It took me about three and a half months” Iqbal told TechCrunch. She began researching how Pakistani women deal with money—for example how do they save or take out credit?

Then she met product designer and entrepreneur Farwah Tapal who had recently returned to Pakistan from Spain and the two created Oraan in 2018 to help women access financial services. The startup announced today it has raised $3 million in funding co-led by returning investor Zayn Capital and Wavemaker Partners with participation from Resolution Ventures i2i Ventures Hustle Fund Haitou Global Plug and Play and angels like Claire Diaz-Ortiz a former investing partner at Magma Partners and early Twitter employee.

Oraan has now raised just over $4 million in funding. Iqbal and Tapal said they are the first women entrepreneurs in Pakistan’s fintech space to raise a seed round.

“There was an opportunity how can we understand the saving space and informal economy in Pakistan and where can we capture that?” Iqbal said.

Oraan decided to start with ROSCAs (rotating credit and savings associations) or committees of people who contribute money to a pool that is distributed to a member each month. It will expand into more financial services with plans to become a digital bank.

Based on Oraan’s research only about 7% of Pakistani women are financially included meaning they have at least a basic bank account. For many women trying to access financial services means facing logistical and social barriers.

“When a woman goes into a bank the first question we get asked is ‘why do you even need bank account?’ especially if you’re a freelancer or micro-entrepreneur or unemployed homemaker” Iqbal said adding that women are often asked to provide their husband or a male relative’s information so they can serve as a guarantor. “These kinds of restrictions have hindered women from having the kind of financial mobility that they require to be able to contribute equally to the economic growth of the country.”

Traditionally ROSCAs are formed within communities for example among family members friends or neighbors. Then each person puts in a set amount of money per month. Who gets each month’s pool of money is decided by the committee sometimes by a vote or random draw.

Iqbal and Tapal decided to start with ROSCAs because almost everyone they know had participated in an informal one. Based on Oraan’s research about 41% of the Pakistani population has participated in a ROSCA and $5 billion gets rotated through them on an annual basis.

“The scale of use and what it provided to the user was just so fascinating” Iqbal said. “This is a goldmine to create something valuable for the end user as well as a business opportunity.”

Oraan formalizes ROSCAs offering five-month or ten-month plans. One of the main differences between Oraan’s ROSCAs and informal ones is that users can pick which month they want the pool of money because the app’s treasury management backend forms committees based on members’ needs and ability to pay.

By participating in ROSCAs through Oraan users also have the opportunity to join committees with people outside of their communities and social networks. Before accepting people onto Oraan the app vets them and it also manages each ROSCA collecting and disbursing funds.

“Generally in Pakistan there is no concept of credit scoring and that’s why financial inclusion or access to liquidity becomes a problem” Tapal said. Oraan partners with other providers to assess creditworthiness based on verified IDs where users live proof of income and personal references.

Some of the reasons Oraan’s users have participated in ROSCAs include financing their children’s education paying for IVF treatments or leaving abusive relationships Iqbal said.

As people participate in committees in Oraan they also build a payment history which can open the door to other financial services in the future. The startup’s ultimate goal is become an online bank said Iqbal.

“We take this culturally religiously socially acceptable tool which is committees digitize them and bring women into a more formal space where they can open bank accounts” said Iqbal. Other verticals Oraan plans to launch include savings credit insurance and educational financing as well as investment products that will allow women to save money in mutual funds and other different asset classes. It also plans to build online communities for its users.

“We want to become a full-fledged neobank and very heavily based on community because that’s where we see that women want a sense of belonging” said Iqbal. “When it comes to financial transactions that’s one of the things they feel they lack that sense of belonging.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTAwMjgxNDcvSmFwYW5lc2UtZW1wZXJvcnMtbmllY2UtYW5ub3VuY2Utd2VkZGluZy1kYXRlLW1vbnRoLXR1cm5pbmctMS0zbS1wYXlvdXQuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEwMDI4MTQ3L2FtcC9KYXBhbmVzZS1lbXBlcm9ycy1uaWVjZS1hbm5vdW5jZS13ZWRkaW5nLWRhdGUtbW9udGgtdHVybmluZy0xLTNtLXBheW91dC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Japanese emperor's niece 'will announce wedding date next month' after turning down $1.3m payout,"A Japanese emperor's rebel niece who is set to turn down a $1.3million marriage payout 'will announce her wedding date next month' after being delayed for years.

Princess Mako of Japan 29 the niece of the Emperor Naruhito who is engaged to her former classmate and US law student fiancé is expected to confirm a date for their low-key wedding in October.

She will give up her royal title to marry commoner Kei Komuro also 29 who she met when they were both students at Tokyo’s International Christian University.

Japan's imperial law requires a princess to leave the royal family after marrying a commoner but they are given a substantial wedding sum of ¥150 million (£1million) 'to preserve the dignity of a person who was once a member of the imperial family'.

However in an unprecedented break from country's tradition Princess Mako is set to turn down the one-off million-dollar payment clearing the way for a marriage delayed for years by financial controversy surrounding her fiancé.

The government is set to agree that the princess forego the payment amid public criticism over her fiancé Japanese public broadcaster NHK and others said.

NHK also said the wedding date may be announced in October.

Officials of the Imperial Household Agency were not immediately available to comment.

A Japanese broadcaster anticipating an imminent wedding recently tracked down Komuro in New York. He was shown sporting a ponytail a detail that has caused an uproar among some Japanese users of Twitter.

After the wedding the newlyweds will move to the US where Mr Komoru intends to take up a job offer with a New York law firm and was recently spotted in New York sporting a ponytail (pictured) causing an uproar among some Japanese users of Twitter

Princess Mako's decision to forego the payment is likely due to the controversy around her fiancé Komuro that arose shortly after announcing their engagement in 2017.

Komuro proposed over dinner in December 2013 and the pair kept their their long-distance relationship under wraps while Mako studied for her master's degree in Museum Studies at the University of Leicester in the UK.

The pair were expected to wed in November 2018 but the wedding was later postponed until 2020 with an official statement saying the couple needed more time to plan.

However reports emerged suggesting Mr Komuro's mother was involved in a financial dispute of which his in-laws disapproved and forced them to suspend the wedding.

Princess Mako will turn down a ¥150 million (£1m) handout from the Japanese government traditionally paid to princesses who lose their imperial status when they marry. Pictured: In traditional dress during her uncle Emperor Naruhito's enthronement ceremony in 2019

According to reports Mr Komuro's mother had borrowed ¥4 million or about £27300 from an ex-boyfriend and then failed to repay it. According to Komuro the money was paid over the duration of the man’s engagement to his mother from 2010 to 2012.

When news of this emerged the Imperial Household Agency reported the pair would postpone their wedding by two years from November 2018 until 2020.

In a statement issued in January 2019 Mr Komuro explained his mother had offered to repay the sum however her ex had 'clearly stated that he did not expect the money to be repaid'.

However the man then reportedly sent a letter to his mother in 2013 asking to be reimbursed. After consulting with an expert Mr Komuro's mother then met her ex and rejected his request.

Since that meeting Mr Komuro said there had been no more developments on the issue until the story emerged in the media reports Japan Times.

In the statement Mr Komoru expressed his gratitude to his mother's former fiance for providing financial assistance over the years and added that he hoped the pair could come to a mutual understanding.

In November 2020 Princess Mako told how while the couple are 'irreplaceable to each other' there are still no 'concrete plans' of when they will eventually tie the knot and that it's difficult to tell 'anything about the future' at the moment.

'For us a marriage is a necessary choice to live and honour our hearts' said Mako in a statement released by the Imperial Household Agency.

'We are irreplaceable to each other and we can lean on each other in happy times and in unhappy times.

'It is difficult to tell anything concrete regarding our future plans and others at the moment.'

Mr Komuro (pictured) proposed over dinner in December 2013 and the pair were expected to wed in November 2018 but the wedding was postponed twice and now a low-key wedding is expected to be held by the end of 2021

Now Princess Mako and Mr Komoru are thought to be planning an imminent low-key wedding expected to be held by the end of 2021.

According to reports in the Japanese media the couple will also skip two formal Shinto betrothal ceremonies: the Nosai-no-Gi betrothal ceremony and the Choken-no-Gi in which the bride offers a thank you and a farewell to Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako.

After her wedding Mako will move to the United States where Mr Komoru is waiting for the results of his US law exams and where he intends to take up a job offer with a New York law firm.

Mr Komuro was working as a paralegal at a law firm in Tokyo prior to starting his studies at Fordham University in New York in August 2018.

The firm has been running for more than five decades and is considered a leading commercial vehicle distributors for the West Midlands East Midlands Shropshire and Staffordshire.

The Walsall site which opened in 2018 after £3 million investment provides parts and service facilities for Volvo trucks and buses as well as new and used sales.

A statement accompanying plans submitted to Walsall Council says the existing site no longer meets ""the current demands for a modern workshop facility which is to provide wider drive through servicing bays and increased headroom for effective and safe vehicle servicing"".

Bosses say the revamped facility will enable the firm to ""expand as a business"" and improve efficiency. It is proposed to develop the site ""in stages"" to allow it to remain open while construction takes place.

Under the plans a new workshop will be built for the servicing and repair of buses HGVs refuse trucks and emergency vehicles. There will also be a new reception offices and parts storage facilities as well as a new body shop.

There will be a new truck sales area and a 46-space car park according to the plans.

The statement concludes that the development would serve as ""a much needed modernisation"" of the existing facility which would ""re-utilise a brownfield site within a predominantly industrial area"".

""The design of the building has been developed with due regard to the relevant planning policies of Walsall Metropolitan Council promoting high quality and efficient design to ensure successful future operations for a key service providing essential vehicle repair and restoration services to the area"" it adds."

Greg Abbott on Sunday defended the actions of U.S. Border Patrol agents who charged at Haitian migrants on horseback blaming the Biden administration for not preventing them from crossing the border. Why it matters: The Republican governor's remarks on ""Fox News Sunday"" comes amid increased backlash over the incident with President Biden saying ""I promise ... those people will pay” and the Department of Homeland Security launching an investigation.

Nevertheless should the agents face termination ""you have a job in the state of Texas” Abbott told host Chris Wallace. “I will hire you to help Texas secure our border.”

Catch up quick: Last week footage surfaced of Border Patrol agents charging their horses at migrants in Del Rio who were attempting to make their way to an encampment under the international bridge Axios' Shawna Chen writes.

DHS later issued a statement saying the agency ""does not tolerate the abuse of migrants in our custody.""

White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters during a briefing that border agents in Del Rio would no longer be using horses.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz said at the time that the agents did not use ""whips"" on the migrants as photos and resulting reaction suggested though questions have remained about whether they were ""whipping"" (""swinging"" ""flicking"") their leather reins toward them.

Freelance photojournalist Paul Ratje who took the Sept. 19 photos in question told local station KTSM: “I’ve never seen them whip anyone.” Ratje added: “He was swinging it but it can be misconstrued when you’re looking at the picture.”

Al Jazeera English journalist John Holman who also captured images from that day told NPR: ""There was a lot of talk about whips and lassos. What we actually saw was them using long reins on their horses and flicking them toward people.""

Greg Abbott.

Host Chris Wallace asked Abbott at one point what he thought of recent images of border patrol agents on horseback this week physically intimidating migrants seeking asylum from Haiti prompting Abbott to double down on his vision of the border as an apocalyptic lawless place. He even offered to thumb his nose at President Joe Biden's authority by staffing his own law enforcement force on the border with employees the administration fires for inappropriate conduct.

""If he takes any action against them whatsoever — I have worked side by side with those Border Patrol agents — I want them to know something. If they are risk of losing their job by a president who is abandoning his duty to secure the border you have a job in the state of Texas. I will hire you to help Texas secure our border"" Abbott said.

Wallace followed up by asking if that exceeded his authority as governor — a criticism echoed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland this week after he threatened to sue Abbott over the state's border policies.

Despite the legal threat Abbott did not moderate his response.

""Because the Biden administration is refusing to do its duty to enforce the laws of the United States they have left Texas in no position other than for us to step up and do what we have to do"" Abbott said. ""I'm going to step up and do whatever I have to do to make sure that I protect the people of Del Rio as well as all these other communities in the state of Texas that the Biden administration is ignoring.""

Regardless of the Texas governor's rhetoric the Biden Administration appears to be holding the course on its immigration plans despite a recent influx of new asylum seekers hailing from Haiti.

During a separate interview on the same program Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the most recent spike in migrants was ""nothing new"" and cautioned people from using the sort of alarmist rhetoric parroted by right-wing media outlets in recent months.

""This is nothing new"" Mayorkas said responding to Abbott's comments. ""We've seen this type of irregular migration many many times throughout the years. I don't know if Governor Abbott said the same thing in 2019 when there were more than a million people encountered at the southern border.

Wallace did at one point ask — prefacing the question with ""forgive me"" — whether or not the administration would be better served reprising the Trump Administration approach of building a ""wall or a fence.""

""It is the policy of this administration: we do not agree with the building of the wall"" Mayorkas responded. ""The law provides that individuals can make a claim for humanitarian relief. That is actually one of our proudest traditions.""

In addition to his questions on the topic of migrants Wallace also grilled Abbott on his bizarre pledge to ""eliminate"" rape — a vow he made in response to criticism of a recent near-total abortion ban he signed into law that does not carry any exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest.

""Is it reasonable to say to somebody who was the victim of rape and might not understand that they are pregnant you know until six weeks 'Don't worry about it because we are going to eliminate rape as a problem in the state of Texas?'"" Wallace asked.

""There's multiple things I have to say in answer to this but the first thing obviously is that survivors of sexual assault they deserve support care and compassion and Texas is stepping up to make sure that we provide that by signing a law and creating in the governor's office a sexual assault survivors task force — separately from that Chris I got to point out about the ways that I have fought to go to arrest and apprehend and try to eliminate rape. I sought the death penalty.""

Wallace tried — repeatedly — to pin Abbott down on the question of whether he would sign an exception to the current law for rape or incest if such a bill were to come across his desk.

Abbott never gave a definitive ""no"" — saying only that the law was ""consistent"" with the Supreme Court precedent which asserts ""states have the ability to make sure that we protect the health and safety of both the mother and the child.""

""Chris you're making a hypothetical that's not going to happen because that bill is not going to reach my desk"" he said. ""Again the goal is to protect the life of every child with a heartbeat."""

How much the manufacturers stand to gain depends on how big the rollout proves to be.

U.S. health officials late on Thursday endorsed booster shots of the Pfizer vaccine for all Americans 65 and older — along with tens of millions of younger people who are at higher risk from the coronavirus because of health conditions or their jobs.

Officials described the move as a first step. Boosters will likely be offered even more broadly in the coming weeks or months including boosters of vaccines made by Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. That plus continued growth in initial vaccinations could mean a huge gain in sales and profits for Pfizer and Moderna in particular.

“The opportunity quite frankly is reflective of the billions of people around the world who would need a vaccination and a boost” Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said.

Wall Street is taking notice. The average forecast among analysts for Moderna’s 2022 revenue has jumped 35% since President Joe Biden laid out his booster plan in mid-August.

Most of the vaccinations so far in the U.S. have come from Pfizer which developed its shot with Germany’s BioNTech and Moderna. They have inoculated about 99 million and 68 million people respectively. Johnson & Johnson is third with about 14 million people.

No one knows yet how many people will get the extra shots. But Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen expects boosters alone to bring in about $26 billion in global sales next year for Pfizer and BioNTech and around $14 billion for Moderna if they are endorsed for nearly all Americans.

Those companies also may gain business from people who got other vaccines initially. In Britain which plans to offer boosters to everyone over 50 and other vulnerable people an expert panel has recommended that Pfizer’s shot be the primary choice with Moderna as the alternative.

Andersen expects Moderna which has no other products on the market to generate a roughly $13 billion profit next year from all COVID-19 vaccine sales if boosters are broadly authorized.

Potential vaccine profits are harder to estimate for Pfizer but company executives have said they expect their pre-tax adjusted profit margin from the vaccine to be in the “high 20s” as a percentage of revenue. That would translate to a profit of around $7 billion next year just from boosters based on Andersen’s sales prediction.

J&J and Europe’s AstraZeneca have said they don’t intend to profit from their COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic.

For Pfizer and Moderna the boosters could be more profitable than the original doses because they won’t come with the research and development costs the companies incurred to get the vaccines on the market in the first place.

WBB Securities CEO Steve Brozak said the booster shots will represent “almost pure profit” compared with the initial doses.

Drugmakers aren’t the only businesses that could see a windfall from delivering boosters. Drugstore chains CVS Health and Walgreens could bring in more than $800 million each in revenue according to Jeff Jonas a portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds.

Jonas noted that the drugstores may not face competition from mass vaccination clinics this time around and the chains are diligent about collecting customer contact information. That makes it easy to invite people back for boosters.

Drugmakers are also developing COVID-19 shots that target certain variants of the virus and say people might need annual shots like the ones they receive for the flu. All of that could make the vaccines a major recurring source of revenue.

The COVID-19 vaccines have already done much better than their predecessors.

Pfizer said in July it expects revenue from its COVID-19 vaccine to reach $33.5 billion this year an estimate that could change depending on the impact of boosters or the possible expansion of shots to elementary school children.

That would be more than five times the $5.8 billion racked up last year by the world’s most lucrative vaccine — Pfizer’s Prevnar13 which protects against pneumococcal disease.

It also would dwarf the $19.8 billion brought in last year by AbbVie’s rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira widely regarded as the world’s top-selling drug.

This bodes well for future vaccine development noted Erik Gordon a business professor at the University of Michigan.

Vaccines normally are nowhere near as profitable as treatments Gordon said. But the success of the COVID-19 shots could draw more drugmakers and venture capitalists into the field.

“The vaccine business is more attractive which for those of us who are going to need vaccines is good” Gordon said.

Global Citizen Live represents a call to action to end extreme poverty and build momentum ahead of the G20 Summit in October and UN Climate Conference COP26 in November.

The campaign calls on world leaders businesses and philanthropists to urgently commit resources to: meet the $15-20 billion funding shortfall of the $100 billion promised annually to the most vulnerable countries confronting climate change; businesses to help curb emissions through joining the Race to Zero campaign and pledging 1 billion additional trees by 2022 in support of the 1t.org ambition to conserve restore and grow 1 trillion trees this decade; $6 billion to provide food to 41 million people facing famine; 2 billion COVID-19 vaccines to be redistributed to low-income countries by early 2022; and for Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna to share mRNA technology with the WHO-backed Africa mRNA vaccine hub.

More than US$1.1 billion 157 million trees and over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines were announced during Global Citizen Live thanks to partnerships between government philanthropy non-governmental organizations and the private sector.

Global Citizen Live featured a remarkable lineup of world leaders advocates and artists supporting the campaign and its mission to end extreme poverty. Across seven continents tens of thousands of Global Citizens were in attendance over 24 hours as millions streamed the live broadcast event globally.

As a result of the hard work of many partner organizations the Global Citizen Live campaign announced:

157 million trees including 77 million trees by 2022; and more than US$300M to defend the planet

“Quite rightly future generations will hold us responsible. So join me and with one loud and united global voice call on the biggest greenhouse gas emitters — the G20 group of nations — to make much bolder commitments to cut emissions"" COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma told the audience during the New York event. “Call on the richest countries to make good on their promise of money to support developing countries deal with the impacts of climate change and call on world leaders to deliver an outcome at Glasgow we can all be proud of.”

Over US$800 million to defeat poverty and address hunger crises.

“Shame on us. At the height of COVID-19 the billionaires’ average net worth increase per day was $5 billion. And yet I am begging to feed the poor! Shame on us ... If we do not act today millions will starve nations will destabilize and millions will migrate by necessity"" said World Food Programme Executive Director David Beasley. ""If we are struggling today with a population of over 7 billion what do you expect will happen when there are over 10 billion people on earth by 2050? And by 2050 due to climate change we anticipate over 1 billion people to be displaced around the world! Wake up New York. Wake up Planet Earth.""

Over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines for those most in need.

“We have what we need to vaccinate the world. But the experts told us here’s what’s getting in the way: They said many countries are ready to produce vaccines at home. Yet they aren’t allowed to because ultra-wealthy pharmaceutical companies are not sharing the recipes to make them. These countries have the means ability and the workers to start manufacturing. All they are waiting for is the vaccine intellectual property to be transferred over” said Prince Harry The Duke of Sussex during the New York show.

“Every single person on this planet has a fundamental right to get this vaccine. That’s the point — yet that’s not happening. While in this country (and many others) you can go almost anywhere and get vaccinated billions around the world cannot. This year the world is expected to produce enough doses to meet the target of vaccinating 70% of people in every single country. But it is wrong that so much of the vaccine supply has only gone to just 10 wealthy nations so far and not everyone else” said Meghan The Duchess of Sussex.

Announcements were made by the European Commission the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) Belgium Colombia Croatia the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) France Germany Ireland Luxembourg the Netherlands Norway Spain United States UNESCO the Green Climate Fund and the Paris Peace Forum.

Global Citizen Live also saw announcements from the US states of Hawaii and Washington; the Brazilian states of Amapá Amazonas Ceará Piauí Pará and Paraíba; the City of Paris France; the municipality of Asker Norway; and 43 cities in Maharashtra State India.

Financial and in-kind announcements were also made by many corporate and philanthropic partners including Accelerit Technologies Aspiration Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Capgemini The Charles Stewart Mott Foundation The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) Duolingo The ELMA Vaccines & Immunization Foundation Global Solidarity Fund Leaders in Motion Academy The LEGO Foundation Private Foundation Rotary International Salesforce Mastercard Namati PepsiCo The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation World Wide Technology and Zendesk.

Thirteen organizations officially signed on to the Race to Zero campaign as a part of Global Citizen Live including: Akamai Technologies American Express BD (Becton Dickinson and Company) Boston Scientific Corporation Citi Cisco Delta Air Lines DocuSign IHG Hotels and Resorts Marriott International Inc. P&G Stanley Black & Decker and Starbucks.

Global Citizen also worked with existing Race to Zero members to join the campaign’s Climate Coalition to encourage others to sign on to the Race to Zero ahead of COP26. Climate Coalition members include: Amazon Bayer AG Boston Consulting Group Capgemini Dentsu International DocuSign HP Inc. Intuit Lendlease P&G RELX Salesforce Schneider Electric Uber Unilever Walmart Inc. and Zurich Insurance Group.

Global Citizen presented Global Citizen Live a 24-hour global broadcast and streaming event featuring an extraordinary lineup of artists and performances from all over the world including: Lagos Paris New York City London Sydney Seoul Rio de Janeiro Los Angeles and Mumbai.

The 24-hour live broadcast event aired globally on ABC BBC FX iHeartRadio YouTube Twitter and other platforms to millions of viewers around the world. On-site safety and precautionary measures including mask-wearing social distancing and proof of vaccination were taken as part of all events which were attended in person by Global Citizen activists from around the world.

In the lead up to Global Citizen Live Global Citizen called on action takers to demand that the world's wealthiest nations redistribute 1 billion vaccine doses urgently this year and 1 billion more by early 2022; support the proposal to waive intellectual property rights on the production of COVID-19 vaccines and other medical tools backed by over 100 countries; and call on Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna to share mRNA technology with a new WHO-backed mRNA technology transfer hub based in South Africa.

Global Citizen also called on countries around the world to reduce fair share national emissions to prevent more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming and for developed nations to deliver on their promise to provide $100 billion annually to address the climate needs of developing countries. G7 nations and billionaires were also called on by Global Citizen and its partners to end the hunger crisis by contributing at least $6 billion for the urgent provision of millions of meals for 41 million people on the brink of famine.

Global Citizen Live represents an ongoing campaign led by citizens around the world to take action to urge governments corporations and philanthropists to make urgent change in line with the United Nations’ Global Goals and the Global Citizen Recovery Plan for the World.

“Global Citizen Live is not a celebration but an urgent call to action” said Mick Sheldrick co-founder and Chief Policy and Government Affairs Officer at Global Citizen. “We’re campaigning hard to get the world on track to end extreme poverty calling on world leaders to step-up at the G20 and COP26 summits. Global Citizen Live is the beginning of a month-long countdown!”

Global Citizen Live highlighted the efforts and announcements of 67 governments six philanthropic foundations and 40 corporate partners alongside global advocates and campaigners. Among millions of Global Citizens stood key global leaders partners and advocates at the forefront of Global Citizen’s mission to end extreme poverty: UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed Executive Director of the World Food Programme David Beasley CEO of Namati Vivek Maru Rotary President-elect Jennifer Jones Global Goals Champion and Advocate Eddie Ndopu President of the Ford Foundation Darren Walker President of the Paris Peace Forum Steering Committee Trisha Shetty Hip Hop Caucus President and CEO Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr. UN Next Generation fellow Valeria Colunga advocate Eunice Akoth and more.

“A Global Citizen is aware of the fact that we all share one planet one health one common destiny — and that every one of us matters” said Ursula von der Leyen president of the European Commission in support of the campaign. “Everyone can make a difference by working together finding global solutions to global problems with unity cooperation and solidarity.”

As leaders step up to curb emissions combat climate change and defend the planet at Global Citizen Live more ambition is needed ahead of the COP26 Climate Summit.

Global Citizen and its Race to Zero partners worked to secure commitments from many of the world’s largest companies and cities to develop verified science-based targets to reach net zero emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.

Corporate partners and cities signed up to the Race to Zero initiative a science-based campaign to drive climate targets in line with the Paris Agreement. Global Citizen Live saw 13 companies valued at $1.3 trillion in market capital join the Race to Zero initiative. New signers include five Fortune 100 companies the largest consumer goods company in the world the largest tool maker in the world and the largest hotel group in the world.

Private sector organizations that officially signed on to the Race to Zero as a part of the Global Citizen Live campaign include: Akamai Technologies American Express BD (Becton Dickinson and Company) Boston Scientific Corporation Cisco Delta Air Lines DocuSign IHG Hotels and Resorts Marriott International Inc. P&G Stanley Black & Decker and Starbucks who have each signed on to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5 and Citi which joined the Race to Zero via the Net Zero Banking Alliance.

Global Citizen also worked with existing Race to Zero members to join the campaign’s Climate Coalition aimed at encouraging peers vendors and partners to sign on to the Race to Zero ahead of COP26. Climate Coalition members include Amazon Bayer AG Boston Consulting Group Capgemini Dentsu International DocuSign HP Inc. Intuit Lendlease P&G RELX Salesforce Schneider Electric Uber Unilever Walmart Inc. and Zurich Insurance Group.

""Urgent and widespread climate action is vital to unlock the pace and scale of decarbonization required by science. Every nation company and individual must play their part. This innovative collaboration with Global Citizen has delivered additional major US businesses to our campaign for the world's most ambitious climate leaders. With just one month until the milestone climate conference COP26 we are now calling on more companies worldwide to join Business Ambition for 1.5 degrees Celsius and play their role in delivering bold climate action to halve global emissions by 2030"" said Tom Dowdall Science Based Targets Initiative Campaign Lead.

While Global Citizen has been in contact with hundreds of companies to sign on to Race to Zero many of the world’s largest companies and top emitters failed to respond to Global Citizen’s outreach after several attempts. These companies must step up to sign on to control their emissions and protect the planet now not later. Global Citizens will continue to campaign and call on these companies to join Race to Zero by COP26 in November this year.

Global Citizen also worked with American Forests and 1t.org to ensure a sustainable climate and a nature-positive planet by conserving restoring and growing trees supporting the global movement to save and restore 1 trillion trees by 2030. A total of 157 million trees will be protected and restored by 2030 including 77 million by the end of 2022.

Global Citizen Live received support from 12 members of the United States Congress calling for legislative measures to meet the goal of 100 million trees being protected conserved and planted in cities across America by 2030 including: Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) Rep. Nanette Barragán (CA-44) Rep. Donald McEachin (VA-4) Rep. Chellie Pingree (ME-1) Rep. Marcy Kaptur (OH-9) and Rep. Jimmy Panetta (CA-20).

⭕️ COVID-19 affects us all & we must unite in our response. THANK YOU @USAID 🇺🇸 & @SamanthaJPower for your commitment of $295M for COVID-19 aid as part of #GlobalCitizenLivepic.twitter.com/AO9L28cDY5 — Global Citizen Impact (@GlblCtznImpact) September 25 2021

Mayors governors and sub-national representatives also showed their support from around the world including: Lene Conradi Mayor of Asker Kommune Norway; Hilary Franz Commissioner of Public Lands Washington; David Ige Governor Hawaii; Anne Hidalgo Mayor Paris; and the Brazilian governors of Amapá (Waldez Góes) Amazonas (Wilson Miranda Lima) Ceará (Camilo Santana) Pará (Helder Barbalho) Paraíba (João Azevêdo) and Piauí (Wellington Dias).

""The protection of the wild is a major task of our generation. Global Citizens have called on leaders to take decisive steps in the right direction. We commend the Brazilian governors of Amapá Amazonas Ceará Pará Paraiba and Piauí for their commitments to environmental protection and strong climate actions"" said Rodrigo Medeiros of Re:Wild.

On Aug. 23 and in support of local advocates Coldplay invited eight Brazilian governors to join Global Citizen at Global Citizen Live in September to pledge to protect critical natural resources throughout their regions. Governors made announcements from across Brazil including six states from the Amazon at the front lines of climate change. The Brazilian states announced plans to reduce emissions increase the number of protected areas and create state-wide climate mitigation and adaptation plans.

Thank you for joining us at #GlobalCitizenLive@AminaJMohammed as we join in unity to defend the planet and defeat poverty! We greatly value our partnership with you and the @UNhttps://t.co/jc4IQFI78Dpic.twitter.com/O8rzPzLb4u — Hugh Evans (@Hughcevans) September 25 2021

This weekend’s announcements build on earlier commitments over the last 18 months as part of the Trillion Trees Campaign. Global Citizen Live celebrates the global 1t.org community for its commitment to conserve restore and grow trees including the following organizations with existing 1t.org pledges contributing to the trillion tree ambition by 2030: Amazon Aspiration AstraZeneca Clif Bar & Company HP Inc. Iberdrola Jonas Philanthropies Trees for Climate Health Initiative Nestlé Pottery Barn SAP SE tentree Travelers Unilever UPS and VMWare.

“It is inspiring to see the world’s largest companies governments and individuals of all ages unite to make ambitious commitments to protect and restore our planet. 1t.org’s collaboration with Global Citizen Live to scale investments in our trees and forests will be an integral part of the solution in tackling pressing ecological and societal challenges” said Nicole Schwab Co-Head of Nature-Based Solutions at the World Economic Forum. “Global Citizen Live shows that collective action at a global scale is possible.”

Leaders make commitments toward $100 billion climate promise but at least $15 billion shortfall remains ahead of COP26.

During UNGA leaders made commitments in support of honoring their promise to provide vulnerable countries with $100 billion annually to respond to climate change. During his UNGA address President Joe Biden announced that the US will increase its climate aid commitment to $11.4 billion by 2024. Despite being a step in the right direction this is still far less than what is contributed by the EU according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute. The G20 must keep their promise to provide an additional $100 billion annually to protect vulnerable nations from climate change. We have five weeks in order to meet this promise.

""The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how strongly the health of one person depends on the behaviour of the other. We need decisive action and solidarity both on individual and societal levels to leave the COVID-19 pandemic behind us. Today at Global Citizen Live I join Global Citizen's calls for more vaccine equity and a stronger commitment to an encompassing solution of the pandemic that is sensitive to the capacities and needs of different countries. I thank all Global Citizens for advocating and strongly supporting the work of WHO “ said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Director-General of World Health Organization.

During the Global Citizen Live campaign Italy committed to substantially increase its climate financing in the run-up to COP 26. Global Citizen will hold them accountable to this commitment.

From New York The Green Climate Fund supporting developing countries to reduce emissions and build resilience announced they would be accelerating the delivery of over $1.2 billion in the coming months.

Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez during his UNGA address and in response to a tweet from Coldplay announced €30 million for the Adaptation Fund an international fund that finances projects and programs aimed at helping developing countries to adapt to the harmful effects of climate change albeit much more is needed for Spain to meet its fair share.

Meanwhile both Denmark and Norway affirmed their commitments to significantly increase their climate financing commitments said Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen declaring:

“Denmark will contribute 1% of the collective target of $100 billion. And 60% of our climate aid will help developing countries adapt to climate change. If we can — G20 can! Let’s send a message to the G20 that cannot be misunderstood: Do not come empty-handed to Glasgow” said Frederiksen.

CODE RED. It’s no secret that the climate crisis is here & it’s a massive threat to our planet. The US has an opportunity to lead the world to a sustainable future. It starts with the #BuildBackBetter act. Join me alongside @GlblCtzn to take action to support. #CodeRedCongresspic.twitter.com/mRPVqeUJOt — Rachel Brosnahan (@RachelBros) September 24 2021

Global Citizen believes that Austria Australia Portugal Spain and Italy should also increase their contributions toward meeting the $100 billion pledge. We are grateful to ODI and Sarah Colenbrander for their analysis and support through the Global Citizen Live campaign. Global Citizen is urging US citizens to contact their local member of congress. The United States must live up to its promise.

Global Citizen Live calls code red for Congress and urges the United States Congress to pass most consequential climate legislation in US history.

“We have the chance to make history soon when Congress could pass essential climate legislation through the Build Back Better Act... We need a true groundswell of public support to show Congress that this critical legislation must pass without getting watered down” said Hip Hop Caucus President and CEO Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr.

Over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines pledged at Global Citizen Live in a step toward vaccine equity but too little too late as huge gap remains.

Inequitable vaccine distribution has left millions of vulnerable communities unprotected and reversed decades of progress against other infectious diseases and the broader Global Goals for Sustainable Development. To end this pandemic we must make the COVID-19 vaccines available to all everywhere. Global Citizen Live is grateful for its partnership with the ACT Accelerator the Pandemic Action Network the ONE Campaign and others in the collective effort to address vaccine inequity and injustice.

Extraordinary action is needed in the fight against COVID-19 and world leaders are uniquely positioned to enable a global recovery by ensuring everyone has access to life-saving vaccines tests and treatments. On Sept. 22 US President Biden convened world leaders to commit to vaccinate at least 70% of people in every country by this time next year to break the chain of transmission and end the pandemic. But more than promises are needed; without action the virus and its mutations will continue to threaten us all and undermine the global economy.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield took to the Global Citizen Live stage to reiterate the call for everyone to have access to COVID-19 vaccines especially vulnerable refugees whose circumstances have been further impacted by the pandemic. Global Citizen welcomes US leadership to galvanize efforts to vaccinate at least 70% of people in all countries by September 2022 but hopes to see this promise met by comprehensive action from the US. This includes sharing all excess and unused doses in hand or on order for 2021 as soon as possible providing funding and support to help lower income countries get doses from tarmac and into arms and critically by actively promoting an intellectual property waiver at the World Trade Organization and pushing pharma companies to share mRNA vaccine technology with Africa and other lower-income regions.

More than 60 million COVID-19 vaccines to be shared with countries in need were announced through Global Citizen Live. However the world must step up to redistribute a total of 2 billion vaccines by early 2022. In advance of Global Citizen Live Prime Minister Sanchez’s UNGA announced 7.5 million new vaccine doses and €2 million for UNITAID at Global Citizen Live. Taoiseach Micheál Martin confirmed 1.3 million COVID-19 vaccine doses primarily through COVAX on behalf of Ireland. This is Ireland's first dose sharing commitment to date and represents one dose for every five Irish citizens.

Croatia also stepped up announcing another 200000 COVID-19 vaccine doses primarily through COVAX following a €500000 and 50000 dose pledge to COVAX made at Global Citizen’s VAX LIVE in May.

""In the global fight against COVID-19 we need commitments to be matched with action. We thank Global Citizens for their tireless advocacy to support vaccine equity and we thank the governments of Croatia Ireland and France for their substantial vaccine donations during Global Citizen Live. This pandemic is the great public health challenge of our time and we urgently need to unlock more vaccine doses to ensure that the most vulnerable in our global village are protected. It's time for countries and manufacturers to do their part and give us the doses we need to protect people everywhere” said Dr. Seth Berkley CEO of Gavi the Vaccine Alliance.

""Only by acting internationally and united will we be able to effectively defeat the serious challenge of COVID-19 and that unity extends to all the other objectives that Spain Global Citizens and other actors defend. We all have to collaborate if we aspire to stop the climate emergency or to defeat hunger. They are enormous tasks that demand pulling all possible forces. This is why we join Global Citizen Live to commit to increase our vaccine donations to COVAX by 7.5 million and pledge financial support of €2 million for UNITAID as well as €30M for the Adaptation Fund to support the fight against climate change” said Pedro Sánchez Prime Minister of Spain.

The world unites to end poverty protect education and fight the hunger crisis at Global Citizen Live.

Forty-one million people are on the brink of famine due to the hunger pandemic reversing decades of progress on the United Nations’ Global Globals. Additionally more than 1.5 billion children have also been affected by COVID-19 school closures globally impairing the learning of marginalized children especially those living in conflict or crisis. Eradicating extreme poverty in all its forms is the greatest global challenge of our time. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this crisis pushing an additional 115 million people into extreme poverty in 2020 alone. To meet this goal Germany and the European Commission collectively announced €75 million to Education Cannot Wait IFAD announced pledges from 17 countries totalling US$23.7 million towards its critical work across the planet and a US$260 in pledges to CGIAR from Belgium Netherlands and the European commission was announced during Global Citizen Live among key pledges to combat extreme poverty.

“Hunger has tightened its grip on millions of vulnerable families around the world due to COVID-19. WFP is grateful to Global Citizen Live for raising awareness of this unprecedented crisis in an effort to mobilize global action against hunger” said David Beasley Executive Director United Nations World Food Programme.

France would release 20% of its Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) in addition to pledging 60 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to COVAX at Global Citizen Live. SDRs could be used to fund COVID-19 vaccines investment in economic recovery and access lifesaving medical treatments.

In the spirit of collaboration and solidarity government leaders showed their support for Global Citizen Live by pledging new financial and policy commitments.

THE ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS) pledged to increase its renewable energy capacity among Small Island Developing States through 2030 up to 10 megawatts taking strong actions toward a meaningful reduction of emissions. “Small Island States are disproportionately affected by the consequences of climate change. It is time that we as Global Citizens stand up and take strong actions to protect the planet. Therefore the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) pledges at Global Citizen Live to almost double its renewable energy capacity until 2030. We call on all governments to follow suit and harness renewable energy capacities. Only together we will be able to overcome the challenge of the century” said Gaston Browne Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda and chairman of AOSIS. BELGIUM announced €6 million to CGIAR a global partnership that unites international organizations engaged in research about food security and €10 million to Least Developed Country Fund. “Global Citizens have advocated for an equitable and sustainable recovery for the planet from the COVID-19 pandemic. Climate change and food security are two issues at the heart of this recovery. Therefore Belgium appreciates the opportunity to join Global Citizen's campaign and to announce commitments for CGIAR and the Least Developed Country Fund. In these challenging times Belgium is proud to demonstrate its solidarity and to take actions that support the most vulnerable” said Meryame Kitir Minister of Development Cooperation and Major Cities Policy. CROATIA pledged 200000 COVID-19 vaccine doses primarily through COVAX at Global Citizen Live. During VAX LIVE in May Croatia donated 50000 doses towards COVAX. Despite a small population Croatia is making vaccine contributions to the world’s supply. “We thank Global Citizen for its critical advocacy work to end extreme poverty by 2030 and overcome the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. We must act collectively to end this crisis. This is why Croatia pledges another 200000 COVID-19 vaccine doses to COVAX to extend the possibility of everyone to get vaccinated. This is our small contribution but it will make a puzzle complete” said Prime Minister Andrej Plenković. EUROPEAN COMMISSION announced €140 million toward CGIAR a global partnership that unites international organizations engaged in research about food security at Global Citizen Live. CGIAR research aims to reduce rural poverty increase food security improve human health and nutrition and sustainable management of natural resources. The European Commission also pledged €25 million to Education Cannot Wait. “Global challenges need a global response and responsibility. This is Global Citizen’s vision which I am proud to support. Europe is taking its responsibilities. Every single dose of coronavirus vaccine produced in Europe is shipped to the rest of the world 800 million doses so far. In addition the European Union will donate 500 million doses to the most vulnerable countries. It also commits €140 million to improve global food security and €25 million to Education Cannot Wait to support education for marginalised children around the world living through conflict and crisis” said Ursula von der Leyen President of the European Commission. FRANCE doubled their vaccine share pledge announcing that they would be sharing an additional 60 million doses on top of an already announced 60 million doses for a total of 120 million toward COVAX to be delivered by the end of Q2 2022. The country also announced they would release 20% of their SDRs. ""To succeed in the fight against the pandemic and inequalities France commits during Global Citizen Live to double the number of doses it shares in particular through COVAX from 60 to 120 million doses and to redirect 20% of the Special Drawing Rights it receives from the IMF to the African continent"" said President Emmanuel Macron.

GERMANY pledged €50 million to Education Cannot Wait to foster educational activities in the most difficult circumstances at Global Citizen Live. “We all see the dramatic crises worldwide. Children and young people suffer the most from hunger violence and lack of education. Every child has a right to education. Thus I am proud to announce today at Global Citizen Live that Germany will commit €50 million to Education Cannot Wait” said Gerd Müller Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development. Thanks to Globale Bildungskampagne and ONE Deutschland. IRELAND confirmed — following a decision of its cabinet — that it will donate 1.3 million COVID-19 vaccine doses primarily through COVAX. This is Ireland's first dose sharing commitment to date and represents 1 dose for every 5 Irish citizens. “When one of us is unwell vulnerable or at risk we all are affected. That is why I am pleased to be part of the Global Citizen campaign and to confirm that Ireland will donate 1.3 million vaccines mostly through COVAX and plans to make a further substantial donation in 2022. If COVID-19 has taught us anything it’s that we are now more than ever before deeply and intimately intertwined with each other. In that closeness there is great vulnerability but even greater strength when we work as one global community” said Mícheál Martin Taoiseach. LUXEMBOURG announced a €3.8 million commitment to UNFPA Supplies at Global Citizen Live to support women’s and girl’s reproductive health. This is Luxembourg’s largest commitment on the Global Citizen’s stage. “As Global Citizens around the world Luxembourg believes that gender equality is decisive to achieve an equitable and sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. We are proud to participate in Global Citizen Live and commit to an additional €3.8 million to UNFPA as part of our total support of €25 million. This contribution will support women and girls around the world in particular reproductive health and rights” said Xavier Bettel Prime Minister of Luxembourg. NORWAY announced the Biodiversity for Opportunities Livelihoods and Development (BOLD) fund committing US$58 million over 10 years. The project will help safeguard crop diversity in genebanks and facilitate its use by breeders smallholders and researchers to develop new crop varieties and more sustainable farming systems with particular focus on communities in lower-income countries.

Vivienne Westwood is deploying the platform based on PTC’s FlexPLM retail solution to improve and accelerate its product development and sourcing processes. FlexPLM integrates data sources relevant to the design and development of products enabling Vivienne Westwood to understand where a product is at each stage of its lifecycle.

This digital thread complete visibility for design and development-related activities across several product categories including women’s and men’s ready-to-wear shoes leather goods jewelry and accessories.

The PLM platform allows for seamless and secure communication and collaboration related to the design and production process both internally and with supply chain partners.

Previously these processes were manual and time-consuming. The brand’s design and merchandising office in the U.K. and production office in Italy used to create tech packs — i.e. product blueprints for manufacturing — and exchange data mainly through email and spreadsheets. These manual practices could lead to duplicate data entry poor collaboration with international factory partners and missed deadlines.

“We chose PTC FlexPLM for its supply chain and product development capabilities its visual user interface and its information security and system stability. Accenture’s expertise and proven track record in the fashion industry and with PLM were instrumental in launching and having it deliver business value” Antony Calabro Vivienne Westwood’s CIO said.

Alberto Codrino managing director for Industry X at Accenture said: “Working closely with their IT and business teams and with the support of the PTC team we were able to help the brand quickly take advantage of data and digital to redefine how it develops products.

“We look forward to helping this iconic brand further optimize its digital product creation strategy and support its go-to-market operations” Bill Brewster senior vice president and general manager of PTC’s Retail business unit said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2FydGlmaWNpYWwtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlL3RvcC0xMC1hcnRpZmljaWFsLWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS1qb2JzLWZvci1mcmVzaGVycy1pbi1pbmRpYdIBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L2FtcC9zdG9yeS9hcnRpZmljaWFsLWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS90b3AtMTAtYXJ0aWZpY2lhbC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2Utam9icy1mb3ItZnJlc2hlcnMtaW4taW5kaWE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Artificial Intelligence Jobs for Freshers in India,Artificial intelligence is the process of re-creating human knowledge in robots that are designed to think and act like humans.

While the likes of Photoshop Illustrator and InDesign are the de facto standards in their respective creative fields it's been a very long time since Dreamweaver has held the same level of respect within the world of web design.

While Dreamweaver's a useful package that's suitable for a wide range of web designers from beginners to advanced professionals it's one that's often overlooked in favour of web design tools that are either friendlier to use or offer more powerful coding tools.

In recent years though Adobe's reshaped Dreamweaver to make it into more of a professional web design and development package. But is it likely to win anyone back? (see our review of Dreamweaver CC 2014).

What's the problem with Dreamweaver?

Dreamweaver's old WYSIWYG approach has fallen out of favour with web pros (Image credit: Adobe)

Serious web designers tend to keep Dreamweaver at arm's length thanks to its long-standing reputation as a simple drag-and-drop website builder that can create good-looking sites hampered by bloated and inelegant code.

At the other end of the scale for beginners Dreamweaver can be challenging to get to grips with thanks to a less-than-intuitive interface. And despite its reputation as a WYSIWYG editor over the last few years Dreamweaver has taken a more code-focused approach. Today Adobe recommends that you have at least a smattering of HTML CSS and JavaScript if you're going to get any joy out of Dreamweaver.

What this all means is that Dreamweaver tends to fall between two stools. It's perceived as far too simplistic for web professionals while being much too complex for beginners and hobbyists. But is this really the case? Let's take a closer look.

Is Dreamweaver a pro tool?

Dreamweaver is all about the code these days and provides helpful tools to speed up development (Image credit: Adobe)

While Adobe Dreamweaver made its name as a visual website building package that's not so much the case these days. The modern Dreamweaver provides essential tools for professionals who prefer to code sites by hand including code hints to save you time and on edit linting that'll alert you to errors as you go and help you keep in line with web standards.

Dreamweaver provides handy visual aids to speed up development such as pop-up preview windows when you're adding an image to your site as well as bare-bones starter templates that'll provide you with the basic structure of a site ready to be customised to meet a particular job's needs.

Dreamweaver used to have a reputation for providing live previews that never really matched what you'd see in your published site but Adobe has gone to work on that. Dreamweaver enables you to create fully responsive sites using Bootstrap and its live view displays previews on most viewports from mobile to full-size screens and constantly updates as you type. While in the wonderful world of web design there's always going to be an edge case that breaks the layout you can be a lot more confident that what you see in the live view will match what you see on the finished site.

For teams collaborating on sites Dreamweaver also provides Git support enabling you to manage your source code and perform operations through its Git panel. And considering that most of your visual assets are probably being created in Photoshop or Illustrator Dreamweaver's Creative Cloud integration makes it easy to import imagery and enables you to extract imagery text fonts and even colours and gradients from PSD comps to use in your designs.

As an all-in-one package that handles everything from design and coding through to publishing on most web platforms Dreamweaver has a lot going for it if you like all your tools in one place. But if you're settled into a web workflow comprised of a set of dedicated tools that all to their job really well we suspect you'll quickly run up against limitations with Dreamweaver.

Is Dreamweaver any good for beginners?

Until recently anyone wanting a more visual website builder would have defaulted to the much friendlier Adobe Muse but with that now discontinued Dreamweaver's your only choice if you're committed to an all-Adobe workflow.

The latest Dreamweaver is clearly aimed at professionals but it also allows you to customise your workspace to meet your needs. By default it offers a streamlined Developer workspace for web professionals who want to create with code and see a real-time preview. There's also a Standard workspace that's a little friendlier and features visual tools for creating layouts but it's still a code-heavy experience.

If you know the basics of HTML CSS and JavaScript and want to improve your skills however Dreamweaver could prove to be a great way to do just that. Its templates provide an easily-understandable starting place while its built-in code hints and quick docs will help you write new code and actually understand what you're doing.

If it's an easy-to-use visual web editor that you're after though Adobe Dreamweaver is likely to leave you cold and you'd be better off checking out our list of the best website builders to find a more intuitive solution.

Should I buy Dreamweaver?

Dreamweaver's better than it used to be but that might still not be enough for many (Image credit: Adobe)

Dreamweaver tends to draw a lot of shade from experienced web designers and developers who probably grew up with it and then grew out of it as they discovered better and more effective tools along the way. If you're working in web design then you doubtless have a go-to suite of tools as well as an eye on new developments and it's unlikely that Dreamweaver's all-in-one approach is going to win you over even though it's a much more serious and capable tool these days.

If you don't really know your stuff and don't have the time to learn all the ins and outs of web technology Dreamweaver's probably a hard pass for you too. There are plenty more approachable packages out there that'll let you get results with a lot less effort than Dreamweaver demands.

However if you're reasonably competent with code already use other Creative Cloud apps and aren't yet committed to a specific web workflow Dreamweaver's definitely worth checking out these days. If you have a full CC subscription then it's included with your app portfolio and you won't have to pay a thing for it. Give it a try and see how it shapes up for you.

To subscribe to Dreamweaver on its own will cost you £19.97/$20.99 per month on an annual plan or £30.34/$31.49 on a month-by-month basis. That's a slightly less attractive prospect but if you're intrigued then it's still not a bad price to pay to try it for a month in order to find out how you get on with it.

Ultimately Dreamweaver's a lot better than it used to be and Adobe seems set on supporting and improving it. That may not be enough for seasoned pros but as a Swiss Army knife for the web it's a pretty attractive prospect right now.

My biggest question was exactly how you edit the selective focus in post-production.

I picked up a new iPhone 13 Pro over the weekend. By far the biggest buzz is over the new Cinematic Mode that is selective defocus either manually or by letting the iPhone AI pick what should be in focus based on where the subject might be looking. What’s most intriguing about Cinematic Mode is that the focus point is editable after you shoot with supported software. This idea isn’t entirely original as the Light camera had a similar idea but while that camera failed iPhones are everywhere and this is kinda fun.

It’s easy to capture video in Cinematic Mode you just swipe to that new setting in the Camera app on your supported phone. My main questions were more about how you’d edit clips shot in Cinematic Mode … so I answered them.

How do I know a view was shot in Cinematic Mode?

That’s easy. When browsing photos in the Photos app you’ll see a CINEMATIC icon in the upper left.

When browsing in iMovie you’ll see a tiny little special camera icon on the thumbnail. Unlike a regular video the Cinematic camera icon has a little square on it.

What applications can actually edit Cinematic Mode?

Currently this special type of focus adjustment can only be edited in the Photos app with an iPhone X S  iPhone X R  and later with iOS 15 as well as the latest update to iMovie. You can also use those same apps on an iPad.

I’ve seen stories that say Apple’s Clips app can edit Cinematic mode but that’s misleading. You can’t adjust the focus and that’s the whole point. So Clips can import and work with Cinematic video but so can any video editing application like Premiere Rush and LumaFusion.

I’ve read that if you’re using an updated version of iMovie on MacOS Monterey then it will support Cinematic Mode post-production focusing as well. It has been announced that this will be coming to Final Cut Pro X later as well.

What about editing Cinematic Mode in other editing tools like Adobe Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve?

What about it? Cinematic videos are video clips so they can be edited in any non-linear editing application.

You can’t adjust the focus on clips like those above in Premiere Pro as that feature isn’t supported outside of Apple’s ecosystem of currently supported applications.

Will other non-Apple apps be able to adjust focus in the future?

One would hope but this is up to Apple. They would have to release a toolkit with that kind of support for editing the focus after shooting. If they do I would expect LumaFusion to get this capability as soon as it’s available.

I’m getting confused about “editing Cinematic Mode” vs. editing the selective focus in Cinematic Mode. Am I dumb?

No you are not dumb. Any video shot in Cinematic Mode is just an H.264 or HEVC video clip depending on your phone’s settings. Those can be edited in most anything that can edit video. Any Cinematic Mode adjustments done during filming will as far as I can tell be baked into the clip when imported into another editing app on your phone or sent over to the desktop for editing there.

What if you enable the Photos Keep Originals setting so iOS doesn’t bake anything into the clip when say using AirDrop to send a Cinematic clip to a Mac?

Good thought and I tried just that but nothing as far as the ability to edit the focus points in other NLEs. That is a function that will have to be built into future applications should Apple support it.

Is it easy to edit?

Kinda. You can think of it a bit like keyframing an animation only you aren’t setting multiple keyframes per “move” just setting a point where you want the focus to change.

The screen capture above is a Cinematic clip playing back in the edit mode of the Photos app. As the kids and the referee ran around the soccer field you can see all the different focus points in that clip. The white dots are focus points that the phone automatically added as it tried to do some rack focusing while the bigger yellow dots are focus points I added by manually tapping points on the screen. This is indeed a difficult kind of shot for Cinematic mode to “automagically” track.

As you scrub through a Cinematic clip in the little timeline you get a bit of haptic feedback as the playhead scrubs over the focus points.

What if I don’t like all the focus madness that I’ve done?

If you go overboard with the cinematicness of a shot you could delete all the manual focus points you’ve added to just use the Revert option that is available at the top right of the Photos app to revert a video (or image) back to the original metadata and original focus points from when it was shot. If you’re in iMovie it’ll be Reset in the timeline.

If you want to delete focus points that were added by tapping the screen while shooting or added after the fact by tapping a new focus point while editing you can delete those by hitting the trash can icon that pops up when post-editing a Cinematic clip.

If I add some manual focus points in the Photos app those appear to stay only in the Photos app. If I import that same clip into iMovie those new focus points don’t import to iMovie though I can add news once in iMovie.

Won’t Cinematic Mode “automatically” track faces and things and adjust the focus? You used that word “automagically” above.

Yes it will. Apple made a great little short about this and the technology that uses AI to track faces and adjust that focus as talent looks away and back to the camera.

But I’ve got another question for Cinematic Mode… how does it track a shoe in the foreground and dropping focus to soccer kids far away on a foggy soccer field?

The purpose of this shoe video is to compare that to what that looks like as Cinematic Mode tracks through an app that can see and edit the focus points. The above video is HDR so depending on where you view the video it might look very blown out. That was my first HDR upload to YouTube so gotta figure that one out. 🤷‍♂️

You can see how the focus points track as this shoe clip plays back in iMovie.

Can you change the depth of field in Cinematic Mode like you can with an actual real camera and lens?

The depth of the focus can be changed as each focus point has the ability to adjust the F-stop kind of like a real lens.

Haven’t I see something like that in other iOS camera modes?

Yes shooting SLO-MO on an iPhone gets you some special editing of slow-motion clips.

This slo-mo editing tool is supported in Apple’s tools like Photos and iMovie.

Is this all ProRes because I heard the new iPhone 13 Pros support ProRes capture on the phone.

This ProRes support is coming but it hasn’t been released as of this writing.

I hear the camera bump has changed. Will my iPhone 12 case fit an iPhone 13?

I will if you modify it.

Is Cinematic Mode actually useful?

Actually yes. It’s incredibly fun to shoot with depending on your situation and if you like to tinker with your footage (if you’re reading this you like to tinker with your footage) you’ll get a kick out of Cinematic Mode.

Is it worth the iPhone upgrade cost just for Cinematic Mode for video?

Probably not but if you are in the iPhone Upgrade Program then if you’re eligible absolutely.

Is it going to revolutionize filmmaking like the Canon 5D did and some blogs say it is going to?

Uhhh … no.

Yea but it is going to be useful for professional filmmaking and post-production in general?

Probably not. If anything the upgraded camera overall in the new iPhone 13s will make them more useful in the professional space as well the upcoming ProRes support on the iPhone.

Will rack focus and Cinematic Mode be overused and become ubiquitous on YouTube?

Of course it will.

Do you think you should move into cinematography with that amazing 👟 and ⚽️ video?

No. No I do not.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vdGFnL2hvdy10by1jcmVhdGUtY3VzdG9tLWNvbG9yLXBhbGV0dGUtcGhvdG9zaG9wL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Create a Custom Color Palette in Adobe Photoshop,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vdGFnL2hvdy10by1jcmVhdGUtY3VzdG9tLWNvbG9yLXBhbGV0dGUtcGhvdG9zaG9wL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyZWF0aXZlYmxvcS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvYWRvYmUteGQtcGx1Z2luc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plugins are finally on their way to Adobe XD,"Prototyping tool Adobe XD has already been making serious waves in the UI design space. And it looks set to get even better as Adobe has announced that Adobe XD plugins are on their way. These will enable users to integrate XD with top collaboration or project management tools as well as offering the community the opportunity to build their own XD plugins through an open platform.

Adobe XD is a free tool that enables designers to design app and website interfaces quickly and easily without the need to dabble in code. And while Experience Design is undeniably great for designing prototypes it can't cover all the features that UX designers need to get a project to completion. These XD plugins promise to make the process of swapping between different apps and tools much smoother.

Limited time offer: Save 40% on Adobe Creative Cloud

Adobe has partnered with key companies and tools to build XD plugins that will add useful functionality and unlock new workflows. The list of companies involved looks promising too: Microsoft Trello UserTesting Dribbble Anima (see our Anima 2 review) and Astute Graphics and more are already working on their own third-party plugins as well as Adobe's own Behance and Stock.

Adobe has also announced that it will enable its community of users to build on top of the app via an open developer platform. That means means that if you can't find an XD plugin that adds the functionality you're after you'll be able to build one yourself.

""We are committed to developing a rich ecosystem around Adobe XD to fit the modern designer's needs"" comments Creative Cloud executive VP Scott Belsky. ""Delivering seamless engaging user experiences is imperative for brands companies and all digital products and Adobe is focused on serving designers with powerful collaboration capabilities.""

This much-anticipated development continues Adobe's commitment to providing a tool that fits seamlessly into a modern designer's workflow and follows the company's announcement earlier in the year that it had integrated XD with Photoshop CC and Sketch.

That's all we know for now although we'll be updating this post with more details as they're released. You can take a look at the full press release on the Adobe blog.

Before she took the White House rose garden by storm Melania Trump made plenty of on-screen appearances in film television and commercials. Here are some of her best.





Melania the film star

In the 2001 comedy film Zoolander Melania makes a cameo alongside her husband Donald Trump who tells reporters: “Without Derek Zoolander male modelling wouldn’t be what it is today.”

The cameo came about because the couple were at the now defunct VH1 fashion awards. “We pulled them aside and asked them to talk about Derek Zoolander and so Trump and Melania did that” filmmaker Ben Stiller – who also plays the title character – told The New Abnormal podcast.



And Melania was in good company as the likes of David Bowie and Lenny Kravitz also had cameos in the motion picture.

Some stars have supported removing Donald Trump’s cameos from films. However Stiller dismissed the notion on the podcast when it came to Zoolander insisting the Trumps’ appearance represented a certain era in pop culture.



Melania the reality TV star

When Melania launched a caviar-based skin care line in 2013 she turned to her husband’s reality show The Celebrity Apprentice to help increase exposure for it. The Caviar Complexe C6 collaboration she created with New Sunshine earned her US$1 million upfront plus other perks but the company still had to pay US$100000 to be featured on the show.



The episode featuring Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Lisa Rinna and actor Stephen Baldwin showed basketball star Dennis Rodman and actor Gary Busey enthusing about Melania’s good looks. At one point Busey said: “Her beauty lives 5000 miles past heaven.”

Unfortunately the cosmetics line was soon cancelled due to poor sales and the company and Melania even ended up suing each other.



Melania the high-profile interviewee

Forget Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s bombshell interview when Donald and Melania introduced the world to baby Barron Trump people couldn’t get enough of them. In 2006 they gave the Oprah Winfrey Show cameras a grand tour of their luxury Trump Tower New York triplex home. Their interview with Gayle King also allowed more of the spotlight to shine on Melania who at the time was a model living in her husband’s somewhat more famous shadow.

The Trumps had so much respect for Oprah back then that in a 1999 interview the couple did with Larry King Donald said he would want the media mogul to be his running mate if he ran for president.

Melania the beauty pageant judge

Ivanka Trump co-hosted the Miss Teen USA pageant owned by her dad so it’s no surprise that Melania got to serve as a judge for the televised Miss USA competition in 2010. However Donald was forced to sell the Miss Universe company in 2015 due to remarks he made about Mexicans which caused advertisers to flee.



Melania the commercial queen

Between 2005 to 2006 she appeared in an Aflac commercial in which a crazy scientist switched her brain with that of the brand’s duck mascot.

Years before she even met Donald Melania appeared in a commercial for a Slovenian clothing line that showed her as the first female president of the United States. In 1993 23-year-old Melania was still an aspiring supermodel and the scenes were shot in her European home country. The ad also shows Melania – whose sister and parents eventually joined her in the US – signing a decree to allow three people to cross the border.

You may be certain you know what is causing a mysterious phenomenon but a well-done scientific experiment denies you that satisfaction and points you in an unexpected direction. Reality can be stranger than hypotheses.

Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is one of those mysterious phenomena that science when applied correctly has the power to resolve. (As a side note MCS can also be found under the larger umbrella of idiopathic environmental intolerance or IEI.) Put succinctly it’s the complaint that some people are harmed by small concentrations of chemicals that the rest of us tolerate. Think perfumes air fresheners paints scented products. It is a syndrome a group of symptoms that always occur together but those symptoms to the great frustration of medical professionals are often non-specific: they can have dozens and dozens of potential causes. They are commonly things like fatigue headaches and a general sense of not being well. The full list of potential symptoms involves every organ system in the body.

When a patient consults a doctor about non-specific symptoms and a battery of tests reveals nothing it can be irritating. “The symptoms are clearly there” the patient thinks “why can’t my doctor find what’s causing them?” Which is why when they are given a diagnosis even one that turns out to be wrong or fake it feels reassuring. A diagnosis provides information about the condition and paves the way to meet other people with the diagnosis who can offer moral support and potential solutions.

I bring up MCS in this context because the question of what causes it has been addressed by a massive report that was published earlier this summer (in French only). In fact to call it a report is to show modesty on behalf of its authors. At over 800 pages and with an emphasis on educating the reader about the many discoveries and technological innovations that helped researchers probe the mystery of MCS it is a veritable textbook on multiple chemical sensitivity.

This textbook was commissioned by Quebec’s Ministry of Health and Social Services because of the magnitude of the problem in Canada. As the authors remark the number of medical appointments made by people with MCS in Canada is much higher than that of a similar population. Quebec’s public health agency the INSPQ was thus tasked with summarizing the literature on the subject (over 4000 papers and documents) and my hat’s off to the textbook’s many authors for this colossal work.

MCS was first described in 1956 and in the intervening 65 years a number of hypotheses have been formulated to explain what its underlying cause may be. Could people with MCS have a genetic predisposition a change in their DNA that would trigger this sensitivity? We already know that certain changes can affect the activity of our enzymes tasked with metabolizing foreign substances. We can imagine a similar scenario in which molecules from a perfume end up causing some sort of toxicity because of the impaired function of an important enzyme. Genetic studies of MCS have so far produced contradictory results in part because determining who belongs to the MCS group is not easy. There is no diagnostic test that can confirm someone has MCS. It is a diagnosis of exclusion what is left after ruling out a long list of possibilities. So who participates in a genetic study of MCS can be just about anyone who self-identifies as having the syndrome and this can fudge the data. So far the INSPQ report concludes the lack of reliability of these genetic studies means we cannot blame MCS on specific changes in the DNA. As we have seen with handedness height asthma and other traits however it may be that multiple genes all make small contributions to MCS but this remains to be proven.

Another hypothesis is that these chemicals would have a neurotoxic effect: they would directly alter the normal functioning of the brain. Various mechanisms were proposed including one poetically called “limbic kindling” which suggests that small repeated exposures of the brain to a substance leads to a much-amplified response later on even in the absence of exposure. The idea is that these small early exposures “kindled” or set fire to the electrical activity of the brain and the metaphorical fire is now self-sustained. While scientists seemingly agree that the limbic system—the parts of our brain involved in emotion memory learning and motivation—indeed plays a role in MCS they disagree on whether the dreaded chemicals are toxic to it or if the impact on the limbic system is due to the anxiety of anticipating the presence of the chemical. More on that later.

Then there is the immune system. Could MCS be an allergy? Laboratory tests proved negative. Could MCS be a type of immunodeficiency or an autoimmune condition like lupus? The data we have so far seem to disprove these ideas although high levels of pro-inflammatory molecules seen with MCS (but not unique to it) may contribute to the condition.

The INSPQ textbook goes on to survey the remaining hypotheses—blaming oxidative stress or inflammation inside the brain or the spinal cord or the sense of smell itself—but while some of these systems are altered in some way in MCS nothing could be pinned down as a specific cause. Studies on the sense of smell are particularly revealing however. People with MCS who enrolled in these studies had no better detection threshold than people without MCS when it came to smells thus ruling out a hypersensitivity of the nose but surprisingly enough they were worse at identifying and distinguishing familiar smells. Not better; worse. Moreover in a 2016 study participants with MCS would start reporting symptoms before the volatile chemicals were even deployed. Faced with all of this information the INSPQ report ends with the remaining hypothesis: that multiple chemical sensitivity is an anxiety disorder.

It’s worth highlighting the fact that people who suffer from an anxiety disorder are not “crazy.” Our brain is an organ like our liver and lungs and it can malfunction. There is an unfortunate stigma around mental health and a severe underfunding of services meant to address it. But anxiety depression bipolar disorder—these are as real as high blood pressure and asthma and they have genuine and debilitating effects on the body. Summarizing the research on MCS the INSPQ report proposes that chronic anxiety can explain all of the symptoms associated with MCS. Anxiety is characterized by the anticipation of a perceived danger which leads the person to always be on the lookout for this supposed threat thus creating a state of permanent stress. The perception of a threat in this case a chemical arises through a bit of conditioning: if the chemical is originally detected when someone’s symptoms independently manifest themselves an association is made which leads to a catastrophizing anticipation of the next exposure. Physical consequences like insomnia depression and headaches trickle down from this state of constant anxiety.

This is a real health issue and the INSPQ proposes that specialized centres dedicated to MCS be set up to address this significant problem. While it is challenging to know how many people are affected by MCS given the lack of proper diagnostic tools the scientific literature reveals numbers between 0.5 and 3% of the population when it is diagnosed by a medical doctor and up to 32% (a third) of the population when it is self-diagnosed with a higher risk being seen in women and in adults between the ages of 40 and 60. This is not a problem that can be ignored.

But blaming trace amounts of chemicals is simply not supported by the evidence at this point. If you cannot reliably tell when you are being exposed to the chemical; if you start reporting symptoms before the chemical is even released; if your brain is worse at identifying smells than the average person; if it has been shown that these chemicals present in trace amounts are not even absorbed by your body; then it is unlikely this chemical is responsible for the debilitating symptoms. This latest summary of the evidence points us in a different direction than the original name of the syndrome did and while it will not please everyone it paves the way for more effective treatments of a very real condition.

Take-home message:

-Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a chronic condition often blamed on exposure to trace amounts of chemicals that is accompanied by a wide variety of symptoms

-Since it was first described in 1956 scientists have investigated many hypotheses to explain how tiny concentrations of chemicals could affect people with MCS: hypotheses based on genetics neurology the immune system the sense of smell oxidative stress and the mind influencing the body

-An 840-page report by Quebec’s public health agency summarizes the state of our knowledge on MCS and comes to the conclusion that trace amounts of chemicals are not to blame and that MCS is a type of anxiety disorder in which anticipation of a danger causes very real and debilitating physical symptoms

After being bombarded by Instagram ads from Drift a direct-to-consumer air freshener company I decided to order some since I’ve been spending more time in my car and want to mask the musk.

I’ve never been much of an air freshener guy and the only time I’ve really used them was when they were given to me after getting my car detailed. They’re ugly they get in the way and their scents can be overwhelming.

Drift is a new take on the car air freshener. In case you’re unfamiliar Drift is a subscription box service that’ll send you a new air freshener every month or so (depending on how frequently you want one). With a price that starts at under $10 a month it’s a relatively inexpensive convenience.

The air fresheners come in two different types. There’s a wood air freshener about the size of a credit card that comes from sustainably sourced tree farms in the United States. Drift also sells a silver-dollar-sized aluminum freshener that clips to your air conditioning vent. With the latter you can control the scent intensity by twisting it clockwise or counterclockwise.

I tried both models. Although I preferred the look of the wood freshener more the metal freshener’s scent lasted 2 weeks longer — totaling about a month of use before needing replacing. I also liked that the wood freshener magnetically clips right to my visor and stays out of the way. I use my air conditioner vents to mount my smartphone so I’d prefer to keep my additional vents free from obstructions.

You can choose between six scent options: teak mill grove amber cabana and a limited-edition scent of the month that changes every 30 days. The amber scent has notes of lavender and fresh rain grove smells of citrus cabana is coconutty and salty teak is a masculine fragrance with hints of cedar and amber and mill is very pine-like and reminded me of Christmas.

The scent of the month I tried was coffee — which made me crave a cup every time I got in my car. The “teak” and “mill” scents were definitely my favorites but may be too intense for some. The scents are strongest for the first couple of days of use but they mellow out over time.

I appreciate that Drift uses all-natural fragrances and essential oils without using any harsh toxic chemicals. Overall they’re nice-looking good-smelling and relatively inexpensive air fresheners that show up at your doorstep like magic to keep your car smelling clean.

In June he listed the extra bedroom in their apartment on Airbnb and for more than two months hosted a steady stream of tourists at a rate of 40 euros or about $47 per night. But by the end of August a couple of weeks after a new ban on short-term private-room rentals had taken effect he was reconsidering his options.

“I think I’m going to cancel the reservations that I have” said Mr. Hernández who added that he had used his rental earnings to help fund the launch of his fashion brand. “I can get problems by renting on Airbnb so I think I’m not going to do it anymore.”

As the Philippines begins to relax domestic travel restrictions Airbnb continues to steadily navigate the Covid-19 pandemic with hundreds of new local Hosts joining the platform in the first six months of 2021.

The company announced today that Filipino Gen Zs and millennials are the driving force behind Airbnb’s growing community of Hosts in the Philippines with over 68% of new Airbnb Hosts in H1 2021 comprising Gen Zs and millennials aged between 18 and 40*.

Despite hosting during small windows of opportunities due to the start-stop order of travel restrictions between January to June new Filipino Hosts have collectively earned over PHP 21 million welcoming guests on Airbnb. Metro Manila Tagaytay and Metro Cebu also emerged as the top cities where new Airbnb Hosts are hosting*.

Tourism is a significant contributor to the Philippine economy and employment. In 2019 research from Oxford Economics revealed that Filipino Airbnb Hosts contributed USD 1 billion to the country’s GDP and supported over 160000 jobs. Guests on Airbnb spent over USD 930 million representing 1.2% of the country’s total tourism spending in the same year**.

Through the pandemic hosting has emerged as an important economic lifeline for many Filipinos to make ends meet and support their families. A Q1 2021 survey by Airbnb reveals that 57% of Filipino Hosts polled said the income they’ve earned through hosting has helped them to stay in their homes and over half said they want to find more ways to host with Airbnb. Over a third of Filipino Hosts also said they share recommendations with guests on their favourite local restaurants and businesses within their community***.

“This year’s World Tourism Day calls for more inclusive growth that advances prosperity for more communities and drives more sustainable development. It’s a call for our tourism industry to reset and rebuild tourism in a way that benefits more people and communities than ever before. As more Filipinos turn to hosting with Airbnb to support themselves and their families during this time of need we remain fully committed to empowering our Hosts to provide unique family-friendly and clean responsible travel” shares Amanpreet Bajaj General Manager for Southeast Asia India Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Earlier this year Airbnb introduced more than 100 upgrades across its platform including a new simplified 10-step process for anyone to become a Host. It also launched seven Host clubs this year across the Philippines to empower Hosts to connect collaborate and support each other as well as their local communities by sharing advice and best practices on hosting. During the pandemic Airbnb launched its Airbnb Enhanced Clean protocol an industry-first set of cleaning and sanitisation standards designed with guidance from the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure peace of mind for the community.

The company continues to support and strengthen the communities its Hosts call home amidst the unprecedented changes brought about by the pandemic. In June Mercy in Action Childhope Philippines Foundation Inc. Haligi ng Bata Inc. and Reach Out and Feed Philippines were amongst the first 150 grant recipients of the inaugural Airbnb Community Fund which will distribute US$100 million over 10 years to organizations around the world.

Cops this week seized seven illegally documented vans that have been used for at least two years as cut-rate Airbnb rentals authorities said.

In a series of since-removed posts on the app the vans were touted as a very down to Earth way for tourists to experience the mean streets of the Big Apple — by practically sleeping on them for under $100 a night.

“Glamp in a spacious camper Van in NYC!” gushed one ad boasting of a “private room” said to accommodate up to three people.

But an eagle-eyed traffic enforcement agent noticed something sketchy about the vehicles — five of which were parked in the East Village — whose registration and NJ plates were long expired some going as far back as 2000 sources said.

A joint investigation by the city Sheriff’s office and the NYPD Document Fraud Unit discovered an “operation of alleged fraudulent and illegally registered vehicles being used as Airbnb rentals on various streets in Manhattan” Sheriff Joseph Fucito told The Post Saturday.

The Sheriff impounded the cars on Thursday and Friday authorities said.

“Vehicles could be removed from the street because they were mismatched and expired registrations” a law enforcement source added.

One of the seized vans — a red 1999 Ford Econline parked on East 2nd Street — offered California-based journalist/video creator Uptin Saiidi a room with a view — not to mention four wheels and an exhaust pipe.

Saiidi who made a YouTube video out of his Aug. 4 stay said he was initially seduced by the ad which offered him the #VanLife experience for just $97.

He said a key — which cannot start the engine — was left for him in a lockbox at the back of the van.

But he quickly noticed a red flag: “When I arrived there was a parking ticket because it was there on Tuesday which was street cleaning. I stayed there on a Wednesday” he noted.

9 In a series of since-removed posts on Airbnb the vans were touted as a very down-to-Earth for tourists to experience the mean streets of the Big Apple. Airbnb

Another big concern he admitted was finding his own accommodations to relieve himself since the ad warned: “Restrooms shower and lockers are available at a public pool nearby.”

“The worst thing was the anxiety of where to pee when you gotta go. I went into the van at 10 p.m. and then woke up at 7 a.m.” he said adding that he found relief at a nearby Equinox.

Sleeping was another issue he continued.

“What is interesting was how awful I slept because you have people walking right next to you. You have people literally outside walking and talking and cars trying to parallel park next to you all-night long” said Saiidi describing his stay in the “smelly” van as “awful.”

When reached for comment Airbnb directed the Post to its settlement agreement with New York City’s Office of Special Enforcement that requires the platform to share renter and unit information with the city. The company was not cited by authorities the sources said.

The company has a verified checkmark next to a picture of the account of the mysterious “Nancy” who collected several positive reviews this month from users gushing about their ”Superfun! Adventure” or kvelling that the van was a “Perfect spot to stay for a couple!”

In her profile on the app Nancy wrote: “Love to travel and explore the world. I’m a fan of tiny and unique homes. Hoping to share a part of van life experience with all travelers! I have lived in NYC all my life so I can recommend you the best places to see eat and go!”

It was unclear whether Nancy owned any or all of the vans and authorities would not comment on their ownership.

Sleeping overnight in a van is legal according to the city’s Department of Transportation — provided it’s not parked in the same spot for 24 hours in restricted areas.

When parking is not otherwise restricted no person shall park any vehicle in any area including a residential area in excess of seven consecutive days the agency’s rules note. Fines typically start at $115 the NYPD has said.

The Sheriff’s office did not comment further except to say the “investigation in this matter is ongoing.”

That place is called Little Talladega.

An Airbnb located on a 60-acre property the location features an 8500+ sq ft Tuscan style home with accommodations for 16 people. That means six bedrooms 12 beds and six and a half baths. All of which is great because its marquee features are the two race tracks and miles of trails renters have access to.

Although the tracks aren’t huge they’re more than big enough to drift on or to host a karting Grand Prix with all 15 of the friends you’re staying at the house with. Its teardrop shape with a chicane in the middle also allows for a few track setups to prolong the fun. The small dirt oval meanwhile will provide hours of fun.

As if that wasn’t enough there’s a massive garage with go-karts and ATVs. It even has enough space to set up a crazy kart course.

If you get tired of driving there’s also an arcade in the shop as well as a tennis court basketball court a baseball diamond a playground a swimming pool a billiards table a dance floor and more.

Several kitchens mean you won’t be left hungry and if it wasn’t clear that this place is set up for car enthusiasts two of the bedrooms feature car beds (one JDM themed the other classic pickup themed) for when you inevitably collapse from exhaustion after you become overstimulated from all the activities.

AKAM,Akamai,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vc3ViYXJ1dGVsZXNjb3BlLm9yZy9lbi9uZXdzL3RvcGljcy8yMDIxLzA5LzI2LzI5OTAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Akamai Internship Program at Subaru Telescope | Topics & Announcements,"Topics

The Akamai Workforce Initiative (AWI) has been in operation since 2003 and has placed more than 400 students into summer internships in Hawai`i and California. The goal of the program is to support undergraduate students in STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) fields so that they are more likely to be successful in Hawai`i 's technology industries.



Subaru Telescope has participated in the AWI program since 2005 and has mentored 32 students during that time. Each intern works on a project that makes a direct and tangible contribution to the organization to which they are assigned. Past projects have included software improvements power distribution units and equipment monitors.



Kyra Ikeda was the AWI intern at Subaru Telescope for the 2021 internship period. Kyra grew up on Oahu and graduated from Pearl City High School in 2017 as a valedictorian. She is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Hawai`i at Mānoa. After graduation she hopes to apply her knowledge of computer science to oceanographic research and be able to benefit the community.



Kyra worked on a project to enhance the Ginga software that Subaru Telescope uses to view astronomical images. The project goal was to improve and develop graphical user interface (GUI) widgets so that Ginga could operate in a web browser.



The Subaru Telescope Software Division developed Ginga a Python-based toolkit of GUI widgets to build image viewers for scientific data files taken by the telescope instruments. Currently Ginga exists solely as a desktop application; however it would be convenient to allow Ginga to run on the web as well. This enhancement would provide ease of access for users worldwide and be beneficial for other applications that are based on the Ginga toolkit.



At the beginning of the project Kyra was able to run Ginga’s desktop and web versions side-by-side so that she could see which widgets needed their web versions corrected or improved. For example the controls (buttons menus etc.) on several of the widgets were non-functional. She was able to use the JavaScript and Python programming languages as well as the HTML and CSS technologies to improve the web widgets so that they would have a similar look feel and functionality as the desktop widgets. The progress made during the course of this project helped to advance Ginga and applications based on it towards the ultimate goal of being fully operable in a web browser.



""Working on Ginga gave me lots of new knowledge to bring back home"" said Kyra ""I’m forever grateful for the opportunity to intern at Subaru with my mentors Eric and Russell especially with the ongoing pandemic.""



Russell Kackley and Eric Jeschke Software Engineers at Subaru Telescope mentored Kyra during the project. Kyra's participation in Akamai was funded by Maunakea Observatories.

But in a region of the country that knows too well the toll of OUD one treatment provider is stepping up in the fight through a partnership with one the world’s most influential companies.

Located in Dayton Ohio OneFifteen is a 4.5-acre campus consisting of residential treatment and housing outpatient treatment and a crisis stabilization facility. OneFifteen also provides telehealth assistance medication-assisted treatments (MATs) and places a significant emphasis on the science of addiction care.

Founded in 2019. OneFifteen is assisted through a partnership with Verily Life Sciences a research organization that is a subsidiary of Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL) the parent company of Google. OneFifteen is using its care approach — dubbed the “No Wrong Door” method — to provide much-needed help to residents throughout southwestern Ohio which has been one of the hardest hit regions in the country with OUD.

OneFifteen is specifically tasked with tackling the drug epidemic in Dayton which at the time of the company’s founding had one of the highest overdose death rates in the country largely stemming from opioids like fentanyl. Additionally Montgomery County — of which Dayton is the county seat — has previously been given the infamous distinction as “the overdose capital of the nation” as it recorded almost 400 overdose deaths in a six-month span shortly before OneFifteen opened its doors.

A nurse by training with a background in health care management Marti Taylor is OneFifteen’s president and CEO as well as Verily’s executive director of behavioral health. As the greater Dayton community and the nation struggles with OUD Taylor believes strides can be made by employing data and research in the care delivery process — which she says is a hallmark of OneFifteen.

Behavioral Health Business caught up with Taylor who talked about the mission of OneFifteen which was recognized by Fast Company in its 2021 Innovation by Design Awards. She also discussed the company’s partnership with Google-backed Verily how it has already surpassed expectations for the number of patients treated and its future plans beyond Dayton.

Inside the C-Suite shines a spotlight on executives in the behavioral health space. Know a top leader who’d like to be profiled in an upcoming Q&A? Drop us a line at [email protected].

BHB: Talk about the mission of OneFifteen and what was the impetus for its creation.

Taylor: It really started in 2018. Verily was doing work in the behavioral health space at that time. It was their CEO who said: ‘“What are we doing with this opioid crisis that’s happening in this country? And shouldn’t we be leaning in a bit as a health care tech company to help with this?”

Through lots of conversations and travels across the country he said: “Let’s land this in Dayton Ohio.” Dayton unfortunately was being named ground zero for the opioid epidemic. But also what we found in Dayton was a very collaborative community. Working with the [local] hospital association working with two local health systems — Premier Health Network and Kettering Health Network — and working with public health agencies there was lots of collaboration and leaning in on this problem.

Dayton felt like the place that we should go and so our mission is simple which is to really heal people experiencing substance use disorder through learning science and partnership. Verily set the tone back when the original vision was laid out to say: “Let’s not recreate the wheel every time. Let’s figure out how we can partner with others and optimize the care that’s being delivered.”

How would you describe the partnership between OneFifteen and Verily?

Coming from academic medicine where I’ve worked over the last 30 years what’s been so great in having a tech partner is the user experience. When I think about Google I think about the user experience. We have folks on our partner team at Verily who come to our campus at OneFifteen and talk about the user experience. They talk to our patients they talk to our clinicians and as we’re developing a new patient app they say: “What’s going to work? What features would you like us to build into this app?” That’s been one of the things that has been exciting to watch that we have this whole user experience team that is everyday thinking about the users in Dayton and what’s going to be best for them.

None of us were necessarily planning this when we stood up OneFifteen as a startup company but we wondered what it would mean if we needed in-person care to become more like virtual care. By having a partner like Verily developing our technology and helping us pivot during the pandemic to more virtual care they built that out in about nine days for us.

From a user experience standpoint we were able to say: “It needs to be secure but it needs to be simple for our patients and for our clinicians to use.” To date we’ve had almost 10000 visits which may be that one patient has five encounters with us via telehealth but they have 10000 visits via telehealth.

We have a team of biostatisticians and data scientists who once we pull the data in then they’re able to take that data and start to analyze it and say: “Here’s what we’re learning from the data and here’s what changes we should implement to make our care even better.” Verily provides technology and data analytics and are great partners to have working alongside us.

There are a variety of treatment providers that have set up locations in southwestern Ohio which has been especially hit hard by SUD. In your opinion how does OneFifteen stand apart from those other providers?

I like to think of the uniqueness of OneFifteen in four buckets. One we focus on whole patient care. Secondly we embrace a harm reduction model. Third we are driving addiction treatment into the future. And the fourth bucket is in our continuum of care and having that entire care on one campus.

Whole patient care is our care coordination strategy. We have everything from psychiatrists primary care physicians peer specialists who have lived experience care coordinators nurse practitioners and a very multidisciplinary group of people. We really can focus broadly on the entire person and not just their addiction treatment.

The second thing is harm reduction which involves practical strategies and ideas to help reduce negative consequences associated with drug use. We have what we call a “No Wrong Door” approach. That means we’re going to meet people where they are. While we have a brick-and-mortar campus in Dayton on this five-acre campus we’re also now putting telehealth hubs out in the community.

We have a telehealth hub in the public defender’s office and we have telehealth hubs in emergency rooms as ways to really meet people where they are. Other practical things we’re doing around harm reduction is that we distribute Narcan and we distribute fentanyl strips.

Unlike other programs where patients may be terminated from care for using again we see that recovery is very incremental and we need to be walking with that person each step of the way.

The third thing is that we’re really wanting to drive addiction treatment into the future. We have a team of 15 people or so in South San Francisco California [where Verily is located] who wake up every day saying: “What kind of technology should we be developing for Dayton to really help clinicians as well as the patients?”

The fourth thing that is unique about our care is that we have the full spectrum of care on one campus. Every level of care is available and that goes from outpatient care to a crisis stabilization unit to a detox unit to what we call “living” — or which some people refer to as sober living.

OneFifteen has been around for less than two years but it has already surpassed projections on the number of patients it expected to treat? What might you attribute that to?

The pandemic did have an impact on isolation. The pandemic was breeding isolation and social issues and people lost their jobs. For many people you lose something and you turn to alcohol or substances that you think are going to take away the pain. And we know that that’s not going to necessarily take away the pain.

We had set out in our first year to see 1000 patients and we are about 22 months in and we’re over 3600 patients that we’ve now treated. It’s hard to say: ”Should we celebrate this number or not?” But part of it for us as far as why we’re seeing more patients and more of a demand than we thought I’d go back to those four unique principles.

As SUD/OUD rates continue to rise might OneFifteen look to expand its services to other parts of Ohio as well as other regions of the country?

Our focus right now is still very much Montgomery County and the greater Miami Valley region. But certainly through the pandemic and through other opportunities that others have talked with us about we’re in the very early stages of thinking about how we can better treat rural Ohio.

Dayton while it’s not a big city certainly is a more urban area than in many parts of Ohio. We’re starting to have conversations where we say: “How do we start to address some of these issues and meet people where they are but specifically in rural Ohio?” That is probably the next expansion for us.

Do you think that analytics — be it on the addiction research side or the provider business side — needs to become more embedded into the daily operations of the SUD treatment sector?

We’ve got to get behavioral health to have the same level of parity that physical health has in this country. In a joking manner people might think: “Gosh if somebody has a cancer diagnosis the neighbors are bringing casseroles over to the house.” Are people even talking about the fact that maybe their son is struggling with addiction? Certainly somebody is not bringing a casserole over and saying: “Well let me help you out here with it.”

In every way that you look at the stigma that goes along with addiction care and behavioral health care people don’t want to talk about it because people think it’s a moral failing or something that they did wrong. There’s not a lot of people that really talk about addiction care as a chronic health condition. And so we feel strongly that we need to be shining the light on that. We need to be talking about that.

Payers will say to us: “I don’t have the data to know what I should be paying for and what I shouldn’t be paying for.” That’s where we feel we can come in with a strong partnership with a company like Verily to say “Okay we’re really going to hone in on the data and start to generate the evidence to say this is what works and this is what doesn’t work” so that we can start to fix all of those other issues around payment reform and stigma.

Do you think that providers like OneFifteen represent the future of SUD treatment care nationwide?

I sure hope so and I would point to those four bucket areas I talked about where we see ourselves as being a little bit unique. But I think other providers have some of those similar traits as well.

When I look around and have conversations with other providers they are so passionate about the care that they’re delivering every day. But because there are other parts of the systems that don’t work in their favor like payment if they can’t somehow keep their doors open they’re not going to be able to continue to provide substance use disorder treatment.

We need to continue to push to make sure that there’s always 24/7 access for individuals. That may not be for every provider and some may just do Monday through Friday 9-to-5 outpatient care that they can deliver. But we need to make sure that we’re thinking more broadly about access at a 24/7 level.

As we start to generate evidence we want to make sure we’re sharing that with others. We’re not going to hold that in a OneFifteen silo we’re going to share that evidence and say: “Here’s what works and what doesn’t work.” Working with many other providers we want to try to have an impact on addiction care for generations to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Site preparation began this week on two of the more conspicuous solar installations in the city of Perry’s plan for 10 self-sustaining buildings.

Some 15 trees were cut down in Wiese Park last week to make way for the series of solar canopies that will line the bike trail north of the McCreary Community Building. The majority of the trees were ash and slated for future removal with the progress of the emerald ash borer in Iowa.

Concrete footings for the canopies will be 12 feet deep and three feet wide according to the city making them hopefully sturdy enough to withstand the next derecho wind storm.

Groundbreaking is also near for a solar pavilion between the Raccoon River Valley trailhead and Caboose Park in downtown Perry and solar carport canopies are planned for the city hall parking lot and at the Perry Public Library.

The city aims to save almost $5 million on its electricity bills and reduce its carbon footprint to zero under its agreement with Norwalk-based Red Lion Renewables to install the arrays of solar panels and carport canopies on or around 10 city buildings.

Under the power purchase agreement the city will buy its electricity from Red Lion at a rate lower than that charged by Alliant Energy the city’s current energy provider. There are be no up-front cost to the city to build the solar system with installations planned for:

City Hall 1102 Willis Ave.

Police/Fire Department 908 Willis Ave.

Library 1101 Willis Ave.

Carnegie Library 1123 Willis Ave.

Towncraft 1124 Willis Ave.

Recycle Building 14323 Ivy Place

Caboose Park First and Willis Avenue

Public Works North Shop W. Fourth Street

Public Works Shop Shop W. Fourth Street

McCreary Community Building 1800 Pattee St.

The city stands to save between $2.7 million and $4.8 million over the 30-year life of the system with an option to buy the solar array outright anytime after the fifth year for about $1.2 million or less.

Altogether the solar system will generate 102.2% of the green energy needed to power the 10 city sites making Perry a leading community in reducing the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and bring the town close to meeting its goals of a net-zero community.

Most of the other solar panels will be largely unseen rooftop installations on city buildings with the largest single installation an array of solar panels covering much of the roof surface of the McCreary Community Building. The Perry Public Safety Building at 908 Willis Ave. would also see a large rooftop array.

The solar installations can also accommodate the future integration of battery storage or car-charging stations for further energy resiliency in Perry.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Police are investigating seek the public’s help; the county DA has been notified

Several business owners in downtown Longmont arrived to work on Friday morning September 23 to find a racist flyer left at their doorstep.

Longmont Police and the Longmont Downtown Development Authority were contacted. Longmont Officers recovered 11 flyers.

This is not the first time Longmont has been peppered with racist flyers or stickers. As more Americans learn about anti-blackness and work to create a more just and equitable society there are those who linger in the past refusing to let go of the violent supremacy the nation was founded on. With disinformation rising and anti-black rhetoric surrounding CRT (Critical Race Theory) there is a portion of America that seems determined to keep America in her racist roots.

Critical race theory is a body of legal scholarship and an academic movement of US civil-rights scholars and activists who seek to critically examine the intersection of race and US law and to challenge mainstream American liberal approaches to racial justice. Wikipedia

https://www.facebook.com/LongmontDDA

The flyers were photocopied and included a boldface racial slur using asteriks indicating they know the word is wrong as well as a misspelling/typo.

There was no indication why Allstate and its toll-free number were included in the text. Allstate’s corporate media team was contacted and provided the following statement:

These fliers were not created or posted by Allstate and do not represent the company or its agency owners. Inclusive Diversity and Equity is one of our core values and we take situations like this seriously. To learn more about Allstate’s commitment to Inclusive Diversity and Equity please visit www.allstate.com/diversity.

There is no sign that this has anything to do with Allstate at a corporate level nor with any local Allstate insurance offices. All we can guess is that Allstate employs a black man as its spokesperson.

You shouldn't sell cigarettes to children. But if you primarily sell cigarettes you should try expanding your portfolio to include mac and cheese. That's what Altria Group which was once known as Marlboro cigarette company Philip Morris did between 1988 and 2007.

As The Motley Fool reports Altria actually bought General Foods in 1985 because rival cigarette maker Reynold's American had acquired Nabisco. Then having acquired some food business experience they decided to invest further in the market and bought Kraft three years later. This arrangement continued into the 2000s when Altria began to sell some shares before spinning off the company in its entirety in 2007. During their relationship nothing overtly shady seems to have occurred other than the fact that both companies sell products that can be detrimental to public health.

In an interview with NPR Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld explained that the split would allow Kraft to pursue opportunities that being a subsidiary had blocked off. In no way was this a move against the possibility that Kraft would end up losing money to pay off various tobacco lawsuits on the behalf of Altria Group. Nor did the spin off seem to indicate that Kraft would pursue healthier options because as Irene Rosenfeld put it ""...nobody is willing to trade off the great taste of the food that they're eating for the benefit of having some other nutritional properties..."" The only reason then that Kraft is less shady now is because it is no longer covered in tobacco smoke.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Brown an operations manager at the new facility and Pontiac native who has lived in the city for over 35 years is in charge of making sure millions of books laptops beauty products and more reach their destinations.

A graduate of Pontiac Central High School and Oakland University he had his first date with his wife in 2000 at a Detroit Lions game at the Silverdome. Before that he worked there selling popcorn.

He recently moved back from a regional manager position in Pennsylvania.

“That was hugely important to me (to come home) because I’ve seen the good times in Pontiac and the down times” Brown said.

Originally announced in 2019 the 823000-square-foot Pontiac Robotics Fulfillment Center near M-59 and Opdyke Road opened Sept. 8. Orders are picked and packed at the location before being shipped to customers.

Jessica Pawl spokesperson for the company said construction on the facility began in late 2019. She said Amazon received no tax breaks adding that the company does not share developmental costs.

Since 2010 Amazon says it has invested more than $6 billion statewide and created more than 21000 jobs.

“We saw a growing demand within southeast Michigan so it made sense to bring about a second Amazon robotics fulfillment center in Michigan” said Fred McPherson general manager at the location.

The first such center is located in Romulus.

The Pontiac facility is one of three new Michigan sites that were recently opened. The other two include a fulfillment center in Huron Charter Township designed to receive store and package heavy or bulky items; and a warehouse in Walker a Grand Rapids suburb which delivers to southwest Michigan customers.

Future expansion includes facilities in Delta Township in 2022; Canton in 2022 and Grand Rapids in 2022 or 2023.

The Pontiac facility will employ over 1200 people. As of Sept. 15 McPherson said 1000 employees have been hired adding that the company is planning to add more for the upcoming holiday season.

Health and safety remains Amazon’s No. 1 priority McPherson said. The company offers health and well-being programs he said along with wellness centers and stretching and hydration stations.

“It’s talked about every day” Brown said. “It’s the first thing we talk about every meeting with any employees.”

McPherson added that due to the Delta variant Amazon has a mandatory mask order in its facilities accompanied by social distancing and other protocols. Previously those who proved their vaccination status could work without masks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFib3V0YW1hem9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL29wZXJhdGlvbnMvd2F0Y2gtYXMtZW1wbG95ZWVzLWxlYXJuLXRoZXlyZS1iZWluZy1wcm9tb3RlZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch as Amazon employees learn they're being promoted,"We’re working hard every day to be the best place for people to have satisfying and fulfilling long-term careers.

Congratulations Sam! See an Amazon employee get a surprise promotion

""I'm able to help guide my [new team] and tell them 'Hey dreams do come true!'""—Sam

Sam has been working with Amazon for four years and has been battling cancer on and off for all four of them. But that hasn’t slowed her down. According to Sam Amazon is a huge family. Her coworkers always make sure that she is feeling well and with their support she quickly worked her way up within an Amazon Air site.

Being an area manager has been her goal since day one when she joined as a seasonal employee and she recently applied for the position.

Levi newly-promoted Amazon Air area manager

San Bernardino California

Congratulations Levi

""This is exactly what I want to do ... I'm just really excited. It's time to start a new chapter.”—Levi

Levi started at Amazon as a seasonal employee hungry to learn. His team recognized that in him and invested time to help him grow within the company. When he recently applied for his next promotion to move from an hourly to salaried role as an area manager they helped him through the process—and his dedication paid off.

""Levi goes above and beyond"" said Patrick one of Levi’s mentors. ""He's done a lot of things when it comes to driving the business and being a great leader for the transportation team.""

Levi's new role as a transportation area manager puts him in charge of the transportation team at his site. The position itself is close to Levi's heart as he loves cars (Japanese domestic market cars to be specific).

""Honestly the opportunity at Amazon is endless. You could work your way from literally an entry-level employee up to a senior-level manager"" Levi's manager Kiro said. ""I think the sky's the limit [for Levi].""

Marta newly-promoted Amazon Fresh zone lead

Franconia Virginia

Congratulations Marta

“I didn’t know where this job would take me. It’s led me to a great company and great people that I work with. [This promotion] means a lot.”—Marta

Marta started working with Amazon in 2020 as a Whole Foods shopper. She later became one of the first hourly employees at a new Amazon Fresh location and soon after her managers talked to her about growth opportunities and how her role could become a career. Marta expressed enthusiasm to move up to the next level and her managers encouraged her to apply for a zone lead position.

Zone leads are the backbone of each department within the store and we’re excited to see Marta thrive in this new role—as are her co-workers. They love being on the same shift with her because everything flows everything works and she always helps other employees.

“Our entire team is very excited about Marta getting promoted because she totally deserves it. She really really worked hard [at] learning about every department” said Nellie Marta’s manager. “Marta is always eager to learn about the dash cart front end customer service … she's a true team player.”

Tiana newly-promoted fulfillment center area manager

Baltimore Maryland

Congratulations Tiana

“[This promotion means] everything. She’s trying to stay and stick with Amazon. She says it’s going to take her places.”—Tambra Tiana’s mother

Tiana just passed her five-year anniversary at Amazon. She started as an hourly employee packing customer orders and then moved to sorting where she sorted items into customer orders. When she asked if she could learn something new her managers moved her to problem solving where she came up with solutions to challenges across departments in the fulfillment center. After about 18 months she was promoted to be an outbound flow process assistant. As her manager Rob said “Tiana pretty much controls the entire operation.”

Tiana recently applied for a promotion to an area manager and to share the news that she earned the promotion her team secretly planned a celebration. Her co-workers managers and even her family joined in on the surprise.

“When I tell you this girl goes above and beyond she goes above and beyond for every single department” said Sarah one of Tiana’s co-workers. “She's always helpful always happy joyful with smile on her face. [It’s a] super well-deserved [promotion].”

“At our fulfillment center and really all of Amazon we're committed to promoting compassionate leaders who have a people-first mentality and Tiana certainly fits that mold” Rob said. “That's going to be what leads her to be successful at the next level as well. I'm excited for what she does next.”

And the e-commerce giant continues to expand: its new Stockton shipping center will be Amazon's fourth facility in the city and its 11th in the county according to the San Joaquin Partnership.

'There’s something for everyone':Stockton Amazon center is hiring thousands of jobs

E-commerce companies' demand for workers is transforming the local labor market: San Joaquin County was one of the first places in the country to see transportation and warehousing employment surpass employment in retail according to a 2019 report by the Center for Business and Policy Research at the University of the Pacific.

The county has the second-highest concentration of transportation and warehouse jobs out of all metropolitan areas in the U.S. the report found.

E-commerce companies are looking to cash in on the county's central location and expanding workforce Carrie Wright Stockton's economic development director said.

Stockton has extensive freeway and rail connections in addition to its port and unlike many parts of California the population of the city and county are growing she said.

“We were approached with a very aggressive timeline in order to have that facility built"" Wright said. ""And we worked to do that so that we could make sure that it could open and that we could provide 2000 additional jobs.""

The new Amazon facility is hiring for 2200 full- and part-time jobs that start at $17.55 an hour the company said in a statement.

In Stockton 7550 people currently hold logistics jobs Wright said. And as of July Amazon employs between 8900 and 10400 people in the county according to the San Joaquin Partnership.

These jobs have gained a reputation as being tough work. On Wednesday Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law barring large retailers such as Amazon from firing workers for missing quotas that interfere with breaks the AP reported.

But warehouse jobs have advantages too: the average warehousing and storage worker made $990 per week in 2020 while the average food and beverage service worker made $410 per week according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

More:County has second-highest concentration of transportation warehouse jobs

Amazon warehouse jobs can also be a good way for first-time job seekers to establish work histories because they do not require résumés Thomas Pogue director of the Center for Business and Policy Research said.

Amazon recently announced plans to expand its Upskilling programs which provide workers education and skills training to ""help them secure new high-growth jobs.""

“The City of Stockton is looking to attract companies that hire (for) a variety of opportunities whether that be entry-level or more advanced or management"" Wright said. ""So we always want to look to have a balance.”

It is a very humbling experience for both of us ... This award was a very pleasant surprise to us” Shashi said.

Dr. Amrit and Shashi Chadha have been loyal supporters of the college for many years and have made significant financial contributions. They established the B. R. and R. R. Chadha Memorial Scholarship to support students majoring in psychology or health technologies they assisted in establishing at least three other endowed scholarships and they support students with disabilities through a separate Springfield Foundation scholarship.

Shashi said the two feel strongly about the education for young people.

“It is one important step for changing the lives of people and ultimately changing the world for the better. We are also aware that some students lack the opportunity for pursuing their education and educational goals for lots of reasons mostly for financial hardships” she said. “We were fortunate to be able to start an endowment fund for scholarships in memory of Dr. Chadha’s parents.”

Dr. Amrit is a physician and neurologist for the Rocking Horse Community Health Center. Before he retired last year he was a neurologist in Springfield for 45 years. He did his post-graduate studies in internal medicine in India and completed his residency in neurology in State University of New York at Buffalo New York.

Shashi who has her master’s in psychology has been an adjunct faculty member of the college since 1977 and has served on the Foundation Board of Directors for over 11 years. Over the years she has taught general psychology abnormal psychology interpersonal communications and regional studies of India.

“The Clark State Foundation is grateful for the Chadhas’ generous support of our students. In addition to their scholarship the Chadhas have generously supported other healthcare program initiatives and our Major Gifts Campaign. The give of their time and generously provide resources to support Clark State’s mission and the Springfield community” said Toni Overholser Director of the Foundation.

In the run-up to the general election on September 26 all parties have committed to this goal with the hard-right Alternative für Deutschland the only exception. One key element in this program lies in the automotive sector Germany’s key domestic industry. The auto companies and their suppliers haven’t called for climate protection — in fact they aren’t too happy about the mooted changes. Their business model is mostly based on the resource- and energy-intensive manufacturing of diesel and gasoline vehicles which run on fossil fuels. Instead it’s mainly been start-ups such as StreetScooter — a firm which makes the cars for the German postal service — that have specialized in electro-mobility thus occupying the economic niche of “sustainable mobility solutions.” Nonetheless today the German state aims for the total transformation of both auto production and the vehicles it churns out in order to make them CO 2 -efficient and ultimately carbon-neutral. The problem is this industry is supposed to make these changes out of its own business interests but the new technology isn’t yet profitable for private firms. The current German government’s Climate Action Programme 2030 clearly identifies the old fossil-fuel-centric technology as a model that’s about to be phased out. As it puts it The heart of the climate protection program is the new CO 2 pricing system for transport and heating from 2021 with the costs borne by the fuel trade: when companies sell heating oil liquid gas natural gas coal gasoline or diesel they will require a certificate as a “pollution right” for each ton of CO 2 that the substances will cause in consumption. For capital to accept measures to green the industry the electric motor first has to become profitable. That’s where the state comes in. From the production of the pistons at MAHLE GmbH to the manufacture of transmission belts at the Daimler plant in Romania to the diesel engine itself the entire value chain of the German car has so far been based on the cost-effective use of both state-owned and private infrastructure to supply cheap fossil fuel. This is also why the change to electric cars could have such dramatic consequences: huge parts of the German auto industry are in danger of losing their international competitiveness because of a politically motivated change. Hence why auto firms are complaining — and invoking the 1 million jobs in the sector. This in turn calls for political support for their interests — easing the transition for big private firms. From this perspective the previous “dirty” business of the car industry should not simply be banned; rather the state ought to provide the necessary funding for the change to “clean” technologies. For capital to accept measures to green the industry the electric motor first has to become profitable. And again that’s where the state comes in — making these profit opportunities for private firms a reality through comprehensive public intervention.

A Helping Hand For that to happen it would first require a great deal of credit being poured into research and development by the state. After all the necessary products and technologies still have to be developed to market maturity — or even still need inventing. Currently the main focus is hydrogen production and its use. The knowledge thus achieved will then be made available to the entire German business community and the private investment that follows will be subsidized so that the new technologies can be put to use. In auto-related industries this currently applies especially to battery and accumulator production. Daimler and Bosch already withdrew from this sector years ago because Asian manufacturers enjoyed a competitive advantage. But now the German state’s insistence on a value chain “made in Europe” is making companies recalculate their options buoyed by increased subsidies. Second is the German state’s intervention as a legal authority. It is raising the price of CO 2 -heavy production to make low-emission autos more attractive. And it is also subsidizing the new technologies directly. Third the state is currently in the process changing Germany’s automobile infrastructure over to electric charging stations in order to make the electric car a viable alternative to its fossil-based predecessor. Here too the state’s direct measures are directed at opening up business for capital where it has not been profitable so far because of the lack of electric cars on German roads. Again a look at the Climate Action Programme 2030 shows how the state seeks to generate the capitalist interest that it expects from its companies: The ramping-up of electro-mobility changes the demands on the distribution networks especially when peaks occur due to simultaneous charging. For this reason the German government will create good framework conditions to enable distribution network operators to invest in the intelligence and controllability of the networks and to expand their network with foresight so that the distribution network can also supply the targeted number of e-vehicles with high quality. Finally the state is also subsidizing electric car purchases directly via bonuses to private consumers and companies thus ensuring a sales guarantee so that German capital can earn its profits as securely as possible when it does invest in the new technologies. The whole program is supplemented by the conversion of massive company vehicle fleets to electric and hybrid cars.

Energy Sovereignty Germany has always depended on other nations to satisfy its energy needs. This is also why the combustion engine has long been a subject of suspicion: “our” oil is situated in the wrong countries. Initially Germany relied on self-produced nuclear power in order to preserve its energy sovereignty in an American-dominated world market for electricity and fossil fuels; but since the Fukushima disaster this has been replaced by the “green electricity” project. Foreign minister Heiko Maas put it in plain terms back in 2019: The energy turnaround is not only the switch from fossil to renewable energy — it also shifts basic political constants. By using renewable energies states can put themselves in a position to increase their own energy security. As a result the geopolitical instrument of energy as we have known it for decades is losing its power. Energy-producing countries can pursue their strategic and foreign policy interests independently. Green energy is thus a step further in Germany’s emancipation from its big brother in the bid to become a sovereign world power itself — not only operating successfully in the American-dominated world market but dictating the rules itself. For “fossil energies” as Maas could hardly have put it more bluntly contain a geopolitical side that Germany is now mounting an offensive over. In this sense the carbon-neutral future — and as part of this the CO 2 -free automotive industry — is a project for German imperialism helping it pursue its interests as an independent global power. The carbon-neutral future — and as part of this the CO 2 -free automotive industry — is a project for German imperialism helping it pursue its interests as an independent global power. For this emancipation of German capitalism from the American energy market and the implementation of electro-mobility to be possible China — one of the economic powers that now dominates the international scene — must play a double role. First as an indispensable partner for German manufacturers the Chinese auto market has long been one of the most profitable in the world and the Chinese Communist Party’s current support for electro-mobility ensures secure sales figures for German cars. In addition China is pushing back against US dominance and relying on green technologies for its independence. Second this makes China a competitor since carbon-neutral production in capitalist society exists only as a project of rival states each of them trying to pursue their own success at the expense of the others. The German car companies that have been let into the country en masse have paid for their management of the huge domestic market by entering joint ventures with Chinese companies that have long since created a competitive Asian car industry. But China is also working to reverse the terms of its past relation with German capital. Aiways Automobiles Company Ltd a young company based in Shanghai now exports Chinese electric cars to Germany. Businessmen Fu Qiang and Gu Feng have already gained experience as managers in the automotive industry including with the Chinese FAW Group in which Volkswagen AG also has a stake. Employees of the company have reportedly been poached by Audi BMW and Daimler among others.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2ZvcnVtcy5tYWNydW1vcnMuY29tL3RocmVhZHMvaS1hbS1icmluZ2luZy1teS1tYWMtcHJvLTIwMTMtZnJvbS10aGUtdXMtdG8tZXVyb3BlLXdoYXQtZG8taS1uZWVkLXRvLWNvbnNpZGVyLXZvbHRhZ2Utd2lzZS4yMzEzNDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I am bringing my Mac Pro 2013 from the US to Europe — what do I need to consider voltage wise?,"chscag said:

American Express would construct a roughly 50000-square-foot three floor expansion building adjacent to the New Terminal A building. The first two floors would be subleased back to the Port Authority for other uses such as concessions (22000 feet “for subletting by the Port Authority and the remaining 10000 square feet would be required to support the operation of the NTA Expansion” including core/circulation and support space).

It would include an 18000 square foot lounge on the third floor of the three level building.

The lease would commence January 1 2022 for a 15 year term with a 5 year option to extend.

The lounge can be expected to open around August 1 2023 – since rent payments commence on the earlier of that date or lounge opening.

Total rent payments total $121.5 million over the 15 year lease plus a percentage of gross revenue (though there aren’t generally sales associated with Amex lounges) and construction of the building is estimated at $100 million (only one floor of which will be the lounge).

Amenities are expected to include

a “viewing terrace overlooking the EWR airfield Port of Newark New York and Newark Harbor and the Manhattan skyline”

“multiple signature Amex food and bar areas”

“a piano lounge” as well as “a Jersey jazz-themed bar” and “a speakeasy-themed backstage cocktail lounge.”

“wellness rooms workstations and world-class restroom facilities.”

Unless there are significant challenges or revelations over the next few days this should be approved.

The new terminal A will initially be home to 12 United Airlines gates where narrowbody operations are supposed to commence next year. The remaining gates will be assigned to “Air Canada American Airlines Delta Air Lines and JetBlue and United.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbG95YWx0eWxvYmJ5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzI2L3JlYWRlci1lbWFpbC1wcm9ibGVtcy13aXRoLWhpbHRvbi1naWZ0LWNhcmRzLWlzc3VlZC1ieS1hbWV4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reader Email: Problems With Hilton Gift Cards Issued By Amex?,"A LoyaltyLobby reader sent us an email about an issue with Hilton gift cards that use the American Express network and are issued by Amex.

Here’s the email from the reader:

I have a Hilton Gift card (issued by AMEX with AMEX card number standards). I have had issues using it at several Hilton hotels in the past four years that I’ve had this gift card. Sometimes I can just simply pay with it by sliding it in the card reader and it charges their system as an AMEX. Sometimes it won’t work and they try to enter it manually and it will decline. Long story short – I’ve had more Hilton hotels unable to process it than I care to count. Of all places an old Hampton Inn in Mississippi was able to process it just fine. The lady told me that most front desk agents forget to “remove the temporary hold which is why this card won’t allow you to charge it. You need to make sure at check-out that only the total amount is entered by the agent and not the hold. In some systems they need to choose gift card or certificate to process payment.” Well I have tried to explain this and it still won’t work. Last week I stayed at the Doubletree Lisbon. At check out the card was declined twice. I ended up paying with my own VISA card and then contacted the hotel via email and explained how they need to process it. They offered me to call in with the number. On the phone they tried again twice to no avail. The card itself is fine has a positive balance on it and I have checked it several times online. When I contact Hilton customer service they always refer me to the “number on the back of the card.” When you call that number it goes to the generic AMEX gift card hotline which goes to a foreign call center and they usually just read a script telling me that “restaurants may hold 20% on this card for tip.” Essentially none of them can differentiate the Hilton card vs other generic AMEX gift cards. I’m just curious if you’ve had or heard of this problem in the past. I have a decent chunk in my card that I’d like to use….

Here’s how Hilton sells these:

Hilton claims that these can be used at ALL hotels and resorts within their portfolio. Additionally there is a note on the T&Cs that these can be used at all hotels that accept American Express cards.

I believe that the problem is that hotels that cannot process a payment using these gift cards are not correctly programmed at the system that accepts or declines charges coming from them.

As these cards can only be used at Hilton-affiliated hotels although they use the Amex network the system that accepts the incoming charge must be aware that the merchant is an affiliated hotel. The problem is that the name these hotels are under with banks often has very little to do with the hotel’s name.

Unfortunately Hilton appears not to OWN the issue even when these cards carry their name. Last week I was in touch with the Hilton spokesperson about the problem surrounding these cards but they had not returned to us by the time this article was published.

Conclusion

As the reader I have had similar issues with IHG Rewards prepaid Mastercard debit cards that you can redeem using your points. I would say that it is roughly fifty-fifty chance whether the hotel’s system accepts or declines them. It is not much better with Marriott that uses a separate system to redeem their gift cards. Be prepared for very lengthy checkouts and utter confusion with front desk clerks.

As the reader correctly notes you must use another form of payment to guarantee the stay at the time of checking in and then settle the folio charges to the gift card at the time of checking out.

If these hotel companies continue to offer gift cards they should ensure that it is not a PITA to use them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL3RoZS1hc2NlbnQvY3JlZGl0LWNhcmRzL2FydGljbGVzLzUtdGhpbmdzLXRvLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtdXNpbmcteW91ci1jcmVkaXQtY2FyZHMtb3ZlcnNlYXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Things to Know About Using Your Credit Cards Overseas,"Using credit cards abroad isn't quite the same as using them at home.

If you're planning a big trip overseas one important item to sort out is how you'll pay for purchases. You might figure you can just bring your credit cards along and use them as you would in the United States.

You can do that -- and in fact a credit card is a smart way to pay since you don't need to carry much cash. But there are some problems and additional expenses you can run into if you aren't prepared.

1. Some credit cards charge foreign transaction fees so bring one that doesn't

A foreign transaction fee is a fee for purchases made with international merchants. The standard amount is 3%. With a card that charges that much you'd pay an extra $30 on top of every $1000 in spending abroad.

Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards

Fortunately there are plenty of credit cards with no foreign transaction fees. Travel rewards credit cards generally don't charge them and even some cash back cards don't have this type of fee.

Before you travel outside the country check if your credit cards have foreign transaction fees. If you don't have a card without this fee it's worth applying for one to save money.

2. You may need to notify your credit card issuer you're traveling

Some credit card issuers allow cardholders to set up travel alerts to let the card issuer know where you're going. That way when you start making purchases in another country they don't look like potential credit card fraud and get blocked.

Several major card issuers including Chase and American Express have phased out travel alerts in recent years. You might find that you don't need to create a travel alert with your credit card. However there are still many card issuers that use travel alerts. It's best to check in case yours does.

3. Visa and Mastercard are the most widely accepted card networks

There are four credit card payment networks: Visa Mastercard Discover and American Express. You can see which network a credit card belongs to by looking at the logo on the bottom-right corner of the card. In the United States all four networks are widely accepted. Most merchants that accept credit cards accept cards from all networks. That isn't always true overseas.

In terms of international acceptance Visa and Mastercard are the best credit cards to have. Discover and American Express are working on wider acceptance abroad but they're lagging behind.

4. Don't let the merchant convert the transaction to dollars

Some businesses abroad ask if you want to pay in the local currency or U.S. dollars. If you choose dollars the merchant uses a feature called dynamic currency conversion to change the currency of the transaction.

This may seem convenient and help you keep track of expenses but it's a bad deal. The merchant gets an exchange rate that's favorable to them. As the customer you get the short end of the stick and you may also get charged a fee for using the service.

It's always better to pay in the local currency. You get a much better exchange rate by letting your credit card issuer handle the currency conversion.

5. Many international merchants don't accept credit cards

Credit card acceptance is the norm in the United States but it varies in other places. In general big businesses usually accept credit cards. And in major cities credit card acceptance tends to be high among merchants of all sizes. In small and mid-sized cities it can be hit or miss. You may find that many businesses only accept cash and their own country's debit cards.

Carry some of the local currency with you just in case you need it. It's also a good idea to check online regarding credit card acceptance in the country you're visiting.

No one wants to have a credit card get declined on vacation or to come home to a bill full of extra fees. Now that you know more about using credit cards overseas you can navigate your international trip without surprise issues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YXJwcmVzcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIxLzA5LzI1L2FyZWEtcm91bmR1cC1qZW5uaWUtZGV2b2UtcGVyZm9ybS1jb3JuZXJzdG9uZS81ODQzNTMzMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Area roundup: Jennie DeVoe to perform at Cornerstone,"FROM NEWS REPORTS

Gotytom Gebreslase (ETI) wins the women’s race in 2:20.09 hours.

BMW BERLIN-MARATHON returns to the streets of the German capital as the world’s largest marathon since the start of the pandemic.

Title and automobile partner provides 55 vehicles – led by the zero-emission “Official Lead Car” the BMW i4*.

After long months of not being able to be held the fastest 42 kilometres on the international running calendar can finally get underway for the 47th time in the German capital. Ethiopians Adola and Gebreslase triumphed at the tenth staging of the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON with BMW as title partner. Bernhard Kuhnt BMW Group Senior Vice President Market Germany and BMW Brand Ambassador Lena Gercke gave the starting signal for the 25 000 athletes including 200 employees of the BMW Group.

“Congratulations to Guye Adola and Gotytom Gebreslase on their outstanding performances – but also to the entire running community who were finally able to take on and conquer the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON again. We are also delighted that we could all celebrate the 10th anniversary of BMW as title partner together” said Bernhard Kuhnt BMW Group Senior Vice President Market Germany. “We would like to thank the many volunteers as well as our partner SCC EVENTS for once again organising an outstanding sporting event and developing an excellent hygiene concept to ensure the safety and health of all involved.”

Thirty-year-old Adola who was runner-up in Berlin four years ago took victory ahead of Kenya’s Bethwel Yegon who crossed the finish line at the Brandenburg Gate after 2:06.14 hours of running. There was disappointment for Kenenisa Bekele. The Ethiopian superstar had to settle for third place (2:06.47) after a failed attempt to break the world record of Eliud Kipchoge (KEN) who set a stunning time of 2:01.39 hours at the 2018 BMW BERIN-MARATHON. In late-summer weather with temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius in the latter stages of the elite race there was no chance of a new record this time.

It was a top-class debut from Gotytom Gebreslase who surprised the favourites to take victory in a time of 2:20.09 hours. This is the third-fastest time in the world this year. Second place went to Hiwot Gebrekidan in 2:21.23 followed by Helen Tola (2:23.05) who crossed the finish line third to make it an all-Ethiopian top three.

The innovative and successful efforts of the BMW Group to implement the mobility of the future were again a leading feature of this year’s BMW BERLIN-MARATHON. The full range of all-electric models from the BMW Group were involved as lead cars and safety cars: the technology flagship BMW iX* the first all-electric BMW i4 Gran Coupé* the Sports Activity Vehicle BMW iX3* and the BMW i3s* whose predecessors have been on the market since 2013."

And yet the war grinds on.

As Mr. Biden drew the curtain on Afghanistan the C.I.A. was quietly expanding a secret base deep in the Sahara from which it runs drone flights to monitor Al Qaeda and Islamic State militants in Libya as well as extremists in Niger Chad and Mali. The military’s Africa Command resumed drone strikes against the Shabab a Qaeda-linked group in Somalia. The Pentagon is weighing whether to send dozens of Special Forces trainers back into Somalia to help local troops fight the militants.

Even in Kabul itself a fiery drone strike on men believed to be Islamic State plotters targeting the airport portended a future of military operations there. The attack which the Pentagon called a “righteous strike” to avert another deadly suicide bombing showcased America’s “over the horizon” abilities to use a phrase favored by Mr. Biden.

Here's what it means to be Afro-Latino in America,"CNN —

Joel Alvarado was 6 years old when his mother pulled him aside and asked him to be discreet as he was getting ready to meet his grandmother in Puerto Rico.

“She made me aware that my grandmother was much darker than my other relatives especially from her side of the family and she didn’t want me to say anything out of turn or something about her skin color” said Alvarado 50 the executive vice president of the Atlanta-based government relations firm Ohio River South.

“These are my blood relatives what does that make me?” he recalls thinking.

At that moment Alvarado learned that his grandmother and himself were Black Latinos or Afro-Latinos a group that historically has faced prejudice within Latino communities in the United States and abroad.

In the last decade the number of people across the US who identify as Black and Hispanic has increased 11.6% according to a CNN analysis of census data. The national debate around race along with a growing trend of young Black Latinos embracing their roots in a way that older generations may have not are some of the factors behind the uptick experts say.

African roots in Latin America can be traced to the 1500s when the majority of enslaved Africans brought to the Americas landed in the Caribbean. Intermingling between Africans indigenous people and the European Spaniards over generations occurred as a result of the slave trade.

The term traces to the 1970s when Black activists in Brazil sparked a social political movement to fight for recognition in the country’s census because Brazil – at the time – did not recognize its Black citizens in the census said Solsiree Del Moral a professor at Amherst College who studies Latin America and the Caribbean modern history.

Ultimately defining what it means to be Afro-Latino is personal and can be subjective multiple scholars and Afro-Latinos told CNN. They have dark and lighter skin they are fully bilingual or only speak some Spanish and their families are linked to more than a dozen countries. The term acknowledges that Black Latinos face different struggles than other Latinos especially those with lighter skin experts say.

In the 2020 census more than 1.3 million people identified as Black and Hispanic compared to 1.2 million in 2010 census data shows. Mark Hugo Lopez director of race and ethnicity research at the Pew Research Center said it is hard to pinpoint exactly what led to the increase.

“It may be because of a change in the census form and the way the responses are coded” Lopez said. “It may be people becoming more aware of their identity because of things like DNA tests and so forth and it may be because of the way in which US society has discussed and engaged with issues around race and racial equality over the last 10 years.”

Many believe the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and its aftermath led to the rise of acceptance in Afro-Latino identity but Lopez said the increase was a culmination of years of protests anger and political polarization that took place long before Floyd’s death.

You don’t have to choose between being Black and Latino

Growing up Alvarado told others that he was Black. He says it took him years to understand he could equally claim both African and Latin American roots simultaneously.

“I felt like the world was telling me ‘you can either be Black or Latino but you couldn’t be both’ and I didn’t know how to explain being both” he said.

The Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn where he grew up was very diverse he said but his lack of fluency in Spanish created a self-imposed pressure to figure out how he could immerse himself in the Latino community.

Joel Alvarado 50 told CNN attending Morehouse College in Atlanta and studying history helped him fully understand why he should identify as an Afro-Latino man. courtesy Joel Alvarado

“I would ask myself ‘am I fully accepted? Do Latinos see me as fully Latino or do they just tolerate me?”’ Alvarado said adding that no one ever did anything to him to make him feel this way.

Morehouse College a historically Black all-male university in Atlanta offered Alvarado a chance to understand his identity he said. As a student all but one of his peers saw him as a Black man he recalls.

“When I came to Morehouse in ’91 there was no ‘oh Joel’s from Puerto Rico.’ Everybody just saw me and said ‘that’s a light-skin Black dude’” he said.

As a history major at Morehouse Alvarado researched the transatlantic slave trade as well the expansive history of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. Later he discovered there were Puerto Ricans on Morehouse’s dive team in the 1950s so both parts of his identity had a place at his school.

Delving into that history helped him understand who he was as an Afro-Latino and it gave him a newfound ability to define and vocalize his identity.

“You can be Latino and Black and that doesn’t take away from one or the other and they shouldn’t have to make you choose between one or the other you can be both because they’re both representative of who you are as a human being” Alvarado said.

Racism and discrimination is keeping some from identifying as Afro-Latino

Nydia Guity remembers people calling her “esa morena” in a disparaging tone. The Spanish phrase translates to “that Black Girl.”

Guity 34 was born and raised in the Bronx to Honduran immigrants. She was one of a few Black students – and one of the few darker skinned students – in her elementary school bilingual class. She recalled Spanish-speakers saying “dehumanizing and disgusting” things about Black people around her because they assumed she wouldn’t understand.

But once it was known she understood Spanish she said “people suddenly felt comfortable to share things about Blackness in my presence that for me are super offensive. It’s like ‘you do know that I’m Black right?’”

Unlike Alvarado who was also teased as a child for his racial ambiguity but ultimately came to embrace his full Afro-Latino identity Guity said she’s exhausted of having to explain to people why she can speak Spanish fluently. For her saying she’s Afro-Latina erases her Blackness.

“I’m not any less Black because I speak Spanish” she said.

Nydia Guity 34 became so exhausted from her experiences with racism and colorism that she does not identify as Afro-Latina. courtesy Nydia Guity

Instead of calling herself Afro Latina Guity says she prefers to identify with the African subculture within Honduras called Garifuna. These are the descendants of people from the Caribbean island of St. Vincent who were exiled from the island and relocated to Central American countries like Honduras Nicaragua and Belize.

Carlos Olave head of the Hispanic Reading Room at the Library of Congress and María Peña a spokeswoman for the Library of Congress said colorism runs deep in the Spanish language. One example of that is the phrase “mejorar la raza” which means to improve the race.

“In the popular culture there’s still that belief – whether it’s subconscious or not – that if you marry someone lighter than you you have a better chance for upward mobility” Peña said adding there are certain parts of Latin America where social mobility depends on the complexion of a person’s skin.

A 2019 Pew Research survey highlighted how darker skin color is associated with more frequent experiences of discrimination among Latinos including people questioning their intelligence being the subject of jokes and unfair treatment from police.

“Darker-skinned Latinos were more likely across every single discrimination experience we asked about to say that had happened to them in the year before the survey than lighter-skinned Latinos” said Lopez the director of race and ethnicity research at the Pew Research Center.

In Puerto Rico many Latinos struggle to see themselves as Black or of African descent because they link it to slavery racism and racial violence and many identified as White in the census for decades said Bárbara Abadía-Rexach a Latina/Latino studies professor at San Francisco State University.

After more than 75% of people in Puerto Rico identified as White in the 2010 survey Colectivo Ilé an anti-racism group of educators and organizers launched a campaign to encourage citizens to self-identify as Black or more than one race in the 2020 survey.

Abadía-Rexach who was part of the campaign said she encountered many people on the island who said they didn’t have to answer the race question because they could write in “Puerto Rican” on the census question about Hispanic and Latino origin.

Puerto Rico was one of the places where the most pronounced growth of multiracial population was reported in the 2020 census. Only 17% of the population chose White as the only racial category while more than half said they were more than one race.

Olave and other experts said there are Latinos who no matter their complexion don’t acknowledge their African roots and have a hard time choosing a race.

“I’m not Black I’m …” Dominican Puerto Rican Colombian or any country of origin is common because some people identify more with their experience rather than their race Olave said.

In the 2010 census 94% of the US population chose at least one of the five standard government-defined racial categories – White Black Asian American Indian or Pacific Islander. But among those who identified as Hispanic 63% selected at least one of these categories compared to 37% who chose “some other race.”

Many respondents offered write-in responses such as “Mexican” Hispanic” or “Latin American” according to the Census Bureau.

While some use the term Afro-Latino to merely reclaim their roots Abadía-Rexach said the term should also be used to challenge the anti-Black attitudes within Latinx communities in the US and abroad.

“People should answer the race question in a political way how you see yourself but also how you are treated” said Abadía-Rexach adding that she asserts her identity as a Black woman as a means of making a political statement.

There’s a stark difference in generational views of Afro-Latino identity

Growing up Erica-Antoinette Castillo Slaton 40 said she always felt like she was “other.” Outside she was a Black American but at home she was the daughter of immigrant parents from Belize and Honduras.

It wasn’t until she turned 18 and left for college that she embraced how different she was starting with changing the pronunciation of her (maiden) last name.

What was formerly pronounced in English as Castillo – the double L sounds like “jello” – transformed into the Spanish pronunciation Castillo where the double L sounds like a “Y” like the word “pollo” or chicken in Spanish.

“I decided to no longer assimilate but to provide it as is in terms of who I was” Slaton said. Her parents were more concerned with working and supporting their children she said than how their name was pronounced.

Changing the pronunciation of her last name led Slaton to eventually see herself as an Afro-Latina woman something that was unfamiliar to her parents. Slaton said neither of her parents identify as Afro-Latino even though they could be considered such by definition of their racial and ethnic background.

Her mother identifies as Belizean Honduran and Garifuna but has never been in a space to consider whether she was Afro-Latina Slaton said. Her father identifies as Belizean and Garifuna.

“I think people have the freedom and the right to identify with what they want and it doesn’t have to look a certain way to those of us on the outside” Slaton said.

While most of the adults who spoke to CNN came to terms with their racial and ethnic identity at a much later age 16-year-old Nation Shabazz Alvarado is well aware of his diverse heritage.

Unlike his father Joel Alvarado Nation learned at a fairly young age that his father was a darker-skinned Afro-Latino man from Puerto Rico and his mother was a biracial woman – Black and White – from Alabama.

“It’s confusing for anybody to understand it – especially someone who’s younger – by themselves luckily I have parents who kind of know this” Nation said. “They showed me – especially at a younger age – who I am and what I am. That really helped me in the long run knowing where I fit and knowing who I am.”

When Nation heard the story about his father meeting his grandmother for the first time he says it confused him and made him wonder what stopped his relatives from showing Alvarado “who he really was” at a younger age. Now he understands that his grandparents and parents lived during a time where racism colorism and segregation were more prevalent in both the US and Latin America.

“Racism in itself is like a virus. It’s spread until eventually there is antibiotic that takes it out. The antibiotic is the new generation that’s coming in” Nation said.

“There’s a lot more people like me coming into the world” he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbGNpdGl6ZW4ub3JnL2VuL2NvbnRlbnQvZ2xvYmFsLWNpdGl6ZW4tbGl2ZS1pbXBhY3QtcmVwb3J0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Global Citizen Live Calls for Action to Halt Climate Change and for Wealthy Countries to Deliver on $100B Climate ...,"The Global Citizen campaign to defend the planet and defeat poverty marked a major milestone at Global Citizen’s 24-hour global broadcast Global Citizen Live on Sept. 25 during which key commitments were announced through the hard work of many partner organizations.

Global Citizen Live represents a call to action to end extreme poverty and build momentum ahead of the G20 Summit in October and UN Climate Conference COP26 in November.

The campaign calls on world leaders businesses and philanthropists to urgently commit resources to: meet the $15-20 billion funding shortfall of the $100 billion promised annually to the most vulnerable countries confronting climate change; businesses to help curb emissions through joining the Race to Zero campaign and pledging 1 billion additional trees by 2022 in support of the 1t.org ambition to conserve restore and grow 1 trillion trees this decade; $6 billion to provide food to 41 million people facing famine; 2 billion COVID-19 vaccines to be redistributed to low-income countries by early 2022; and for Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna to share mRNA technology with the WHO-backed Africa mRNA vaccine hub.

More than US$1.1 billion 157 million trees and over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines were announced during Global Citizen Live thanks to partnerships between government philanthropy non-governmental organizations and the private sector.

Global Citizen Live featured a remarkable lineup of world leaders advocates and artists supporting the campaign and its mission to end extreme poverty. Across seven continents tens of thousands of Global Citizens were in attendance over 24 hours as millions streamed the live broadcast event globally.

As a result of the hard work of many partner organizations the Global Citizen Live campaign announced:

157 million trees including 77 million trees by 2022; and more than US$300M to defend the planet

“Quite rightly future generations will hold us responsible. So join me and with one loud and united global voice call on the biggest greenhouse gas emitters — the G20 group of nations — to make much bolder commitments to cut emissions"" COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma told the audience during the New York event. “Call on the richest countries to make good on their promise of money to support developing countries deal with the impacts of climate change and call on world leaders to deliver an outcome at Glasgow we can all be proud of.”

Over US$800 million to defeat poverty and address hunger crises.

“Shame on us. At the height of COVID-19 the billionaires’ average net worth increase per day was $5 billion. And yet I am begging to feed the poor! Shame on us ... If we do not act today millions will starve nations will destabilize and millions will migrate by necessity"" said World Food Programme Executive Director David Beasley. ""If we are struggling today with a population of over 7 billion what do you expect will happen when there are over 10 billion people on earth by 2050? And by 2050 due to climate change we anticipate over 1 billion people to be displaced around the world! Wake up New York. Wake up Planet Earth.""

Over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines for those most in need.

“We have what we need to vaccinate the world. But the experts told us here’s what’s getting in the way: They said many countries are ready to produce vaccines at home. Yet they aren’t allowed to because ultra-wealthy pharmaceutical companies are not sharing the recipes to make them. These countries have the means ability and the workers to start manufacturing. All they are waiting for is the vaccine intellectual property to be transferred over” said Prince Harry The Duke of Sussex during the New York show.

“Every single person on this planet has a fundamental right to get this vaccine. That’s the point — yet that’s not happening. While in this country (and many others) you can go almost anywhere and get vaccinated billions around the world cannot. This year the world is expected to produce enough doses to meet the target of vaccinating 70% of people in every single country. But it is wrong that so much of the vaccine supply has only gone to just 10 wealthy nations so far and not everyone else” said Meghan The Duchess of Sussex.

Announcements were made by the European Commission the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) Belgium Colombia Croatia the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) France Germany Ireland Luxembourg the Netherlands Norway Spain United States UNESCO the Green Climate Fund and the Paris Peace Forum.

Global Citizen Live also saw announcements from the US states of Hawaii and Washington; the Brazilian states of Amapá Amazonas Ceará Piauí Pará and Paraíba; the City of Paris France; the municipality of Asker Norway; and 43 cities in Maharashtra State India.

Financial and in-kind announcements were also made by many corporate and philanthropic partners including Accelerit Technologies Aspiration Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Capgemini The Charles Stewart Mott Foundation The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) Duolingo The ELMA Vaccines & Immunization Foundation Global Solidarity Fund Leaders in Motion Academy The LEGO Foundation Private Foundation Rotary International Salesforce Mastercard Namati PepsiCo The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation World Wide Technology and Zendesk.

Climate Coalition members include: Amazon Bayer AG Boston Consulting Group Capgemini Dentsu International DocuSign HP Inc. Intuit Lendlease P&G RELX Salesforce Schneider Electric Uber Unilever Walmart Inc. and Zurich Insurance Group.

Global Citizen presented Global Citizen Live a 24-hour global broadcast and streaming event featuring an extraordinary lineup of artists and performances from all over the world including: Lagos Paris New York City London Sydney Seoul Rio de Janeiro Los Angeles and Mumbai.

The 24-hour live broadcast event aired globally on ABC BBC FX iHeartRadio YouTube Twitter and other platforms to millions of viewers around the world. On-site safety and precautionary measures including mask-wearing social distancing and proof of vaccination were taken as part of all events which were attended in person by Global Citizen activists from around the world.

In the lead up to Global Citizen Live Global Citizen called on action takers to demand that the world's wealthiest nations redistribute 1 billion vaccine doses urgently this year and 1 billion more by early 2022; support the proposal to waive intellectual property rights on the production of COVID-19 vaccines and other medical tools backed by over 100 countries; and call on Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna to share mRNA technology with a new WHO-backed mRNA technology transfer hub based in South Africa.

Global Citizen also called on countries around the world to reduce fair share national emissions to prevent more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming and for developed nations to deliver on their promise to provide $100 billion annually to address the climate needs of developing countries. G7 nations and billionaires were also called on by Global Citizen and its partners to end the hunger crisis by contributing at least $6 billion for the urgent provision of millions of meals for 41 million people on the brink of famine.

Global Citizen Live represents an ongoing campaign led by citizens around the world to take action to urge governments corporations and philanthropists to make urgent change in line with the United Nations’ Global Goals and the Global Citizen Recovery Plan for the World.

“Global Citizen Live is not a celebration but an urgent call to action” said Mick Sheldrick co-founder and Chief Policy and Government Affairs Officer at Global Citizen. “We’re campaigning hard to get the world on track to end extreme poverty calling on world leaders to step-up at the G20 and COP26 summits. Global Citizen Live is the beginning of a month-long countdown!”

Global Citizen Live highlighted the efforts and announcements of 67 governments six philanthropic foundations and 40 corporate partners alongside global advocates and campaigners. Among millions of Global Citizens stood key global leaders partners and advocates at the forefront of Global Citizen’s mission to end extreme poverty: UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed Executive Director of the World Food Programme David Beasley CEO of Namati Vivek Maru Rotary President-elect Jennifer Jones Global Goals Champion and Advocate Eddie Ndopu President of the Ford Foundation Darren Walker President of the Paris Peace Forum Steering Committee Trisha Shetty Hip Hop Caucus President and CEO Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr. UN Next Generation fellow Valeria Colunga advocate Eunice Akoth and more.

“A Global Citizen is aware of the fact that we all share one planet one health one common destiny — and that every one of us matters” said Ursula von der Leyen president of the European Commission in support of the campaign. “Everyone can make a difference by working together finding global solutions to global problems with unity cooperation and solidarity.”

As leaders step up to curb emissions combat climate change and defend the planet at Global Citizen Live more ambition is needed ahead of the COP26 Climate Summit.

Global Citizen and its Race to Zero partners worked to secure commitments from many of the world’s largest companies and cities to develop verified science-based targets to reach net zero emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.

Corporate partners and cities signed up to the Race to Zero initiative a science-based campaign to drive climate targets in line with the Paris Agreement. Global Citizen Live saw 13 companies valued at $1.3 trillion in market capital join the Race to Zero initiative. New signers include five Fortune 100 companies the largest consumer goods company in the world the largest tool maker in the world and the largest hotel group in the world.

Private sector organizations that officially signed on to the Race to Zero as a part of the Global Citizen Live campaign include: Akamai Technologies American Express BD (Becton Dickinson and Company) Boston Scientific Corporation Cisco Delta Air Lines DocuSign IHG Hotels and Resorts Marriott International Inc. P&G Stanley Black & Decker and Starbucks who have each signed on to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5 and Citi which joined the Race to Zero via the Net Zero Banking Alliance.

Global Citizen also worked with existing Race to Zero members to join the campaign’s Climate Coalition aimed at encouraging peers vendors and partners to sign on to the Race to Zero ahead of COP26. Climate Coalition members include Amazon Bayer AG Boston Consulting Group Capgemini Dentsu International DocuSign HP Inc. Intuit Lendlease P&G RELX Salesforce Schneider Electric Uber Unilever Walmart Inc. and Zurich Insurance Group.

""Urgent and widespread climate action is vital to unlock the pace and scale of decarbonization required by science. Every nation company and individual must play their part. This innovative collaboration with Global Citizen has delivered additional major US businesses to our campaign for the world's most ambitious climate leaders. With just one month until the milestone climate conference COP26 we are now calling on more companies worldwide to join Business Ambition for 1.5 degrees Celsius and play their role in delivering bold climate action to halve global emissions by 2030"" said Tom Dowdall Science Based Targets Initiative Campaign Lead.

While Global Citizen has been in contact with hundreds of companies to sign on to Race to Zero many of the world’s largest companies and top emitters failed to respond to Global Citizen’s outreach after several attempts. These companies must step up to sign on to control their emissions and protect the planet now not later. Global Citizens will continue to campaign and call on these companies to join Race to Zero by COP26 in November this year.

Global Citizen also worked with American Forests and 1t.org to ensure a sustainable climate and a nature-positive planet by conserving restoring and growing trees supporting the global movement to save and restore 1 trillion trees by 2030. A total of 157 million trees will be protected and restored by 2030 including 77 million by the end of 2022.

Global Citizen Live received support from 12 members of the United States Congress calling for legislative measures to meet the goal of 100 million trees being protected conserved and planted in cities across America by 2030 including: Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) Rep. Nanette Barragán (CA-44) Rep. Donald McEachin (VA-4) Rep. Chellie Pingree (ME-1) Rep. Marcy Kaptur (OH-9) and Rep. Jimmy Panetta (CA-20).

⭕️ COVID-19 affects us all & we must unite in our response. THANK YOU @USAID 🇺🇸 & @SamanthaJPower for your commitment of $295M for COVID-19 aid as part of #GlobalCitizenLivepic.twitter.com/AO9L28cDY5 — Global Citizen Impact (@GlblCtznImpact) September 25 2021

Mayors governors and sub-national representatives also showed their support from around the world including: Lene Conradi Mayor of Asker Kommune Norway; Hilary Franz Commissioner of Public Lands Washington; David Ige Governor Hawaii; Anne Hidalgo Mayor Paris; and the Brazilian governors of Amapá (Waldez Góes) Amazonas (Wilson Miranda Lima) Ceará (Camilo Santana) Pará (Helder Barbalho) Paraíba (João Azevêdo) and Piauí (Wellington Dias).

""The protection of the wild is a major task of our generation. Global Citizens have called on leaders to take decisive steps in the right direction. We commend the Brazilian governors of Amapá Amazonas Ceará Pará Paraiba and Piauí for their commitments to environmental protection and strong climate actions"" said Rodrigo Medeiros of Re:Wild.

On Aug. 23 and in support of local advocates Coldplay invited eight Brazilian governors to join Global Citizen at Global Citizen Live in September to pledge to protect critical natural resources throughout their regions. Governors made announcements from across Brazil including six states from the Amazon at the front lines of climate change. The Brazilian states announced plans to reduce emissions increase the number of protected areas and create state-wide climate mitigation and adaptation plans.

Thank you for joining us at #GlobalCitizenLive@AminaJMohammed as we join in unity to defend the planet and defeat poverty! We greatly value our partnership with you and the @UNhttps://t.co/jc4IQFI78Dpic.twitter.com/O8rzPzLb4u — Hugh Evans (@Hughcevans) September 25 2021

This weekend’s announcements build on earlier commitments over the last 18 months as part of the Trillion Trees Campaign. Global Citizen Live celebrates the global 1t.org community for its commitment to conserve restore and grow trees including the following organizations with existing 1t.org pledges contributing to the trillion tree ambition by 2030: Amazon Aspiration AstraZeneca Clif Bar & Company HP Inc. Iberdrola Jonas Philanthropies Trees for Climate Health Initiative Nestlé Pottery Barn SAP SE tentree Travelers Unilever UPS and VMWare.

“It is inspiring to see the world’s largest companies governments and individuals of all ages unite to make ambitious commitments to protect and restore our planet. 1t.org’s collaboration with Global Citizen Live to scale investments in our trees and forests will be an integral part of the solution in tackling pressing ecological and societal challenges” said Nicole Schwab Co-Head of Nature-Based Solutions at the World Economic Forum. “Global Citizen Live shows that collective action at a global scale is possible.”

Leaders make commitments toward $100 billion climate promise but at least $15 billion shortfall remains ahead of COP26.

During UNGA leaders made commitments in support of honoring their promise to provide vulnerable countries with $100 billion annually to respond to climate change. During his UNGA address President Joe Biden announced that the US will increase its climate aid commitment to $11.4 billion by 2024. Despite being a step in the right direction this is still far less than what is contributed by the EU according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute. The G20 must keep their promise to provide an additional $100 billion annually to protect vulnerable nations from climate change. We have five weeks in order to meet this promise.

""The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how strongly the health of one person depends on the behaviour of the other. We need decisive action and solidarity both on individual and societal levels to leave the COVID-19 pandemic behind us. Today at Global Citizen Live I join Global Citizen's calls for more vaccine equity and a stronger commitment to an encompassing solution of the pandemic that is sensitive to the capacities and needs of different countries. I thank all Global Citizens for advocating and strongly supporting the work of WHO “ said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Director-General of World Health Organization.

During the Global Citizen Live campaign Italy committed to substantially increase its climate financing in the run-up to COP 26. Global Citizen will hold them accountable to this commitment.

From New York The Green Climate Fund supporting developing countries to reduce emissions and build resilience announced they would be accelerating the delivery of over $1.2 billion in the coming months.

Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez during his UNGA address and in response to a tweet from Coldplay announced €30 million for the Adaptation Fund an international fund that finances projects and programs aimed at helping developing countries to adapt to the harmful effects of climate change albeit much more is needed for Spain to meet its fair share.

Meanwhile both Denmark and Norway affirmed their commitments to significantly increase their climate financing commitments said Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen declaring:

“Denmark will contribute 1% of the collective target of $100 billion. And 60% of our climate aid will help developing countries adapt to climate change. If we can — G20 can! Let’s send a message to the G20 that cannot be misunderstood: Do not come empty-handed to Glasgow” said Frederiksen.

CODE RED. It’s no secret that the climate crisis is here & it’s a massive threat to our planet. The US has an opportunity to lead the world to a sustainable future. It starts with the #BuildBackBetter act. Join me alongside @GlblCtzn to take action to support. #CodeRedCongresspic.twitter.com/mRPVqeUJOt — Rachel Brosnahan (@RachelBros) September 24 2021

Global Citizen believes that Austria Australia Portugal Spain and Italy should also increase their contributions toward meeting the $100 billion pledge. We are grateful to ODI and Sarah Colenbrander for their analysis and support through the Global Citizen Live campaign. Global Citizen is urging US citizens to contact their local member of congress. The United States must live up to its promise.

Global Citizen Live calls code red for Congress and urges the United States Congress to pass most consequential climate legislation in US history.

“We have the chance to make history soon when Congress could pass essential climate legislation through the Build Back Better Act... We need a true groundswell of public support to show Congress that this critical legislation must pass without getting watered down” said Hip Hop Caucus President and CEO Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr.

Over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines pledged at Global Citizen Live in a step toward vaccine equity but too little too late as huge gap remains.

Inequitable vaccine distribution has left millions of vulnerable communities unprotected and reversed decades of progress against other infectious diseases and the broader Global Goals for Sustainable Development. To end this pandemic we must make the COVID-19 vaccines available to all everywhere. Global Citizen Live is grateful for its partnership with the ACT Accelerator the Pandemic Action Network the ONE Campaign and others in the collective effort to address vaccine inequity and injustice.

Extraordinary action is needed in the fight against COVID-19 and world leaders are uniquely positioned to enable a global recovery by ensuring everyone has access to life-saving vaccines tests and treatments. On Sept. 22 US President Biden convened world leaders to commit to vaccinate at least 70% of people in every country by this time next year to break the chain of transmission and end the pandemic. But more than promises are needed; without action the virus and its mutations will continue to threaten us all and undermine the global economy.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield took to the Global Citizen Live stage to reiterate the call for everyone to have access to COVID-19 vaccines especially vulnerable refugees whose circumstances have been further impacted by the pandemic. Global Citizen welcomes US leadership to galvanize efforts to vaccinate at least 70% of people in all countries by September 2022 but hopes to see this promise met by comprehensive action from the US. This includes sharing all excess and unused doses in hand or on order for 2021 as soon as possible providing funding and support to help lower income countries get doses from tarmac and into arms and critically by actively promoting an intellectual property waiver at the World Trade Organization and pushing pharma companies to share mRNA vaccine technology with Africa and other lower-income regions.

More than 60 million COVID-19 vaccines to be shared with countries in need were announced through Global Citizen Live. However the world must step up to redistribute a total of 2 billion vaccines by early 2022. In advance of Global Citizen Live Prime Minister Sanchez’s UNGA announced 7.5 million new vaccine doses and €2 million for UNITAID at Global Citizen Live. Taoiseach Micheál Martin confirmed 1.3 million COVID-19 vaccine doses primarily through COVAX on behalf of Ireland. This is Ireland's first dose sharing commitment to date and represents one dose for every five Irish citizens.

Croatia also stepped up announcing another 200000 COVID-19 vaccine doses primarily through COVAX following a €500000 and 50000 dose pledge to COVAX made at Global Citizen’s VAX LIVE in May.

""In the global fight against COVID-19 we need commitments to be matched with action. We thank Global Citizens for their tireless advocacy to support vaccine equity and we thank the governments of Croatia Ireland and France for their substantial vaccine donations during Global Citizen Live. This pandemic is the great public health challenge of our time and we urgently need to unlock more vaccine doses to ensure that the most vulnerable in our global village are protected. It's time for countries and manufacturers to do their part and give us the doses we need to protect people everywhere” said Dr. Seth Berkley CEO of Gavi the Vaccine Alliance.

""Only by acting internationally and united will we be able to effectively defeat the serious challenge of COVID-19 and that unity extends to all the other objectives that Spain Global Citizens and other actors defend. We all have to collaborate if we aspire to stop the climate emergency or to defeat hunger. They are enormous tasks that demand pulling all possible forces. This is why we join Global Citizen Live to commit to increase our vaccine donations to COVAX by 7.5 million and pledge financial support of €2 million for UNITAID as well as €30M for the Adaptation Fund to support the fight against climate change” said Pedro Sánchez Prime Minister of Spain.

The world unites to end poverty protect education and fight the hunger crisis at Global Citizen Live.

Forty-one million people are on the brink of famine due to the hunger pandemic reversing decades of progress on the United Nations’ Global Globals. Additionally more than 1.5 billion children have also been affected by COVID-19 school closures globally impairing the learning of marginalized children especially those living in conflict or crisis. Eradicating extreme poverty in all its forms is the greatest global challenge of our time. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this crisis pushing an additional 115 million people into extreme poverty in 2020 alone. To meet this goal Germany and the European Commission collectively announced €75 million to Education Cannot Wait IFAD announced pledges from 17 countries totalling US$23.7 million towards its critical work across the planet and a US$260 in pledges to CGIAR from Belgium Netherlands and the European commission was announced during Global Citizen Live among key pledges to combat extreme poverty.

“Hunger has tightened its grip on millions of vulnerable families around the world due to COVID-19. WFP is grateful to Global Citizen Live for raising awareness of this unprecedented crisis in an effort to mobilize global action against hunger” said David Beasley Executive Director United Nations World Food Programme.

France would release 20% of its Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) in addition to pledging 60 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to COVAX at Global Citizen Live. SDRs could be used to fund COVID-19 vaccines investment in economic recovery and access lifesaving medical treatments.

In the spirit of collaboration and solidarity government leaders showed their support for Global Citizen Live by pledging new financial and policy commitments.

THE ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS) pledged to increase its renewable energy capacity among Small Island Developing States through 2030 up to 10 megawatts taking strong actions toward a meaningful reduction of emissions. “Small Island States are disproportionately affected by the consequences of climate change. It is time that we as Global Citizens stand up and take strong actions to protect the planet. Therefore the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) pledges at Global Citizen Live to almost double its renewable energy capacity until 2030. We call on all governments to follow suit and harness renewable energy capacities. Only together we will be able to overcome the challenge of the century” said Gaston Browne Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda and chairman of AOSIS. BELGIUM announced €6 million to CGIAR a global partnership that unites international organizations engaged in research about food security and €10 million to Least Developed Country Fund. “Global Citizens have advocated for an equitable and sustainable recovery for the planet from the COVID-19 pandemic. Climate change and food security are two issues at the heart of this recovery. Therefore Belgium appreciates the opportunity to join Global Citizen's campaign and to announce commitments for CGIAR and the Least Developed Country Fund. In these challenging times Belgium is proud to demonstrate its solidarity and to take actions that support the most vulnerable” said Meryame Kitir Minister of Development Cooperation and Major Cities Policy. CROATIA pledged 200000 COVID-19 vaccine doses primarily through COVAX at Global Citizen Live. During VAX LIVE in May Croatia donated 50000 doses towards COVAX. Despite a small population Croatia is making vaccine contributions to the world’s supply. “We thank Global Citizen for its critical advocacy work to end extreme poverty by 2030 and overcome the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. We must act collectively to end this crisis. This is why Croatia pledges another 200000 COVID-19 vaccine doses to COVAX to extend the possibility of everyone to get vaccinated. This is our small contribution but it will make a puzzle complete” said Prime Minister Andrej Plenković. EUROPEAN COMMISSION announced €140 million toward CGIAR a global partnership that unites international organizations engaged in research about food security at Global Citizen Live. CGIAR research aims to reduce rural poverty increase food security improve human health and nutrition and sustainable management of natural resources. The European Commission also pledged €25 million to Education Cannot Wait. “Global challenges need a global response and responsibility. This is Global Citizen’s vision which I am proud to support. Europe is taking its responsibilities. Every single dose of coronavirus vaccine produced in Europe is shipped to the rest of the world 800 million doses so far. In addition the European Union will donate 500 million doses to the most vulnerable countries. It also commits €140 million to improve global food security and €25 million to Education Cannot Wait to support education for marginalised children around the world living through conflict and crisis” said Ursula von der Leyen President of the European Commission. FRANCE doubled their vaccine share pledge announcing that they would be sharing an additional 60 million doses on top of an already announced 60 million doses for a total of 120 million toward COVAX to be delivered by the end of Q2 2022. The country also announced they would release 20% of their SDRs. ""To succeed in the fight against the pandemic and inequalities France commits during Global Citizen Live to double the number of doses it shares in particular through COVAX from 60 to 120 million doses and to redirect 20% of the Special Drawing Rights it receives from the IMF to the African continent"" said President Emmanuel Macron.

GERMANY pledged €50 million to Education Cannot Wait to foster educational activities in the most difficult circumstances at Global Citizen Live. “We all see the dramatic crises worldwide. Children and young people suffer the most from hunger violence and lack of education. Every child has a right to education. Thus I am proud to announce today at Global Citizen Live that Germany will commit €50 million to Education Cannot Wait” said Gerd Müller Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development. Thanks to Globale Bildungskampagne and ONE Deutschland. IRELAND confirmed — following a decision of its cabinet — that it will donate 1.3 million COVID-19 vaccine doses primarily through COVAX. This is Ireland's first dose sharing commitment to date and represents 1 dose for every 5 Irish citizens. “When one of us is unwell vulnerable or at risk we all are affected. That is why I am pleased to be part of the Global Citizen campaign and to confirm that Ireland will donate 1.3 million vaccines mostly through COVAX and plans to make a further substantial donation in 2022. If COVID-19 has taught us anything it’s that we are now more than ever before deeply and intimately intertwined with each other. In that closeness there is great vulnerability but even greater strength when we work as one global community” said Mícheál Martin Taoiseach. LUXEMBOURG announced a €3.8 million commitment to UNFPA Supplies at Global Citizen Live to support women’s and girl’s reproductive health. This is Luxembourg’s largest commitment on the Global Citizen’s stage. “As Global Citizens around the world Luxembourg believes that gender equality is decisive to achieve an equitable and sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. We are proud to participate in Global Citizen Live and commit to an additional €3.8 million to UNFPA as part of our total support of €25 million. This contribution will support women and girls around the world in particular reproductive health and rights” said Xavier Bettel Prime Minister of Luxembourg. NORWAY announced the Biodiversity for Opportunities Livelihoods and Development (BOLD) fund committing US$58 million over 10 years. The project will help safeguard crop diversity in genebanks and facilitate its use by breeders smallholders and researchers to develop new crop varieties and more sustainable farming systems with particular focus on communities in lower-income countries. This is an essential first step to secure a sufficient healthy food supply for all. Norway also announced a major increase of their climate investments. “Norway is very pleased to partner with Global Citizen to announce the new Norwegian Climate Investment Fund that will help developing countries to switch from coal to clean energy. We are also increasing our funding to help poor countries adapt to a changing climate"" said Erna Solberg Prime Minister of Norway. STATE OF AMAPÁ BRAZIL announced four climate and environmental commitments at Global Citizen Live. The state pledged to consolidate collective participation in the management of protected areas to reach 0% fossil fuel energy sources in public structures and isolated areas by 2050 transform 100000 hectares of productive areas from agroforestry systems to a low-carbon production model and support traditional populations and families in humid areas and urban spaces to minimize the effects of climate change. “We appreciate that Global Citizen’s advocacy and Global Citizen Live call for more attention to environmental protection in the Amazon. These actions are decisive to tackle climate change. To demonstrate our efforts the state of Amapá commits to strengthen management of protected areas to reach 0 % fossil fuel energy sources in public structures and isolated areas by 2050 foster bio-economic activities and expand climate adaptation initiatives throughout the state. The people of Amapá are all Global Citizens as they continue to defend our planet and end extreme poverty” said Waldez Góes Governor of Amapá.

The special Tower lighting configuration coincides with the birthday of Gloria Anzaldúa who earned a Master’s degree in Education and English at UT in 1972 and returned in 1974 to earn a PhD in Literature. Anzaldúa who became an internationally recognized cultural theorist creative writer and independent scholar felt alienated by the white-dominated university during her time at UT and was also dissatisfied with both the Chicano and feminist movements. The Tower lighting on this date not only honors Anzaldúa and her legacy but also publicly reinforces the university’s commitment to bring and keep Latinx thought and work into the light continuing the work she started here 50 years ago.

“Fifty years of Latino Studies on campus is a huge achievement even for institutions as long-lived as UT Austin” Dr. Maggie Rivas-Rodriguez the director of the Center for Mexican American Studies said. “Fifty years of representing the experiences and knowledge of Mexican American and other Latino communities in Texas who had long been excluded in significant numbers from the state flagship prior to 1970. Fifty years of speaking truth to power and thereby fighting for equity inclusion and democracy. Fifty years of working for the success of all students but especially Latinx students for whom Latino Studies has been a cultural oasis and a space of affirmation. Put differently the presence of Latino Studies means that Latinx communities truly matter in the University’s business of knowledge production.”

Since its launch in 1970 the Center for Mexican American Studies at UT Austin has evolved. CMAS now has two sister units: the Department of Mexican American and Latino Studies (MALS) and the Latino Research Institute (LRI). All three units make up Latino Studies.

Over the course of fifty years Latino Studies has grown from a student initiative into a powerhouse of Latino thought and advocacy at The University of Texas at Austin fearlessly upholding the mission of ethnic studies by creating space to explore and understand the lives of Latinos in the U.S. Together all three units are fiercely committed to the empowerment of students scholars and communities for the purpose of realizing a just and affirmative future for all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRzLWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvdmlzdWFsLWFydHMvMjAyMS8wOS8yNi90ZW4teWVhcnMtbGF0ZXItdGhlLWdsYXJlLWZyb20tbXVzZXVtLXRvd2VyLWNvbnRpbnVlcy10by1iZWRldmlsLXRoZS1uYXNoZXItc2N1bHB0dXJlLWNlbnRlci_SAbEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0cy1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3Zpc3VhbC1hcnRzLzIwMjEvMDkvMjYvdGVuLXllYXJzLWxhdGVyLXRoZS1nbGFyZS1mcm9tLW11c2V1bS10b3dlci1jb250aW51ZXMtdG8tYmVkZXZpbC10aGUtbmFzaGVyLXNjdWxwdHVyZS1jZW50ZXIvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ten years later ‘The Glare’ from Museum Tower continues to bedevil the Nasher Sculpture Center,"It revealed itself with a white-hot intensity on Sept. 26 2011. No one knew what it was — how it got there or where it came from. But all of those answers soon revealed themselves giving The Glare as it came to be known a permanent place in Dallas history.

The Glare is still there but a decade later — the 10th anniversary of this infamous discovery is Sunday — Dallas continues to be amazed by its force and power and the casualties left in its wake.

The Glare is not an invention of Stephen King and yet it had (continues to have) a sci-fi effect on the Nasher Sculpture Center whose walls on a sunny day look as though they’re stricken with measles. The Glare is the shiny reflection emanating from the glass exterior of the building next door 42-story Museum Tower which in 2011 was under construction.

What Nasher officials discovered around 3 p.m. on a September afternoon a decade ago grew in intensity as the months went by. And what ensued was truly miraculous. After The Dallas Morning News broke the story of The Glare in early 2012 it made its way into Vanity Fair and the front page of The New York Times. Cable documentaries have been made about The Glare which created one of the nastiest controversies in the history of the Dallas art world — and that’s only part of the story.

What The Glare ended up doing was redirecting its white-hot intensity onto the owners of Museum Tower the Dallas Police & Fire Pension System. By the five-year anniversary of The Glare the pension fund teetered on the brink of insolvency and was forced to work out a deal with the city of Dallas for a financial rescue plan — via the state Legislature. The Glare even managed to topple the former head of the pension fund Richard Tettamant whom critics assail for having squandered the retirement money of the city’s first responders with outrageous investments in luxury real estate Museum Tower being (forgive us) the most glaring example.

And yet despite The Glare emerging as its own version of a sci-fi thriller the problem 10 years after is still there. Indeed nothing has been done to fix it. The Nasher garden remains unusually parched and hot and yes the walls still have measles. We turned to the Nasher for comment and got in response this statement from its director of external affairs Jill Magnuson:

“We are obviously disappointed that at this milestone the reflective glare from Museum Tower’s façade continues to have a negative impact on the Nasher Sculpture Center’s indoor and outdoor galleries. Nevertheless we remain committed to working toward the restoration of our original conditions and are hopeful with technology innovations that we can realize this solution as we continue to serve this community as a vital educational and cultural resource.”

The detentions add a new twist to the rise and fall of HNA a conglomerate started as a regional airline and later expanded globally through a highly leveraged buying spree of stakes ranging from the Hilton hotel chain to Deutsche Bank. The company entered bankruptcy proceedings earlier this year.

Details of the alleged crimes committed by the two executives were not disclosed by the police but Caixin’s year-long investigation including a review of the company’s filings and previous interviews with multiple former and current executives found that HNA Chairman Chen Feng now deceased co-founder Wang Jian and multiple senior executives owned companies controlled or invested in by family members that conducted business with HNA. These businesses many registered in New York as well as Hainan where the company headquarter was located obtained funds and contracts from HNA ranging from aviation materials to real estate development advertising and insurance. Some of those relatives even became frequent guests in New York’s philanthropy circle and leaders of Chinese businesses associations in the U.S.

None of the related-party transactions some of which were related to the conglomerate’s overseas acquisitions were fully disclosed in HNA’s regulatory filings.

Chen’s and Wang’s brothers were both involved in aviation material businesses that have supply contracts with HNA. HNA might have paid 30% to 50% more than competitors for aviation materials and 10% more for aircraft a former HNA executive said.

“The more expensive the more commission they could get” the former executive said. “This is impossible at state-owned enterprises. Isn’t this embezzlement?”

Brothers’ business ties

In 1989 following the establishment of Hainan — a huge remote southern island — as a province the provincial government decided to set up a local airline company with 10 million yuan ($1.55 million) of registered capital. Starting from scratch the planned Hainan Airlines faced difficulties from the beginning because of a lack of capital airplanes and talent.

In 1990 Wang and Chen along with several co-workers from the Civil Aviation Administration of China in Beijing quit their jobs to join the new airline. Wang and Chen soon became vice presidents and major shareholders after a joint-stock ownership restructuring.

Shortly after Chen joined Hainan Airlines his younger brother Chen Guoqing in 1991 set up Hainan American Co. (HAC) in the U.S. The original shareholders and business scope of HAC are unknown. In the first couple of years the company had several transactions with the New York branches of Citic Ka Wah Bank (later renamed China Citic Bank International) Bank of China and Bank of Communications according to information from the New York Department of Finance. The amount and purpose of these transactions are also unknown.

In 1999 Hainan Airlines’ A-shares were listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Its prospectus shows that Hainan Airlines had investments in HAC but the timing and amount weren’t disclosed. In 1997 Hainan Airlines sold its interest in HAC to its subsidiary HNA Aviation Import & Export Co. Ltd. for $1.5 million according to the prospectus.

The prospectus also for the first time revealed the business relationship between Hainan Airlines and HAC. In 1996 Hainan Airlines paid HAC 25.59 million yuan ($3.96 million) in commissions for aviation material procurement. Next year the figure was 14.75 million yuan.

In 1997 HAC moved its office into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York which was destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attacks. Its aviation materials business boomed with the expansion of Hainan Airlines’ fleet.

In the next two years HAC procured aviation materials including aircraft engines for Hainan Airlines from Allied Signal Aerospace Boeing and CFM International and obtained funds through the New York branches of Citic Ka Wah Bank and Bank of Communications. Chen Guoqing was chairman of HAC and its vice chairman was Tang Xiangdong. Tang who is now the HNA vice chairman and CEO was detained by police together with Chen Feng.

As of March 1999 Hainan Airlines entrusted HAC to import aviation materials and paid it 76 million yuan in deposits.

In 1999 HAC changed its name to Pacific American Co. (PAC). The next year the company procured engines from Pratt & Whitney Canada for Hainan Airlines’ 328 planes. Citic Ka Wah Bank provided loans for the deal.

In 1994 Chen Guoqing registered another company also named HAC in Bermuda. A verdict related to a vessel detained in South Africa revealed HNA’s relationship with HAC. The ship was owned by Grand China Shipping Co. Ltd. a subsidiary of HNA while HAC owns a 10% stake in Grand China Shipping according to the verdict. Grand China Shipping claimed HAC was a private investment company.

Chen Guoqing’s wife Liu Ming and his wife’s brother were also listed as shareholders of Bermuda HAC. His wife’s brother identified as Mr. Liu is a longstanding employee of HNA a former executive of a number of HNA’s subsidiaries and the current chief executive of an associated company the verdict said.

In 2000 HNA prepaid HAC 94.4 million yuan for aviation materials according to HNA’s annual report. HNA also had 13.8 million yuan of long-term payables to HAC on which HNA paid 10% to 12.5% annual interest. Meanwhile during 2001 to 2005 PAC also provided aviation material financing leasing services for HNA which listed PAC as one of its long-term payable recipients. As of 2002 HNA had 59.43 million yuan of payables to PAC on which HNA had to pay 3.2 million yuan of interest.

Notably HNA in its reports used the names PAC and HAC on the same payable items during that period. It’s unclear whether HAC referred to the New York company that changed its name to PAC or the Bermuda company or whether the two companies are actually the same.

Chen Guoqing’s complex ties with HNA in terms of equity investments business and company management are also documented in other little-known overseas court records. A 2013 court ruling on the bankruptcy of Dornier Aviation (North America) Inc. an American subsidiary of German aircraft manufacturer Fairchild Dornier GmbH and supplier of aircraft equipment to HNA shows that HNA placed orders with Dornier through PAC which was an affiliate of HNA. HNA didn’t dispute that PAC was its agent and had authority to order parts on its behalf the court ruling said even though HNA claimed PAC was an independent business.

Properties in Manhattan

Bio of Chen Guoqing on Committee of 100 official website

Chen Guoqing was involved in HNA’s property investments in China. Hainan Airlines disclosed in 1997 that it invested 38 million yuan for a 20% stake in a real estate development firm called Beijing America Center Real Estate Development Co. The exact time the investment was made wasn’t disclosed. The name of the company couldn’t be found in a business registration database. But a company called Beijing America Tower Real Estate Development Co. registered in 1994 with 150 million yuan of capital listed Chen Guoqing as the legal representative and HAC as a shareholder with a 50% stake. The registration of the company has since been canceled.

Chen Guoqing and companies associated with him were also behind the equity changes in many HNA affiliates. In 2000 HAC was listed as the seventh-largest shareholder of Hainan Airlines with 1.15% and it exited as a shareholder in 2003. In 2006 Hainan Airlines completed a private placement with a group of investors including Hainan Taiheng Industrial Co. Ltd. where Chen Guoqing’s wife Liu Ming was an executive. Taiheng’s legal representative Li Dongjiang was also CEO of PAC. Another executive at PAC Meng Fanchen was once director at Headstream Investment Co. Ltd. which holds a 17.5% stake in HNA.

As HNA expanded through overseas acquisitions Chen Guoqing also gobbled up properties in the U.S. In 1997 through HAC he bought a unit in Trump Tower in New York that is now worth about $3.7 million. In March 2003 Chen and his wife bought another apartment in the Park Imperial in midtown Manhattan. Four months later he bought another unit in the same building through PAC. Citic Ka Wah Bank provided a $1.1 million mortgage to him and Hainan Airlines guaranteed the loan.

In 2006 and 2010 PAC bought two luxury apartment units in the Time Warner Center overlooking Central Park. Citic Ka Wah Bank provided a $3.3 million mortgage on one of the units guaranteed by Hainan Airlines and HNA. PAC sold the two units in 2012 and 2015.

Chen and his wife entered the elite social circle in New York through philanthropy and business associations. Among his many social engagements Chen is a vice chairman of China General Chamber of Commerce in the U.S. a member of the board of trustees of the Asia Society and founder of the Asia Society Policy Institute and as a parent remains a trustee on the Board of prestigious Brown University. The bio of Chen at Brown’s corporation trustee page referred to him as one of the founders of HNA Group chairman of HNA North America and vice chairman of the HNA Foundation.

The Wang brothers

HNA's co-founders Chen Feng (left) and Wang Jian (right) attended an internal meeting in 2013. Photo: VCG

HNA’s late Co-Chair Wang Jian was one of the twin engines powering the company together with Chen. In 2017 Wang commented on his relationship with Chen in an internal meeting as harmonized and unified although some company sources said the co-leaders are not as amicable as they appeared to be.

“You hardly saw them together cheerfully” a person close to Chen and Wang said. “Chen was on the front stage taking all the attention but it was Wang who decided everything in the back.”

But the two were tightly coordinated in their personal links with HNA’s business networks. Caixin learned that while Chen’s family profited from deals with HNA Wang’s brother Wang Wei was also deeply engaged in lucrative businesses with the aviation giant.

Wang Wei is the controlling shareholder of Hainan Aviation Import and Export Trade Co. (Hainan Aviation Trade) one of the earliest HNA subsidiaries which was later spun off. According to Hainan Airlines’ 1999 IPO prospectus Hainan Aviation Trade was a noncontrolling shareholder of Hainan Airlines at the time.

Financial records of Hainan Airlines showed that between 1996 and 1999 Hainan Airlines paid more than 65 million yuan in commissions to Hainan Aviation Trade for equipment purchases. In 1999 Hainan Aviation Trade owed 28.7 million yuan to Hainan Airlines in the form of accounts receivable.

In 2006 Hainan Airlines disclosed in its annual report that it had written down 6.38 million yuan of bad debts related to Hainan Aviation Trade as well as 6.5 million yuan of bad debts with HAC.

In addition to Hainan Aviation Trade Wang Wei also controlled a company called Hainan Jianheng Industrial Investment Co. Ltd. which engaged in a wide range of businesses including property aviation trade logistics golf courses and finance. Hainan Jianheng had close business links with HNA and its affiliates.

In 2000 Hainan Jianheng joined HNA and Hainan Airlines in setting up a trading venture Hainan HNA Aeronautics Import & Export. Hainan Jianheng held 30% of the venture equivalent to HNA’s holding.

From 2000 to 2016 Hainan HNA Aeronautics earned 420 million yuan from aviation equipment imports for Hainan Airlines.

A former HNA employee said it is common that the company’s procurement orders went to businesses affiliated with senior executives.

“We had contacted suppliers and done a lot of work but got no response when it was reported to Wang Jian” the former employee said. “Many (of the orders) eventually went to Wang Wei.”

For a while Wang Wei controlled all of HNA’s printing-related businesses. “One copy of the product cost only 1 yuan in Beijing but we had to do it in Hainan where it cost 4 yuan” the person said.

Cover Story: HNA Group’s Final Crisis

The hidden network

A 2005 regulatory warning issued to Hainan Airlines offered a glimpse of HNA’s sprawling hidden network with affiliates and business dealings. The China Securities Regulatory Commission in the notice criticized Hainan Airlines for failing to disclose 440 million yuan of transactions with Shaanxi Xinyuan Industrial Trade Co.

Business registration records showed that as of December 2003 Shaanxi Xinyuan was 83.3% owned by Changjiang Leasing Co. formerly known as HNA Aviation Leasing Co. Changjiang Leasing was 97% owned by four affiliated companies of Hainan Airlines.

It is unclear how many of HNA’s business partners are affiliated with the company and its executives due to the complicated shareholding structures. It is also difficult to track the capital flows between HNA and such affiliates.

According to Hainan Airlines’ 2004-05 financial report a company called Hainan Jiahui Investment Co. had a large amount of debt transactions with Hainan Airlines. Hainan Jiahui whose business registration has been canceled was registered in 2003 and 20% owned by Yangtze River Investment an HNA affiliate. Hainan Jiahui’s legal representative Zhang Yigang took senior management posts in several companies linked to Wang Wei.

After announcing the detention of Chen and Tan Friday night HNA held a management meeting chaired by party chief Gu Gang urging executives to reflect on the company’s 28-year development as the bankruptcy restructuring enters a key stage.

One week earlier Gu said in an internal meeting that under the restructuring plan HNA’s assets would be divided into four independent units — aviation airport operation finance and commercial. All existing shareholders including the largest shareholder Hainan Cihang Charity Foundation will no longer hold any interest in the company after the revamp according to Gu.

“Existing shareholders’ stake will be wiped out a practice that follows market rules and the legal obligations of bankruptcy restructuring” Gu said. “It is the responsibility that shareholders must bear and a result of a private company’s reckless growth.”

AWK,American Water Works,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyZW50b25kYWlseS5jb20vdHd3LXRvLXJlcGxhY2UtMS04LW1pbGVzLW9mLXdhdGVyLW1haW4taW4tZXdpbmctdG93bnNoaXAtbmV4dC1mYWxsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TWW to Replace 1.8 Miles of Water Main in Ewing Township Next Fall,"Trenton Water Works (TWW) will replace approximately 1.8 miles of 16-inch water main in Ewing Township north of Princeton Avenue to Sutherland Road beginning in the fall of 2022.

“We measure TWW’s capital projects in the millions of dollars” said Mayor Gusciora. “This is the level of investment commitment and leadership required to ensure that TWW continues to produce some of the highest quality drinking water in the United States for our customers and service-area consumers – drinking water that meets or exceeds rigorous federal and state standards.”

On Sept. 16 2021 Trenton City Council approved the use of $4 million from the city’s allotment of American Rescue Plan funding to pay for the Ewing Township water main replacement project. When complete the project will help maintain high water quality and improve water distribution system reliability increase water pressure in some areas and maintain adequate flows throughout the TWW system. The scope of work includes replacing approximately 9500 linear feet of 16-inch water main north of Princeton Avenue to Sutherland Road in Ewing Township. TWW has more than 10000 customers in Ewing Township.

“We are very pleased that Trenton Water Works is making this investment in the Olden Avenue business district a vital part of Ewing Township’s economy and quality of life” said Bert H. Steinmann Mayor of Ewing Township. “In recent years and months the number of water main breaks on Olden Avenue has supported the argument that this project is fundamentally needed. Many thanks to Mayor Reed Gusciora and Trenton City Council for making it a priority.”

TWW has undertaken several capital projects since it announced its six-year $405-million capital plan in 2019. The plan includes $150-million to remove lead infrastructure from its water-distribution system and at private residences; $20 million to replace water meters systemwide with smart meters; $30 million to construct two 8-million-gallon tanks across the street from the Pennington Avenue Reservoir to improve system resiliency; $5.5 million to rehabilitate the water-filtration plant’s raw-water intake; and $3 million to clean and line water mains in targeted areas of TWW’s 683-mile water-distribution system.

Purchased by the City of Trenton in 1859 Trenton Water Works (TWW) is one of the oldest and largest publicly owned water systems in the United States supplying 28 million gallons of water per day to approximately a quarter-million consumers in a five-municipality service area in Mercer County NJ: Trenton Ewing Township parts of Hamilton Township Lawrence Township and Hopewell Township.

“With approved funding authorized by City Council we can start the design phase of the project. We are immensely grateful for their support and Mayor Gusciora’s leadership” said Mark A. Lavenberg Director of the city’s Department of Water and Sewer which operates Trenton Water Works. TWW serves nearly 250000 consumers in its five-municipality service area. “We will prepare the specifications put it out for public bid evaluate proposals and ultimately award the project to a vendor as part of our work to improve the performance of TWW’s water-distribution system.”

Roosevelt (FDR) as he entered office in the midst of the Great Depression and calls for reviving parts of the New Deal have been heard from many quarters. This is not idle speculation because today’s challenges of inequality injustice unemployment and global warming are so grave that they can only be met by sweeping federal policies comparable to the New Deal of the 1930s. For example in his 2020 presidential campaign Senator Bernie Sanders pushed a plan for spending $171 billion for a Civilian Climate Corps. By late April of this year Senator Ed Markey and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — leading proponents of a Green New Deal — had also unveiled their ambitious plan for a Civilian Climate Corps that would employ a diverse group of 1.5 million young people over five years. Recruits would work on projects to address climate change (land water and energy conservation) community development (schools clinics parks and social services) and environmental justice (impacted communities would provide half the recruits and receive half the projects). In the meantime President Biden included a Civilian Climate Corps as part of his own American Jobs Plan (AJP) looking to provide perhaps $10 billion over ten years to drive the program. A new Civilian Climate Corps continues to be one of the programs that progressives in Congress are pushing to include in the $3.5 trillion spending bill that is expected to be put into final form and voted on next week. Why did these politicians hit on the model of Roosevelt’s Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) for their Civilian Climate Corps? There are four good reasons. First the CCC was the most popular of FDR’s programs — with the men who served the local communities that benefitted and the general public. Second the CCC employed more than 3 million young men from 1933 to 1942 saving them from despair and their families from destitution. Third the CCC gave recruits the opportunity to do useful work learn self-discipline develop job skills and acquire basic education (many were illiterate). Fourth the CCC was the “greenest” of the New Deal programs working across the country to repair a century of rampant deforestation soil exhaustion and pollution. At the same time the CCC’s record on race and gender has often been criticized. Women were excluded entirely and African American men were often passed over by racist recruiters. There was a lack of people of color in most skilled and supervisory positions and CCC camps were mostly segregated. These failings of the original CCC would almost certainly will not be repeated today given social changes over the last century. The interwar period was the high tide of Jim Crow. The law could declare discrimination illegal but how it was carried out proved to be a different thing. Still the record of the original CCC deserves a closer look as a matter of historical accuracy and of political urgency. On the one hand there’s a need to address a set of misleading and ahistorical — but unfortunately widespread — arguments that portray the New Deal as fundamentally racist. Not only is that a profoundly misleading depiction of the New Deal; it’s an argument that could well be deployed in the future to weaken support for anything echoing the New Deal — including the idea of a new Civilian Climate Corps — even though those kinds of bold federal initiatives are essential to the welfare of all working people in this country. This article is an attempt to assess the record of the CCC on race — both the facts of the case and the context of government and civil society in Jim Crow America. In our view the failings of the CCC were due less to inherent flaws in the program than to the overwhelming facts of life of the 1930s. In brief the CCC began under a clear antidiscrimination rule; fell into line with segregation under external pressure and internal capitulation; bettered its performance with African Americans over its life; and did relatively well by other people of color. By the end it had provided jobs for hundreds of thousands of young African Americans and other men of color affording them with much of the same benefits as white people. Overall the CCC was flawed — but it was better than the country it served.

Achievements of the Original CCC Working out of three thousand camps across the country the CCC helped restore millions of acres of public forest and private agricultural land devastated by two centuries of relentless exploitation and opened up the vast public domain to mass recreation by its improvements to public parks forests and refuges. CCC enrollees planted 2.3 billion trees for the US Forest Service and millions more in shelterbelts for the Soil Conservation Service (SCS; now the Natural Resources Conservation Service). With the SCS and Grazing Service they built tens of thousands of erosion barriers water works and other improvements on ranches and farms. Under the US Biological Survey (later the Fish & Wildlife Service) they helped develop scores of wildlife refuges and stocked 1 billion fish in America’s fresh waters. Most famously the CCC worked with the National Park Service and nascent state park authorities to improve recreational and maintenance facilities in all the country’s existing national parks monuments and forests along with more than seven hundred state parks. CCC teams created over ninety thousand acres of campgrounds a hundred forty thousand miles of foot horse and truck trails and forty-five hundred rustic cabins and hiking shelters as well as rehabilitating thirty-four hundred acres of public beaches. The experiment with integrated CCC camps came more than a decade before the US military was integrated under Harry Truman. To carry out such projects CCC recruits added a huge amount of infrastructure to public lands such as hundreds of miles of roads forty thousand bridges a hundred seventy landing fields eighty-nine thousand miles of telephone wire and thousands of miles of water pipes. Their fire protection work was legion as they built thirty-eight hundred fire watchtowers cleared thousands of miles of fuel breaks and fought hundreds of fires. CCC enrollees were recruited from all around the country for six-month stints. The majority were sent far from home mostly out west to parks forests farms and range lands. The young men received food accommodation clothing and medical care and they were paid a modest $30 a month $25 of which had to be sent home to their families. They rose early and worked full days in challenging conditions of hot sun dense forests steep mountains poison oak and ivy and inclement weather. After work recreational sports movies and music were encouraged and educational courses offered from basic literacy to botany. Saturdays were set aside for leisure or visits to local communities and Sundays included time for religious services. Enrollees overwhelmingly reported that they finished in better health and better educated than when they entered with large numbers re-upping. The young men of the CCC were mostly from the bottom of the working class. An internal survey in 1937 showed the typical recruit had never held a full-time job had been jobless for seven months prior to enrollment and was from a family whose male head of household was unemployed; less than a third had experienced on-the-job training of any sort. As James McEntee the CCC’s second director put it: “They were drawn almost entirely from that third of the population which President Roosevelt has described as ‘ill-fed ill-housed and ill-clothed.’” This enormous endeavor was not accomplished with the wave of a magic wand. It took rapid planning and on-the-fly adjustments at every stage of the process: recruitment and assignment setting up camps company management identifying projects and tasks training and education and more. The paucity of administrative capacity in government at the time meant that the way to get the program up and running quickly was to call on the US Army. The CCC was organized into companies and camps whose commander was a career army officer or later a reserve officer. At first noncommissioned officers carried out orders from the officers in day-to-day operations; later on more civilians were brought in to serve in these positions.

Launching the CCC The CCC was close to President Roosevelt’s heart; he was a committed conservationist and admirer of the Boy Scouts. The federal program was modeled after New York state’s Temporary Emergency Relief Administration (TERA) when FDR was governor. Yet today it can be hard to imagine the speed with which the CCC moved forward. Roosevelt’s inauguration took place on March 4 1933 he made a request to Congress for an Emergency Conservation Work Program on March 21 and SB 598 passed both houses of Congress and was signed on March 31. The induction of the first CCC enrollee came on April 7 and the first CCC camp was established at the George Washington National Forest in Virginia ten days later. Three serious problems were exposed at the start. The first was labor competition. The unions represented by the American Federation of Labor were initially opposed to the CCC arguing that enrollees would displace free laborers that low pay would depress wages and undermine the contractual rights of workers. In an era of fascist mobilization labor leaders also expressed concerns that the CCC could lead to “militarized labor.” The unions were eventually won over and fears about undermining prevailing wage rates proved unfounded. Roosevelt brought the unions on board by appointing labor officials to direct the CCC: Robert Fechner general vice president of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) and James McEntee also of the IAM. A second issue was that the CCC was planned entirely for and by men. A few critics raised objections — most notably Frances Perkins and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt — who worked behind the scenes to create a parallel program for women administered by the Federal Emergency Relief Administration led by Harry Hopkins popularly known as the “She-She-She.” But it was limited in scope and short-lived reflecting the general patriarchy at a time when women had only recently won the vote had few legal rights and were regarded as unsuited for manual labor. A third problem dogging the CCC from the beginning was race. Unsurprisingly given that this was the height of the Jim Crow era racial justice was not a priority. An amendment introduced by Congressman Oscar S. De Priest a Republican from Chicago and the only African-American member of the House of Representatives barred discrimination in the CCC based on race color or creed and was incorporated into the final legislation. The amendment was supported by FDR who wanted to win over progressive critics and who followed up with an antidiscrimination Executive Order in 1935. If the shortcomings of the CCC around labor gender and race were clear from the outset only the first was resolved — in large part because unions were there to defend the interests of workers. The Roosevelt administration was focused on economic recovery and its leadership moved quickly to bring the working class into the New Deal coalition. Race and gender were another matter. One of the hardest issues CCC leaders would have to cope with was the country’s rigid racial order which in the early 1930s went almost completely unchallenged in mainstream politics. The interwar period was the high tide of Jim Crow a system rooted in the South but instantiated throughout the country. The law could declare discrimination illegal but how it was carried out proved to be a different thing. Nevertheless the New Deal itself brought a remarkable upheaval on many fronts of American life and it would set in motion changes that would help build the civil rights movement give greater autonomy to native tribes and advance women’s standing in society. These were felt to a limited degree within the confines of the CCC program but much more beyond as the New Dealers responded to a changing electorate outside pressure and inside activism especially by black activists. Under the presidency of Herbert Hoover deportations of Mexican Americans soared. Over the course of the 1930s the New Deal expanded federal employment of people of color desegregated federal offices enforced nondiscrimination in Public Works Administration contracts and Works Progress Administration equal pay rules expanded National Youth Administration employment of minority professionals created the first federal Office of Civil Rights and integrated military contracting. Even if the CCC was not at the forefront of most of these developments it still scored some significant achievements for access and inclusion. In this regard a closer review of the situation for African Americans Native Americans and others is called for if the CCC is to be judged accurately on both its accomplishments and failures.

African Americans in the CCC The CCC did not exclude African Americans as is sometimes claimed. In fact more than three hundred thousand young black men and thirty thousand black veterans served during its ten-year existence. For tens of thousands of young African-American men participation in the CCC provided a refuge and sustenance at a time when millions of black people were awash in poverty and hopelessness. Nevertheless there were substantial barriers to full participation in the CCC. To begin with the number of African Americans was capped at 10 percent of all enrollees — the rough percentage of African Americans in the United States population. This was seen as a “fair” rule of thumb by Director Fechner even though it was decidedly less than adequate when measured against the disproportionate unemployment and poverty of African Americans. Worse recruiters in most Southern states rarely accepted “Negro” recruits into the CCC considering white people as more deserving of help and arguing that black people were needed at home for growing and harvesting cotton — a reflection of the South’s fundamental reliance on extremely low-paid African-American labor. Contrary to common opinion segregation of CCC camps was not the rule from the beginning. In the South of course integration was a dead letter. In the North and West however several camps started out with black and white people in the same companies. Notably this experiment with integrated camps came more than a decade before the military was integrated in 1948 and despite army resistance. The evidence is overwhelming that CCC enrollees saw the corps as a positive experience; many looked back on their time in the corps as one of the best of their lives. Nevertheless integrated CCC camps — and even all-black camps — faced hostility from neighboring communities which sent letters of complaint to the director Congress and the president. On top of this internal relations between black and white enrollees could be tense leading to fights and general discord. The result was that black and white CCC companies and camps were soon separated and the experiment with integration ended in 1935. It did not help that Director Fechner came from Tennessee. Fechner danced around the requirements of the De Priest amendment offering the standard separate-but-equal ideology of Plessy v. Ferguson as an excuse in a letter to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP): “This segregation is not discrimination and cannot be so construed. The Negro companies are assigned to the same types of work have identical equipment are served the same food and have the same quarters as white enrollees.” The resegregation of the CCC infuriated civil rights groups but their sway was limited. Political pressure did succeed however in forcing the CCC to promote more African Americans into supervisory and skilled positions. In August 1935 FDR had the army call up a number of African-American reserve officers to fill CCC administrative positions and by 1936 African-American officers commanded two CCC companies in New York and Pennsylvania. Simultaneously African-American enrollees began to be assigned positions of authority and responsibility at the camps such as squad leader company clerk and educational advisor; and were recruited for skilled jobs instead of being consigned to the most demeaning tasks. The CCC Educational Program was particularly important for enhancing the responsibilities given to black men. While the start was slow more than a dozen African-American educational advisors were in place by mid-1934 and by September 1935 African Americans were being appointed as educational advisors throughout most of the country. By 1940 few of the 153 African-American companies lacked such advisors. These men had a leading role at the camp level including crafting classroom instruction and providing on-the-job training programs. Many of the projects undertaken by CCC teams — both white and black — required only the simplest types of common labor yet African-American CCC veterans like their white counterparts regularly reported that the CCC taught them habits of cooperation and conscientiousness and that they appreciated learning skills such as equipment operation carpentry mechanics electrical repair and construction. The limits on opportunity for African Americans in Jim Crow America must be recognized however and many of the skills acquired did not translate to post-CCC jobs — especially in fields such as botany forestry and wildlife management. Skills in journalism radio and photography also added little to black men’s future employability in a world of intense racial discrimination. Once again the good intentions of the CCC ran into the harsh reality of Jim Crow America. On balance for young black men the CCC was a valuable though limited program hobbled by the conventional practices of white America. In some ways it was ahead of its time by attempting the integration of companies and the elevation of African Americans to commanding positions — practices that arrived in the US military only during and after World War II. In general the CCC experience was better than the alternative of unemployment or sharecropping — which was the situation for about 80 percent of all black people. Once in the CCC young people could engage in useful projects in parks forests seashores and other natural landscapes that offered opportunities for personal development and just as important gave them a genuine sense that they had contributed to making their country a better place.

Native Americans Latinos and Islanders in the CCC The New Deal brought about a major reversal in the treatment of Native Americans in the 1930s. The transformation in federal policy toward native peoples was embodied in the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 popularly known as “the Indian New Deal” spearheaded by the US Commissioner of Indian Affairs John Collier. It ended the devastation of the Dawes Act of 1887 which converted 90 million acres (two-thirds) of tribal treaty land to private holdings in an ill-conceived plan to make indigenous people into small farmers. Almost all this privatized land ended up in white hands. Under the 1934 act tribal self-government was implemented tribes were allowed to incorporate businesses and run education programs and employment opportunities were enhanced. By 1940 a hundred thirty-five tribal constitutions had been written voted on and put into operation; millions of acres were restored or added to tribal lands and employment of tribal members was greatly increased in the federal Office of Indian Affairs (renamed the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1947). The course of the New Deal for Indians was by no means smooth and it ran into persistent opposition from white Westerners in Congress and the old guard of Indian agents as well as from many Native Americans — who had good reason not to trust another round of paternalistic and universalizing policy from the US government. Nevertheless it brought a sea change in federal policy. Part of this more enlightened policy was the creation of a parallel CCC the Indian Emergency Conservation Work (IECW) program. A separate program was requested by Native Americans who objected to having army-led CCC camps on tribal lands given the brutal history of conquest. FDR approved almost $6 million in funding for the start of the IECW later renamed the Civilian Conservation Corps Indian Division (CCC-ID). The CCC-ID employed some eighty thousand to eighty-five thousand indigenous men during the years of the Great Depression. This was about 3 percent of the CCC workforce and slightly more than the Native American portion of the population. The Office of Indian Affairs and tribal governments oversaw CCC-ID projects and the age limitations of enrollees was not as restrictive as the regular CCC. The program was focused on tribal lands to restore degraded rangeland improve water supplies and promote sustainable grazing. Projects involved road construction erosion control reforestation fish hatcheries and dams reservoirs and water distribution systems. CCC-ID teams worked on two hundred reservations in twenty-three states. The CCC-ID also built dams roads trails and fences on land near reservations. By the end of the CCC-ID program portions of fifty million acres had been improved. In the words of Collier “No previous undertaking in Indian Service has so largely been the Indians’ own undertaking.” The CCC-ID was of great value to native peoples simply by providing jobs for people who had suffered from unemployment and dire poverty long before the Great Depression. For example jobs for half of the male breadwinners on the Sioux reservations in South Dakota and almost half the income of the Papago tribe in Arizona came from the CCC-ID in the mid-1930s. Native American men received training in gardening animal husbandry safety practices and academic subjects in the same manner as other CCC recruits and they felt that they were working to improve their tribal communities as well as themselves. As one enrollee put it: “This work has provided an income for us and has enabled us to keep alive while at the same time it has given us a better perspective on our goals in life.” The Depression did not begin well for Latino Americans. Mexicans and Mexican Americans were hit hard by white xenophobia and violence against migrant workers in the Southwest. Under the presidency of Herbert Hoover deportations soared often with the enthusiastic aid of local governments and employers. The situation changed significantly once FDR entered the White House. Deportations dropped by roughly half relief programs came to the aid of impoverished workers and their families and the State Department joined Mexican American activists to block a case to exclude Mexicans from immigrating to the United States. The CCC recruited thousands of young Mexican Americans across the Southwest but noncitizen Mexicans did not qualify. Other than African Americans Latinos were the largest minority group in California’s CCC camps. They were apparently not singled out for racial discrimination as intensively as black people even though at some locations identification was split between “W-1” for white and “W-2” for Mexican American. In the reconstruction of La Purísima Mission at Lompoc the treatment of Mexican American men appears to have been very good including their use as skilled workers (in sharp contrast to the way white people drove black people out of the Lompoc camp). New Deal assistance was substantial for Puerto Rico. The Roosevelt administration funded a public works program larger than anything previously seen on the island and New Deal work relief programs including the CCC employed thousands of Puerto Ricans. The island’s CCC camps housed over twenty-four hundred men. As on the mainland the CCC built many of the trails lookouts buildings and roads in various federal and insular parks and forests including in the majestic El Yunque National Forest. In the Pacific Hawai’i received considerable aid under the New Deal and gained many public work projects. The CCC set up several camps on the Hawai’ian Islands doing mostly forestry and park work. The corps was also active in Alaska working with indigenous peoples such as the Aleuts and Tlingit. Most famous of the CCC works in Alaska was the salvage repair and carving of native “totem poles” as part of a US Forest Service effort to employ Alaskan natives and conserve native cultural assets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3lvcmthbG1hbmFjay5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS90aGUtcG9lc3RlbmtpbGwtbW91bnRhaW5zLXdhdGVyZmFsbHMtYW5kLXdhdGVyd29ya3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Poestenkill: Mountains Waterfalls and Waterworks,"On the Hudson River along upstate New York’s eastern border within the natural boundaries of river and mountains lies the rough rectangle of Rensselaer County. It is bisected by the Poesten Kill* a powerful stream that scours its way from the mountains to the sea level flats of the Hudson River at Troy.

The Poesten Kill splits the county across the middle into two pieces of roughly equal size north and south. From its source at about 1600 feet in the Taconic Mountains to the village which bears its name it’s a smaller steam tumbling over forested rocks and ledges and forming pools and small waterfalls. At the village of Poestenkill it begins to meander across a 10-mile wide plateau of farmlands before falling abruptly through a series of steep gorges at Troy to settle into the Hudson.

T he true source of the Poesten Kill are the springs and small streams that feed Dyken Pond 20 miles east of the Hudson. The pond is located near the corner of the towns of Poestenkill Grafton and Berlin some seven miles from the where New York Vermont and Massachusetts come together. As late as the turn of the 20th century it was still known as “dyking pond.”

Dyken Pond’s current stone and masonry dam stands 20 feet high and is 375 feet long. This modern dyke enlarged the pond to the size of a small lake (about 181 acres) when it was built in 1902. Manning Paper Company built the dam to regulate stream flow that powered the mills and machinery along the Poesten Kill to Troy and then donated the pond and some surrounding acres to Rensselaer County in 1973.

Dyken Pond is now home to Rensselaer County’s Dyken Pond Environmental Education Center. The year-round nature interpretative center features exhibits and displays on wildlife and natural resources and many miles of trails for hiking cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. The pond is accessible for fishing canoeing and kayaking.

From Dyken Pond the Poesten Kill gathers strength as comes off the mountains. It tumbles south through the eastern end of the Town of Berlin and then turns west through the hamlet of East Poestenkill.

Winding its way through the eastern part of the Town of Poestenkill it picks up water from a dozen smaller streams to create the rush that makes the 92 foot drop at Barbersville Falls and brings the kill to the broad swath of the Rensselaer Plateau. Here the first substantial village along its course Poestenkill was established near some naturally occurring sulphur springs. Still some seven miles from the Hudson the kill leaves the village of Poestenkill and turns north-northwest where it’s joined by the waters of Newfoundland Creek and the Quacken Kill as it winds its way through small rolling hills that were once mostly farmed.

As Troy was growing a dam was built to the east of the city on the Quacken Kill the Poesten Kill’s largest tributary. It diverted water into the city’s water system from four ponds located in Grafton: Long Second Mill and Shaver ponds. Dams built on the ponds controlled the flow of water down the Quacken Kill to the Eagle Mills diverting dam when it was taken by a cast-iron main to the Brunswick Reservoir. In 1938 another sixteen-inch main was installed from the diverting dam and along Pinewoods Avenue to connect with the city system. The diverting dam reduced the flow of water in the Quacken and Poesten kills and may have hastened the abandonment of some of the mills along both.

Mills established along the streams in these villages sent their goods mostly lumber grain wool cotton and iron products to the markets at Troy and beyond. In the 1870s Poestenkill Village was home to saw and grist mills a cotton batten factory a flax mill and a shirt factory.

At the same time mills along the Quacken Kill produced twine and carpet warp paper brush handles and blocks cotton batten and carded and fulled wool cashmere flannel and yarn. At Eagle Mills there were saw and grist mills two iron foundries producing hoes and other farm tools and nearby three shirt factories.

Near the Brunswick-Poestenkill town line the Poesten Kill turns north again to its second substantial village Eagle Mills (formerly Millville) where it turns west again against steep canyons. It settles down into a the fairly straight course where Sweet Milk Creek enters from the north on it way to the Country Club of Troy.

The club was established in 1927 nestled into a large bend in the kill. It’s the only private golf club in Rensselaer County and includes a clubhouse that overlooks the Poesten Kill designed by New York City architect Pliny Rogers. The course itself was designed by the first American golfer to win the British Amateur Championship Walter J. Travis.

The club was built on 170 acres of undeveloped land and adjacent farmland just before a series of three hairpin turns in the kill near the end of Cole Lane off Pinewoods Avenue in Troy.

There was an early paint mill here were workers mined shale from the ledges of the Poesten Kill and loaded them into scows. They were floated to a nearby mill and ground to produce red paint.

The ruins of the mill’s dam were still visible in the 1930s but today the kill continues to flow towards Ida Lake. Once a popular ice skating location this former mill pond was also the location of an early bleach works. To much consternation the lake was drained in 2019.

After passing under the bridge at Pawling Avenue (one of the oldest across the kill) the Poesten Kill plunges over the High Falls and cuts an enormous gorge through the southeast side of Mount Ida the source of numerous destructive landslides in the past. At the base of Mount Ida the Poesten Kill once meandered its way to the Hudson River but today settles into an a straight course confined with walls of stone brick and concrete into a power canal that gives Canal Street its name.

The mouth of the Poesten Kill once formed islands large and small spiral shoals and long thin sand bars that came and went with the changes in the Hudson River. Before it was channeled and the land around it raised tidal flats once lined the banks of the Poesten Kill some flooding annually to provide rich soil for the summertime crops the people living along the river planted.

The Poesten Kill is only one of more than a dozen streams that flow into the Hudson between Papscanee Island (previously spelled Papsickene now a peninsula nature preserve) and where the Hoosac River meets the Hudson.

There are five major natural waterfalls on the Poesten Kill. They include Poesten Kill High Falls (Mount Ida Falls) in Troy Barberville Falls in Poestenkill and three falls in the Town of Brunswick: the falls at Eagle Mills Fred’s Falls in Cropseyville and Buttermilk Falls.

There have been dozens places where the power of the Poesten Kill was captured by dams raceways waterwheels and turbines including a hydroelectric plant at the High Falls in Troy.

Hydro plants have been proposed over the years at Barberville Falls as well most recently in 1992 when a local landowner Tom Hohman proposed a small plant. Local opposition delayed the project but eventually a small sluice from the top of the falls was constructed to drive a generator at the bottom which now supplies power to a home and sawmill.

The force of the water in the Poesten Kill helped drive the early development of Troy once one of America’s most important 19th century industrial cities. The Poesten Kill’s waters were harnessed for the American industrial revolution that built the golden age of American industry trade and commerce. Its banks also stood witness to industrial abandonment and urban decline.

The Poesten Kill has been home to American Indians who hunted gathered fished and farmed along its shores frontier Dutch farmers and traders and colonial tradesmen merchants millers and lumbermen and 19th century iron steel textile and paper workers. Dutch English Irish German French Italian immigrants and others have lived along its length.

Although frequently hidden now behind modern development the Poesten Kill’s geologic wonders are impressive. It cavernous gorges and spectacular falls have served as inspiration to generations artist and nature lovers. Atop Mount Ida is Prospect Park nineteenth century geologist once celebrated the Logan Fault a thrust of older Cambrian rock that lies on top of newer Ordovician and runs from Canada to Alabama. It’s now called the Emmons Thrust after Ebenezer Emmons who graduated in the first class at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).

Culturally the Poesten Kill might seem to be just one of the many westward-flowing streams that drain Rensselaer County a county dominated by waterways that divide rolling hills. On close examination however the Poesten Kill holds a special place. At its mouth at the Hudson was one of the first truly European frontier settlements beyond the walls of Fort Orange (what is now Albany).

An earlier outlying farm built across from Fort Orange by 1632 on the south side of Mill Creek at de Laetsburgh later known as t’greynen bosch (Greenbush the pine woods) is now within the Rensselaer city limits. A ferry was established there and later colonial soldiers were often mustered under the protective eye of the fort across the river. The ferry continued to be controlled by the Van Rensselaer family until the nineteenth century providing easy and regular transportation between the Greenbush and Albany.

It was initially hoped that Greenbush would be the primary town for both sides of the Hudson but the political reality of competing stake holders (notably the Dutch West India Company and the Patroon Kiliaen van Rensselaer) made this impossible. One of the defining factors was the preference of private settlers preferring citizenship at Beverwijck outside the gates of Fort Orange to the indentured servitude of the Patroon’s feudal lands.

So it was that Greenbush was settled before the Poesten Kill but it could hardly be described as frontier; Rensselaer was once known as East Albany. On the west side flooding and terrain restricted development of farms and the Normanskill was insufficient as a source of power.

Four miles north of Fort Orange on the Hudson’s west side the Patroon established a farm once called de Vlackte (the Flatts home of the Patroon’s agent Arent van Curler) later known as West Troy and today Watervliet. The farm was considerably closer to the fort than those on the Poesten Kill and much more connected to life there.

To the north of the Poesten Kill early settlement was constrained where the Mohawk River meets the Hudson by enormous cliffs and the falls of Cohoes which made river travel impossible. The Piscawan Kill lay to the north but at its mouth was Mohican community so it was settled only later by Europeans. The Piscawan Kill provided plenty of room for Dutch bouweries (farms) and served most of the city’s water needs until about 1900 but it was not nearly powerful enough for major industry.

Farther north the Hoosac River held a substantial place in Native American and colonial history but was settled by Europeans much later than the Poesten Kill and faded in prominence during the industrial revolution. The Wynants Kill closer to the Poesten Kill was settled at about the same time. Its short and ragged drop made it suitable for water power but not for farms and homes. Unlike its neighbor to the north where the Wynants Kill enters the Hudson there is only a small flood plain not wide enough for substantial settlement. The banks of the Wynants Kill found prominence during the industrial revolution but faded thereafter and never served as an urban neighborhood as the lower Poesten Kill has.

So along the Poesten Kill was a frontier outpost that seemingly had it all: ample forests; a large flat farmable flood plain and a powerful source of water power. From the mouth of the Poesten Kill Manhattan Island the Atlantic seaboard Lake Champlain Montreal the St. Lawrence River the Mohawk River the Great Lakes the Hoosac River and New England were all within reach – even in prehistoric times.

The markets at Albany New York and later Troy are crucial to understanding the development along the Poesten Kill. Troy settled at the mouth of the Poesten Kill held a unique physical location that fostered the growth of 19th century industry along the kill. It’s at the head of Hudson River navigation the eastern terminus of the Erie Canal and the southern end of the Champlain Canal. It was also an important center of the very early Mohawk & Hudson Railroad and later the Rensselaer & Saratoga Railroad.

For many years Troy rivaled Pittsburgh in iron and steel production. The Poesten Kill was home to one of the first paper factories in New York. What really made life along the Poesten Kill so unique however was the diversity of products made there. Unlike other eastern urban areas the Poesten Kill was home to producers of agriculture and forest products along with feed flour paper plaster paint textiles iron and steel products like stoves valves and wire – a substantial variety of consumer goods used along the kill and in the world beyond.

* I’ve used the older spelling of Poesten Kill so that we might not forget its long history and besides calling the waterway Poestenkill Creek is like calling it Poesten Creek Creek. Because of its size and power the Poesten Kill hardly warrants the inferior appellation creek – the Dutch word kill just seems right.

Using the limitless possibilities of software defined radios has freed digital radio communication from the limits of what could be done with analogue electronics alone and as a result this is a rare field in which radio amateurs can still be ahead of the technological curve. On of these newer digital modes is FT8 created by the prolific [Joe Taylor K1JT].

And it’s for this mode that [Charles Hill] has created an easy-to-build transceiver. Its brains are aTeensy 3.6 while the receive side is a Si4735 receiver chip and the transmitter is a Si5351 programmable clock chip driving a Mini-Circuits GVA84 power amplifier with an appropriate filter. The interface is via a touchscreen display. It relies on existing work that applies a patch on-the-fly to the Si4735 receiver chip for SSB reception and another project for the FT8 software.

The charm of this transceiver is that it can be assembled almost in its entirety from modules. Some radio amateurs might complain that homebrew radios should only use the most basic of components assembled from first principles but the obvious answer to that should be that anything which makes radio construction easier is to be welcomed. If the 100 mW output power seems a bit low it’s worth remembering that FT8 is a weak signal mode and given the right propagation conditions the world should be able to hear it despite the meagre output.

We’ve featured quite a few radios using the Si47XX series which can be made into very tidy receivers indeed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoYW5zaW5kaWEuY29tL2FuZGhyYS1wcmFkZXNoL2FuZGhyYS1wcmFkZXNoLXJndWt0LWNldC0yMDIxLWV4YW0tZm9yLWFkbWlzc2lvbnMtaW50by1paWl0cy10by1iZS1oZWxkLXRvZGF5LTcwODIxNNIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoYW5zaW5kaWEuY29tL2FtcC9hbmRocmEtcHJhZGVzaC9hbmRocmEtcHJhZGVzaC1yZ3VrdC1jZXQtMjAyMS1leGFtLWZvci1hZG1pc3Npb25zLWludG8taWlpdHMtdG8tYmUtaGVsZC10b2RheS03MDgyMTQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Andhra Pradesh: RGUKT CET - 2021 exam for admissions into IIITs to be held today,"The RGUKT CET-2021 is being held on Sunday for admissions in four IIIT colleges under Rajiv Gandhi University of Science and Technology in the state.

(Sept. 26 2021) – Following the conclusion of the 43rd Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits where the U.S. Ryder Cup Team won its second consecutive domestic Ryder Cup 19-9 Dustin Johnson (U.S.) and Sergio Garcia (Europe) were named the inaugural recipients of the Nicklaus-Jacklin Award presented by Aon. The players were recognized as those who best embodied the spirit of the famous 1969 concession when Jack Nicklaus conceded a 2-foot putt to Tony Jacklin for a halved match that resulted in the first tie in Ryder Cup history.

This new award commemorates sportsmanship teamwork and performance in the context of better decision-making. These three attributes that were brought to the forefront by Johnson and Garcia also reflect Aon’s values and commitment to helping clients shape business decisions for the better.

Johnson arrived at the Ryder Cup as the oldest player on the U.S. Team and through remarkable teamwork in his partnerships with two rookies in Xander Schauffele and Collin Morikawa he performed brilliantly to become the first American to finish with a 5-0-0 record since Larry Nelson in 1979. The 37-year-old playing in his fifth Ryder Cup is the fifth player to go 5-0-0 in a single Ryder Cup joining Arnold Palmer (1967) Gardner Dickinson (1967) Larry Nelson (1979) and Francesco Molinari (2018).

Showcasing his own appreciation for Johnson’s contribution to his teammates Morikawa who was paired with Johnson for three of his five matches recognized the impact that Johnson had on his success.

“Obviously having DJ he's an amazing player. I've said it all week and I'm going to keep saying it because he really is. He's a great guy and he really made these first two days a little easier on me” Morikawa said. “Dustin has been one of the best players in the world for a long time and it was amazing to have someone like that as my partner in my first Ryder Cup.”

“It’s a dream to go 5-0-0 in a Ryder Cup” said Johnson. “For the first four matches I had great partners in Collin Morikawa and Xander Schauffele. We played great together and gelled really well. I am so proud of my teammates and my captains and loved the help from the fans. This award is something to be very proud of. All 12 of us showed great teamwork and came together as a team.”

Making his 10th appearance for the European Team Garcia showcased teamwork and performance through the Thursday and Friday matches alongside fellow Spaniard Jon Rahm. Garcia and Rahm were the first European tandem since 1987 to trail 3-down through three holes and eventually win their match. Garcia and Rahm’s teamwork resulted in victories in all three of their matches.

Garcia exemplified the love of his team with his comments and encouragement of teammate Rory McIlroy on Saturday “I told him the absolute truth. I told him that not only me but the whole team is proud of him no matter if he goes 5-0 or 0-5; that we love him and that we are always proud of the effort that he makes and the heart that he puts into his golf and into the team. It's as simple as that.”

During Friday’s Foursomes match Garcia made the decision to go for the green from 244 yards on the par-5 16th hole for what would be a memorable shot enroute to winning a point. With Garcia’s 3-1-0 record for the week he became the all-time Ryder Cup leader in overall wins (24) overall points (27.5) and Foursomes wins (12).

“I love the Ryder Cup” Garcia said. “We all know about the beautiful moment that happened more than 50 years ago between Nicklaus and Jacklin. I’m proud to be the first to win this award and thankful to Aon. I try to play the game to the best of my ability but always with respect and I enjoy it. I enjoyed this week and I thought we played with good energy which is important to show the young players that you can play with respect and have fun even in defeat. I love my team. I’m so proud of all of them. I have so many amazing experiences and relationships with my team. I love the guys in that room.”

The selections were made by a committee consisting of the award’s namesakes Jack Nicklaus and Tony Jacklin; former Ryder Cup Captains Paul Azinger and Paul McGinley; Jim Richerson President PGA of America; Alan White Chairman PGA of Great Britain and Ireland; and Carlo Clavarino Executive Chairman International Aon.

“We are honored to partner with the Ryder Cup to present the inaugural award that embodies so much of who we are and what we stand for at Aon” said Clavarino. “Sergio Garcia and Dustin Johnson both reflected the spirit of this tournament showcased better decision making on behalf of the greater good for their team and demonstrated excellence and sportsmanship.”

It has been under federal investigation for months. Read more

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has joined the FBI in the investigation of Pennsylvania’s biggest pension fund subpoenaing records about its board’s adoption of a false figure for its financial performance — and about improper “compensation and gifts” possibly offered staff.

State employees are forbidden from accepting such gifts under a ban imposed by Gov. Tom Wolf. The subpoena given the PSERS school pension plan Friday was the first indication that investigators are looking into possible presents or money from investment advisers and consultants.

The FBI and federal prosecutors launched a criminal probe of the $70 billion PSERS plan in March immediately after the fund’s board issued a brief statement revealing its belated doubts about the figure it endorsed in December for financial results.

Prosecutors’ multiple subpoenas ordered top PSERS officials to give information to a grand jury about the mistaken calculation and in a seemingly unrelated matter the pension fund’s $5 million appropriation in 2019 to buy real estate near its headquarters in Harrisburg.

While prosecutors and the FBI build criminal cases the SEC pursues civil complaints. It has broad power to impose fines discipline financial players and order reforms. It can’t put anyone in prison.

PSERS spokesperson Steve Esack said Saturday that the fund had no comment on the SEC action.

The board’s math mistake on its financial performance was no minor error.

PSERS — the Public School Employees’ Retirement System — oversees the pensions for more than 500000 working and retired educators. Under state law many school workers must pay more into the pension system when it fails to meet certain financial targets.

In December the 15-member PSERS board said profits were just barely good enough to spare the teachers such a hike. Then in April it reversed course and adopted a new lower figure. This triggered an increase in payments for more than 100000 teachers and other school employees hired since 2011. More veteran teachers were given a pass.

The SEC subpoena sought documents and communications both external and internal from the pension plan from December to the present regarding “any errors or recalculation of average rate of returns” and the “risk/share” process a reference to the law that says teachers must share in the risk and pay more when returns are disappointing. It also asked for records about board votes people familiar with the matter said. It was sent to Jackie Lutz the fund’s chief counsel.

The securities agency reportedly has subpoenaed Hamilton Lane Advisors LLC a suburban Philadelphia-based firm that reviews PSERS’s stake in private investment firms for information about its dealings with the pension fund. The subpoena explicitly said Hamilton Lane was not a target of the inquiry. Katie McGann a spokesperson for Hamilton Lane declined to comment.

Board members were alerted to the new subpoena later Friday by lawyer William Sullivan of the Pillsbury Winthrop Saw Pittman firm in Washington. PSERS hired his firm in April to deal with the federal probe. Sullivan is a former federal prosecutor who helps lead his firm’s white-collar criminal defense and corporate investigations team.

Besides Pillsbury the fund has brought in two other law firms since the first subpoenas hit — Philadelphia-based Morgan Lewis & Bockius and the international firm of Womble Bond Dickinson. The pension plan has also been paying for individual lawyers for at least eight employees.

The pension fund has said almost nothing about the calculation mistake beyond acknowledging the error six months ago. In internal reports obtained by The Inquirer a key consultant Chicago-based Aon Investment Consulting seemed to shoulder the blame. It traced the incorrect result to nothing more than “clerical data-entry mistakes” by its staff.

Taxpayer-supported PSERS itself had denied an Inquirer request filed under the state’s right-to-know law for documents about the mistake. The fund also alerted Aon and two other consulting firms ACA Compliance Group and Buck Global LLC to the request. The news organization is appealing the denial.

Last year PSERS paid $762000 to Aon and $226000 to Buck for their work on the calculation among other tasks. It also paid $60000 to ACA to spot-check its math.

PSERS relies heavily on outside consultants and money managers — too heavily critics say — as the fund’s results have lagged those of other pension funds. Until this year the fund permitted outside firms to book extravagant travel arrangements for the fund’s 60-member investment unit. The money managers would front the cost and PSERS would later pay them back.

PSERS says it paid more than $700 million at last annual count in fees and profit sharing to more than 150 Wall Street firms and other private money managers. It also spent more than $14 million on consultants such as Hamilton Lane Aon ACA and Buck Global records show.

When the pension system in December adopted the bogus number for its performance it did so despite the objections of three board members. The three who abstained from approving the figure were former State Treasurer Joseph Torsella a Democrat; State Rep. Frank Ryan (R. Lebanon); and Richard Vague the state banking secretary appointed by Wolf a Democrat.

At that time PSERS’s chief investment officer James H. Grossman Jr. told the critics their concerns were groundless. “We did our due diligence” he said. “We covered it. I’m not worried about it.”

Torsella had previously warned top PSERS executives that the plan was newly using unaudited data instead of its own previously certified numbers. PSERS has refused to respond when asked if Torsella’ s criticism was confirmed by the subsequent reviews of the math.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWluc3VyZXIuY29tL25ld3MvcGNzLWVzdGltYXRlcy1odXJyaWNhbmUtaWRhLWxvc3Nlcy1hdC1hbG1vc3QtMjZibi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PCS estimates Hurricane Ida losses at almost $26bn,"PCS estimates Hurricane Ida losses at almost $26bn

erst-mcr.co.uk). Plates £5-£12 wines from £20

A restaurant menu can be the sweetest kind of promise: we have these ingredients; we have ways to prepare them; what would you like? But they are not straightforward documents. Some menus get it so very wrong. There are those that quietly murder the English language. Things are “nestled” in “symphonies”; there are “trios” and “melanges” and “mosaics” which make it sound less like dinner and more like an over-catered Roman orgy. Other menus fail by dint of being too long. Surely no kitchen can manage all these dishes or be fluent in the culinary vernaculars of Mexico Thailand Korea Goa and Dongbei?

Then there is the menu at Erst located amid the blocky red brick lanes of Ancoats England’s first industrial suburb not far from Manchester’s city centre. Like the polished concrete floors and the breezeblock walls the menu is sparse to the point of minimalism. I count just 10 savoury items. One of those is a bowl of olives with pickled chilli peppers. Two of them are bread-based. Another has a line through it. The mackerel didn’t arrive apparently. So nine dishes. Kind of. Because as I say one is olives and two are bread. Less the sweetest kind of promise and more of a shy whisper perhaps. There’s only one thing to do. We order the lot.

The result in its quiet unshowy way is one of the best meals of the year so far; a succession of modestly priced platefuls which bring on low groans and delicate sighs of happiness. And that’s even allowing for the fact that the olives and chillies are bought in. It starts quietly with a couple of Carlingford rock oysters dressed with a precisely judged spoonful of mignonette that simple dice of vinegared shallots with cracked black pepper. How very bracing.

Erst is sibling to the small group of Trove bakeries which started in Levenshulme in 2011 and quickly garnered a following for their ways with sourdough. Those baking chops become apparent in a sizeable disc of still-hot flatbread which isn’t flat at all. On the grill it has bulged and expanded blistered and broken. It is spread with freshly chopped tomato pulp grassy olive oil and a knuckle-crack of garlic. It is the very best take on that old Spanish stager pan con tomate. It manages to be crisp and soft sour and mellow all at the same time. It is the best £5 I have spent in a very long time. Alongside it we have ordered meaty Cantabrian anchovies floating on their olive oil pond with a generous dusting of chilli flakes. The anchovies find their way on to the bread. We stop talking to each other except to mutter: “This is bloody good isn’t it.” That’s a statement not a question and is met with the reply: “Very.”

View image in fullscreen ‘Such a smart idea’: steak tartare with vitello tonnato. Photograph: Shaw & Shaw/The Observer

We tell our waiter we’d like another. He reminds us that we’ve already ordered the other version which comes brushed fatly with garlic herb butter with a quenelle of bright white whipped lardo on the side. I spread it across the hot bread and watch it melt into the crevices. It’s dripping toast but as rebooted by Hollywood. It’s the George Clooney of garlic breads: elegant sophisticated but with substance underpinning the gloss and shimmer. See how good it is? It’s forced me to type utter blathering enthusiastic bollocks.

We have the thinnest slices of raw sea bass cured in an acidulated dressing punched up with fermented chilli and decorated with rings of cherry tomato. It’s vigorous and achingly fresh as if it’s only just been fetched from the surf. Next up a rough-cut steak tartare is topped with a fat dollop of the sauce that’s the key ingredient of vitello tonnato (essentially a mayonnaise blitzed with tuna anchovies and capers). It is such a smart idea I don’t know why I haven’t encountered it before. In vitello tonnato the sauce lubricates slices of veal. Why can’t it do the same job with steak tartare? For scooping purposes there are shards of the crispest cracker. Both of these plates are £12. We finish this sequence with a heaped salad of finely sliced lamb’s hearts pink at the eye with lettuce grilled green beans and what’s billed as a green chilli sauce. That dressing is a little bullying – and that’s the best I can manage by way of criticism.

Because oh look here come the fried potatoes. Seriously look at them: baked potatoes that have then been crushed with force until they are a mess of crevices and edges and folds. Next they have been deep fried with intent until they are the golden-brown of dry maple leaves in autumn. We break off one bit after another. Somewhere in the middle there might be soft potato. Mostly they are just the thrilling business end of crispness right to the heart. With them is a wild garlic tartare sauce. It is £5 worth of glorious crowd-pleasing fun.

This continues with the desserts which on that barely populated piece of paper offer little but which on the plate deliver so much. There is a bay leaf panna cotta with nectarines. The texture like the very best clotted cream is perfect. The flavouring just a hushabye of bay is spot on. And then there is a lemon sorbet a bellow of zest and juice and sugar served at the point when a scoop melts immediately to nothing on the tongue leaving only the lightest fizz of happiness.

Erst describes itself as “a natural wine bar and restaurant”. Our waiter one of the owners has noted my recent rant about the offering at Mangal 2. I tell him that my objection is not to low-intervention wines per se. It’s to nasty cloudy wines that smell of unwiped arse; the ones the truly dedicated natural wine fans seem to celebrate most ardently. He acknowledges the point and directs us to a lovely crisp dry Valdibella from Sicily for £30 which has no top notes of latrine.

At the end he offers us a glass of a low-intervention dessert wine. It is delicious full of honeyed tones dried fruits and the deep waft of Christmas. What matters is not ideology but whether the wine is any good. And with that inside us what had at first seemed an austere space of glass and stone of metal and nerdiness had instead become somewhere of soft edges warm intent and most importantly terrific food. The eerily quiet promise of that tiny sparse menu has been kept.

Every year in November and December the charity StreetSmart raises money for charities and projects tackling homelessness through the addition of a single £1 (after service and VAT) to each table’s bill in participating restaurants. Last year they raised a much needed £180000 but that was down from £760000 the year before due to the fall in restaurant trade as a result of Covid. At the same time the challenge of homelessness has risen so they need the 2021 campaign to be a big one. To find out more as a diner or even more importantly to participate in the campaign as a restaurant visit streetsmart.org.uk.

The order came seven months after the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) - India’s apex procurement body – accorded its acceptance of necessity (AoN) for the tanks. The Arjun Mk-1A is an upgraded version of the Arjun Mk-1 main battle tank (MBT) which is currently in army service.

The new tank will come with 72 upgrades over the existing variant including 14 major improvements officials familiar with the development said adding that the upgrades significantly enhance the tank’s lethality mobility and survivability.

“The Mk-1A is equipped with accurate and superior firepower all-terrain mobility and invincible multi-layered protection provided by an array of advanced technology systems. It can take on the enemy during day and night. By virtue of these capabilities this indigenous MBT will be on a par with any contemporary in its class across the globe” the defence ministry said in a statement on Thursday. The execution of the order is expected to involve 200 Indian vendors and generate 8000 jobs.

Five Mk-1A t tanks will be delivered within 30 months followed by 30 tanks every year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi handed over a prototype of the Arjun Mk-1A tank to the army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane in Chennai on February 14. The army’s existing fleet consists of T-90 T-72 and the Arjun Mk-1 tanks.

The improvements on the new tank include better firepower auto target tracker remote-controlled weapon system explosive reactive armour advanced laser warning and countermeasure systems containerised ammunition bin advanced land navigation systems and improved night vision capabilities as previously reported by HT.

The tank has been configured and designed for Indian conditions and is suitable for deployment to protect the frontiers defence ministry officials said.

However some experts have flagged concerns about the bulky tank saying its weight (68 tonne) could limit the army’s deployment options.

The Defence Research and Development Organisation’s Chennai-based Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (CVRDE) has designed and developed the tank. The Mk-1A tanks will be manufactured at the Ordnance Factory Board’s (OFB) Heavy Vehicles Factory at Avadi outside Chennai.

The tank order comes at a time when the OFB - India’s main producer of weapons and military equipment - is being corporatised to boost its efficiency and competitiveness in a long-awaited reform in the country’s defence manufacturing sector. The Union Cabinet headed by PM Narendra Modi had in June cleared the corporatisation of the board.

The OFB which controls 41 ordnance factories is being split into seven government-owned entities that will produce ammunition and explosives vehicles weapons and equipment troop comfort items optoelectronics gear parachutes and ancillary products.

Ordnance factories are currently engaged in the production of tanks armoured personnel carriers mine-protected vehicles bombs rockets artillery guns anti-aircraft guns parachutes small arms clothing and leather equipment for soldiers.

The development of the Mk-1A tank began in June 2010 and it was fielded for user trials two years later. Extensive trial evaluation was conducted in various phases covering 7000 km and substantial firing of various ammunitions during 2012-2015 the defence ministry statement said."

Apple's social and environmental initiatives are setting an example for other companies to follow according to Apple's Racial Equity and Justice Initiative program lead Alisha Johnson with businesses continuing to take over from governments in driving policy changes.

Apple is known to be a forward-thinking company with social outreach projects including its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative and environmental efforts an attempt to make the world a better place. In an interview executive Alisha Johnson offers that companies should be doing more for the world.

""You need businesses that are proactive that are continuing to push forward and really view it as a priority - not just as a PR statement but in the execution of their work"" Johnson said to Grazia in an interview.

On the Racial Equity and Justice Initiative's conception Johnson says it was started as Apple ""recognized that there was increased public awareness around these issues."" However this is all part of the usual decision-making process at Apple.

""This wasn't new work at Apple. It was already so much work that was happening that was focused on advancing equity and addressing systemic racism"" says Johnson. ""This effort helped us to really first identify work that was happening within the company put us under some key priority areas and then to grow that work.""

On climate change Johnson believes ""You can look at any region in the world and see the devastating impacts of climate change and it's not coming down the line. It's happening now."" Apple has to ensure it is centering action on ""communities that have been under-resourced"" and so cannot fully combat the ecological problem.

The interview also mentions Apple's pledge to become carbon neutral across its entire supply chain by 2030 as well as how the Impact Accelerator was created to invest in Black and Brown leaders in environmentally-focused innovations.

""It's the idea that we can help to scale some of these Black- and Brown-led businesses that are doing really interesting work in the environmental space with a focus on climate change but also on conserving resources and removing talcum from products"" said Johnson. ""We are ensuring that we are looking across our full environmental priorities and bringing in businesses that share those goals.""

In conclusion Johnson suggests Apple is trying to set the tone for the tech industry as a whole with its work. ""We want other companies to follow our example and we know that because we have a pretty big platform if we do something we are shining a light on what's possible.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbmFpcmFtZXRyaWNzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzI1L2hvdy1zdGV2ZS1qb2JzLW5leHQtYmlnLXRoaW5nLWNoYW5nZWQtdGhlLWdhbWUv0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly9uYWlyYW1ldHJpY3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMjUvaG93LXN0ZXZlLWpvYnMtbmV4dC1iaWctdGhpbmctY2hhbmdlZC10aGUtZ2FtZS8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Steve Jobs’ ‘next big thing’ changed the game,"For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise – Isaiah 9:5 KJV

On the 19th of August 2020 several news houses reported that Apple just crossed the $2 trillion market capitalization mark becoming only the second company ever to do so. Apple Inc is definitely a heavyweight in the corporate world today. They occupy a prestigious position many companies only dream of. What began at a garage in California is today the most profitable company in the world with devices services and ethos interwoven into much of modern daily life. Apple touches the lives of several people around the world in magnificent ways today giving real meaning to life. That is the true meaning of business to touch people’s lives in an exceptional way while making profit out of it.

Not many however can easily remember that Apple almost signed for bankruptcy just 24 years ago. Things got so bad for Apple that every analyst report indicated that Apple was definitely out of the game. As a matter of fact Dell CEO Michael Dell responding to an interview on what he would do if he was the Apple CEO said he will shut the whole thing down!

But Steve Jobs who just returned to Apple as CEO after he was forced to leave the company in 1986 didn’t think so. He thought Apple could not only survive but lead the market. In a 1998 interview after Steve Jobs has saved Apple he said his next move was to wait for ‘the next big thing’. This next big thing as it turned out was a chaos that overtook the music industry about the same period. His ability to see through the pattern in the chaos gave him the edge to dominate the market. The chaos was his profit.

Market leadership requires an understanding of your Industry and a unique positioning within the industry which gives the business the ability to create and capture value. As long as the industry structure remains unchanged and the business understands and executes their strategy effectively the business will profit. If the business has a superbly unique business approach it could lead the market.

But in highly competitive markets as many are today designing and sustaining a unique position in any industry isn’t a simple task. It takes a more-than-casual knowledge of strategy. It takes the executives committed to results rather than excuses blames and complaints. It takes the rare ability to recognize value lapses competitive loopholes industry structural imbalances competitive myopias strategy gaps tactical errors and the ability to leverage on them.

This was Steve Jobs advantage. He had the ability to see through the chaos in the music industry. He understood that the case in the industry wasn’t about piracy as the stakeholders saw it but about a structural imbalance created by disruption in technology. He knew that managing that imbalance was the key to victory not court cases. The .mp3 technology had given too much power to music buyers so reconceiving value delivery in the industry was key to leading the market. He was right his ‘next big thing’ was here and he leveraged it so well. His response to this chaos was the iPod and iTunes store and they spelt the beginning of Apple’s market leadership.

In ‘Art of War for Executives’ Donald Krause wrote ‘direct attacks generate emotion. For this reason develop certain devices which can be used to refocus attention.’ Chaos is among the top tools that can get people hyper-focused. During chaotic situations a great number of the stakeholders enter into what Wesley Wells called waking trance in 1924 and it refers to the concentration of attention on something. It means being hyper-focused on a subject to the exclusion of everything else.

Times of heightened focus are great moments for awakened executives because they know how to leverage them to their competitive advantage.

The key is to do your own thinking independently. You can’t even rely on the media and research institutions to understand what is happening because their being compromised might be the real strength of the chaos. In times of chaos keep Newton’s words in mind ‘an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by a force.’ So an industry structure will remain at rest or continue to move at a constant speed unless acted upon by a force.’ This force will disrupt the state of the industry and give only those who understand it an unfair advantage over the rest of the competition. Your job is to see things beyond how they appear to what they really are.

The next generation of embedded MRAM (magneto-resistive RAM) may boil down to changing the order of ingredients in the recipe.

Spin-orbit-torque (SOT) MRAM addresses the “trilemma” that Spin-transfer torque (STT) MRAM currently faces said Antaios CEO Jean-Pierre Nozières in an interview with EE Times. The significant voltage across the device tunnel oxide that’s required for writing means there is a continual tradeoff between data retention write endurance and write speed. That means even though it’s reached near maturity STT MRAM is still constrained when it comes to meeting the demands of high-speed RAM applications that require a combination of high speed and infinite endurance along with acceptable data retention.

Founded in 2017 Antaios began ramping its development efforts on third generation MRAM in 2019 by using SOT a spintronic effect that shows a lot of promise in overcoming the constraints of STT-MRAM and other previous generations of the technology without requiring major changes to manufacturing processes said Nozières. SOT-MRAM solves the trilemma by fully eliminating the high voltage across the device tunnel oxide during write which results in intrinsic unlimited endurance. “The current technology is limited to embedded flash replacements. You have the trilemma between retention speed and endurance.” By removing this constraint he said it opens the door to replacing incumbent memories including flash and SRAM in applications for high-speed applications that previous generations couldn’t address.

Another inherent benefit of SOT-MRAM is that it eliminates data-retention leakage current and is impervious to ionizing radiation data disturbance which are both severe issues for SRAM said Nozières. SOT-MRAM write energy also promises to be favorably lower compared to STT-MRAM due to its very high-speed writing. “It’s a giant leap in terms of system level performance.”

One of the early applications for SOT-MRAM include CPU last-level-cache either as part of a traditional embedded architecture or as an alternate 3D assembly technique that leverages “die-on-die” from different wafers with different process for high-end CPUs with very large caches. Nozières said both are fully compatible with the SOT-MRAM process flow under development.

Another promising use case for SOT-MRAM is for artificial intelligence (AI) in edge devices he said of which most operate in von Neumann architectures and use large amounts of external off-chip memory. On-chip SOT-MRAM could operate like a cache/working-memory for which speed and endurance are key while requiring significantly less power.

Microcontroller architectures could also benefit from SOT-MRAM. The current separate flash “control store” block and SRAM block architectures is akin to constantly shuffling books around on a bookshelf to accommodate additions. “You’re just swapping your books on the shelves which takes a lot of time and energy” said Nozières. “That’s exactly what’s happening inside the microcontroller.” Because SOT-MRAM can simultaneously achieve embedded flash-like data retention with main-memory read and write cycle times in the 10ns and faster range it would allow for a single “execute-in-place” (XIP) block with substantial improvements in power performance and cost.

SOT-MRAM still has a long way to go he said but Antaios’ approach is not to do everything itself but instead forming relationships including on the manufacturing side. Last year it secured investment funding led by French venture capital firms Innovacom and Sofimac Innovation together with Silicon Valley-based Applied Ventures LLC the venture capital arm of Applied Materials Inc. Nozières said the company is looking to take advantage of the ecosystem around MRAM noting that now defunct Spin Memory burned through a great deal of cash by trying to do everything including manufacturing.

Today’s STT MRAM Like SOT is based on spin-transfer effects but there is no need for a magnetic layer to spin-polarize the electrical current. The source of spins is simply the lattice of a SOT layer material via the spin-orbit interaction. This makes SOT a straightforward extension of today’s MRAM technologies already in production in major foundries Nozières said so there’s no need “evangelize” the market to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to implement new tools and new materials. He likens both STT-MRAM and SOT-MRAM to a BLT only the order of the ingredients is different in each. But despite the simple analogy SOT-MRAM is still in infancy and the expectation is that SOT-MRAM might be available for commercial applications some time in 2024.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Le suspense n’aura pas duré très longtemps à Whistling Straits. Alors que les Etats-Unis ont démarré la dernière journée de la Ryder Cup dévolue aux simples avec six points d’avance les joueurs de Steve Stricker ont bouclé l’affaire à l’issue du cinquième match disputé ce dimanche dans le Wisconsin. Un retournement de situation n’était toutefois pas totalement à écarter avec des Européens prêts à croiser le fer avec les Américains pour défendre jusqu’au bout le titre remporté en 2018 au Golf National de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines. D’entrée Rory McIlroy a donné ce peu d’espoir aux hommes de Padraig Harrington.

En effet ne concédant que deux trous le 7 et le 13 au champion olympique Xander Schauffele le Nord-Irlandais s’est montré solide. Empochant pas moins de cinq trous Rory McIlroy a conclu son match à l’arrivée du trou numéro 16 (3&2) mais ce sixième point n’a pas lancé une dynamique permettant au Vieux Continent de faire douter les Américains. En effet dans la foulée Patrick Cantlay a nettement dominé Shane Lowry. Si l’Irlandais a démarré fort en remportant le trou numéro 2 l’Américain a répondu avec une série de quatre trous remportés consécutivement.

Morikawa a terminé le travail

S’imposant sur le 10 puis le 12 Shane Lowry a maintenu le match en vie revenant à une longueur de son adversaire. Mais Patrick Cantlay a placé un dernier coup d’accélérateur avec le 14 le 15 et enfin le 16 tombant dans son escarcelle pour conclure le match (4&2). Scottie Scheffler a infligé au numéro 1 mondial Jon Rahm un résultat similaire. L’Américain a assommé d’entrée l’Espagnol en dominant les quatre premiers trous. La réaction de Jon Rahm au numéro 5 n’a été qu’une péripétie. Les deux joueurs se sont alors rendu coup pour coup du 11 au 15 mais c’est bien l’Américain qui l’a emporté (4&3).

Démarrer fort Bryson DeChambeau l’a également fait contre Sergio Garcia avec trois des cinq premiers trous en sa faveur. Toutefois l’Espagnol ne s’est pas laissé abattre dominant les trous 3 et 5. Mais la puissance de l’Américain a fait merveille sur le 7 puis le 9. Les échanges de politesse du 12 au 15 a permis à Bryson DeChambeau de valider sa victoire (3&2) rapprochant les Etats-Unis à un demi-point de la victoire. Dans un match indécis contre Viktor Hovland c’est à l’issue du trou numéro 17 que Collin Morikawa a apporté ce point décisif à la sélection américaine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhhbGltYXNuLmNvbS9sb3JzZS11bi1vdXRpbC1kZS1sZXRhdC1xdWktdmEtYWxsZWdlci1sZXMtcHJpeC1zdXItbGUtbWFyY2hlLXBhci1hbHktc2FsZWgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,L’ORSE : Un outil de l’Etat qui va alléger les prix sur le marché (Par Aly Saleh),"Après son premier Conseil d’administration tenu le week-end dernier le Directeur Général de l’Organe de Régulation du Système de Récépissé d’Entrepôt de marchandises au Sénégal (ORSRE) Driss Junior Diallo s’est prêté à nos questions pour lever un coin du voile sur la portée économique et sociale de cette institution publique mise en place par l’Etat et la SFI filiale de la Banque mondiale pour servir de mécanisme innovant de financement du développement.

De la régularisation du marché à la stabilité des prix de productions agricoles le Système de Récépissé d’Entrepôt (SRE) arrive à point nommé.

En effet les spécialistes du developpement et de l’économie n’ont pas tord de fonder beaucoup d’espoir sur l’Organe de Régulation du Système de de d’Entrepôt de marchandises au Sénégal (ORSRE). Ainsi à travers la mise en œuvre du mécanisme SRE (Système de Récépissé d’Entrepôt) qui exige la conjugaison de plusieurs facteurs le Sénégal va réussir par le biais de cet instrument financier innovant à stabiliser les prix dont la hausse est parfois due à une inflation importée.

Aujourd’hui que le gouvernement a pris des mesures destinées à ramener les prix à leur niveau antérieur il est possible dans la même logique de faire recours au SRE en assurant aux producteurs locaux un marché d’écoulement de leurs productions particulièrement des productions agricoles. Une prouesse que l’Etat du Sénégal a réalisée depuis 2007 dans le domaine de l’horticulture dans la spéculation sur les prix de l’oignon.

Selon Driss Junior Diallo Directeur de l’ORSE ces mesures de régulation sont une forme d’assurance du marché aux producteurs nationaux:

« Dans ce schéma d’efficience certifiée il est evident qu’en assurant aux producteurs un marché d’écoulement l’Etat assiste à une tendance d’accroissement de la production. A cette production qui augmente il faut donner des infrastructures de conservation et aux commerçants des infrastructures de stockage ».

Toujours à en croire notre interloculeur à l’échelle des producteurs le SRE permet de placer la récolte dans un entrepôt destiné à conserver les productions. Pendant que la marchandise est en entrepôt le producteur peut lever un récépissé qui lui permet de satisfaire ses besoins primaires ou urgents.

« A ce stade la production est conservée évitant ainsi les pertes post récoltes qui sont source de renchérissement du prix de vente des produits. Justement c’est à ce niveau que le SRE permet de stabiliser voire même de réduire les prix des productions.

Si le producteur lève un financement au niveau d’une institution il peut aller recommencer à produire doté qu’il est d’un pouvoir d’achat réel de vaquer à son business en tant qu’acteur économique » a laissé entendre le Directeur de L’ORSE qui ajoute aussi que « le commerçant a lui la possibilité de s’approvisionner directement au niveau des entrepôts agréés par l’ORSRE. Dans cette chaîne parfaitement organisée il a l’assurance de trouver des produits de qualité et en quantité suffisante. Le SRE ayant mis en place un cadre d’interaction des acteurs qui permet d’éviter des intermédiaires source du renchérissement des prix ».

A signaler que selon toujours Mr Diallo la conjugaison des facteurs liés à l’existence d’une infrastructure de conservation sera en même temps une source d’approvisionnement pour des produits de qualité garantie en quantité suffisante et sans intermédiaire.

Il permet d’approvisionner le marché et ou maintenir les prix des productions agricoles à un tarif à la portée du pouvoir d’achat du consommateur. Ceci tout en permettant de maintenir une offre sur une longue période évitant ainsi des importations qui sont souvent la cause de la flambée des prix du marché.

As the cream of female film talent including Hollywood’s Meryl Streep and Britain’s Andrea Arnold prepare to receive significant career awards a dark cloud is threatening. It is expected that new allegations of the abuse of women in the European entertainment industry will be made public which may overshadow the sparkle of a feminist Croisette.

Streep’s screen achievements will be celebrated with an honorary Palme d’Or at the opening ceremony while a day later Arnold the acclaimed British film director will receive the prestigious Carosse d’Or from the French director’s guild. And on Sunday another influential British film personality will be saluted when diversity champion Dame Donna Langley the chairman and chief content officer at NBCUniversal is to be honoured with the Women in Motion Award at a lavish dinner. All this comes in a year that also sees the American director Greta Gerwig best known for last summer’s Barbie presiding over a jury that features the campaigning stars Eva Green and Lily Gladstone. But the story of the 77th festival will not be all positive for women.

In the run-up to the annual gathering on the Côte d’Azur rumours have been widespread in France of the existence of a secret list of 10 men in the industry including leading actors and directors who have been abusive to women. The names described as “explosive” are believed to have been sent anonymously to the National Centre for Cinema in Paris along with other leading film finance companies in France.

According to reports in Le Figaro and the satirical magazine Le Canard enchaîné festival organisers have set up a crisis management team to respond to the accusations. Films might have to be dropped from the screening timetable if they involve implicated names.

The impending revelations may prove an apt curtain-raiser for the Wednesday premiere of a short French film Moi Aussi about abuse in the industry. The film which was added to the festival’s Un Certain Regard programme at the last minute is predicted to prove just as incendiary as the list owing to its emotive content.

Made by actor Judith Godrèche dubbed the “ambassador of #MeToo” in France it draws on the words of many female contributors and takes the form of a choral piece uniting different personal accounts. “Suddenly before me was a crowd of victims a reality that also represented France so many stories from all social backgrounds and generations” Godrèche has explained. “Then the question was what I was going to do with them? What do you do when you’re overwhelmed by what you hear by the sheer volume of testimonies?”

The 52-year-old actor first shook up French cinema in February when she accused the directors Jacques Doillon and Benoît Jacquot of having raped her in the 1980s when she was a teenager. Jacquot 77 Godrèche said had a relationship with her when she was under the age of consent. He denies committing any offences and has said that he was “under her spell”. She claims Doillon 80 forced her to take part in a gratuitous sex scene on his 1989 film La Fille de 15 ans (The 15-year-old Girl). He says she agreed to take part in the scene in which he also acted and he denies rape or assault. Godrèche followed up her accusations a month later with a speech at France’s high-profile Cesar awards in which she claimed the film industry had been a cover for exploiting underaged actors.

The effect of new abuse allegations and all the honours being heaped on influential women will certainly mean the opening of the 2024 festival is in strong contrast to last year. Last May demonstrators on the Croisette opposed Johnny Depp’s appearance in the opening film Jeanne du Barry. They were angry about recent abuse allegations against him involving his ex-wife Amber Heard that led to his defeat in a British libel trial although a month later he won a similar libel trial in an American court.

A more progressive tone should be set by Streep’s opening honour made in recognition of “countless masterpieces” over 50 years of cinema. “To stand in the shadow of those who have previously been honoured is humbling and thrilling in equal part” said Streep on hearing of the award.

London-born Langley a “trailblazing” studio chief is also being rewarded next weekend for fostering “a more inclusive industry” over two decades with films that “provide a platform for women”. Away from film sets Langley has also campaigned as a board member of Vital Voices and is a founder of the Hollywood Reporter’s Women in Film mentorship programme. Previous winners of the Women In Motion award include Jane Fonda Salma Hayek Viola Davis and last year Michelle Yeoh.

Arnold whose new film Bird is showing in the main competition this year will receive her award after a Wednesday screening of her 2006 film Red Road. Set in Glasgow it tells of a false accusation of rape made vengefully by a female CCTV operator.

Jury-member Green is one of the more prominent actors to have accused Harvey Weinstein of making inappropriate advances. In 2017 the actor said she had to push away the disgraced producer during a business meeting in Paris. “I got away without it going further but the experience left me shocked and disgusted” she said.

The reaction to the #MeToo movement in France has been slower and more nuanced than in America. The legendary actor Catherine Deneuve was among those to initially play down the importance of prosecuting the bad behaviour of men defending their so-called “right to pester”. But last week French legislators agreed to a government inquiry into sexual and gender-based violence across the country’s performing arts and fashion sectors. And in the autumn French actor Gérard Depardieu stands trial on charges of sexually assaulting two women on the set of The Green Shutters. He faces rape charges in another case and is under investigation over allegations of assault. He denies all charges.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTIvdXMvdWNsYS1jb3VudGVycHJvdGVzdGVycy1wb2xpY2UtcmVzcG9uc2UuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Chaotic Night at U.C.L.A. Raises Questions About Police Response,"Nearly two weeks after a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of California Los Angeles was attacked by counterprotesters university officials still have not explained why security officers stood by for hours while the attack was underway nor have they arrested any of those who swarmed in wielding metal rods water bottles and firecrackers in one of the worst outbreaks of violence in the college protests that have rocked the country.

The extent of the policing failure has become clearer in recent days as witnesses have come forward to describe a chaotic night of violence on April 30 in which students and bystanders repeatedly called 911 and nonemergency lines finding little help and calls that were disconnected. A dispatcher told one caller pleading for help that they were ending the call because “I have actual emergencies to handle.”

One man was filmed by a local television station on the phone with emergency dispatchers alerting them that people were getting hurt. “Security has abandoned this encampment” he could be heard saying before lowering his phone and looking at it. “They just hung up on me again” he said incredulously.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzExL2xpZmVzdHlsZS93aGF0LXRvLW9yZGVyLWF0LW1jZG9uYWxkcy13aGVuLXlvdXJlLXRyeWluZy10by1sb3NlLXdlaWdodC_SAWhodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8xMS9saWZlc3R5bGUvd2hhdC10by1vcmRlci1hdC1tY2RvbmFsZHMtd2hlbi15b3VyZS10cnlpbmctdG8tbG9zZS13ZWlnaHQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I'm a dietitian — here's what to order at McDonald's when you're trying to lose weight,"When trying to lose weight conventional wisdom might dictate that the first thing to do is stop going to fast food restaurants but let’s be realistic — we’re Americans we’re out on the road and what’s out along those roads?

Burger chains chicken chains taco chains — all with their irresistible nobody-has-to-know drive-thru options.

And out of all those options the one we’re likely to be most frequently presented with is but of course McDonald’s.

And while the Golden Arches might seem like more of a hindrance than a help in the battle against excess pounds informed diners don’t have to be afraid to visit one of the world’s most ubiquitous restaurants — they just have to know how to order from the menu.

By using the same rules you’d use anywhere else — yes to lean proteins yes to veggies and don’t overeat — you’d be amazed how well you can do one expert explained.

Dietitian Kristen Carli owner of Camelback Nutrition & Wellness shared her go-to order with the fast food experts at Eat This Not That! — here are her picks for the best lunch order at McDonald’s for weight loss.

What to order at McDonald’s when you’re trying to lose weight

3 Keep it simple with a classic all-beef hamburger hold the high-calorie frills. McDonald's

“The best lunch order for weight loss is the McDonald’s Classic Burger with a side of apple slices and an unsweetened iced tea” Carli wrote.

“Opting for a basic burger such as a McDonald’s hamburger or cheeseburger provides protein and some carbohydrates without excess calories from cheese or mayo” she said.

“Choosing apple slices as a side adds fiber and natural sweetness without added sugars or fat. Selecting unsweetened tea keeps your drink calorie-free and helps you stay hydrated. This meal provides a great balance of protein carbohydrates and fiber which can help keep you satisfied while managing your calorie intake” the pro explained.

The meal tops off at just 250 calories believe it or not and packs a healthy 12 grams of protein — what Carli calls “your BFF for weight loss” and the “superhero of nutrients” for the way it fills you up helping you to avoid eating snacks between meals.

The apple slices instead of fries — and the unsweet tea instead of soda — makes this meal seem downright healthy.

Just make sure not to load the hamburger up with cheese and mayo and the like Carli warned — content yourself with onions pickle and ketchup.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJ5YW5yb2JpbnNvbi8yMDI0LzA1LzExL3JhZGljYWwtb3B0aW1pc20td2hlbi15b3UtZ2V0LXBlc3NpbWlzdGljLWF0LXdvcmstZG8tdGhlc2UtMTAtdGhpbmdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Radical Optimism: When You Get Pessimistic At Work Do These 10 Things,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2024/05/11/radical-optimism-when-you-get-pessimistic-at-work-do-these-10-things/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvYnJ5YW5yb2JpbnNvbi8yMDI0LzA1LzExL3JhZGljYWwtb3B0aW1pc20td2hlbi15b3UtZ2V0LXBlc3NpbWlzdGljLWF0LXdvcmstZG8tdGhlc2UtMTAtdGhpbmdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

It can also be used for visualisation of these models for studying all its details.

Popular 3D Printing Applications in the Architecture Sector

Architectural Concept Models

Every architectural project begins with a concept or an idea. This idea is then translated from the designer’s mind onto a paper and can now be 3D printed into a physical object.

This fundamental model assists architects in communicating their ideas to their clients. Because of 3D printing concept models can now be extremely detailed replicating all of the minute features that will be seen on the final product. In comparison to the previous technique of hand-made models 3D printing makes it much easier to create such intricate models. The task becomes not only simpler but also faster and less expensive.

Buildings & Structures

This is one of the most rapidly growing 3D printing applications in the architecture industry. Many start-ups around the world are developing concrete 3D printers and building structures houses buildings office spaces and even infrastructure such as bridges.

This application is gaining popularity as a solution to the global housing crisis.

Art

3D printing is not restricted to the creation of geometrically symmetrical objects or the for simple structures. It provides a much more complex type of manufacturing tool. Artists can use this tool to create abstract designs and have them 3D printed into solid objects.

The level of complexity through 3D printing is unprecedented and hence an increasing number of artists are experimenting with 3D printing technology to create art that was previously impossible.

Conclusion

The above list of CAD modelling software for architecture applications will be highly useful for all types of users from students to experts who operate in the architectural field.

The scammers target victims by sending out a text message posing as Bank of America and issuing a fake ""fraud alert"" saying a $3500 transaction has been attempted on Zelle.

4 Thousands of people across the US have reported the scam

One of the victims a school nurse in the San Francisco area named Page Pollack said she was targeted just as she was trying to get students back in school safely amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

The fraudsters targeted Pollack as she was on her way to the airport in July she told KGO-TV.

""3500 is a lot of money to me"" she said.

The text message she received read: ""Bank of America Fraud Alert - Did you attempt a Zelle transaction of $3500? Reply yes of no or 1 to decline fraud alerts.""

""I saw Bank of America on the caller ID so I thought 'OK this is legit'"" Pollack told the outlet.

She said she replied ""no"" and immediately received a call. Caller ID said it was Bank of America.

Pollack explained that the man on the line told her to push several buttons on the Zelle app and then put her on hold.

""By that time I was panicked because I had to get to the airplane"" she said.

""My flight was leaving and something [about the call] just was not sitting right with me.""

It turns out Pollack was one of thousands who were targeted by the fraudsters who pose as Bank of America.

The scammers were able to take $3500 out of her account using Zelle.

Bank of America initially denied her claim of fraud but eventually Pollack was able to get her $3500 back.

The bank has since issued a warning that it would never call a customer and ask them to stop fraud by using the Zelle money app or any other transfer.

If you receive a call Bank of America has requested that its customers call them directly using the number on the back on your debit card or bank statement.

Customers should also avoid responding directly to texts.

The oldest millennial and oldest Gen Zer are in charge right now – of spending influence and the economy.

The 40-year-old's financial behavior is shaping huge economic markets like housing.

Meanwhile the 24-year-old is setting trends affecting consumer behavior for everyone.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

The 40-year-old and the 24-year-old are the talk of the town right now.

The oldest millennial who turns 40 this year has the most spending power. They've mostly recovered from a decade-long struggle following the 2008 financial crisis and they're spending on the biggest purchase of their lives: houses.

The oldest Gen Zer who turns 24 this year has more sway in consumer behavior. A decade before they replace millennials as the largest spenders they're already seen as tastemakers a role every generation takes on during this life stage.

Everything from your buying choices to your lifestyle choices are likely being shaped by the oldest members of these generations.

Meet the people shaping the world you'll live in for the next decade or two.

The 40-year-old millennial has spending power

Millennials have become the economic driving force in America. They're the largest generation represent the biggest percentage of the country's workforce and hold the most purchasing power.

As millennials age and their incomes grow their spending power is only set to increase. Just look at the wave of coming millennial spending power in the chart below. The 40-year-old leads the way.

!function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message""(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}();

While they were some of those hardest hit by the Great Recession many have made wealth-building strides in recent years. In 2016 their wealth levels were 34% below where they should have been but as the economy improved and they neared their prime earning years they narrowed that deficit to 11% in 2019. The pandemic's economic shutdown also enabled the wealthier cohort to sock away even more money.

That means they're the ones doing a whole lot of spending on big ticket items like housing. Most 40-year-olds have a mortgage making them the tip of the generational spear that is leading the pandemic housing boom. Not only is this homebuying spree injecting needed money into the economy it's reshaping the real estate market. Migration out west and to the Sunbelt has been an economic boon for bigger cities in the region while the ""Great American land rush"" has seen millennials snap up nearly every starter home on the market.

But there's also something to be said for the 40-year-old millennial who can't spend very much because they haven't financially recovered from the Great Recession. Many are still burdened with debt like student loans. The affordability crisis they're facing may trigger policy changes such as wiping out student debt which lawmakers are currently debating.

The 24-year-old Gen Zer has influencing power

As the oldest millennial has entered middle age the oldest Gen Zer has become a trendsetter.







This is the life stage when a new generation enters the spotlight because they're old enough to begin exerting influence Jason Dorsey who runs the Center for Generational Kinetics a research firm in Austin Texas recently told Insider.

That's exactly what Gen Z has done since they've emerged from the pandemic as the new ""it"" generation. They've sent middle parts baggy jeans and Y2K fashion to the streets and skinny jeans and side parts to the wayside leading the way in consumer trends.

At the center of this cultural shift was TikTok which blew up during the pandemic. By September 2020 the social media app grew by 75% expanding into intergenerational use and signaling the growing influence of Gen Z in leading consumer behavior – the same way millennials did with Instagram.

In a little over a decade Gen Z will be taking over the economy. Gen Z currently earns $7 trillion across its 2.5 billion-person cohort according to Bank of America Research. By 2025 that income will grow to $17 trillion and by 2030 it will reach $33 trillion representing 27% of the world's income and surpassing that of millennials the following year.

With this kind of influence Dorsey predicts the generation will continue to shift and drive conversation for the next 15 years.

The world is responding. Politicians and lawmakers are debating how to solve the economic issues plaguing millennials while brands are trying to figure out how they can market to Gen Z. They already know we're living in the world made by the mid-20s and early 40s."

Nelson Peltz is an investor businessman and founding partner of Trian Fund Management.

Get Our Activist Investing Case Study! Get The Full Activist Investing Study In PDF

He started his career as a delivery driver for his grandfather’s food distribution business A. Peltz and Sons. Ultimately he and his brother ended up running the company acquiring other companies and listing it as Flagstaff Corp.

Peltz and CFO Peter May left the company in 1983 and bought Triangle Industries which manufactured vending machines. They used the company to make a series of acquisitions before selling the company to Pechiney SA in 1988.

Peltz and May’s next company was Triarc Cos which they used to make opportunistic acquisitions of companies that found themselves in trouble. In 1997 Triarc bought Snapple from Quaker Oats and in 2000 sold it to Cadbury Schweppes - this turnaround play was eventually featured as a case study at Harvard Business School.

Peltz May and Edward Garden founded Trian Fund Management in 2005 to focus on activist investing. The company now called Trian Partners manages $12 billion.

As a result of his activist investing Peltz has found himself on the board of numerous corporations over the years. He is currently Chairman of Wendy’s Company (NasdaqGS: WEN) and serves on the boards of Legg Mason (NYSE: LM) Proctor and Gamble (NYSE: PG) Ingersoll Rand (NYSE:IR) and Mondelez International (NasdaqGS: MDLZ).

Peltz has built a personal fortune of $1.68 billion during his career. In 2013 Forbes magazine listed him as one of the top 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers for the year. The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) has also recognized Peltz as one of the most influential people in corporate governance.

The Old School Activist Investor

Nelson Peltz would be best described as an activist investor. His style of investing has as much to do with operational issues as it does with traditional investment factors like valuation.

Unlike many other investors Peltz rose through the ranks of an industrial company. No doubt he uses this experience when restructuring troubled companies. The first business he ran was in the food distribution and wholesaling industry and the second was an industrial manufacturing business. Since then Peltz has never strayed from these two industries preferring to stick to what he knows (i.e. circle of competence).

Trian only invests in companies if Peltz believes he can gain a seat on the board and make fundamental changes to the structure of the company and the way it is run.

Over the years Trian has invested in Heinz Cadbury Kraft Foods Wendy’s DuPont PepsiCo and Family Dollar. Most of these investments were made with the intention of also bringing about structural or leadership changes at the companies.

Peltz’s first high-profile turnaround success was Snapple. The Quaker Oats Company had bought it for $1.7 billion but ran into cash flow difficulties. Peltz then managed to buy the company for $300 million in 1997 return it to profitability and then sell it to Cadbury Schweppes for $1.45 billion in 2000.

In 2008 Trian used its holding in Triarc Cos to acquire Wendy’s. Triarc already owned Arby’s restaurants and the two chains were merged. Arby’s was later sold to Roark Capital Group leaving Trian in control of Wendy’s. Peltz often uses one company to acquire a larger company before spinning off the smaller business.

Peltz’s strategies often rely heavily on changing the makeup of the board of a company. Sometimes these attempts are successful but just as often they fail.

In 2013 Trian bought a $1.2 billion stake in Du Pont and began pushing for four new board members to be appointed. Though the bid was unsuccessful it did eventually result in the CEO resigning and the company embarking on a cost-cutting plan.

In 2017 Trian bought a significant stake in Proctor and Gamble and pushed for Peltz to be appointed to the board. There was significant initial push back but he ultimately gained a seat on the board in December prompting speculation that the company may eventually split into two.

Trian Fund Management's Latest Form 13F Filing

On November 14th 2017 Nelson Peltz's firm Trian Fund Management filed their quarterly Form 13F regulatory filing. I reviewed the 13F filing to review holdings in Trian Fund Management's 8 stock portfolio.

Trian Fund Management's stock portfolio totals $13.0 billion according to the latest filing. The list value of stock holdings is down -2.1% when compared to the last quarter. As a benchmark the S&P 500 was up 3.9% over the same period.

Quarter-over-Quarter Turnover (QoQ Turnover) measures the level of trading activity in a portfolio. Trian Fund Management's QoQ Turnover for the latest quarter was 9.8% so the firm likely has high conviction in these holdings as indicated by the low turnover ratio.

Trian Fund Management's Stock Holdings

The Ideas section of finbox.io tracks top investors and trending investment themes. You can get the latest data on the holdings discussed below at the Nelson Peltz page. The following table summarizes his firm's entire stock holdings reported in the last filing:

Trian Fund Management Largest Holdings Ticker Name Holding ($mil) % Of Portfolio PG Procter and Gamble $3448.9 26.6% SYY Sysco Corp. $2400.4 18.5% MDLZ Mondelez Intl Inc. $1728.2 13.3% GE General Electric Co. $1713.2 13.2% BK Bank of New York Mellon $1186.3 9.1% PNR Pentair PLC $1033.1 8.0% DWDP DowDuPont Inc. $867.2 6.7% WEN Wendys Co. $606.2 4.7%

Although Trian Fund Management does not take a large number of positions the firm makes huge bets on the positions it does take. The average value from each of the eight positions is a sizeable $1.6 billion!

Managers with more than $100 million in qualifying assets under management are required to disclose their holdings to the SEC each quarter via 13F filings. Qualifying assets include long positions in U.S. equities and ADRs call/put options and convertible debt securities. Shorts cash positions foreign investments and other assets are not included. It is important to note that these filings are due 45 days after the quarter end date. Therefore Trian Fund Management's holdings above represent positions held as of September 30th and not necessarily reflective of the fund's current stock holdings.

However most can agree that with thousands of stocks traded on U.S. exchanges doing thorough research on each one is nearly impossible for smaller investors. Leveraging the resources of the largest hedge funds on Wall Street can be a powerful way to narrow down the list.

As of this writing I did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities and this is not a buy or sell recommendation on any security mentioned.",,,,,,,,,

Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Stuart's try came after another strong drive as Newcastle made their superior territory and possession count.

Global Citizen Live represents a call to action to end extreme poverty and build momentum ahead of the G20 Summit in October and UN Climate Conference COP26 in November.

The campaign calls on world leaders businesses and philanthropists to urgently commit resources to: meet the $15-20 billion funding shortfall of the $100 billion promised annually to the most vulnerable countries confronting climate change; businesses to help curb emissions through joining the Race to Zero campaign and pledging 1 billion additional trees by 2022 in support of the 1t.org ambition to conserve restore and grow 1 trillion trees this decade; $6 billion to provide food to 41 million people facing famine; 2 billion COVID-19 vaccines to be redistributed to low-income countries by early 2022; and for Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna to share mRNA technology with the WHO-backed Africa mRNA vaccine hub.

More than US$1.1 billion 157 million trees and over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines were announced during Global Citizen Live thanks to partnerships between government philanthropy non-governmental organizations and the private sector.

Global Citizen Live featured a remarkable lineup of world leaders advocates and artists supporting the campaign and its mission to end extreme poverty. Across seven continents tens of thousands of Global Citizens were in attendance over 24 hours as millions streamed the live broadcast event globally.

As a result of the hard work of many partner organizations the Global Citizen Live campaign announced:

157 million trees including 77 million trees by 2022; and more than US$300M to defend the planet

“Quite rightly future generations will hold us responsible. So join me and with one loud and united global voice call on the biggest greenhouse gas emitters — the G20 group of nations — to make much bolder commitments to cut emissions"" COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma told the audience during the New York event. “Call on the richest countries to make good on their promise of money to support developing countries deal with the impacts of climate change and call on world leaders to deliver an outcome at Glasgow we can all be proud of.”

Over US$800 million to defeat poverty and address hunger crises.

“Shame on us. At the height of COVID-19 the billionaires’ average net worth increase per day was $5 billion. And yet I am begging to feed the poor! Shame on us ... If we do not act today millions will starve nations will destabilize and millions will migrate by necessity"" said World Food Programme Executive Director David Beasley. ""If we are struggling today with a population of over 7 billion what do you expect will happen when there are over 10 billion people on earth by 2050? And by 2050 due to climate change we anticipate over 1 billion people to be displaced around the world! Wake up New York. Wake up Planet Earth.""

Over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines for those most in need.

“We have what we need to vaccinate the world. But the experts told us here’s what’s getting in the way: They said many countries are ready to produce vaccines at home. Yet they aren’t allowed to because ultra-wealthy pharmaceutical companies are not sharing the recipes to make them. These countries have the means ability and the workers to start manufacturing. All they are waiting for is the vaccine intellectual property to be transferred over” said Prince Harry The Duke of Sussex during the New York show.

“Every single person on this planet has a fundamental right to get this vaccine. That’s the point — yet that’s not happening. While in this country (and many others) you can go almost anywhere and get vaccinated billions around the world cannot. This year the world is expected to produce enough doses to meet the target of vaccinating 70% of people in every single country. But it is wrong that so much of the vaccine supply has only gone to just 10 wealthy nations so far and not everyone else” said Meghan The Duchess of Sussex.

Announcements were made by the European Commission the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) Belgium Colombia Croatia the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) France Germany Ireland Luxembourg the Netherlands Norway Spain United States UNESCO the Green Climate Fund and the Paris Peace Forum.

Global Citizen Live also saw announcements from the US states of Hawaii and Washington; the Brazilian states of Amapá Amazonas Ceará Piauí Pará and Paraíba; the City of Paris France; the municipality of Asker Norway; and 43 cities in Maharashtra State India.

Global Citizen presented Global Citizen Live a 24-hour global broadcast and streaming event featuring an extraordinary lineup of artists and performances from all over the world including: Lagos Paris New York City London Sydney Seoul Rio de Janeiro Los Angeles and Mumbai.

The 24-hour live broadcast event aired globally on ABC BBC FX iHeartRadio YouTube Twitter and other platforms to millions of viewers around the world. On-site safety and precautionary measures including mask-wearing social distancing and proof of vaccination were taken as part of all events which were attended in person by Global Citizen activists from around the world.

In the lead up to Global Citizen Live Global Citizen called on action takers to demand that the world's wealthiest nations redistribute 1 billion vaccine doses urgently this year and 1 billion more by early 2022; support the proposal to waive intellectual property rights on the production of COVID-19 vaccines and other medical tools backed by over 100 countries; and call on Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna to share mRNA technology with a new WHO-backed mRNA technology transfer hub based in South Africa.

Global Citizen also called on countries around the world to reduce fair share national emissions to prevent more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming and for developed nations to deliver on their promise to provide $100 billion annually to address the climate needs of developing countries. G7 nations and billionaires were also called on by Global Citizen and its partners to end the hunger crisis by contributing at least $6 billion for the urgent provision of millions of meals for 41 million people on the brink of famine.

Global Citizen Live represents an ongoing campaign led by citizens around the world to take action to urge governments corporations and philanthropists to make urgent change in line with the United Nations’ Global Goals and the Global Citizen Recovery Plan for the World.

“Global Citizen Live is not a celebration but an urgent call to action” said Mick Sheldrick co-founder and Chief Policy and Government Affairs Officer at Global Citizen. “We’re campaigning hard to get the world on track to end extreme poverty calling on world leaders to step-up at the G20 and COP26 summits. Global Citizen Live is the beginning of a month-long countdown!”

Global Citizen Live highlighted the efforts and announcements of 67 governments six philanthropic foundations and 40 corporate partners alongside global advocates and campaigners. Among millions of Global Citizens stood key global leaders partners and advocates at the forefront of Global Citizen’s mission to end extreme poverty: UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed Executive Director of the World Food Programme David Beasley CEO of Namati Vivek Maru Rotary President-elect Jennifer Jones Global Goals Champion and Advocate Eddie Ndopu President of the Ford Foundation Darren Walker President of the Paris Peace Forum Steering Committee Trisha Shetty Hip Hop Caucus President and CEO Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr. UN Next Generation fellow Valeria Colunga advocate Eunice Akoth and more.

“A Global Citizen is aware of the fact that we all share one planet one health one common destiny — and that every one of us matters” said Ursula von der Leyen president of the European Commission in support of the campaign. “Everyone can make a difference by working together finding global solutions to global problems with unity cooperation and solidarity.”

As leaders step up to curb emissions combat climate change and defend the planet at Global Citizen Live more ambition is needed ahead of the COP26 Climate Summit.

Global Citizen and its Race to Zero partners worked to secure commitments from many of the world’s largest companies and cities to develop verified science-based targets to reach net zero emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.

Corporate partners and cities signed up to the Race to Zero initiative a science-based campaign to drive climate targets in line with the Paris Agreement. Global Citizen Live saw 13 companies valued at $1.3 trillion in market capital join the Race to Zero initiative. New signers include five Fortune 100 companies the largest consumer goods company in the world the largest tool maker in the world and the largest hotel group in the world.

Private sector organizations that officially signed on to the Race to Zero as a part of the Global Citizen Live campaign include: Akamai Technologies American Express BD (Becton Dickinson and Company) Boston Scientific Corporation Cisco Delta Air Lines DocuSign IHG Hotels and Resorts Marriott International Inc. P&G Stanley Black & Decker and Starbucks who have each signed on to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5 and Citi which joined the Race to Zero via the Net Zero Banking Alliance.

Global Citizen also worked with existing Race to Zero members to join the campaign’s Climate Coalition aimed at encouraging peers vendors and partners to sign on to the Race to Zero ahead of COP26. Climate Coalition members include Amazon Bayer AG Boston Consulting Group Capgemini Dentsu International DocuSign HP Inc. Intuit Lendlease P&G RELX Salesforce Schneider Electric Uber Unilever Walmart Inc. and Zurich Insurance Group.

""Urgent and widespread climate action is vital to unlock the pace and scale of decarbonization required by science. Every nation company and individual must play their part. This innovative collaboration with Global Citizen has delivered additional major US businesses to our campaign for the world's most ambitious climate leaders. With just one month until the milestone climate conference COP26 we are now calling on more companies worldwide to join Business Ambition for 1.5 degrees Celsius and play their role in delivering bold climate action to halve global emissions by 2030"" said Tom Dowdall Science Based Targets Initiative Campaign Lead.

While Global Citizen has been in contact with hundreds of companies to sign on to Race to Zero many of the world’s largest companies and top emitters failed to respond to Global Citizen’s outreach after several attempts. These companies must step up to sign on to control their emissions and protect the planet now not later. Global Citizens will continue to campaign and call on these companies to join Race to Zero by COP26 in November this year.

Global Citizen also worked with American Forests and 1t.org to ensure a sustainable climate and a nature-positive planet by conserving restoring and growing trees supporting the global movement to save and restore 1 trillion trees by 2030. A total of 157 million trees will be protected and restored by 2030 including 77 million by the end of 2022.

Global Citizen Live received support from 12 members of the United States Congress calling for legislative measures to meet the goal of 100 million trees being protected conserved and planted in cities across America by 2030 including: Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) Rep. Nanette Barragán (CA-44) Rep. Donald McEachin (VA-4) Rep. Chellie Pingree (ME-1) Rep. Marcy Kaptur (OH-9) and Rep. Jimmy Panetta (CA-20).

⭕️ COVID-19 affects us all & we must unite in our response. THANK YOU @USAID 🇺🇸 & @SamanthaJPower for your commitment of $295M for COVID-19 aid as part of #GlobalCitizenLivepic.twitter.com/AO9L28cDY5 — Global Citizen Impact (@GlblCtznImpact) September 25 2021

Mayors governors and sub-national representatives also showed their support from around the world including: Lene Conradi Mayor of Asker Kommune Norway; Hilary Franz Commissioner of Public Lands Washington; David Ige Governor Hawaii; Anne Hidalgo Mayor Paris; and the Brazilian governors of Amapá (Waldez Góes) Amazonas (Wilson Miranda Lima) Ceará (Camilo Santana) Pará (Helder Barbalho) Paraíba (João Azevêdo) and Piauí (Wellington Dias).

""The protection of the wild is a major task of our generation. Global Citizens have called on leaders to take decisive steps in the right direction. We commend the Brazilian governors of Amapá Amazonas Ceará Pará Paraiba and Piauí for their commitments to environmental protection and strong climate actions"" said Rodrigo Medeiros of Re:Wild.

On Aug. 23 and in support of local advocates Coldplay invited eight Brazilian governors to join Global Citizen at Global Citizen Live in September to pledge to protect critical natural resources throughout their regions. Governors made announcements from across Brazil including six states from the Amazon at the front lines of climate change. The Brazilian states announced plans to reduce emissions increase the number of protected areas and create state-wide climate mitigation and adaptation plans.

Thank you for joining us at #GlobalCitizenLive@AminaJMohammed as we join in unity to defend the planet and defeat poverty! We greatly value our partnership with you and the @UNhttps://t.co/jc4IQFI78Dpic.twitter.com/O8rzPzLb4u — Hugh Evans (@Hughcevans) September 25 2021

This weekend’s announcements build on earlier commitments over the last 18 months as part of the Trillion Trees Campaign. Global Citizen Live celebrates the global 1t.org community for its commitment to conserve restore and grow trees including the following organizations with existing 1t.org pledges contributing to the trillion tree ambition by 2030: Amazon Aspiration AstraZeneca Clif Bar & Company HP Inc. Iberdrola Jonas Philanthropies Trees for Climate Health Initiative Nestlé Pottery Barn SAP SE tentree Travelers Unilever UPS and VMWare.

“It is inspiring to see the world’s largest companies governments and individuals of all ages unite to make ambitious commitments to protect and restore our planet. 1t.org’s collaboration with Global Citizen Live to scale investments in our trees and forests will be an integral part of the solution in tackling pressing ecological and societal challenges” said Nicole Schwab Co-Head of Nature-Based Solutions at the World Economic Forum. “Global Citizen Live shows that collective action at a global scale is possible.”

Leaders make commitments toward $100 billion climate promise but at least $15 billion shortfall remains ahead of COP26.

During UNGA leaders made commitments in support of honoring their promise to provide vulnerable countries with $100 billion annually to respond to climate change. During his UNGA address President Joe Biden announced that the US will increase its climate aid commitment to $11.4 billion by 2024. Despite being a step in the right direction this is still far less than what is contributed by the EU according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute. The G20 must keep their promise to provide an additional $100 billion annually to protect vulnerable nations from climate change. We have five weeks in order to meet this promise.

""The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how strongly the health of one person depends on the behaviour of the other. We need decisive action and solidarity both on individual and societal levels to leave the COVID-19 pandemic behind us. Today at Global Citizen Live I join Global Citizen's calls for more vaccine equity and a stronger commitment to an encompassing solution of the pandemic that is sensitive to the capacities and needs of different countries. I thank all Global Citizens for advocating and strongly supporting the work of WHO “ said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Director-General of World Health Organization.

During the Global Citizen Live campaign Italy committed to substantially increase its climate financing in the run-up to COP 26. Global Citizen will hold them accountable to this commitment.

From New York The Green Climate Fund supporting developing countries to reduce emissions and build resilience announced they would be accelerating the delivery of over $1.2 billion in the coming months.

Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez during his UNGA address and in response to a tweet from Coldplay announced €30 million for the Adaptation Fund an international fund that finances projects and programs aimed at helping developing countries to adapt to the harmful effects of climate change albeit much more is needed for Spain to meet its fair share.

Meanwhile both Denmark and Norway affirmed their commitments to significantly increase their climate financing commitments said Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen declaring:

“Denmark will contribute 1% of the collective target of $100 billion. And 60% of our climate aid will help developing countries adapt to climate change. If we can — G20 can! Let’s send a message to the G20 that cannot be misunderstood: Do not come empty-handed to Glasgow” said Frederiksen.

CODE RED. It’s no secret that the climate crisis is here & it’s a massive threat to our planet. The US has an opportunity to lead the world to a sustainable future. It starts with the #BuildBackBetter act. Join me alongside @GlblCtzn to take action to support. #CodeRedCongresspic.twitter.com/mRPVqeUJOt — Rachel Brosnahan (@RachelBros) September 24 2021

Global Citizen believes that Austria Australia Portugal Spain and Italy should also increase their contributions toward meeting the $100 billion pledge. We are grateful to ODI and Sarah Colenbrander for their analysis and support through the Global Citizen Live campaign. Global Citizen is urging US citizens to contact their local member of congress. The United States must live up to its promise.

Global Citizen Live calls code red for Congress and urges the United States Congress to pass most consequential climate legislation in US history.

“We have the chance to make history soon when Congress could pass essential climate legislation through the Build Back Better Act... We need a true groundswell of public support to show Congress that this critical legislation must pass without getting watered down” said Hip Hop Caucus President and CEO Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr.

Over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines pledged at Global Citizen Live in a step toward vaccine equity but too little too late as huge gap remains.

Inequitable vaccine distribution has left millions of vulnerable communities unprotected and reversed decades of progress against other infectious diseases and the broader Global Goals for Sustainable Development. To end this pandemic we must make the COVID-19 vaccines available to all everywhere. Global Citizen Live is grateful for its partnership with the ACT Accelerator the Pandemic Action Network the ONE Campaign and others in the collective effort to address vaccine inequity and injustice.

Extraordinary action is needed in the fight against COVID-19 and world leaders are uniquely positioned to enable a global recovery by ensuring everyone has access to life-saving vaccines tests and treatments. On Sept. 22 US President Biden convened world leaders to commit to vaccinate at least 70% of people in every country by this time next year to break the chain of transmission and end the pandemic. But more than promises are needed; without action the virus and its mutations will continue to threaten us all and undermine the global economy.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield took to the Global Citizen Live stage to reiterate the call for everyone to have access to COVID-19 vaccines especially vulnerable refugees whose circumstances have been further impacted by the pandemic. Global Citizen welcomes US leadership to galvanize efforts to vaccinate at least 70% of people in all countries by September 2022 but hopes to see this promise met by comprehensive action from the US. This includes sharing all excess and unused doses in hand or on order for 2021 as soon as possible providing funding and support to help lower income countries get doses from tarmac and into arms and critically by actively promoting an intellectual property waiver at the World Trade Organization and pushing pharma companies to share mRNA vaccine technology with Africa and other lower-income regions.

More than 60 million COVID-19 vaccines to be shared with countries in need were announced through Global Citizen Live. However the world must step up to redistribute a total of 2 billion vaccines by early 2022. In advance of Global Citizen Live Prime Minister Sanchez’s UNGA announced 7.5 million new vaccine doses and €2 million for UNITAID at Global Citizen Live. Taoiseach Micheál Martin confirmed 1.3 million COVID-19 vaccine doses primarily through COVAX on behalf of Ireland. This is Ireland's first dose sharing commitment to date and represents one dose for every five Irish citizens.

Croatia also stepped up announcing another 200000 COVID-19 vaccine doses primarily through COVAX following a €500000 and 50000 dose pledge to COVAX made at Global Citizen’s VAX LIVE in May.

""In the global fight against COVID-19 we need commitments to be matched with action. We thank Global Citizens for their tireless advocacy to support vaccine equity and we thank the governments of Croatia Ireland and France for their substantial vaccine donations during Global Citizen Live. This pandemic is the great public health challenge of our time and we urgently need to unlock more vaccine doses to ensure that the most vulnerable in our global village are protected. It's time for countries and manufacturers to do their part and give us the doses we need to protect people everywhere” said Dr. Seth Berkley CEO of Gavi the Vaccine Alliance.

""Only by acting internationally and united will we be able to effectively defeat the serious challenge of COVID-19 and that unity extends to all the other objectives that Spain Global Citizens and other actors defend. We all have to collaborate if we aspire to stop the climate emergency or to defeat hunger. They are enormous tasks that demand pulling all possible forces. This is why we join Global Citizen Live to commit to increase our vaccine donations to COVAX by 7.5 million and pledge financial support of €2 million for UNITAID as well as €30M for the Adaptation Fund to support the fight against climate change” said Pedro Sánchez Prime Minister of Spain.

The world unites to end poverty protect education and fight the hunger crisis at Global Citizen Live.

Forty-one million people are on the brink of famine due to the hunger pandemic reversing decades of progress on the United Nations’ Global Globals. Additionally more than 1.5 billion children have also been affected by COVID-19 school closures globally impairing the learning of marginalized children especially those living in conflict or crisis. Eradicating extreme poverty in all its forms is the greatest global challenge of our time. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this crisis pushing an additional 115 million people into extreme poverty in 2020 alone. To meet this goal Germany and the European Commission collectively announced €75 million to Education Cannot Wait IFAD announced pledges from 17 countries totalling US$23.7 million towards its critical work across the planet and a US$260 in pledges to CGIAR from Belgium Netherlands and the European commission was announced during Global Citizen Live among key pledges to combat extreme poverty.

“Hunger has tightened its grip on millions of vulnerable families around the world due to COVID-19. WFP is grateful to Global Citizen Live for raising awareness of this unprecedented crisis in an effort to mobilize global action against hunger” said David Beasley Executive Director United Nations World Food Programme.

France would release 20% of its Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) in addition to pledging 60 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to COVAX at Global Citizen Live. SDRs could be used to fund COVID-19 vaccines investment in economic recovery and access lifesaving medical treatments.

In the spirit of collaboration and solidarity government leaders showed their support for Global Citizen Live by pledging new financial and policy commitments.

THE ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS) pledged to increase its renewable energy capacity among Small Island Developing States through 2030 up to 10 megawatts taking strong actions toward a meaningful reduction of emissions. “Small Island States are disproportionately affected by the consequences of climate change. It is time that we as Global Citizens stand up and take strong actions to protect the planet. Therefore the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) pledges at Global Citizen Live to almost double its renewable energy capacity until 2030. We call on all governments to follow suit and harness renewable energy capacities. Only together we will be able to overcome the challenge of the century” said Gaston Browne Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda and chairman of AOSIS. BELGIUM announced €6 million to CGIAR a global partnership that unites international organizations engaged in research about food security and €10 million to Least Developed Country Fund. “Global Citizens have advocated for an equitable and sustainable recovery for the planet from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore Belgium appreciates the opportunity to join Global Citizen's campaign and to announce commitments for CGIAR and the Least Developed Country Fund. In these challenging times Belgium is proud to demonstrate its solidarity and to take actions that support the most vulnerable” said Meryame Kitir Minister of Development Cooperation and Major Cities Policy. CROATIA pledged 200000 COVID-19 vaccine doses primarily through COVAX at Global Citizen Live. During VAX LIVE in May Croatia donated 50000 doses towards COVAX. Despite a small population Croatia is making vaccine contributions to the world’s supply. “We thank Global Citizen for its critical advocacy work to end extreme poverty by 2030 and overcome the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. We must act collectively to end this crisis. This is why Croatia pledges another 200000 COVID-19 vaccine doses to COVAX to extend the possibility of everyone to get vaccinated. This is our small contribution but it will make a puzzle complete” said Prime Minister Andrej Plenković. EUROPEAN COMMISSION announced €140 million toward CGIAR a global partnership that unites international organizations engaged in research about food security at Global Citizen Live. CGIAR research aims to reduce rural poverty increase food security improve human health and nutrition and sustainable management of natural resources.

Europe is taking its responsibilities. Every single dose of coronavirus vaccine produced in Europe is shipped to the rest of the world 800 million doses so far. In addition the European Union will donate 500 million doses to the most vulnerable countries. It also commits €140 million to improve global food security and €25 million to Education Cannot Wait to support education for marginalised children around the world living through conflict and crisis” said Ursula von der Leyen President of the European Commission. FRANCE doubled their vaccine share pledge announcing that they would be sharing an additional 60 million doses on top of an already announced 60 million doses for a total of 120 million toward COVAX to be delivered by the end of Q2 2022.

Thanks to Globale Bildungskampagne and ONE Deutschland. IRELAND confirmed — following a decision of its cabinet — that it will donate 1.3 million COVID-19 vaccine doses primarily through COVAX. This is Ireland's first dose sharing commitment to date and represents 1 dose for every 5 Irish citizens. “When one of us is unwell vulnerable or at risk we all are affected. That is why I am pleased to be part of the Global Citizen campaign and to confirm that Ireland will donate 1.3 million vaccines mostly through COVAX and plans to make a further substantial donation in 2022. If COVID-19 has taught us anything it’s that we are now more than ever before deeply and intimately intertwined with each other. In that closeness there is great vulnerability but even greater strength when we work as one global community” said Mícheál Martin Taoiseach. LUXEMBOURG announced a €3.8 million commitment to UNFPA Supplies at Global Citizen Live to support women’s and girl’s reproductive health.

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%) the conglomerate headed by Warren Buffett owns a massive stock portfolio worth well over $300 billion today. From consumer electronics and financial services to automobiles and telecommunications Berkshire certainly owns a diverse range of businesses.

The Oracle of Omaha favors companies that are easy to understand have a strong brand and benefit from a competitive advantage. With this perspective in mind a team of Motley Fool contributors have identified Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 0.19%) Costco Wholesale (COST 1.05%) and Salesforce (CRM 0.55%) as three outstanding businesses with features that Warren Buffett would love.

Popularizing the fast-casual dining experience

Neil Patel (Chipotle Mexican Grill): Buffett is very familiar with the restaurant industry having previously owned Restaurant Brands International. But the fast-casual pioneer Chipotle possesses some key characteristics that every investor should be looking for.

With 2853 total locations and trailing-12-month revenue of $6.8 billion Chipotle has developed a widely recognized consumer brand. Given that an estimated 30% of restaurants fail in their first year reaching this level of scale is no easy accomplishment. Chipotle has become adept at marketing leaning on social media channels and introducing celebrity-inspired burrito bowls to convey the real ingredients and simple cooking methods used. It wasn't until July 2021 that the business aired its first-ever national TV commercial which just goes to show that offering high-quality food at affordable prices speaks for itself.

Bolstering the brand even further is a focus on digital. In the most recent quarter orders via the company's website mobile app and third-party delivery services accounted for nearly half of all sales. And there are now more than 23 million Chipotle rewards members who have the ability to order their favorite items ahead of time. Of the 56 new locations the business opened in the second quarter 45 were equipped with a Chipotlane which is the drive-through option. Serving customers in whatever ways are most convenient for them is table stakes in today's hyper-competitive restaurant and retail environment.

Something Warren Buffett would really appreciate is Chipotle's proven pricing power. Following an increase to employee wages the company raised menu prices by up to 4% in June. But this had no adverse impact on demand. In fact Chipotle was able to register an impressive 24.5% restaurant-level operating margin in the quarter the highest since Q3 2015. ""Consistent with the past we saw very little resistance with the price increase in any of these channels"" CEO Brian Niccol mentioned on the recent earnings call.

The stock has soared nearly 400% over the past five years but based on a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 76 it is by no means cheap. Chipotle is a fantastic business and it has the traits Buffett seeks out in his investments. However the absence of a margin of safety would probably keep him away.

A bulk-sized moat

Jeremy Bowman (Costco): Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was a longtime owner of Costco Wholesale the membership-based warehouse retailer but the conglomerate sold the stock late last year. It wasn't clear why though it may have been for valuation reasons. However Costco shares have continued to gain since.

Though Buffett may have parted with Costco there are a number of reasons why Costco still looks like a classic Buffett stock.

First Costco is the clear leader in warehouse retail. The company only has two direct competitors Walmart's Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club and Costco is significantly ahead of both of those rivals in key metrics like sales per square foot and overall revenue. In fact Costco is the second-largest brick-and-mortar retailer in the U.S. behind Walmart with $196 billion in revenue last year.

The membership model offers a number of competitive advantages or economic moats as Buffett would put it. It locks in customers and encourages them to spend more money at Costco stores. Costco prices its products at near cost encouraging customer loyalty and creating a business model where membership fees which are $60 per year for most customers make up the bulk of its profits. Costco has a 90% customer retention rate in North America and it ranks near the top in customer satisfaction surveys a strong sign for the business's future growth.

The company continues to open new stores unlike many large retailers and invest in its e-commerce platform which surged during the pandemic.

As malls struggle and other brick-and-mortar retailers falter Costco's business model remains a winner and its rock-bottom prices will keep customers flocking to its stores. Costco even has a history of paying generous special dividends every few years.

In the retail industry only a few stocks look as bulletproof as Costco.

A force to be reckoned with

Eric Volkman (Salesforce): It's been said before but it's worth repeating and emphasizing -- if there's one thing Buffett loves in a company above nearly everything else it's a moat.

I feel that Salesforce has a wide one. It's very much the dominant company in the ever-expanding world of customer relationship management (CRM; not coincidentally the company's ticker symbol too). In fact its estimated market share of nearly 20% (as gauged by tech market researcher IDC) is higher than the four trailing competitors combined.

Another thing Buffett admires -- heck all investors admire -- is a business that continues to scale. Salesforce delivers growth in spades. In its most recently reported quarter a mix of organic improvement and well-considered recent acquisitions (corporate communications specialist Slack Technologies for one) lifted total revenue by a meaty 23% year-over-year to over $6.3 billion.

That wasn't a quirk or a one-off. Salesforce has posted very forceful top-line growth for years. From its fiscal 2017 to 2021 -- hardly a long stretch of time -- the company managed to more than double its total annual revenue from just under $8.4 billion in the former year to over $21 billion in 2021.

Profitability has jumped around some but in recent years the company has landed more consistently in the black and convincingly at that. The trailing four quarters of non-GAAP net income were respectively $1.4 billion $1.1 billion $975 million and $1.6 billion. Buffett would be well pleased with the double-digit net margins attached to those figures which range from 17% to 30%.

Granted some of this growth is due to the pandemic which kept employees at home and necessitated the kind of remote-teamwork solutions Salesforce specializes in. However it's likely we're shifting from a traditional office work regime to more of a hybrid model for a great many professions so the company has a very long runway in front of it.

It realistically believes that vaunted double-digit growth will continue to the tune of at least 23.5% for the entirety of 2021 and 20% for 2022. Those are consistent and strong improvements particularly considering how long Salesforce has been on the scene.

They are also the kinds of hard-to-ignore figures Buffett loves to see in his companies. He should really consider buying a stake in this one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA5LTI1L3dhbHRlci1zY290dC1idWZmZXR0LXMtZnJpZW5kLWFuZC1idXNpbmVzcy1wYXJ0bmVyLWRpZXMtYXQtOTDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walter Scott Buffett's Friend and Business Partner Dies at 90,"Walter Scott Jr.  the Omaha businessman and philanthropist who made a fortune teaming up with his friend Warren Buffett to buy electric utilities has died.

The mid-tier market is more competitive than ever. You can get a lot these days for well under $1000 and prices keep plummeting while our eyes reap the rewards.

The Vizio M-Series is among the best of a very closely matched bunch. It has quantum dots for brighter colors local dimming for deeper blacks a variable refresh rate for gaming and a current price—at 55 inches—under $700. A TV that ticks all of those boxes is rarely this affordable. If you're in the market for a new flatscreen then that's very good news for your wallet.

The Black Box

When you're shopping in person it can be tough to pick between good mid-range TVs because they all tend to look the same. Unfortunately the M-Series is no different. Like various mid-priced models from TCL Samsung and LG it's about an inch and a half thick with relatively thin bezels. It comes with a rather generic-looking plastic remote that has a few hot keys for streaming services.

You’ll want to wall-mount this one unless you have a big TV stand. It has legs out near the ends rather than a center pedestal which means you’ll need a stand that’s about as long as the TV itself. That's not going to work in every living room.

All of this is because Vizio’s entire business model is to take top-tier technology and put it into something affordable. That means compromises in aesthetics. So you're not getting razor-thin looks here but you do get Vizio’s excellent backlighting technology and iQ processing engine.

The company's local dimming backlighting tech can turn off or dim based on the content that's playing. In super dark scenes some of the 32 zones of the backlighting are able to hit different brightnesses so you get less gray and something closer to black.

Local dimming isn’t as good as with organic LED or “OLED” technology where each pixel is its own backlight but it definitely still improves contrast quality. Vizio’s expertise with the tech is fully on display with this new M-Series. Watching darker shows like Stranger Things and The Mandolorian I noticed that everything still manages to look crisp and clean with just a touch of light bloom (where you get a halo around bright objects on dark backgrounds).

I should note that this model has HDMI 2.1 ports—an earlier 2021 M-Series model came with HDMI 2.0 ports but that's been remedied here. This upgraded port supports the eArc standard for easy soundbar setup that immediately integrates with the TV remote. And you should use a soundbar or a set of speakers because the TV's audio is pretty tinny though it does sound better than thinner TVs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9yZXZpZXdlZC8yMDIxLzA5LzI1L2xlZ28tbWFydmVsLWF2ZW5nZXJzLWFkdmVudC1jYWxlbmRhci0yMDIxLXdoZXJlLWJ1eS81ODQ2NDI3MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lego Marvel The Avengers Advent Calendar 2021: Where to buy,"Rebecca Norris

Let's start with the monarchy,"On 12 October 2018 Princess Eugenie married Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle in a ceremony funded in part by the Sovereign Grant the British government’s annual payment to the monarchy. At my local gym that day I overheard two people discussing the day’s events.

“I hate it when people moan about how much money royal weddings cost” one said. “This country has more important problems to worry about. I thought she looked beautiful.”

This is neither the first nor the last time I have heard such sentiment. In the six years I’ve been writing my new book ‘Running the Family Firm: How the monarchy manages its image and our money’ I have been asked many times why I spend so long thinking about monarchy when we are faced with seemingly more important global inequalities.

My reply is that to understand these other problems we must understand monarchy particularly in the British context. While research and commentary on elite corporate power is increasingly being used to understand global inequalities the monarchy is very rarely considered as part of this. It’s often dismissed as an archaic institution an anachronism to corporate forms of wealth and power and therefore irrelevant.

Meanwhile the monarchy is moralised in media culture through representations of national identity ‘the family’ and philanthropy which circumvent questions of inequality aristocratic state power and privilege. The gym-goer’s comment – “I thought she looked beautiful” – is doing precisely this: masking monarchical power through individualised ideologies of gender fairytale and love.

However the relationship between monarchy and capitalism is as old as capitalism itself. To pretend the monarchy is a banal tradition is to completely overlook centuries of exploitation and accumulation that have helped it to survive.

The Firm and tax avoidance

In my book I describe the monarchy as a corporation – the Firm – to expose its underlying capitalist logic. One example of where this came to light was during the leak of the ‘Paradise Papers’ on global tax avoidance which revealed that the Duchy of Lancaster – the Queen’s private estate – had used offshore private equity funds to avoid paying more tax on its holdings. Global corporations such as Apple Nike and Facebook were also embroiled in the scandal.

By law the Crown is exempt from taxation and the Sovereign Grant is exempt from income tax. In 1992 responding to anger over public funds being used to restore Windsor Castle after a fire the Firm agreed to pay ‘voluntary’ income and capital gains tax on private investments and the Privy Purse the sovereign’s income from the portfolio of land property and assets held by the Duchy of Lancaster – but only “to the extent that the income is not used for official purposes”. At the time the exact sum of this income tax as well as the size of the wealth the income is taxable from remained undisclosed. The Crown is also exempt from inheritance tax on “sovereign to sovereign bequests” meaning assets can pass from monarch to monarch without alteration or loss of wealth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1dGNobmV3cy5ubC8yMDIxLzA5L2JsYWNrc3RvbmUtb3ducy1ob3VzaW5nLXdvcnRoLWU4MDBtLWluLW5sLWJ1dC1wYXlzLW5vLXRheC12ay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blackstone owns housing worth €800m in NL but pays no tax: VK,"American investment house Blackstone which has built up a Dutch housing portfolio valued at €793m since 2019 pays no tax on its real estate in the Netherlands the Volkskrant reported on Saturday.

The company uses a variety of limited and holding companies via Luxembourg Jersey and the Cayman Islands to ‘lose’ its profits and make a loss on its Dutch venture hence the zero tax bill the paper said.

The loss in the Netherlands has been created by interest charges on debts that the Dutch companies have with the Luxembourg companies the Volkskrant said.

Blackstone can deduct these interest expenses from its rental income in the Netherlands – leaving no profit and therefore no tax to be paid on the rent paid by its tenants.

The interest owed does not have to be paid either. Instead it is added to the loan every year increasing the debate and subsequently the annual deduction for interest paid the paper said.

In 2015 the then housing minister Stef Blok called on foreign investors to put money into the housing market and a number of investors have since moved in.

Blackstone now owns some 1700 homes in the Netherlands and they are valued at €793m on the company’s books.

Legal

Blackstone told the Volkskrant in a reaction that it meets Dutch legislation and all appropriate tax is paid.

‘The structure we use is in line with that used by institutional investors all over the world’ the company said. ‘In the past five years we have invested more than €4bn in the growth and improvement of our Dutch property portfolio including offices logistics hospitality housing and retail.’

Aggressive

Leiden University tax law professor Jan van de Streek told the Volkskrant that the Blackstone approach is ‘aggressive tax planning’ in the ‘danger zone’ to be considered abusive.

Tax offices are becoming more critical of the private equity approach and ultimately it would be up to the Supreme Court to say if this is legal he said.

Blackstone hit the Dutch headlines last month when it reported that 328 homes on its books in Amsterdam were empty. Property owners in the capital are required to brief the city council if their property is empty for more than six months but until that point the company had only made reports about six.

In 2019 the UN’s housing advisor accused private equity firms and Blackstone of exploiting tenants ‘wreaking havoc’ in communities and helping to fuel a global housing crisis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZmludGVjaHRpbWVzLmNvbS93aXNlLWludHJvZHVjZXMtYXNzZXRzLWEtbWl4dHVyZS1vZi1hLWN1cnJlbnQtYWNjb3VudC1zYXZpbmdzLWFjY291bnQtYW5kLWludmVzdG1lbnQtcGxhdGZvcm0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wise Introduces Assets a Mixture of a Current Account Savings Account and Investment Platform,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='thefintechtimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

He was born in Carlow town on March 14 1930 and brought up in the family’s grocery/pub business. After he had met and fallen in love with his future wife June Harrington who worked in the bank next door the couple eloped to Dublin.

Having obtained a degree in marketing he joined the television rental company Rentel Ltd owned by the Rank Organisation. His son Conor commented in an address at the funeral service in Mount Jerome Crematorium that this was “at a time when people could only afford to rent their TVs but they could afford to buy their houses”.

He was later headhunted by the businessman and former rugby international Tony O’Reilly who appointed him chief marketing officer at the newly-created Bord Bainne — The Irish Dairy Board — where Cartan was centrally involved in the successful launch in London of Kerrygold butter. He later continued his third-level studies at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston.

After Ireland had joined what was then the European Economic Community he took up a position with Córas Iompair Éireann (CIE) as assistant general ma nager (marketing) where he was a key figure in the launch of the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (Dart) system of public rail transport.

He also managed the Great Southern Hotel Group heading up their international tour operation at a time when the Northern troubles did not help to make the island of Ireland an attractive destination.

His retirement from CIE was actually the start of a whole new phase in his life. He set up travel companies Accueil d’Irlande and Heritage Island and also found time for consultancy projects in Mozambique Zimbabwe and Poland and to serve as an election supervisor/observer in South Africa Bosnia-Herzegovina Zambia and Tanzania.

He wrote several books including 3 Score and 10 looking back on his first 70 years which raised over €9000 for the Blackrock Hospice and a further self-published memoir entitled 75 Not Out the proceeds of which also went to charity. His other books included the South Africa-focused Mandela’s Election as well as My Last Hurrah and The Four Islands. Finegan held a number of directorships including at the National Safety Council and the Hugh Lane Art Gallery and he was president of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport.

The launch of his 3 Score and 10 memoir took place in the National Yacht Club in Dún Laoghaire where he was an enthusiastic member in both sailing and social terms. In his time he completed a transatlantic voyage and also revelled in the sea views from the apartment where he lived in later years. An art collector and supporter of the arts in general he took part in the annual Bloomsday festivities on June 16 the date on which the events depicted in James Joyce’s Ulysses take place.

Always keenly interested in politics as a young man in the 1950s he was involved with the Carlow-based Bennekerry Land League. As a supporter of the Irish Labour Party he was an active participant in the successful campaign to elect Mary Robinson as Ireland’s first female president. Over the years he spoke on left-wing platforms with such figures as Noel Browne Jack McQuillan Justin Keating and Roy Johnston and was an assistant editor of the pioneering socialist newspaper The Plough.

Among the issues he promoted were women’s rights development aid policy and in later years the right to choose when to die. In a pamphlet he published in his later years entitled Labour in Vain: 50 years supporting the Labour movement but now ‘no’ Finegan wrote that he would no longer be voting Labour because of disillusionment with the party’s approach as a coalition government partner to the allocation of aid in developing countries in particular what he saw as insufficient funding for contraception and family planning.

Suffering from Parkinson’s disease in his 80s he wanted the right to choose the time of his death in the event that the illness became too much to endure. He believed it would be sensible to have access to a life-ending pill for such an eventuality. He got in touch with a contact abroad for that purpose. As a result he was brought to a hospital A&E unit accompanied by two gardaí.

He was kept under observation for some time and eventually transferred to a nursing home. He later spoke about the “dilemma” between believing in the right to terminate one’s own life on the one hand and the legal constraints and concerns of the medical profession on the other.

Cartan Finegan died from Parkinson’s disease on September 10 and is survived by his wife June four children Rosemary Conor Patricia and Rory as well as seven grandchildren Dylan Oscar Evie Louis Dexter Lauren and Alice. Paying tribute to his father Conor said: “He was generous to a fault with guidance advice and enthusiasm for new projects helping us financially when needed and gifting away most of his money.”"

Dutch tax authorities have been missing out on millions in corporate tax due to the tax structure an investigation by the Volkskrant showed.

Blackstone began buying up apartments in the Netherlands two years ago particularly in Amsterdam Rotterdam and Utrecht. To date Blackstone owns around 1700 apartments in the Netherlands. Annual accounts from Blackstone’s balance sheet last year showed that Blackstone has around 793 million euros worth in properties in the Netherlands.

The properties are owned by Dutch holding companies which in turn are part of companies in Luxembourg the Cayman Islands and Jersey. In these areas the tax rate is very low. The Dutch holding companies do not have to pay any taxes in the Netherlands because on paper they do not make any profit.

The Dutch companies show a loss due to interest charges on debts they have with their foreign partnerships. The interest expenses can be deducted from the rental income in the Netherlands therefore relieving the Dutch companies from having to pay taxes.

The payments are structured in such a way so that the interest charged to the Dutch companies is not immediately paid off the Volkskrant reported based on a review of company documents. Thus debt will remain on paper at the end of every fiscal year for the purpose of Dutch annual reporting with little or no profit that can be taxed.

Blackstone stated first to the Volkskrant and later by email to NL Times that the investment company follows Dutch law. “The structures we use are in line with other institutional investors across the world.”



Blackstone owns around 550 billion euros in assets globally which the company invests in sectors including housing data centers medical equipment bans film studios and casino hotels. A company spokesperson told NL Times it invested 4 billion euros in private and commercial real estate in the Netherlands over the past five years alone. It also employs 3200 people in the Netherlands.

The investment company has come under fire in the past for allegedly keeping more than 330 apartments in Amsterdam vacant while there is a housing shortage in the Netherlands however the investment firm said that a majority of the homes were being renovated. “The actual situation is that over 99% of the vacant homes are under maintenance or in the planning stage thereof. The majority of the approximately 330 vacant homes were purchased last year. Most were already vacant and in poor condition"" Blackstone said earlier this month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1dGNobmV3cy5ubC8yMDIxLzA5L2JsYWNrc3RvbmUtb3ducy1ob3VzaW5nLXdvcnRoLWU4MDBtLWluLW5sLWJ1dC1wYXlzLW5vLXRheC12ay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blackstone owns housing worth €800m in NL but pays no tax: VK,"American investment house Blackstone which has built up a Dutch housing portfolio valued at €793m since 2019 pays no tax on its real estate in the Netherlands the Volkskrant reported on Saturday.

The company uses a variety of limited and holding companies via Luxembourg Jersey and the Cayman Islands to ‘lose’ its profits and make a loss on its Dutch venture hence the zero tax bill the paper said.

The loss in the Netherlands has been created by interest charges on debts that the Dutch companies have with the Luxembourg companies the Volkskrant said.

Blackstone can deduct these interest expenses from its rental income in the Netherlands – leaving no profit and therefore no tax to be paid on the rent paid by its tenants.

The interest owed does not have to be paid either. Instead it is added to the loan every year increasing the debate and subsequently the annual deduction for interest paid the paper said.

In 2015 the then housing minister Stef Blok called on foreign investors to put money into the housing market and a number of investors have since moved in.

Blackstone now owns some 1700 homes in the Netherlands and they are valued at €793m on the company’s books.

Legal

Blackstone told the Volkskrant in a reaction that it meets Dutch legislation and all appropriate tax is paid.

‘The structure we use is in line with that used by institutional investors all over the world’ the company said. ‘In the past five years we have invested more than €4bn in the growth and improvement of our Dutch property portfolio including offices logistics hospitality housing and retail.’

Aggressive

Leiden University tax law professor Jan van de Streek told the Volkskrant that the Blackstone approach is ‘aggressive tax planning’ in the ‘danger zone’ to be considered abusive.

Tax offices are becoming more critical of the private equity approach and ultimately it would be up to the Supreme Court to say if this is legal he said.

Blackstone hit the Dutch headlines last month when it reported that 328 homes on its books in Amsterdam were empty. Property owners in the capital are required to brief the city council if their property is empty for more than six months but until that point the company had only made reports about six.

In 2019 the UN’s housing advisor accused private equity firms and Blackstone of exploiting tenants ‘wreaking havoc’ in communities and helping to fuel a global housing crisis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzkvdGhlLWNvbmp1cmluZy1ob3VzZS1yaG9kZS1pc2xhbmQtZm9yLXNhbGUtMS0yLW1pbGxpb24tdXNk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The Conjuring' House For Sale for $1.2M USD,"The Rhode Island home that inspired the events of James Wan’s The Conjuring is on the real estate market for $1.2 million USD.

Located on eight acres at 1677 Round Top Road in Burrillville Rhode Island the property is a farmhouse that boasts 3000 square feet three bedrooms and one and one-half bathrooms. In 1971 late paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren claimed that the farmhouse — owned by the Perron family at the time — was being haunted by a witch named Bathsheba Sherman who died in the 19th century and cursed the land.

“1677 Round Top Road is a property with such a fascinating background and we are pleased to have listed this interesting home” Ray Mott broker and co-owner of Mott & Chace Sotheby’s International Realty said in a press release. Judy Chace also a broken and co-owner added “The “Conjuring” estate is an intriguing offering in northern Rhode Island. We are happy that The Blackstone Team has listed this property with such noteworthy historical significance.”

Tim is onstage now presenting. He said this is the “world’s first Boeing yoke and quadrant for flight simulator.” He continued “this Thrustmaster’s first-ever yoke. That alone is a huge announcement. An ergonomic replica of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner yoke. Replicated that feeling as close as possible – the same feeling a pilot gets when flying the real aircraft.”

The interior of the product is 100% metal. It’s precise durable and robust. The throttles are swappable and can be expanded over time. For now the flaps and speed brake are interchangeable. Both will come in the box. It will be functional with Microsoft Flight Simulator on both Xbox Series X and PC when it does release.

The full reveal of the TCA Boeing Yoke Pack will happen on November 9th and Thrustmaster will talk a lot more about it then. If you’re at the show you can touch and try it right now.

Tim is answering questions from the community. He said “we’re confident this will be a game-changer” when answering a question from Chewwy94.

There is no current price point or release date at this time.

Stick with FSElite as we’ll be speaking to Tim from Thrustmaster about the announcement and other things related to Thrustmaster. This goes live at 18:45z.

This is a breaking story and will be updated. You can follow the action LIVE on our FSExpo Hub."

Global Citizen Live represents a call to action to end extreme poverty and build momentum ahead of the G20 Summit in October and UN Climate Conference COP26 in November.

The campaign calls on world leaders businesses and philanthropists to urgently commit resources to: meet the $15-20 billion funding shortfall of the $100 billion promised annually to the most vulnerable countries confronting climate change; businesses to help curb emissions through joining the Race to Zero campaign and pledging 1 billion additional trees by 2022 in support of the 1t.org ambition to conserve restore and grow 1 trillion trees this decade; $6 billion to provide food to 41 million people facing famine; 2 billion COVID-19 vaccines to be redistributed to low-income countries by early 2022; and for Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna to share mRNA technology with the WHO-backed Africa mRNA vaccine hub.

More than US$1.1 billion 157 million trees and over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines were announced during Global Citizen Live thanks to partnerships between government philanthropy non-governmental organizations and the private sector.

Global Citizen Live featured a remarkable lineup of world leaders advocates and artists supporting the campaign and its mission to end extreme poverty. Across seven continents tens of thousands of Global Citizens were in attendance over 24 hours as millions streamed the live broadcast event globally.

As a result of the hard work of many partner organizations the Global Citizen Live campaign announced:

157 million trees including 77 million trees by 2022; and more than US$300M to defend the planet

“Quite rightly future generations will hold us responsible. So join me and with one loud and united global voice call on the biggest greenhouse gas emitters — the G20 group of nations — to make much bolder commitments to cut emissions"" COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma told the audience during the New York event. “Call on the richest countries to make good on their promise of money to support developing countries deal with the impacts of climate change and call on world leaders to deliver an outcome at Glasgow we can all be proud of.”

Over US$800 million to defeat poverty and address hunger crises.

“Shame on us. At the height of COVID-19 the billionaires’ average net worth increase per day was $5 billion. And yet I am begging to feed the poor! Shame on us ... If we do not act today millions will starve nations will destabilize and millions will migrate by necessity"" said World Food Programme Executive Director David Beasley. ""If we are struggling today with a population of over 7 billion what do you expect will happen when there are over 10 billion people on earth by 2050? And by 2050 due to climate change we anticipate over 1 billion people to be displaced around the world! Wake up New York. Wake up Planet Earth.""

Over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines for those most in need.

“We have what we need to vaccinate the world. But the experts told us here’s what’s getting in the way: They said many countries are ready to produce vaccines at home. Yet they aren’t allowed to because ultra-wealthy pharmaceutical companies are not sharing the recipes to make them. These countries have the means ability and the workers to start manufacturing. All they are waiting for is the vaccine intellectual property to be transferred over” said Prince Harry The Duke of Sussex during the New York show.

“Every single person on this planet has a fundamental right to get this vaccine. That’s the point — yet that’s not happening. While in this country (and many others) you can go almost anywhere and get vaccinated billions around the world cannot. This year the world is expected to produce enough doses to meet the target of vaccinating 70% of people in every single country. But it is wrong that so much of the vaccine supply has only gone to just 10 wealthy nations so far and not everyone else” said Meghan The Duchess of Sussex.

Announcements were made by the European Commission the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) Belgium Colombia Croatia the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) France Germany Ireland Luxembourg the Netherlands Norway Spain United States UNESCO the Green Climate Fund and the Paris Peace Forum.

Global Citizen Live also saw announcements from the US states of Hawaii and Washington; the Brazilian states of Amapá Amazonas Ceará Piauí Pará and Paraíba; the City of Paris France; the municipality of Asker Norway; and 43 cities in Maharashtra State India.

Financial and in-kind announcements were also made by many corporate and philanthropic partners including Accelerit Technologies Aspiration Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Capgemini The Charles Stewart Mott Foundation The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) Duolingo The ELMA Vaccines & Immunization Foundation Global Solidarity Fund Leaders in Motion Academy The LEGO Foundation Private Foundation Rotary International Salesforce Mastercard Namati PepsiCo The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation World Wide Technology and Zendesk.

P&G Stanley Black & Decker and Starbucks.

Global Citizen also worked with existing Race to Zero members to join the campaign’s Climate Coalition to encourage others to sign on to the Race to Zero ahead of COP26. Climate Coalition members include: Amazon Bayer AG Boston Consulting Group Capgemini Dentsu International DocuSign HP Inc. Intuit Lendlease P&G RELX Salesforce Schneider Electric Uber Unilever Walmart Inc. and Zurich Insurance Group.

Global Citizen presented Global Citizen Live a 24-hour global broadcast and streaming event featuring an extraordinary lineup of artists and performances from all over the world including: Lagos Paris New York City London Sydney Seoul Rio de Janeiro Los Angeles and Mumbai.

The 24-hour live broadcast event aired globally on ABC BBC FX iHeartRadio YouTube Twitter and other platforms to millions of viewers around the world. On-site safety and precautionary measures including mask-wearing social distancing and proof of vaccination were taken as part of all events which were attended in person by Global Citizen activists from around the world.

In the lead up to Global Citizen Live Global Citizen called on action takers to demand that the world's wealthiest nations redistribute 1 billion vaccine doses urgently this year and 1 billion more by early 2022; support the proposal to waive intellectual property rights on the production of COVID-19 vaccines and other medical tools backed by over 100 countries; and call on Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna to share mRNA technology with a new WHO-backed mRNA technology transfer hub based in South Africa.

Global Citizen also called on countries around the world to reduce fair share national emissions to prevent more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming and for developed nations to deliver on their promise to provide $100 billion annually to address the climate needs of developing countries. G7 nations and billionaires were also called on by Global Citizen and its partners to end the hunger crisis by contributing at least $6 billion for the urgent provision of millions of meals for 41 million people on the brink of famine.

Global Citizen Live represents an ongoing campaign led by citizens around the world to take action to urge governments corporations and philanthropists to make urgent change in line with the United Nations’ Global Goals and the Global Citizen Recovery Plan for the World.

“Global Citizen Live is not a celebration but an urgent call to action” said Mick Sheldrick co-founder and Chief Policy and Government Affairs Officer at Global Citizen. “We’re campaigning hard to get the world on track to end extreme poverty calling on world leaders to step-up at the G20 and COP26 summits. Global Citizen Live is the beginning of a month-long countdown!”

Global Citizen Live highlighted the efforts and announcements of 67 governments six philanthropic foundations and 40 corporate partners alongside global advocates and campaigners. Among millions of Global Citizens stood key global leaders partners and advocates at the forefront of Global Citizen’s mission to end extreme poverty: UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed Executive Director of the World Food Programme David Beasley CEO of Namati Vivek Maru Rotary President-elect Jennifer Jones Global Goals Champion and Advocate Eddie Ndopu President of the Ford Foundation Darren Walker President of the Paris Peace Forum Steering Committee Trisha Shetty Hip Hop Caucus President and CEO Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr. UN Next Generation fellow Valeria Colunga advocate Eunice Akoth and more.

“A Global Citizen is aware of the fact that we all share one planet one health one common destiny — and that every one of us matters” said Ursula von der Leyen president of the European Commission in support of the campaign. “Everyone can make a difference by working together finding global solutions to global problems with unity cooperation and solidarity.”

As leaders step up to curb emissions combat climate change and defend the planet at Global Citizen Live more ambition is needed ahead of the COP26 Climate Summit.

Global Citizen and its Race to Zero partners worked to secure commitments from many of the world’s largest companies and cities to develop verified science-based targets to reach net zero emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.

Corporate partners and cities signed up to the Race to Zero initiative a science-based campaign to drive climate targets in line with the Paris Agreement. Global Citizen Live saw 13 companies valued at $1.3 trillion in market capital join the Race to Zero initiative. New signers include five Fortune 100 companies the largest consumer goods company in the world the largest tool maker in the world and the largest hotel group in the world.

Private sector organizations that officially signed on to the Race to Zero as a part of the Global Citizen Live campaign include: Akamai Technologies American Express BD (Becton Dickinson and Company) Boston Scientific Corporation Cisco Delta Air Lines DocuSign IHG Hotels and Resorts Marriott International Inc. P&G Stanley Black & Decker and Starbucks who have each signed on to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5 and Citi which joined the Race to Zero via the Net Zero Banking Alliance.

Global Citizen also worked with existing Race to Zero members to join the campaign’s Climate Coalition aimed at encouraging peers vendors and partners to sign on to the Race to Zero ahead of COP26. Climate Coalition members include Amazon Bayer AG Boston Consulting Group Capgemini Dentsu International DocuSign HP Inc. Intuit Lendlease P&G RELX Salesforce Schneider Electric Uber Unilever Walmart Inc. and Zurich Insurance Group.

""Urgent and widespread climate action is vital to unlock the pace and scale of decarbonization required by science. Every nation company and individual must play their part. This innovative collaboration with Global Citizen has delivered additional major US businesses to our campaign for the world's most ambitious climate leaders. With just one month until the milestone climate conference COP26 we are now calling on more companies worldwide to join Business Ambition for 1.5 degrees Celsius and play their role in delivering bold climate action to halve global emissions by 2030"" said Tom Dowdall Science Based Targets Initiative Campaign Lead.

While Global Citizen has been in contact with hundreds of companies to sign on to Race to Zero many of the world’s largest companies and top emitters failed to respond to Global Citizen’s outreach after several attempts. These companies must step up to sign on to control their emissions and protect the planet now not later. Global Citizens will continue to campaign and call on these companies to join Race to Zero by COP26 in November this year.

Global Citizen also worked with American Forests and 1t.org to ensure a sustainable climate and a nature-positive planet by conserving restoring and growing trees supporting the global movement to save and restore 1 trillion trees by 2030. A total of 157 million trees will be protected and restored by 2030 including 77 million by the end of 2022.

Global Citizen Live received support from 12 members of the United States Congress calling for legislative measures to meet the goal of 100 million trees being protected conserved and planted in cities across America by 2030 including: Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) Rep. Nanette Barragán (CA-44) Rep. Donald McEachin (VA-4) Rep. Chellie Pingree (ME-1) Rep. Marcy Kaptur (OH-9) and Rep. Jimmy Panetta (CA-20).

Mayors governors and sub-national representatives also showed their support from around the world including: Lene Conradi Mayor of Asker Kommune Norway; Hilary Franz Commissioner of Public Lands Washington; David Ige Governor Hawaii; Anne Hidalgo Mayor Paris; and the Brazilian governors of Amapá (Waldez Góes) Amazonas (Wilson Miranda Lima) Ceará (Camilo Santana) Pará (Helder Barbalho) Paraíba (João Azevêdo) and Piauí (Wellington Dias).

""The protection of the wild is a major task of our generation. Global Citizens have called on leaders to take decisive steps in the right direction. We commend the Brazilian governors of Amapá Amazonas Ceará Pará Paraiba and Piauí for their commitments to environmental protection and strong climate actions"" said Rodrigo Medeiros of Re:Wild.

On Aug. 23 and in support of local advocates Coldplay invited eight Brazilian governors to join Global Citizen at Global Citizen Live in September to pledge to protect critical natural resources throughout their regions. Governors made announcements from across Brazil including six states from the Amazon at the front lines of climate change. The Brazilian states announced plans to reduce emissions increase the number of protected areas and create state-wide climate mitigation and adaptation plans.

Thank you for joining us at #GlobalCitizenLive@AminaJMohammed as we join in unity to defend the planet and defeat poverty! We greatly value our partnership with you and the @UNhttps://t.co/jc4IQFI78Dpic.twitter.com/O8rzPzLb4u — Hugh Evans (@Hughcevans) September 25 2021

This weekend’s announcements build on earlier commitments over the last 18 months as part of the Trillion Trees Campaign. Global Citizen Live celebrates the global 1t.org community for its commitment to conserve restore and grow trees including the following organizations with existing 1t.org pledges contributing to the trillion tree ambition by 2030: Amazon Aspiration AstraZeneca Clif Bar & Company HP Inc. Iberdrola Jonas Philanthropies Trees for Climate Health Initiative Nestlé Pottery Barn SAP SE tentree Travelers Unilever UPS and VMWare.

“It is inspiring to see the world’s largest companies governments and individuals of all ages unite to make ambitious commitments to protect and restore our planet. 1t.org’s collaboration with Global Citizen Live to scale investments in our trees and forests will be an integral part of the solution in tackling pressing ecological and societal challenges” said Nicole Schwab Co-Head of Nature-Based Solutions at the World Economic Forum. “Global Citizen Live shows that collective action at a global scale is possible.”

Leaders make commitments toward $100 billion climate promise but at least $15 billion shortfall remains ahead of COP26.

During UNGA leaders made commitments in support of honoring their promise to provide vulnerable countries with $100 billion annually to respond to climate change. During his UNGA address President Joe Biden announced that the US will increase its climate aid commitment to $11.4 billion by 2024. Despite being a step in the right direction this is still far less than what is contributed by the EU according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute. The G20 must keep their promise to provide an additional $100 billion annually to protect vulnerable nations from climate change. We have five weeks in order to meet this promise.

""The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how strongly the health of one person depends on the behaviour of the other. We need decisive action and solidarity both on individual and societal levels to leave the COVID-19 pandemic behind us. Today at Global Citizen Live I join Global Citizen's calls for more vaccine equity and a stronger commitment to an encompassing solution of the pandemic that is sensitive to the capacities and needs of different countries. I thank all Global Citizens for advocating and strongly supporting the work of WHO “ said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Director-General of World Health Organization.

During the Global Citizen Live campaign Italy committed to substantially increase its climate financing in the run-up to COP 26. Global Citizen will hold them accountable to this commitment.

From New York The Green Climate Fund supporting developing countries to reduce emissions and build resilience announced they would be accelerating the delivery of over $1.2 billion in the coming months.

Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez during his UNGA address and in response to a tweet from Coldplay announced €30 million for the Adaptation Fund an international fund that finances projects and programs aimed at helping developing countries to adapt to the harmful effects of climate change albeit much more is needed for Spain to meet its fair share.

Meanwhile both Denmark and Norway affirmed their commitments to significantly increase their climate financing commitments said Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen declaring:

“Denmark will contribute 1% of the collective target of $100 billion. And 60% of our climate aid will help developing countries adapt to climate change. If we can — G20 can! Let’s send a message to the G20 that cannot be misunderstood: Do not come empty-handed to Glasgow” said Frederiksen.

CODE RED. It’s no secret that the climate crisis is here & it’s a massive threat to our planet. The US has an opportunity to lead the world to a sustainable future. It starts with the #BuildBackBetter act. Join me alongside @GlblCtzn to take action to support. #CodeRedCongresspic.twitter.com/mRPVqeUJOt — Rachel Brosnahan (@RachelBros) September 24 2021

Global Citizen believes that Austria Australia Portugal Spain and Italy should also increase their contributions toward meeting the $100 billion pledge. We are grateful to ODI and Sarah Colenbrander for their analysis and support through the Global Citizen Live campaign. Global Citizen is urging US citizens to contact their local member of congress. The United States must live up to its promise.

Global Citizen Live calls code red for Congress and urges the United States Congress to pass most consequential climate legislation in US history.

“We have the chance to make history soon when Congress could pass essential climate legislation through the Build Back Better Act... We need a true groundswell of public support to show Congress that this critical legislation must pass without getting watered down” said Hip Hop Caucus President and CEO Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr.

Over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines pledged at Global Citizen Live in a step toward vaccine equity but too little too late as huge gap remains.

Inequitable vaccine distribution has left millions of vulnerable communities unprotected and reversed decades of progress against other infectious diseases and the broader Global Goals for Sustainable Development. To end this pandemic we must make the COVID-19 vaccines available to all everywhere. Global Citizen Live is grateful for its partnership with the ACT Accelerator the Pandemic Action Network the ONE Campaign and others in the collective effort to address vaccine inequity and injustice.

Extraordinary action is needed in the fight against COVID-19 and world leaders are uniquely positioned to enable a global recovery by ensuring everyone has access to life-saving vaccines tests and treatments. On Sept. 22 US President Biden convened world leaders to commit to vaccinate at least 70% of people in every country by this time next year to break the chain of transmission and end the pandemic. But more than promises are needed; without action the virus and its mutations will continue to threaten us all and undermine the global economy.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield took to the Global Citizen Live stage to reiterate the call for everyone to have access to COVID-19 vaccines especially vulnerable refugees whose circumstances have been further impacted by the pandemic. Global Citizen welcomes US leadership to galvanize efforts to vaccinate at least 70% of people in all countries by September 2022 but hopes to see this promise met by comprehensive action from the US. This includes sharing all excess and unused doses in hand or on order for 2021 as soon as possible providing funding and support to help lower income countries get doses from tarmac and into arms and critically by actively promoting an intellectual property waiver at the World Trade Organization and pushing pharma companies to share mRNA vaccine technology with Africa and other lower-income regions.

More than 60 million COVID-19 vaccines to be shared with countries in need were announced through Global Citizen Live.

""In the global fight against COVID-19 we need commitments to be matched with action. We thank Global Citizens for their tireless advocacy to support vaccine equity and we thank the governments of Croatia Ireland and France for their substantial vaccine donations during Global Citizen Live. This pandemic is the great public health challenge of our time and we urgently need to unlock more vaccine doses to ensure that the most vulnerable in our global village are protected. It's time for countries and manufacturers to do their part and give us the doses we need to protect people everywhere” said Dr. Seth Berkley CEO of Gavi the Vaccine Alliance.

""Only by acting internationally and united will we be able to effectively defeat the serious challenge of COVID-19 and that unity extends to all the other objectives that Spain Global Citizens and other actors defend. We all have to collaborate if we aspire to stop the climate emergency or to defeat hunger. They are enormous tasks that demand pulling all possible forces. This is why we join Global Citizen Live to commit to increase our vaccine donations to COVAX by 7.5 million and pledge financial support of €2 million for UNITAID as well as €30M for the Adaptation Fund to support the fight against climate change” said Pedro Sánchez Prime Minister of Spain.

We must act collectively to end this crisis. This is why Croatia pledges another 200000 COVID-19 vaccine doses to COVAX to extend the possibility of everyone to get vaccinated.

That is why I am pleased to be part of the Global Citizen campaign and to confirm that Ireland will donate 1.3 million vaccines mostly through COVAX and plans to make a further substantial donation in 2022.

Today at Global Citizen Live we announce two new initiatives to foster our global COVID-19 response and to assemble a group of climate avengers to whom we commit €3 million. Take action as a Global Citizen and at the Paris Peace Forum to make the world a better place"" said Justin Vaïsse Founder & General Director. PEPSICO committed US$1 million to the World Food Programme to help combat global food insecurity. P&G announced that it is signing onto the Race to Zero and committed to outreach toward encouraging other companies to join. During the broadcast Tide also announced its goal to get 1.3 billion more loads of laundry done in cold water over the next two years to help reduce CO2 emissions. ROTARY INTERNATIONAL pledged US$98 million in grant funding during 2022 in support of smart and sustainable member-led projects that help end poverty through education disease prevention and treatment community economic development peace and conflict prevention access to clean water and sanitation and support for the environment in communities around the world. SALESFORCE pledged to fund an additional 30 million trees by the end of this year in partnership with 1t.org a global movement dedicated to conserving restoring and growing 1 trillion trees by 2030. STANLEY BLACK & DECKER joined Race to Zero as part of GLOBAL CITIZEN LIVE by signing on to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5. STARBUCKS joined Race to Zero as part of Global Citizen Live by signing on to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5. THE CHILDREN'S INVESTMENT FUND FOUNDATION (CIFF) made a $50 million commitment to UNICEF that will fund projects focused on child nutrition particularly towards the urgent treatment and prevention efforts for children suffering from a life-threatening form of malnutrition called “wasting.” In addition UNICEF has committed to mobilize an additional $50 million to create a $100 million partnership to tackle this preventable form of malnutrition.

Indeed some of the most popular purebred dogs are those with noses that look as though they were pressed up against glass in utero: Pugs English bulldogs French bulldogs and Boston terriers all fall into these categories. The technical term for these types of smushed-face dogs is ""brachycephalic."" (The root brachy- means ""short"" while cephalic means ""of the head."") Perhaps humans love them because with their snouts squished toward their skulls until their faces are flat brachycephalic dogs are unbearably adorable. Their big round eyes seem friendly curious and kind; their wrinkled visages convey a delightful spectrum of moods from grumpy to overjoyed; and when their tongues stick out of their mouths as often happens they look like they're blowing raspberries.

""I think there's a good reason to believe that one of the things we like about a shorter-nosed dog is that they more resemble a human primate face"" Alexandra Horowitz a cognitive scientist and the author of ""Our Dogs Ourselves"" said during an interview last year with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""We need to acknowledge that it's gone too far.""

Appearances can be deceiving however. While brachycephalic dogs may seem to lead the lives of happy cartoon characters their actual day-to-day lives can be full of discomfort — and often worse. From illnesses to genetic diseases brachycephalic dogs not only have problems — their problems are getting worse. That's because as time has passed such breeds are becoming more inbred than they were 100 years ago — which for some dog lovers and vets raises ethical questions about continuing to breed them. Indeed humans may be dogs' best friend but in our quest to breed more best friends we may have inadvertently hurt the ones we claim to love.

What it's like being a brachycephalic dog

It starts with the elimination of the snout; though aesthetically pleasing to breeders and owners this anatomical alteration forces the dog to breathe through nasal passages that are simply too small.

""We might imagine when we have a cold and it's harder to breath and we tend to snore a lot"" Erica Feuerbacher an associate professor at Virginia Tech's Department of Animal and Poultry Science wrote to Salon. ""That could be what it might be like for these dogs.""

It is an affliction that may literally be unimaginable for humans. Humans are occasionally born with brachycephaly though their symptoms are not the same as it is for these dogs. Molly H. Sumridge an instructor of anthrozoology at Carroll College noted to Salon that humans with brachycephaly usually do not have the extreme symptoms intentionally bred into many dogs. ""In humans this is corrected in infants through the use of a cranial reforming helmet"" Sumridge told Salon.

""Due to malformation of the skull and muzzle a lot of brachycephalic dogs have stenotic nares [a condition caused by malformed nasal cartilage that strains the larynx] bulging eyes and deep nasal skin folds"" Marjan van Hagen a professor of animal behavior at Utrecht University told Salon by email. This means that many of the animals are constantly experiencing shortness of breath which ""has a major impact on their day-to-day lives as they have to gasp for air with every breath they take."" They also may have painful eye disorders because of their malformed sockets; pugs for instance are particularly prone to ocular proptosis a condition in which their eyes pop out of their skulls.

That is not all. The list of diseases related to being brachycephalic is long and ""continues to grow"" as we study them Van Hagen says. Van Hagen can attest to dogs with abnormalities in their inner-ear structures and tear ducts having accumulations of cerebrospinal fluid in the spinal cord and craniums too small for a dog's cerebellum (which helps control muscle activity). Even the jaws that make English bulldogs seem simultaneously ferocious and silly are often in fact a source of pain: brachycephalic dogs can have crowding of teeth because there is not enough space in their jaws resulting in inflammation.

There is also a good reason why bulldogs like Uga the famous mascot for the University of Georgia need to be constantly air conditioned if they stay in the sun for too long.

""Their brachycephaly also contributes to them not being able to thermoregulate as well and they can overheat easily again meaning that they are limited in what activities and in what conditions they can participate"" Feuerbacher explained. She also mentioned it is common for English and French bulldog puppies to need to be delivered through C-sections which affects the mother's welfare.

Smaller brachycephalic dogs are also prone to a condition known as hanging tongue syndrome. When their tongues are too large they're missing teeth or they have an abnormal jaw bone the floppy pink muscular organ will constantly stick out or droop down from their mouths. While this may appear cute it can be very uncomfortable for the dogs. If they are not able to pull their tongue into their mouth enough to keep it moist it can dry out crack blister and get infected. Imagine the feeling of having uncomfortable chapped lips but on your tongue.

The inter-canine language barrier

Smushed-face dogs may also struggle to have conversations with their canine companions.

""Brachycephalic deformities can also inhibit a dog's ability to effectively communicate with other dogs through facial body language"" Sumridge told Salon. In other words because their facial structure appears odder to other dogs they are inhibited in their ability to communicate.

If it is so difficult for many of these dogs to survive ""talk"" and in some cases even to reproduce how do they exist at all? Surprisingly they have been around for a while — albeit in healthier form.

""The origins of brachycephalic dogs depend on what characteristic you're looking to measure"" Sumridge explained. Pugs Shih Tzus and Pekingese dogs are very ancient for example but the extreme nature of their current flat faces are more recent.

""The breeding for flatter faces seems to have increased mostly in the last 50-100 years to accentuate the 'baby face' that many owners love and are attracted to"" Sumridge told Salon.

Modern dog breeds were created in the 19th century as the concept of ""purebreds"" became fashionable among Victorian Europeans. As with so many things this phenomenon can be linked to racism specifically the eugenics movements which held that knowledge about genetics could be manipulated to create ""perfect"" specimens in the human and animal world.

Even if purebred brachycephalic dogs did not have this uncomfortable history there would still be considerable ethical concerns about continuing to breed them.

""Veterinarians all over the world argue that there is widespread evidence of a link between extreme brachycephalic phenotypes and chronic disease which compromises canine welfare"" van Hagen said. ""The selection of dogs with progressively shorter and wider skulls has reached physiological limits. To continue breeding them in this way with this knowledge therefore can be considered unethical.""

Feuerbacher noted that it is not simply brachycephalic breeds who have congenital health issues. A number of purebred dogs have health problems because of inbreeding such as German shepherds who are bred to have increasingly sloped backs and therefore develop back hip and leg problems.

""I think we have a responsibility to our animals to breed them to be as healthy as we can rather than give in solely to our desire for certain aesthetics"" Feuerbacher wrote. ""We can certainly select for different aesthetics but if we keep in mind the welfare of the animal when we are making these selection decisions hopefully we'll find a balance and not select for extreme characteristics that can negatively impact the animal.""

The solution experts agree is to discourage overbreeding. It is possible for dogs to continue to come in a variety of colors shapes and sizes and yet still lead healthy lives. The key experts agree is to make sure that there is genetic diversity in their lineage. Inbreeding as the name itself makes clear is bad.",,,,,,,,,

Eric Van Cutsem MD

After a median follow-up of almost 5 months median progression-free survival (a secondary endpoint) was 5.8 months and median overall survival was 17.2 months he reported at the ESMO World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancers 2021.1

“Overall the results reported with this combination are similar to that observed with recommended chemotherapy-based regimens in first-line BRAF-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer” Dr. Van Cutsem noted. “These encouraging results support exploring the combination of encorafenib plus cetuximab with chemotherapy in the first-line setting.” This is now being done in the phase III BREAKWATER study.

Although BRAF-targeted therapy was proven effective as first-line therapy in this patient -population the value of this approach as maintenance was not borne out in the MODUL trial which evaluated fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin plus cetuximab and vemurafenib after induction other investigators reported at the Congress.2 Lessons were learned however about the molecular landscape of colorectal cancer.

ANCHOR CRC Background

For the 10% to 20% of patients with BRAF V600E mutations the prognosis is poor. Treatment with chemotherapy has traditionally yielded disappointing outcomes although recently in the first randomized prospective study—FIRE-4.5—first-line treatment with FOLFOXIRI (5-FU leucovorin oxaliplatin irinotecan) plus bevacizumab led to a 51% response rate median progression-free survival of 8.3 months and median overall survival of 16.8 months.3

Subsequently BEACON evaluated targeted treatment with a doublet (encorafenib and cetuximab) and a triplet (encorafenib binimetinib and cetuximab) in the second and later lines finding median overall survival to be 9.3 months with either regimen vs 5.9 months with standard chemotherapy.4 These results led to the design of the phase II ANCHOR CRC trial Dr. Van Cutsem explained.

Study Details

ANCHOR CRC enrolled patients with BRAF V600E mutations previously untreated for metastatic disease. Dr. Van Cutsem presented the main analysis on 95 patients (median age 65; 60% with right-sided or transverse tumors; 76% with ≥ 2 metastatic sites). The primary endpoint was objective response rate by investigator assessment.

“The primary endpoint was clearly met” Dr. Van Cutsem announced. The objective response rate was 47.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 37.3%–58.5%) and the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval exceeded 30% (the specified threshold). Disease control was achieved by 88% and the majority of patients experienced tumor regression. Subgroup analysis showed no meaningful differences in benefit he said.

After a median follow-up of almost 5 months median progression-free survival was 5.8 months. Median overall survival was 17.2 months with 65% alive at 12 months 49% alive at 18 months and 29% alive at 24 months Dr. Van Cutsem reported.

The median duration of exposure for encorafenib binimetinib and cetuximab was almost 5 months and the relative dose intensity was 93% to 95% for each.

Most patients received subsequent therapies which mostly included an oxaliplatin-based doublet with or without bevacizumab (22%) and FOLFOXIRI with or without bevacizumab (12.6%). At the time of this analysis 21% of patients were still receiving study treatment.

The incidence of at least one adverse event was 52% but grade ≥ 3 toxicities were uncommon mostly anemia (10.5%) and decreased appetite (10.5%). Intestinal obstruction grade ≥ 3 was identified in 15% of patients (mainly due to metastases).

Three patients (3%) suffered an adverse event leading to death (two were possibly treated-related); 24% had one that led to discontinuation of at least one study drug; and 75% had a dose interruption or reduction. Quality of life assessed with different instruments showed no meaningful changes over baseline in patient-reported outcomes.

MODUL: No Impact of Maintenance Therapy

Despite the benefit shown for BRAF-targeted therapy in the first-line setting in Cohort 1 of the MODUL study patients with metastatic BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer derived no benefit from maintenance therapy that included a BRAF-targeted agent according to Michel Ducreux MD of Gustave Roussy in Villejuif France and Université Paris-Saclay.2

“Median progression-free survival appeared to be a little longer in the control arm whereas median overall survival and response rate appeared to be longer in the experimental arm” he reported at the Congress.



Michel Ducreux MD

MODUL is an adaptable phase II signal-seeking trial testing novel agents as first-line therapy for predefined subgroups of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. It is the largest randomized umbrella maintenance study in the first-line metastatic colorectal setting and the largest chemoimmunotherapy study to date.

Previously untreated patients received up to eight cycles of induction treatment with FOLFOX and bevacizumab and then were randomly assigned to experimental maintenance in one of four biomarker-driven cohorts or to the control arm. Cohort 1 involved 90 patients with BRAF-mutant disease almost all with synchronous metastases. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (surgery-censored).

Ultimately 60 patients were randomly assigned after induction treatment to one of the following arms in a 2:1 ratio:

Experimental treatment: 5-FU/leucovorin every 2 weeks plus cetuximab every 2 weeks and vemurafenib daily (n = 40).

Control: 5-FU/leucovorin every 2 weeks or capecitabine orally plus bevacizumab every 2 weeks (n = 20).

MODUL’s translational studies include an exploratory genomic analysis performed on tissue or blood at the beginning of the treatment and on plasma samples collected upon disease progression or at the end of treatment. Investigators compared variants identified at the two different time points to look at drivers of acquired resistance to cetuximab plus vemurafenib.

Clinical Outcomes With Maintenance

Despite longer exposure to the experimental treatment (36 vs 21 weeks) no major differences were observed between the experimental and control arms in terms of progression-free survival. Median progression-free survival was 10.0 months with targeted treatment and 11.6 months with standard chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.95; P = .087). For overall survival the difference was slightly more in favor of the experimental arm with a median overall survival of 24.0 months vs 21.3 months (HR = 0.69; P = .29). Objective response rates were 50% and 25% respectively (P = .06).

In the biomarker analysis of 49 patients baseline samples of both tissue and plasma showed no differences between the arms in mutations copy number alterations and rearrangements. But in samples evaluated at the end of treatment or after disease progression clear differences emerged most strikingly an enrichment in alterations in MAP kinase pathway genes in the experimental arm. “This means that with this treatment we are inducing something in the tissue that can be seen with circulating tumor DNA evaluation” Dr. Ducreux said.

“Due to events unrelated to Cohort 1 the MODUL study was closed to enrollment prematurely” he indicated. “Results from the Cohort 1 efficacy analysis should therefore be considered descriptive.”

At the 2021 Pan Pacific Lymphoma Conference Dr. Flowers described the bispecific antibodies targeting CD20 a relevant target in B-cell lymphoma.1 As single agents CD3/CD20 bispecific antibodies can produce complete responses in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma including those with disease progression after CAR T-cell therapy and stem cell transplant and those with poor-risk indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Some patients have been shown to maintain remission after they complete treatment.

Mechanisms of Action

In general bispecific antibodies can exert efficacy via three different mechanisms of action: (1) by engaging the tumor cells and the immune cells (T cells or natural killer cells); (2) by binding to both payload and tumor cells and offering targeted delivery of the payload; and (3) by using both arms of the compound to block key signaling areas of the tumor. Most of the bispecific antibodies that have been explored in clinical trials employ the first mechanism.

One bispecific antibody blinatumomab has been approved and there are 23 others in clinical trials in hematologic cancers and 34 in solid tumor trials. For both types of malignancies these constructs workpredominantly by engaging immune cells.





“It appears that by using subcutaneous dosing [of epcoritamab] you can get a more gradual increase in … peak plasma cytokine level as well as a longer plasma half-life.” — Christopher Flowers MD MS FASCO

Dr. Flowers described five CD3/CD20 bispecific antibodies in phase I trials for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These drugs bind to malignant B cells (CD20) as well as to T cells (CD3): mosunetuzumab glofitamab plamotamab odronextamab and epcoritamab. As with CAR T cells bispecific antibodies also pose a risk for cytokine-release syndrome but attempts are being made to mitigate this through step-up dosing subcutaneous delivery and pretreatment with obinutuzumab. This toxicity is almost always mild and occurs primarily during the first treatment cycle. “The important question is how these bispecific antibodies compare with CAR T-cell therapy” Dr. Flowers said. “Ultimately if bispecific antibodies move into the marketplace we will need to know the best way to select between these approaches in terms of benefits duration of effects and also risk for cytokine-release syndrome.”

Response rates with these agents range from 40% to 70% in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cohorts and from 70% to 90% in follicular lymphoma. Dr. Flowers commented that “currently these drugs look more similar than they do different … with meaningful complete responses seen across all agents in this class.” He also noted there may be variations in the study populations which could lead to slight differences in the outcomes observed but perhaps there are also differences in the drugs themselves. They also are similar in terms of safety: the most common adverse event is cytokine-release syndrome which occurs in about 50% to 60% of patients is almost always grade 1 or 2 and is generally limited to cycle 1 of treatment.

He broadly compared these outcomes for CD20/CD3 bispecific antibodies. For DLBCL objective response rates have ranged from 50% to 73% and complete response rates from 32% to 54%; cytokine-release syndrome has been observed in 46% to 94% and has been grade ≥ 3 in 13% to 23%.

In the clinical trials arena the preference for choosing a bispecific antibody over CAR T-cell therapy may be driven by the nature of the lymphoma. A more aggressive disease such as DLBCL may warrant one approach whereas the indolent nature of other subtypes such as follicular lymphoma may pose “a different trade-off” he said.

Mosunetuzumab

Mosunetuzumab is afull-length humanized IgG1 antibody that brings the T cell into close proximity to the target tumor cells. This leads to T-cell activation formation of immune synapses and killing of the tumor cell through T-cell engagement and B-cell elimination. In a large phase I dose-escalation trial whose results were presented at the 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Plenary Session mosunetuzumab elicited promising responses in relapsed patients including a subset previously treated with CAR T-cell therapy.2

The population included 270 patients 117 with DLBCL. In the DLBCL cohort the median number of prior treatment lines was five including prior CAR T-cell therapy in 30 patients; 22 patients were refractory to prior CAR T-cell therapies.

“Of interest and why this study was presented at an ASH Plenary Session is that it reflects one of the first approaches for therapy in patients whose disease failed to respond to prior CAR T-cell therapy” Dr. Flowers commented.

The drug was given intravenously on days 1 8 and 15 of cycle 1 then on day 1 of each 21-day cycle thereafter. Patients received 8 cycles then discontinued treatment upon a complete response; with partial response or stable disease patients continued treatment for a total of 17 cycles.

The objective response rate was 37% with complete responses observed in 19% of patients. In the aggressive types of lymphoma—DLBCL and transformed follicular lymphoma—these rates were “impressive for a single-agent bispecific antibody” at 38% and 20% respectively he noted.

Many responses were durable. Among patients with aggressive disease 71% of complete responders remained in remission up to 16 months off treatment whereas 83% of complete responders in the indolent disease cohort remained progression-free up to 26 months he reported.

Among patients with prior CAR T-cell therapy a 40% response rate was observed with 22% being complete responses. For patients with DLBCL who had received prior CAR T-cell therapy 39% of these patients responded and 22% had complete responses. A description for one responder revealed a rise in copy number of persistent CAR T cells.

A phase II trial of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma is evaluating a subcutaneous formulation of mosunetuzumab and a phase III trial will study mosunetuzumab plus lenalidomide vs lenalidomide plus rituximab as a chemotherapy-free regimen. Another phase III study is enrolling patients with untreated DLBCL giving mosunetuzumab upfront in combination with CHP (cyclophosphamide doxorubicin prednisone) and polatuzumab vedotin-piiq vs rituximab CHP and polatuzumab.

Glofitamab

Glofitamab has a unique 2:1 molecular configuration that allows two binding sites to CD20 (B cells) and a single binding site for CD3 (T cells). Under experimental conditions this design is associated with higher potency than the 1:1 binding bispecific antibodies and allows for concomitant treatment with anti-CD20 antibodies.

An ongoing phase I dose-escalation study in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma is investigating the use of obinutuzumab at 1000 mg given 7 days prior to cycle 1 day 1 of glofitamab to debulk B cells and mitigate cytokine-release syndrome.34 Patients then receive escalating doses of glofitamab in either a fixed-dose schema (10 16 and 26 mg) or a step-up dosing schema (2.5 10 and 16 mg or 2.5 10 and 30 mg).

“With glofitamab step-up dosing antitumor activity was seen across non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes including patients with both aggressive and indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas” Dr. Flowers reported. In aggressive subtypes the objective response rate to step-up dosing was 61% with 54% of patients achieving complete responses. In indolent subtypes these rates were 67% and 54% respectively.

Response rates were even higher in patients receiving 10 mg or higher doses. In these patients the projected median progression-free survival was 3 months and 14.5 months respectively and although follow-up is short the curves are plateauing as many responses are being maintained with patients remaining on treatment. The median duration of response was not reached for either cohort he said.

Plamotamab

Plamotamab involves an approach similar to that with glofitamab displaying a “tunable” binding affinity that allows for optimization of potency and safety. In a study of 45 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 8 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who underwent weekly dosing encouraging dose-dependent clinical activity was seen in the initial cohorts of 18 patients with DLBCL treated with at least 80 μg/kg.5 In this subtype objective responses were achieved by 39% of patients and complete responses by 28% with rates rising to 50% and 25% respectively at the highest dose of 170 μg/kg.

Odronextamab

Odronextamab is a bispecific IgG4 antibody modified to reduce Fc binding. In a phase I dose-escalation trial of 96 patients who were heavily pretreated (mostly with aggressive subtypes) including 12 patients with prior CAR T-cell therapy response rates were dose-related as seen with other agents.6

In the DLBCL cohort responses were seen in 54% among patients receiving 18 to 40 mg with complete responses achieved by 18%. Patients without prior CAR T-cell therapy who received at least 80 mg had a response rate of 71% all complete responses; among patients who had received prior CAR T cells 50% of patients with DLBCL responded and 25% of them had complete responses. Response rates were higher in patients with indolent types of lymphoma.

Epcoritamab

The relatively unique feature of epcoritamab is its 1-mL subcutaneous administration. “It appears that by using subcutaneous dosing you can get a more gradual increase in and perhaps a lower peak plasma cytokine level as well as a longer plasma half-life. The hope is that this will reduce toxicity especially cytokine-release syndrome” Dr. Flowers said.

In a study of 69 patients 11 with follicular lymphoma received doses less than 1 mg to 48 mg and 90% achieved responses 50% of which were complete responses.7 Responses were present in patients remaining on treatment and in remission beyond 12 months “suggesting that with ongoing treatment responses can be quite durable” he said.

A subcutaneous dosing approach is now being evaluated for mosunetuzumab as well. Compared with intravenous administration side effects of subcutaneous delivery are similar including cytokine-release syndrome which is mostly mild.8

Safety of CD3/CD20 Bispecific Antibodies

The safety profiles of these five bispecific antibodies have not differed appreciably in clinical trials. Adverse events of grade ≥ 3 have been seen in 39% to 63% of patients. Neutropenia and fever are common but reported to be manageable. Anemia hypophosphatemia and lymphopenia are also observed across trials. Cytokine-release syndrome develops in about half the patients but is almost invariably mild and limited to the first cycle of treatment; there is some evidence that higher doses may pose a greater risk for this toxicity. Neurologic toxicities also occur but are transient. Injection-site reactions have also been -observed.

Dr. Flowers emphasized that although his talk focused on CD3/CD20 antibodies there are “a host” of other constructs and targets for bispecific agents both for solid and blood cancers. The future for the development of bispecific antibodies is bright. This new class of agents is likely to bring new therapies and many additional clinical trials to patients with lymphomas and other cancers in the near term.

The retired Philadelphia Eagles center bizarrely accused Secretariat the horse that won the Triple Crown in 1973 of cheating during the latest episode his his New Heights podcast with brother Travis Kelce.

'Secretariat was juiced to the gills' Kelce claimed on the podcast. 'Secretariat just so happens to be right in the heart of the steroid era.

'(In) 1973 every NFL player every baseball player they were juicing them to the gills. You don't think Secretariat was f–king juiced to the rafters? Of course it's the fastest horse of all-time.'

His comments sparked backlash on social media ultimately forcing Kelce into apologizing with one user claiming that the legendary center must have CTE - the brain disease many NFL stars have been diagnosed with post-mortem especially veterans playing late into their careers.

Jason Kelce admitted he believes he has CTE following his dazzling 13-year career in the NFL

The Philadelphia Eagles legend claimed he can almost guarantee he suffers with the disease

Kelce's bold claims came after he suggested racehorse Secretariat cheated

'[Y]ou know who else makes unsubstantiated claims not backed up by facts. People suffering from CTE. I'll admit I don't know whether @JasonKelce suffers from CTE or not it's impossible to know' they posted.

Kelce surprisingly responded to the dig by suggesting that he more than likely does suffer with the brain disease.

'I mean I can virtually guarantee that I have CTE all the research would suggest I have some degree of it' he replied. 'I think it is entirely reasonable to assume I have some degree of that pathology.'

The social media user later insisted he didn't mean to cause any offense but an unbothered Kelce brushed it off saying it was just the reality he faces.

'I understand I don't take offense at all. what I’m saying is that it’s completely reasonable to think I have CTE' he added.

'Even though there is no test to see if I currently have CTE The evidence suggests I probably do. Just like the reality that a lot if not most of the high level horses of the 70s and 80s were doping because adequate tests were not available.

'But it really doesn’t accomplish anything to bring this up I don’t know why I started Secretariat was still a fantastic horse and legendary specimen.'

An unbothered Kelce brushed it off saying it was just the reality he faces

Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown unsurprisingly had a less-than-sensitive response to Kelce's admission.

Brown who has become an internet provocateur attacking the likes of Tom Brady and Caitlin Clark online has repeatedly joked about having CTE on X.

The controversial former NFL star has even created a social media page known as CTESPN in order to mock the original ESPN network

Brown quote-tweeted a post reporting Kelce's claim writing: 'First step is admitting it. #CTESPN.'

Kelce was also concerned over the impact of CTE towards the end of his career the Philadelphia Inquirer's Marcus Hayes reported following the end of the Eagles' 2023 season and just weeks before the veteran announced his retirement.

He reportedly struggled to remember the date of a teammate's injury and quipped that it was 'the CTE creeping in'.

The former NFL wide receiver has repeatedly joked about having CTE on social media

Kelce previously expressed his concerns about the impacts of CTE during his Amazon Prime documentary last year.

'There have been little things that are not big things yet but are going to turn into big things the longer I play' he said.

'Not to dress like an elephant in the NFL room but I am fearful about what the impacts of playing football are going to mean long-term. I have two girls and ... some people end up getting CTE and some guys live long healthy lives.

'I have no idea what's going to happen with that because I've thought about this' he said thinking of the amount of physical impacts in the game and if 'it might come back to bite me.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL3N0YXJ2aW5nLWJyb3duLXBlbGljYW5zLW92ZXJ3aGVsbS1iaXJkLXJlc2N1ZS1mYWNpbGl0eS1mYWlyZmllbGQv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3NhbmZyYW5jaXNjby9uZXdzL3N0YXJ2aW5nLWJyb3duLXBlbGljYW5zLW92ZXJ3aGVsbS1iaXJkLXJlc2N1ZS1mYWNpbGl0eS1mYWlyZmllbGQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starving brown pelicans overwhelm bird rescue facility in Fairfield,"FAIRFIELD -- A wildlife crisis is playing out in the Bay Area and along the California coast. Thousands of brown pelicans are starving to death and scientists don't seem to know why. Now one local rescue center is desperately appealing to the public for help.

On Saturday a public open house at the International Bird Rescue Center in Fairfield almost didn't happen but they decided to go through with it anyway because they thought it was important for the public to understand the crisis they're dealing with. The rescue center is accustomed to dealing with injured or sick birds but what began slowly in April has suddenly become overwhelming.

""We were all going back and forth like 'Is this a thing is this not a thing?' And then in the last four or five days things have just cratered"" said the center's fevelopment director Alex Domeyko. ""The number of pelicans we've taken in in the last week or so has doubled.""

""For the first time in ten years this is the most pelicans I've ever seen here so it's quite unusual"" said wildlife center manager Kelly Beffa.

Brown pelicans are the birds you see at the beach skimming over the water in formation like a squadron of fighter planes. Lately they've been found wandering in unusual places unable to fly away from people.

""One bird that we actually have in care right now came in from Santa Cruz and it tried to walk into a bar right near the boardwalk. So these birds are disoriented"" said spokesperson Russ Curtis.

They're not sick they're starving. For some reason that remains a mystery the birds cannot find the fish they need to survive. They eat the same diet as other birds but it is only the pelicans that are being brought in by the dozens.

""One of the things that we'll be relying on is ocean scientists and avian folks to figure out why this fishing stock is eluding them"" Curtis said.

""Some of them are coming in less than half of the body weight that they're supposed to be"" said Beffa as she examined a new arrival. ""So imagine a human going through that. You're supposed to weigh 150 pounds you're coming in at 75 pounds. You're going to be having some severe problems.""

The rescue center currently has 120 pelicans and is expecting another 30 to 40 in a few days. As a result the operation is facing a crisis of its own.

""Right now we're going through 500 pounds of fish a day"" said Curtis. ""That's about $1000 a day so you can start to multiply that out.""

The birds respond well to the food and vitamins they're getting but they can't be released into the wild until there is a food supply for them. It's putting a major drain on the center's finances so they're asking for help -- donations to help pay for food and volunteers to help care for so many patients.

""I mean especially for crises like this where we take in this many birds we need as many hands on deck as we can get"" Domeyko said. ""And volunteers are the backbone of this organization.""

No one knows for sure why this is happening or when it might end. Pelicans burn a lot of calories and can die within days with no food. The fear is for each of the birds that have been captured and saved many more have already perished in the wild.

The center says any pelican found acting strangely should be reported immediately to local animal control.

The mural is done by Chicago’s Emmy Star Brown who said it’s the biggest mural she’s painted so far. And she’s painted a lot of murals. She finished this one in December 2022.

“We wanted to create a bright spot for the community that felt joyful and reflective” Brown says.

“I wanted to create a really inspiring impactful piece that served as a visual landmark a statement piece something you can see from the bike path above as well as from Touhy driving by” she says. The mural rises with the pedestrian bridge to 36 feet tall at its highest point.

“It’s a piece that encourages you to pause and take a moment ... to reflect on and hopefully connect with a piece of your younger self.”

The mural is part of a rebirth on the plot at the northwest corner of Touhy and Lincoln avenues — or an “exorcism  ” as Sun-Times reporter David Roeder described it.

When it closed in 2007 and was torn down in 2013 the Purple Hotel had a reputation for drug-fueled parties and was remembered as the site of a mob hit back when it was a Hyatt. The desolate property sat vacant strewn with debris until construction on the mixed-use project known as District 1860 began in 2021. Now apartments are up for lease and restaurants are seating tables. When completed the 8.7-acre project from Tucker Development will include residential units retail and restaurant space and an Amazon Fresh anchor store.

Inspiring connection with one’s inner child is a common theme not just in the Lincolnwood mural but in much of Brown’s recent work. It grew as she taught calligraphy classes in the mid-2010s and realized that she wanted her students to “find their creative imaginative playful selves again.” This realization also led to her to begin painting murals.

“What if I had the opportunity to do a large-scale mural in my calligraphy writing style writing a positive quote?” she wondered. “Something that could really inspire someone or change the course of their day.”

She convinced a gallery in Logan Square to let her paint her mural on the wall for one month. She painted in white script on a black wall: “in a world where you can be anything be kind.”

The mural went viral. Couples traveled to take their wedding photos in front of it. Members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers saw it and asked her to paint her second mural for their shows.

Now Brown said she’s painted dozens of murals with about 13 of them in Fulton Market alone. Her murals and artwork can be found on both interior and exterior walls of coffee shops restaurants and retail stores all over Chicago as well as in private collections. She painted a ceiling mural for a private condo building and licensed her art to a hotel for key cards and other features. She has partnered with brands like Field Notes and Yeti where her patterns grace their book covers and tumbler walls.

Earlier in her career Brown worked primarily in black and white and painted solid glass windows that she found in Chicago dumpsters. Her career exploded after she signed a year-long contract with Sharpie which ran a documentary-style commercial of her on MTV featured her on a billboard in Times Square and showed her in ads in major magazines.

“That changed my life” she says.

Brown grew up in Glen Ellyn and attended college at Illinois Institute for the Arts. Now she works out of Kimball Arts Center in Logan Square where she painted a mural on an outside wall. She’s traveling the world to paint commissioned murals and returned most recently from painting in the British Virgin Islands. She has other murals underway that she can’t talk about yet.

Looking ahead Brown says she hopes to continue with a balance between the murals she loves her licensed work and her studio practice. An exhibition of her work titled “Familiar Form” opened May 3 at Vertical Gallery in Ukranian Village. The exhibit runs to May 25.

“It was a packed house the whole night” Brown says of the opening. Family members collectors who follow the gallery fans who follow her on Instagram and friends from high school college and beyond all showed up.

For a woman who grew up and built her career in and around Chicago “It feels like all my worlds colliding in one place.”

Details of the incident that led to Jones' 5:45 a.m. arrest at the Las Vegas Strip resort were not immediately made public by Las Vegas police. Jail and court records showed Jonathan Dwight Jones 34 posted $8000 bail and was due for an initial court appearance Saturday with an Oct. 26 date for prosecutors to file criminal charges.

The domestic battery charge is a misdemeanor. The vehicle charge is a felony with damage reported at more than $5000. It was not immediately clear if Jones had an attorney. Caesars Entertainment Inc. declined to comment citing an active police investigation.

At the UFC Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony

Jones lives in Albuquerque but he attended a Thursday night UFC Hall of Fame induction ceremony at the Park MGM hotel honoring his 2013 fight with Alexander Gustafsson. Jones (26-1 1 no-contest) had three separate stints as the UFC's light heavyweight champion from 2011 to 2020 and he is widely considered one of the greatest fighters in MMA history.

But his UFC career has been defined more by misbehavior outside the cage than his excellence in it. In 2012 a year after becoming the youngest champion in UFC history Jones was arrested for DUI after crashing his Bentley into a telephone pole in upstate Binghamton New York.

Jones then lost his title in 2015 when he was arrested and charged with a felony stemming from a hit-and-run accident in New Mexico in which he broke a pregnant driver's arm.

Jones pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct in 2019 after an incident with a waitress at a strip club in Albuquerque and he was arrested last year in Albuquerque on charges of aggravated driving under the influence and negligent use of a firearm.

Several drug tests

Jones has failed several drug tests from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency which runs the UFC's antidoping program. He was forced out of a fight with Daniel Cormier at UFC 200 in 2016 after testing positive for two banned substances that he blamed on a sexual enhancement pill.

He then tested positive for an anabolic steroid in 2017 prompting the UFC to strip his light heavyweight title for a second time. The California State Athletic Commission overturned the result of his victory over Cormier at UFC 214 and Jones received a 15-month competitive suspension.

Because of his arrests suspensions and various disputes with the UFC Jones has fought only eight times in the last eight years during the ostensible prime of his career. He hasn't fought since beating Dominick Reyes in February 2020 for his fourth consecutive victory.

Jones relinquished the light heavyweight title last year and declared his intention to move up to heavyweight. He told reporters Thursday night he wants to weigh 270 pounds when he makes his heavyweight debut hopefully next spring.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vcGxhdHRldmFsbGV5Lm5ld3NjaGFubmVsbmVicmFza2EuY29tL3N0b3J5LzQ0MjMzMTI2L2Nhc2luby1jb21pbmctdG8tY29sdW1idXMtZXhwZWN0ZWQtdG8tYmUtY29tcGxldGVkLWluLWxhdGUtMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casino coming to Columbus expected to be completed in late 2022,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzkvMjUvbW1hLXVmYy1qb24tam9uZXMtYXJyZXN0ZWQtZG9tZXN0aWMtdmlvbGVuY2UtdmVoaWNsZS1kYW1hZ2XSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjEvOS8yNS9tbWEtdWZjLWpvbi1qb25lcy1hcnJlc3RlZC1kb21lc3RpYy12aW9sZW5jZS12ZWhpY2xlLWRhbWFnZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UFC’s Jon Jones arrested for domestic violence vehicle damage,"Former UFC light heavyweight champion arrested in Las Vegas following Hall of Fame induction.

He then tested positive for an anabolic steroid in 2017 prompting the UFC to strip his light heavyweight title for a second time. The California State Athletic Commission overturned the result of his victory over Cormier at UFC 214 and Jones received a 15-month competitive suspension.

Because of his arrests suspensions and various disputes with the UFC Jones has fought only eight times in the last eight years during the ostensible prime of his career. He has not fought since beating Dominick Reyes in February 2020 for his fourth consecutive victory.

Jones relinquished the light heavyweight title last year and said on Thursday prior to the Hall of Fame ceremony that he wants his next bout to be at heavyweight. He told ESPN that he now weighs 115.5kg (255 pounds) and is targeting 270 pounds as his ideal weight.

He is eyeing a fight next year against the winner of a likely upcoming bout between Francis Ngannou and Ciryl Gane. The date has not been made public.

Drumming great Pepe Jimenez is famous around Las Vegas for keeping a super-steady beat. But even he has been knocked off rhythm over the past week because of a heart scare he learned of while playing at Allegiant Stadium.

Jimenez powers David Perrico’s Las Vegas Raiders House Band. The drummer’s call to the stadium stage has been delayed however until Sunday’s tilt against the Miami Dolphins. Jimenez is behind the skins for his first NFL game ever after undergoing triple bypass surgery Aug. 11.

“I am back playing” Jimenez said Saturday afternoon. “I’m ready. I cannot be home anymore.”

A universally respected musician Jimenez spent two years with Carlos Santana and many more with Santa Fe & The Fat City Horns over nearly two decades in town. He’s pounded the beats for “Storm” “Mamma Mia!” and “The Lion King” at Mandalay Bay Criss Angel’s “Believe” at Luxor Frankie Moreno at The Strat (then Stratosphere) “Baz” at Palazzo Theatre and The Hot Club of Las Vegas.

Jimenez joined Perrico’s Pop Strings in 2017 and was its primary drummer for most of its residency at Cleopatra’s Barge at Caesars Palace. Jimenez was onstage when the band played its first “empty nest” performance at Allegiant Stadium in June. The band returned for more work in the vacant stadium Aug. 7.

That’s when it got interesting medically for Jimenez. He’d undergone heart tests that morning then headed directly to the stadium. As Jimenez was jamming with Perrico and what would be the Raiders’ house band his phone started flashing.

“Same number over and over” Jimenez said. “I didn’t recognize it. I kept looking down and thinking ‘This person is persistent!’”

It was the cardiologist who had just conducted Jimenez’s heart exam feverishly attempting to reach the musician.

“She said ‘Whatever you are doing stop doing it and get to the emergency room’” Jimenez said. “You have two fully clogged arteries.”

Jimenez was shocked.

“I felt a little tired” he said “but the way I play makes me tired. I thought it was normal. But they told me I was in immediate danger of having a heart attack.”

At hearing the jarring news of his condition Jimenez did what any proficient passionate musician would do.

He finished the gig.

“I said ‘You don’t understand. We are in a stadium. Too many people are depending on me to play right now’” Jimenez said. “I promise I will come to the emergency room when we are finished.”

Jimenez did that but he didn’t stay. He played again the next day Aug. 8 which would be the band’s formal audition at Allegiant Stadium. Only then did he check himself back into the hospital to be prepped for open heart surgery.

Doctors had discovered a third blocked artery so this was a major operation.

“They opened me up like a turkey on Thanksgiving” Jimenez said. “It was pretty intense.”

Jimenez’s surgeon Dr. Thomas d’Amato is also a musician. A cellist specifically.

“We talked a lot about my condition but a lot about music too” Jimenez said.

The surgery lasted about four hours. Jimenez was walking short distances within two days. He was back home in five. Given six weeks to return to playing he started practicing on pads in two weeks. He recorded himself playing a solo and showed it to his cellist-doctor on his next visit.

“He watched it and said ‘Wow you’re good!’” Jimenez said.

While Jimenez was away his son Miguel filled in on drums for the Raiders band.

“That’s actually good for me” the elder Jimenez said “because I get a piece of his payment.”

Perrico said he learned Aug. 7 of Jimenez’s health.

“It’s just like the NFL you go with the next man up” Perrico said. “Every player has a sub. We have a line of subs they have the music ahead of time. I immediately sent him all the music all the links and nailed it with no rehearsal. He was in the hot seat.”

Pepe Jimenez was back full scale for its Friday performance at the stadium honoring Tom Flores’ induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Other than being told he can’t lift objects heavier than 30 pounds (which is a directive with which he’s happy to comply) Jimenez says he’s fit and ready to rock.

“I wasn’t in bad shape; I didn’t eat badly or anything like that” the drummer said. “It’s genetics. Some of have that gift from our relatives from our mom and dad. That’s what happened with me.”

At age 55 Jimenez says he is eager to use his story as a reminder to be diligent about your health.

“Get checked that’s why I am talking about this” he said. “If I hadn’t gone in for a deep exam a CAT scan and all of the testing it would be a different story.”

My journey here has been a long and fulfilling one. I joined Capital One 15 years ago straight after graduating from Queen’s University. Prior to being appointed president earlier this year I led the customer acquisitions and customer management groups and had the opportunity to support many areas of the business from credit and brand marketing to operations and customer engagement. As president I’m responsible for the overall strategic direction and operations of the Canadian business—our goal is to help customers succeed with credit and our products and services are designed with that in mind.

I strongly believe everyone brings unique strengths to the table and by making space for everyone to be heard you’re maximizing your team to its fullest potential. As a leader I recognize my privilege and believe it’s my responsibility to create equal opportunities for different perspectives to be heard; not to demand perfection but to support progress. When faced with challenging issues I invite a broad group of people to share their perspectives to build consensus on key decisions. Their input provides me with better information and gives us all an opportunity to expand our thinking by learning from others.

What role can Canadian financial institutions play in fostering a more inclusive society during a period of immense social change?

The past 18 months have seen unprecedented upheaval in almost every facet of society. We are reckoning with incredibly challenging times but the emerging social issues aren’t new. Whether relating to racial justice or public health these issues have been thrust into the forefront. As a society we’ve never been more aware of the experiences of marginalized groups and we can no longer operate as if everyone is treated equally or has the same challenges.

As a financial institution we have an incredible opportunity to make a difference in people’s lives. We are here to help and reinforce our customers’ confidence regardless of where they are in their financial journey—and we must reimagine our customer relationships as an investment in their future. If we can empower people to know that they are not alone and that there are resources and people who can help them overcome their difficult circumstances we can slowly build a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.

At Capital One diversity inclusion and belonging are the cornerstones of our culture. Whether it’s through our business resource groups training and development or day-to-day work everyone has an opportunity to get involved and make a difference for our associates customers and community. We are also actively supporting educational technology initiatives through our partnerships with organizations such as The Learning Partnership a Canadian charity focused on developing and deploying innovative education to early learners. Our partnership last year enabled the Coding Quest program which is the largest classroom-based coding program available to publicly funded schools across the country aimed at enriching STEM learning and preparing the workforce of the future.

What role can technology play in fostering financial inclusion?

The digital revolution has changed how we communicate connect with people shop travel manage our health—and our money. When we envision the future of banking we don’t start with how banking works or what other banks are doing. We look at how technology is changing our lives. By leveraging real-time data and cutting-edge technology our goal is to provide customers with new experiences that enable them to make better financial decisions which also helps advance financial inclusion. We know a one-size-fits-all approach isn’t the future of finance.

That’s one of the reasons why we created Quick Check an online tool that allows Canadians to know which Capital One credit card they can be approved for without impacting their credit score. Quick Check has been used more than one million times in Canada which we believe points to a strong need for people to take back some control in their financial lives.

What financial anxieties do you see being experienced by Canadians today and how is Capital One helping customers and employees overcome them?

We know that financial anxieties are at an all-time high. We also understand that not everyone faces the same challenges—people’s needs are different and their circumstances change suddenly. One thing we have heard over and again is that the unprecedented uncertainty has been a major source of stress in people’s lives—the uncertainty about lockdowns job security and finances. And stress can have a profound impact on our sense of control and decision-making. At Capital One we have been focused on empowering Canadians to develop healthier financial habits—our goal is to increase our customers’ financial awareness so they can make better decisions with their money and overall take greater control of their lives.

As leaders this time also demands bravery—we must rewrite the social contract with our workforce while keeping in mind that our employees have been through a lot in the past 18 months. Many are continuing to manage challenging physical and mental health struggles as well as caregiving needs. As a leader I welcome expressions of vulnerability both from our employees and customers. We are in it together and we will meet you no matter where you are in your life and financial journey—and we will help you succeed.

The Washington Capitals released their roster for tomorrow night’s preseason opener against the Boston Bruins at Capital One Arena. (5 PM ET NBC Sports Washington locally NHL Network nationally). Since 2011-12 the Capitals are 18-5-4 at home in preseason games.

As expected tomorrow night’s preseason opener will feature a number of key prospects in the Capitals lineup. Connor McMichael Hendrix Lapierre Garret Pilon Beck Malenstyn Brett Leason Brian Pinho Riley Sutter Joe Snively Dylan McIlrath Martin Fehervary and Martin Has will all suit up for tomorrow nights game.

Connor McMichael will appear in the Capitals’ first preseason game this season after appearing in two preseason games in 2019-20 where he recorded an assist. “I was fortunate enough to get a game [with the Caps] last year and then obviously able to play in Hershey a year earlier” says McMichael. “I think it benefited me a lot and it’s made me feel more comfortable in this camp with the same goal of trying to crack the lineup.”

Hendrix Lapierre will make his debut for the Capitals. He was drafted 22nd overall in the 2020 NHL Draft. In the 2020-21 season Lapierre ranked eighth in the QMJHL in points per game (1.48) recording 31 points (8g 23a) in 21 games with Chicoutimi. Lapierre led Chicoutimi in assists and ranked second on the team in points.

In total 12 players selected by Washington in the NHL draft are in the lineup for Washington on Sunday.

NHL rules state that teams must dress a minimum of eight “veterans” for each preseason game but the League’s definition of a “veteran” is quite generous at this time of year. Any forward or defenseman who played in 30 or more NHL games in the previous season qualifies as does any goaltender who dressed for 50 or more or played in 30 or more games in the previous season.

Additionally a first-round draft choice from the most recent NHL Draft qualifies as a “vet” for the purposes of preseason roster building as does any player with 100 or more career games. These standards include playoff games. For this autumn those numbers have been prorated to last season’ 56-game slate so players who played in 20 or more games and goalies who dressed for 34 or more games will qualify as vets during the 2021 preseason.

Capitals’ head coach Peter Laviollete discussed his general plan for players playing in the six preseason games in his post-practice media availability on Saturday.

And many of these same staffers would argue that Alaska Mileage Plan is one of the best frequent flyer programs. Even so Alaska Mileage Plan may not be the best option every time you want to redeem miles to fly on Alaska-operated flights.

So today I'll discuss a lesser-known sweet spot: using Japan Airlines Mileage Bank for multi-city Alaska-operated awards.

Get the latest points miles and travel news by signing up for TPG's free daily newsletter.

Why it's special

The Japan Airlines Mileage Bank program has a distance-based partner award chart. This award chart is appealing for trips where you want to fly on multiple relatively short Alaska-operated flights. Here's a look at the economy award chart:

Up to 1000 miles trip distance : 12000 miles

: 12000 miles 1001 to 2000 miles trip distance : 15000 miles

: 15000 miles 2001 to 4000 miles trip distance : 23000 miles

: 23000 miles 4001 to 6000 miles trip distance : 37000 miles

: 37000 miles 6001 to 8000 miles trip distance : 45000 miles

: 45000 miles 8001 to 10000 miles trip distance : 47000 miles

: 47000 miles 10001 to 12000 miles trip distance : 50000 miles

: 50000 miles 12001 to 14000 miles trip distance : 55000 miles

: 55000 miles 14001 to 20000 miles trip distance : 70000 miles

: 70000 miles 20001 to 25000 miles trip distance : 90000 miles

: 90000 miles 25001 to 29000 miles trip distance : 110000 miles

: 110000 miles 29001 to 34000 miles trip distance : 130000 miles

: 130000 miles 34001 to 50000 miles trip distance: 150000 miles

As you can see the number of miles required for an award ticket depends on your total trip distance. However there are several complexities to consider including:

One award can have up to six flights and up to three stopovers of more than 24 hours.

An award can open-jaw on at most one stopover -- but surface sector distance during this stopover won't count toward the total trip distance.

Itineraries with surface sectors may not be allowed as one award ticket in some cases.

You can include the same city in an itinerary up to three times but you can only stop in a city once.

For example you could start in Seattle and stopover in Fairbanks Anchorage and Portland before returning to Seattle. This 3465-mile route would cost 23000 miles per person plus taxes and fees in economy.

Or you could start in Seattle and stopover in Honolulu Los Angeles and San Jose del Cabo before returning to Seattle. This 7958-mile route would cost 45000 miles per person plus taxes and fees in economy.

You could also start in San Francisco and stopover in Anchorage Honolulu and Cancun (after connecting through San Diego) before returning to San Francisco. This 11844-mile award would cost 50000 miles per person plus taxes and fees in economy.

In short the options are essentially limitless if you can find partner award availability for each segment.

How to book this award

I recommend searching for (and finding) award availability on American Airlines' website. Then go to the Japan Airlines website and log into your Mileage Bank account. Click on JAL Mileage Bank on the top menu bar and select ""JMB Partner Airlines Award Ticket"" under the ""Redeem your miles"" section. Next click on ""JMB Partner Airlines Award Ticket"" under ""Book ticket.""

(Screenshot courtesy of jal.co.jp)

Now select ""Staying in multiple cities"" and choose Alaska Airlines as the partner airline. Then choose your travel pattern and enter your flight information.

(Screenshot courtesy of jal.co.jp)

If there's award availability on your dates you'll see options on the next page after you click ""Search.""

(Screenshot courtesy of jal.co.jp)

You can also call the U.S. and Canada English-language JAL Mileage Bank Center at 1-800-525-3663. However there's a $50 ticket service fee when you book over the phone (you won't pay this fee when booking online).

How to earn Japan Airlines miles for this award

(Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy)

Perhaps the biggest shortcoming to this sweet spot is that it can be challenging to earn Japan Airlines miles. After all the only major transferrable currency that transfers to JAL MileageBank is Marriott Bonvoy at a 3:1 ratio with a 5000 mile bonus awarded for every 60000 Marriott points transferred.

If you're looking to earn more Marriott Bonvoy points consider opening a Marriott Bonvoy cobranded credit cards. Many of these cards are offering higher than usual welcome bonuses and can be a great way to top up your Marriott account. Just be aware that you may lose value when transferring Marriott points to an airline instead of redeeming for hotel nights.

There is also a JAL MileageBank credit card available in the U.S: the JAL USA CARD. This card has a lower annual fee version that earns 0.5x points on qualifying purchases and a higher annual fee version that offers 1x points.

Bottom line

Since it's often difficult to earn Japan Airlines miles this sweet spot is easy to overlook. And it won't be a reasonable option every time you want to redeem miles to fly on an Alaska-operated flight.

But if you find partner award availability and can maximize the up to three allowable stopovers on your award this sweet spot may be appealing. However note that you can't redeem Japan Airlines miles within the first 60 days of enrolling in the Japan Airlines Mileage Bank program. And you can only redeem miles for travel by yourself and select family members."

Rather than just having cubicles or dedicated offices spread throughout the building they wanted to create spaces for the different ways people work these days.

Executives still wanted places for employees to work at a desk if they wanted but also to give them the option of plugging in their computers to work in other places throughout the building. Employees needed to have access to smaller private spaces to make a phone call or conduct a small meeting.

The company also sought a more open office environment for collaboration brainstorming and strategizing with colleagues.

CarMax officials wanted employees involved in the process and sought their input by talking to them about what the space should look like. They conducted tests with employees on the different types of furniture and the various space configurations to see what worked best.

This month the Goochland County-based retailer opened what it calls CarMax Midtown its innovation center in the Putney Building at 2220 W. Broad St.

The 120000-square-foot building originally used as a Putney Shoe factory building when it opened in 1906 was completely renovated. It is between the main offices of the Department of Motor Vehicles on West Broad Street and a Lee’s Chicken restaurant near the Whole Foods Market store in the Sauer Center mixed-use development.

“We were going for areas where we wanted to connect and spark ideas and spark creativity and play off of each other’s thoughts” said Jim Lyski CarMax’s executive vice president and chief marketing officer who oversaw the revamping of the building’s space.

“What we’ve done here is to evolve to the next level ... to create this collaboration space that is highly productive but also highly creative” he said.

When CarMax first began planning for the center it was months before the pandemic and the chain hadn’t given much thought to remote work or even how that might play into its plans. “When the pandemic hit it just put everything on fast-forward. Everything became even more reinforcing of those design concepts.”

That meant designing space built around a remote-first workplace model that emphasizes flexibility for employees. The plan was to provide office space for in-person work if the employee wanted that but the design needed to have a greater importance for areas of collaboration and company gatherings.

“I think one of the important design thinking aspects of this was that we wanted the space to fit the work” Lyski said. “If you want to go heads down [to work at a desk on a computer] there are quiet spaces for that so nobody will talk to you. But if you need to collaborate there’s obvious collaboration spaces. If you need to socialize there’s socialization spaces.”

CarMax isn’t alone in rethinking its office space needs. Many businesses have been doing so in recent years particularly in the past year because of the pandemic according to the Society for Human Resource Management.

“They’re reconsidering how to effectively use office space now that many employers are doing hybrid work” said SHRM knowledge advisor Kimberly McNeil.

“The office is becoming more like the hub where people come together to collaborate to offer social interaction” she said. “We’re seeing a lot of employers move away from assigned seating to more open workspaces.”

Brent Smith a professor of real estate at Virginia Commonwealth University said employers need to be flexible with their workspace needs but they also need to make them look more dynamic.

“Now that everybody has worked at home for 18 months they have found ways to get comfortable in that environment and still be productive” Smith said. “If you look at some of these newer spaces ... you’re transplanting that comfortability that they had at the house into the office space. Instead of having this stoic structure that’s really homogeneous and requires this certain posture both physically and structurally ... you’re seeing the continuation of comfortability combined with productivity.”

***

CarMax shifted gears in the past year in how the space in the Putney Building would be configured because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The biggest change made was reducing the maximum occupancy from accommodating about 750 workers to having about 600 employees assigned to the building.

“Everything was spread out a little bit more than it was previously” Lyski said.

But given the ability to work from home he expects about 200 to 300 people might work there on a regular day.

“We have no mandates. We have told employees we want you to be the most productive person you can be and if you can do that 100% in the office great. If you can do that 100% at home great. But most of you are going to want to leverage both environments” he said.

There are about 550 seating options available throughout the building. These include places where employees can plug in their laptop computers at about 400 desks as well as a variety of high-top tables soft chairs and bench couches. That doesn’t include the building’s various meeting spaces.

Employees also are not assigned a desk but are told to sit in designated areas within the building based on the teams. They can reserve a desk by using their smartphones to scan a QR code on an available desk. Conference rooms can be reserved either from a mobile phone a laptop or from the screen at the entrance to the room.

Reconfiguring the workspace to provide more open common space is what a lot of companies are doing VCU’s Smith said

Employees he said spend a certain amount of time weekly working on their computer and the rest of the time is spent brainstorming or strategizing with colleagues. Businesses will adapt and have space where employees can come to an office and do their independent work if they want to but spend the bulk of their time at the office interacting with others.

“When we need to come together we can come together. When we’re working on our own we can pretty much be flexible to do that just about anywhere” Smith said.

The second-biggest change to CarMax’s initial plans was how to accommodate the hybrid worker so that person would feel present in a videoconferencing meeting.

“If you’re not present in the meeting because the technology is glitchy or I can’t hear or I can’t see you’re not productive you’re not helping us. That’s the second-biggest change and where we conducted a lot of experimentation” Lyski said.

All of the conference rooms or meeting spaces in the building can easily be set up so employees simply push a button on a screen or tablet to join or create a meeting. Cameras in the rooms can zoom in to allow participates to clearly see documents so they can collaborate in real time.

The other key part is that the meeting rooms also have two large screens on the walls — one to see those participants who are working remotely and the other to show the presentation.

“The reason that you see these two monitors everywhere is it’s about presentation and presence” said Eric Martin the chain’s assistant vice president for product design who was part of the team overseeing the configuration of the new space.

“We realized that the remote individuals needed to feel like they were part of a team. What we learned from our experiments is that most setups have one large display but you lost the people” he said. “The value is when you’re in a presentation with remote participants you want to see them and they see you by one central widescreen camera. It creates a sense of community and collaboration that bridges that gap between in-person and remote.”

The pods around the space or on the conference room tables are microphones that enable the worker to have a natural conversation so they don’t have to speak loudly or put a headset on Martin said.

“That way you can actually focus on the meeting because everyone is looking at everyone else. That’s the environment that we want to create — speaking naturally making eye contact feeling like that’s a group that’s having a productive conversation without having to think about technology at all” he said.

Before the pandemic CarMax was starting to think about how to facilitate better productive meetings that could be remote. The pandemic changed that Lyski said.

“We’re a hybrid forever now. You have got to be able to have in-person/remote combo meetings” he said. “Everything is designed to facilitate that virtual presence seamlessly with the physical presence. That’s probably one of the major design tenants of everything we’ve done here.”

The building has only two enclosed offices — one for Lyski and one for the company’s chief information officer — largely because they are often in confidential meetings he said.

***

The building which had been used by the Virginia Department of Taxation for years until 2011 is home to CarMax employees working in digital services technology innovation product design and marketing.

Most relocated from CarMax’s headquarters in the West Creek office park in Goochland or from the company’s former digital and technology innovation center in the Lady Byrd Hat building along the Canal Walk in downtown Richmond as well as from office space in the nearby Canal Crossing building in Shockoe Bottom.

CarMax began leasing space in the historic Lady Byrd Hat building in 2016 and started leasing in the Canal Crossing building in 2019. The chain began leasing that space because it was starting to outgrow its 250000-square-foot corporate headquarters space that opened in 2005.

The company decided not to renew the leases at those two buildings a spokesperson said.

The location of the Putney Building Lyski said is ideal to help the company attract and retain top talented workers because it is between VCU’s academic campuses and Scott’s Addition and is near the Fan District.

“When we started growing out of our space in West Creek we were thinking about how do we both accommodate more real estate needs but also how do we attract and retain this creative class that we were getting — whether in IT [information technology] or in product or in marketing” Lyski said. “They want more of an urban environment and more of a creative environment itself.”

CarMax is leasing the space from Sauer Properties the development and property entity of the Sauer family that is developing the urban mixed-use Sauer Center development. Sauer Properties bought the Putney Building from the state for $4 million in 2012.

***

In the middle of the Putney Building is a stage for large meetings or presentations.

At one end is grandstand-type seating. In between the stage and the tiered seating is a variety of couches and chairs where employees can plug in and work or simply relax.

Behind the stage is the kitchen or cafe area. It was deliberately placed to encourage better connections — and collaboration — between people working in different parts of the building Martin said.

Putting the cafe area there VCU’s Smith said makes it more of a focal point.

“It is like bringing back the water cooler concept of interaction” Smith said. “Usually these days the break room is off to the side somewhere and it is almost an afterthought. Food is big part of life and interaction and communication takes place over food. Everybody has to go there so there’s a natural alleyway or pathway through one another’s space.”

The building is divided into four neighborhoods — northeast northwest southeast and southwest — based on location from the CarMax Midtown office. Conference rooms within each area are named for different neighborhoods.

For instance the Bellevue conference room is for the northwest neighborhood. The Carver and Jackson Ward conference rooms are for those neighborhoods in the northeast sector.

Sprinkled throughout the building are 15 two-people enclosed private booths that are nearly soundproof. These allow employees to make a phone call or conduct a one-on-one meeting. There also are three one-person private booths.

In addition to conference rooms and other formal areas with tables the building has a lot of smaller breakout or medium-sized meeting areas used primarily for collaboration.

Six murals designed by local artists also were added to provide some unique artwork. Two pieces on the second level were installed as a nod to the iconic neon sign atop the C.F. Sauer headquarters and manufacturing plant complex at 2000 W. Broad St. at Hermitage Road.

More murals are planned from artists from the Richmond region.

“Murals are one thing that Richmond is well-known for” Lyski said “and we wanted to be part of the fabric of the city.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not shy about my affection for minivans. And so despite having no kids and still being in the middle of a pandemic that makes it dangerous to spend time with other people in small enclosed spaces I said ""yes"" when Kia asked if I wanted to spend some time with its new $32100 Carnival minivan. Because as already noted minivans are wonderful.

They're handsome too at least when we're talking about the Carnival. Kia's designers went with a two-box shape and embraced the boxiness. To my eye the proportions are spot-on particularly in profile where its shape falls midway between hatchback and station wagon that's been scaled up by 20 percent.

Distinguishing features include the brand's big ""tiger nose"" grille up front and since our test car was the Carnival SX (MSRP: $41100) a textured chrome panel on the C pillar that gives you something interesting to look at up close. My photos fail to do justice to the optional ($495) ceramic silver paint which sparkled with pink and gold flecks in the sunlight. Together with the SX's black alloy wheels and the silver accents it all works well.

The inside is voluminous in the way you want a people carrier to be. The Carnival is available in either an eight-seat layout (as was the case for our test Carnival) with a middle row that slides and can be removed or as a seven-seater with a pair of reclining heated and ventilated captain's chairs for the middle row. In both cases the third row can fold flat into the floor to increase cargo room from 40.2 cubic feet (1138 L) to 86.9 cubic feet (2460 L). The third row is also only really a three-seat row for small children.

As I've written before Kia's UVO infotainment system is actually pretty decent with a UI that at times reminds me of the old days of pre-OS X Macintoshes. Being an SX trim our test Carnival also had screens built into the seat backs of both front seats. These have a kids mode and the screens can also mirror a phone via Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Each row has its own USB-A ports but phone casting also works wirelessly and a wireless charging pad is built into the center console.

Beyond that there's a good suite of advanced driver-assistance systems as standard including automatic emergency braking blind-spot monitors rear cross-traffic alerts lane keeping (adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go is standard on EX and SX trims) and headlights that automatically dip for oncoming traffic.

It’s a great minivan but I have one complaint

Behind the tiger's nose (or under the hood if you prefer) is a 3.5 L V6 which generates 290 hp (216 kW) and 262 lb-ft (355 Nm) sending power to the front wheels via Kia's in-house eight speed automatic transmission. It's rated at a combined 22 mpg (10.69 L/100 km) which means the time has come for my one big complaint about the Carnival: why didn't Kia at least make it a hybrid?

It's not like Kia (and corporate sibling Hyundai) doesn't know how to electrify a vehicle; its hybrids are some of the best in the industry and it's probably the mainstream OEM that's closest to Tesla in terms of electric powertrain efficiency. But for some reason just like the highly popular Telluride and Palisade SUVs you have no alternative here but pure fossil power. To make things worse the Carnival shares a platform with the Kia Sorento SUV and that is an efficient hybrid!

The Carnival is level-pegged with the Honda Odyssey in terms of efficiency but it's blown away by the 35 mpg (6.72 L/100 km) hybrid Toyota Sienna and plug-in hybrid Chrysler Pacifica (which will do about 28 miles on a full battery before you even need to bother the engine and 30 mpg 7.84 L/100 km even when the battery is empty ).

An electric motor would also improve the driving experience. Not that the Carnival is lacking—the lower center of gravity in a minivan compared to a three-row SUV gives the minivan an inherent advantage in terms of handling and the ride was smooth and absorbed road imperfections well. Kia says that the Carnival is stiffer than the old Sedona it replaces thanks to more high-strength steel in the chassis. The car also has more sound deadening and insulation to keep the inside calm and serene at highway cruising speeds.

But as anyone who's spent time in an electrified car knows the instant torque of an electric motor is hard to beat particularly with bigger heavier vehicles. The automotive rumor mill does suggest that a hybrid and (eventually) even a full battery electric Carnival could appear once Kia wraps up the Stinger production line. But I must stress that Kia itself has said nothing to that effect.

Carnival Corp recorded a $2.8 billion loss in the third quarter of this year AP reported.

The company said sales were knocked this summer due to the impact of the Delta variant of COVID-19.

Shares rose on Friday however after the company expects soaring demand for next year.

Carnival Corp the world's biggest cruise line recorded a $2.8 billion loss in the third quarter of this year as concerns over the Delta variant of COVID-19 impacted sales.

Associated Press reported that shares rose 3% on Friday however after the cruise line operator said bookings for the second half of next year are running ahead of 2019 levels.

The average ship was only 59% full in August Carnival told AP. That was an improvement from 39% in June.

The cruise industry has been one of the hardest-hit sectors following the huge disruption caused by the pandemic. Former and current cruise employees recently told Insider how they had to reckon with loneliness fear and uncertainty while being stuck in mandatory quarantines.

AP reported that the big three cruise companies in the US did not receive the same kind of federal relief that was allotted to airlines.

But the future for Carnival looks more assured thanks to pent-up demand for cruises. In July it said advance bookings for 2022 were already higher than in 2019 Insider's Grace Dean reported.

""We reported a significant loss so we haven't recovered yet obviously but as we look ahead we see brighter days"" Carnival CEO Arnold Donald told AP. ""If things continue to trend the way they are (with COVID-19 cases) we should see positive cash flow as we get our fleet sailing broadly again.""

People are spending a lot of money on board too. The company told AP that while there were fewer passengers on board this summer they spent 20% more onboard than before the pandemic.

According to Donald the fact that people haven't been able to cruise or travel at all could be behind the increased spending. ""So they are in a mood to spend more because they haven't had a chance to in a while"" he said.

Eight of Carnival's nine cruise lines have resumed sailing with reduced schedules AP reported. The company said it anticipated its full fleet to be operating by spring 2022.

But in order to help keep themselves literally afloat many lines had to make difficult decisions including which of their ships were worth continuing to invest in and which were better beached both literally and metaphorically.

Carnival Cruise Line for example crunched the numbers and came to the conclusion to decommission several of its older ships.

So while the Carnival Victory was hanging out in Cadiz Spain getting a $200 million facelift which would transform it into the “new” Carnival Radiance other ships in the fleet wound up being sold for parts and sent to foreign shores so they could be scrapped.

PHOTOS: Haunting Images From Cruise Ship Scrapyard

To be fair these vessels — such as the Carnival Inspiration — likely would have met a similar fate a few years down the line.

During several Carnival Corporation quarterly earnings calls the company spoke about how they would “accelerate the removal of ships… which were previously expected to be sold over the ensuing years.”

Translation: The ships wound up being sold off a little earlier than expected. In better times those ships might well have found a new home at another cruise line.

For example when Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line was founded in 2014 it purchased the Costa Celebration from Carnival Corporation renamed it the Grand Celebration and began operations.

However with the industry shut down there was little call for repurposed ships making Carnival’s best option to sell the vessels for scrap.

So what exactly does the final stage of a cruise ship’s life look like? Well for those who loved a ship it can be hard to look at.

But it’s also a pretty fascinating process. The folks at Business Insider recently released an eight-minute video — which you can watch in its entirety below — which explains where sold-for-scrap ships wind up and what happens to them once they arrive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vcmlja3Jpb3JkYW4uY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvdGhlLWN1cnNlZC1jYXJuaXZhbC1jb21lLW9uZS1jb21lLWFsbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Cursed Carnival – Come one come all!,"A very happy Saturday to all!

Supply Chain Woes an Update

As I mentioned last week the publishing industry has been hit hard by COVID-related shutdowns at printing facilities that prepare our books. As a result you may well have trouble finding copies of physical books and even pre-orders may be late. Also though I signed thousands and thousands of tip-in sheets back in June those books still have not been printed so we can’t promise you will receive a signed copy. If you ordered one from one of our event bookstores you might want to check in with them and if you wish to wait until signed copies are available rather than receiving an unsigned one talk to them about what might be possible. Each store is different but we are all facing these supply chain issues which are beyond our control so please be patient and kind! I apologize for the delays and I know how frustrating they are.

The tour is close for Daughter of the Deep! Keep your eyes peeled on social media over the next week as our media coordinator Ashlee Latimer has been collecting questions from fans via Instagram and I have recorded my answers to some of the best! As you may know I personally have been off social media for over a year now but Ashlee will be sharing my video answers as we get closer to the release date for Daughter of the Deep.

Mike Pack Return to Mardi Gras

One of the most famous Carnival Cruise directors Mike Pack has returned to the flagship Mardi Gras. It comes after Pack and his wife Emma Nixon a former Carnival cruise director enjoyed time with their new baby.

Chris “The Flying Scotsman” Williams has been covering for pack on the initial Mardi Gras cruises since the ship first debuted with guests from Port Canaveral Florida at the end of July 2021. Williams did a great job bringing fun to the new vessel for the first time with new onboard experiences and shows.

“Over the last few weeks I’ve been training and getting familiar with all-things-Mardi Gras and although I was excited before it doesn’t compare to how thrilled I am now to be back with our guests and our amazing crew” said Pack. “I want to thank Chris Williams for his amazing leadership thus far and the incredible reception our guests have had for Mardi Gras and the ship’s entertainment makes this moment that much more special. Let’s get this party started!”

For Beijing it would be a matter of giving the word to send missiles and warplanes skyward from sites on the mainland.

Last year firebrand People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) Admiral Luo Yang declared that sinking two U.S. Navy supercarriers and killing 10000 sailors is a splendid idea because Americans can’t stand battle casualties and will abandon the Western Pacific if struck a hammerblow. He posits a military cause and a strategic and political effect: land a heavy military blow and your antagonist will make the political decision to quit the battlefield.

Gee. You usually have to consult the likes of Osama bin Laden or Hideki Tojo for that caliber of strategic foresight and insight. They too knew that America always flees shrieking after suffering a sneak attack. The idea that the United States is irresolute appears graven on many foreign strategists’ minds.

Keep talking admiral. Fighting words make it easier politically for us ‘Mercans to don our game face. Threats help us rally. The United States took a strategic holiday it never should have taken after the Cold War letting its readiness for major combat slip. The armed forces are now scrambling to make up for lost time. But that’s a separate problem from political moxie. No one from any U.S. political party countenances an assault on American fighting men and women—let alone one that claims more lives in an afternoon than the combined figure from seventeen years of the Global War on Terror.

Yet the fact that strategic masterminds within the PLA establishment talk openly about executing surprise attacks and mass slaughter warrants asking whether the PLAN could actually make good on Luo’s saber-rattling. Could China sink a couple of U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and stun the United States into abandoning the Western Pacific?

Short answer: maybe but don’t bet on it. It is conceivable though doubtful that the PLAN could inflict the material damage Luo espouses. Whether that would induce the United States to leave the Western Pacific and abrogate its alliance commitments is a political question whose probable answer is “no.” In other words it’s dubious whether the military stimulus would yield the desired political effect. Luo’s theory could well backfire.

Start with the military and technical side of Luo’s master plan and with the trivial case: an attack on a ship sitting at its moorings. First the basics: it is never easy to sink an American carrier. These behemoths are ruggedly built on the same philosophy as dreadnought battleships of old. Their innards are sheathed in a bulky armored box for instance while their hulls are stoutly built. Redundant systems allow crews to reroute around damaged equipment or piping systems. And on and on. These are masterpieces of naval architecture and their purpose is to withstand hard knocks and fight on.

Most retired carriers are mothballed or towed off to the shipbreaker. We witnessed an elegy of sorts not long ago when ex-USS Forrestal and Saratoga the world’s first two supercarriers were hauled away from Newport after years in mothballs to be broken up.

In 2005 though the U.S. Navy leadership decided to conduct a “SINKEX” against ex-USS America to test the durability of supercarrier design under massive fire. As the redoubtable defense gadfly Tyler Rogoway tells it America withstood nearly four weeks of pounding before having to be scuttled. Explosives were detonated above and below the flattop’s waterline to furnish the best possible data about what the U.S. Navy could expect in battle and how crews could recover from damage. A ship that can ride out weeks of pummeling with no crew on board and no way to defend itself or maneuver to elude attack is one tough ship.

Let’s use the America SINKEX to gauge the prospects of Luo’s stratagem. To make his scheme work PLA seamen airmen and rocketeers would need to deliver a SINKEX level of firepower against two U.S. carriers simultaneously or nearly so.

Suppose China’s military caught a carrier berthed at a pier or at anchor. The U.S. Seventh Fleet centered around the nuclear-powered carrier Ronald Reagan is permanently based in Japan—mainly at Yokosuka and Sasebo—alongside its Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force allies. Vessels moor in the open in Japan (and in U.S. seaports as well) not beneath hardened shelters or other passive defenses. See for yourself courtesy of Google Earth; PLAN strategists have.

Sinking Reagan pierside would get China halfway to fulfilling Luo’s threat. Is that possible? Yes. A ship sitting pierside is a building and about as easy for missiles to hit as a building. A ship at anchor is a building that drifts around lazily in a “swing circle” centered on the anchor. It verges on being a stationary target as well. If Chinese intelligence confirmed Reagan was in port it could be targeted for a missile barrage.

And Yokosuka lies within reach of a panoply of Chinese weaponry including hundreds of ballistic missiles fielded by the PLA Rocket Force. Pearl Harbor anchored the U.S. naval position in the Pacific Ocean prior to World War II. In 1941 the Kidō Butai or Imperial Japanese Navy carrier striking force had to steam across thousands of miles of storm-tossed sea to get at the U.S. Pacific Fleet battle line. This represented a massive undertaking replete with risk.

The Seventh Fleet anchors the U.S. naval position in the Western Pacific and constitutes a rough counterpart to Pearl Harbor in 1941. (A closer analogy would be the Philippines had Washington split the Pacific Fleet between there and Hawaii.) Except China’s military could launch its version of “Pearl Harbor” without incurring the operational dangers Tokyo incurred three-quarters of a century ago. For Beijing it would be a matter of giving the word to send missiles and warplanes skyward from sites on the mainland.

If Beijing were willing to endure the international opprobrium from striking U.S. vessels based in a neighboring country for the equivalent of four weeks solid then sure: it is possible to sink an American supercarrier in China’s backyard. And many lesser vessels besides. Seventh Fleet is in peril when in port.

What about less-than-trivial cases though? What if say allied intelligence gets wind of a Chinese assault and the Seventh Fleet puts to sea? And what about that second carrier Luo hopes to sink?

Mobility changes things. A carrier group able to maneuver and defend itself with its embarked aircraft and its escort cruisers and destroyers is far better positioned to withstand a preemptive attack. If we use the America standard for punishment it’s an open question whether the PLA mete out four weeks’ worth of constant bombardment under such conditions.

Many Chinese analysts and officers have come to believe the answer to that question is “Yes.” They believe they can saturate American defenses with attacks from all points of the compass as well as from above and below. If so they could conceivably approximate the results of the America SINKEX.

Whether the true answer is “Yes” or “No” is a matter for U.S. naval officers specialists in weaponry and naval architecture and wargame designers to settle. It is worth pointing out however that what Americans think about these matters is of secondary importance to a Chinese decision to proceed with Operation Luo Yang.

If Beijing believes—rightly or wrongly—that a sudden strike would work and that it would elicit the desired political effect then the leadership might roll the iron dice. Again Chinese magnates could be wrong. They might fail. Or they might be right in the narrow military sense in that they put paid to the carriers but wrong about the political impact of an assault. Imperial Japan sank U.S. Navy battleships and carriers and look what befell it in the end.

China would be far from the first to underrate American power and resolve.

Now if the PLA were ordered to sink two U.S. carriers one would presumably be the Seventh Fleet flagship. The other likely candidate would be a flattop from the San Diego-based Third Fleet. The Third Fleet has traditionally acted as a force provider for forward-deployed forces in the Western Pacific Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf. In other words it equips and trains forces for duty under regional combatant commanders such as the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and Central Command proconsuls.

In recent years though the navy leadership has taken to employing the San Diego fleet as an operational force. In other words the Third Fleet commander acts as an operational commander for naval forces in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean rather than transferring control to commanders in the field. That makes U.S.-based ships a fighting force in their own right without overburdening the Seventh Fleet apparatus.

Whether the PLA could sink two carriers thus depends on its ability to detect track and engage vessels operating from opposite sides of the Pacific and it depends on how U.S. carrier-group commanders handle fleet operations at sea. It remains to be seen (except perhaps in the spooky realm of classified intelligence) whether China’s array of satellites sensors and other surveillance assets can find and track moving task forces in the vast emptiness that is the Pacific Ocean with any real precision.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmVrYWxlcnQub3JnL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvOTI5MzM10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finding the chemical carrier option for hydrogen storage,"Interests in hydrogen are rapidly growing due to its potential to establish global clean energy supply chains. A typical method of hydrogen storage is physically storing hydrogen such as compression or liquefaction which requires higher energy to increase storage capacity and expensive distributing infrastructure. To overcome these limitations research efforts to store hydrogen chemically in liquid carriers such as liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) or ammonia have been conducted. Especially hydrogen can be safely stored in LOHCs at room temperature and atmospheric pressure before being extracted at locations for hydrogen consumption.

Various organic compounds have been suggested for LOHCs. However there were few comparative studies on LOHC performance leading to a lack of scientific consensus in the hydrogen community for downselecting LOHCs and catalysts. Scientists at Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) have contributed to the development of a high-throughput benchmarking protocol for the adoption of promising LOHCs and their well-matched catalysts. The KIST LOHC research team in the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research Center led by Dr. Yongmin Kim developed a semi-automatic evaluation system for LOHC dehydrogenation (alternatively hydrogen extraction from LOHC). This system allows us to rapidly test dehydrogenation in well-defined and standardized reaction conditions and carry out comparative analyses to draw out optimal solutions for the successful commercial deployment of LOHCs.

One example of LOHC in the analyses is methylcyclohexane (MCH) with high technological readiness. It shows a higher dehydrogenation rate with minimal byproduct formation. Monobenzyltoluene (MBT) is another promising candidate because it has been mass-produced as a safe chemical while extracting hydrogen fast. A biphenyl-based eutectic mixture developed by KIST in 2017 shows 20% higher dehydrogenation rate than those of other LOHCs. This biphenyl-based LOHC with a superior hydrogen storage density of 6.85 wt.%-H2 is applicable for onboard hydrogen storage such as in hydrogen vehicles or trains.

The proposed system for fast screening on LOHCs materials and catalysts will be also helpful for both domestic and international research collaborators in industry and academia. In addition to ongoing research collaboration with Hyundai Motor Group and Korea Gas Corporation international collaborative research projects with Germany and Japan are being planned to widely disseminate this generalized benchmarking LOHC study platform for accelerating LOHC deployment in the hydrogen economy. Dr. Yongmin Kim further noted: “the as-developed platform will help develop new technology for lower cost and energy consumption which are two key bottlenecks for the commercialization of LOHC.”

An executive of Chinese global communications giant Huawei Technologies has returned from Canada following a legal settlement that also saw the release of two Canadians held by China.

Meng Wanzhou Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of the company’s founder arrived Saturday evening aboard a chartered jet provided by flag carrier Air China in the southern technology hub of Shenzhen where Huawei is based.

Her return met with a flag-waving group of airline employees was carried live on state TV underscoring the degree to which Beijing has linked her case with Chinese nationalism and its rise as a global economic and political power.

Wearing a red dress matching the colour of China’s flag Meng thanked the ruling Communist Party and its leader Xi Jinping for supporting her through more than 1000 days in house arrest in Vancouver where she owns two multimillion-dollar mansions.

“I have finally returned to the warm embrace of the motherland” Meng said. “As an ordinary Chinese citizen going through this difficult time I always felt the warmth and concern of the party the nation and the people.”

Meng 49 was arrested at Vancouver International Airport in December 2018 on a United States warrant and was indicted on bank and wire fraud charges for allegedly misleading HSBC in 2013 about the telecommunications equipment giant’s business dealings in Iran.

Her arrest sparked a diplomatic storm and drew Canada into the fray when China arrested two Canadians – Michael Spavor a businessman and Michael Kovrig a former diplomat shortly after Meng was taken into custody.

Beijing has denied publicly that the arrests are linked.

Ment spent three years of house arrest in Canada fighting extradition to the United States for allegedly violating US sanctions.

Officials said Meng reached an agreement with US prosecutors to end the bank fraud case against her. As part of the deal known as a deferred prosecution agreement she accepted responsibility for misrepresenting the company’s business dealings in Iran.

The move allows her to leave Canada relieving a point of tension between China and the US.

On the same day Kovrig and Spavor were also released and flown back to Canada. They were detained shortly after Canada arrested Meng. Many countries labelled China’s action “hostage politics” while China accused Ottawa of arbitrary detention.

Canadian broadcast footage showed Meng boarding a flight on Friday to the city of Shenzhen shortly after she was granted release in a Vancouver court hearing according to AFP news agency.

The South China Morning Post also confirmed the news report saying that about two hours after the court’s decision Meng boarded an unscheduled Air China 777 flight that departed Vancouver International Airport at 4:29pm local time.

China has yet to issue an official statement on Meng’s release. But Lijian Zhao a senior foreign ministry spokesman wrote in one of his social media accounts saying “Welcome home.”

Shortly before Meng’s return to China the Communist Party’s flagship People’s Daily newspaper declared the resolution of the case as a “glorious victory for the Chinese people” achieved through the “unremitting efforts of the Chinese government”.

The state-backed Global Times also welcomed Meng’s release while remaining critical of Canada with one analyst accusing it of being a “willing accomplice” of the United States.

The years-long extradition drama has been a central source of discord in increasingly rocky ties between Beijing and Washington with Chinese officials signalling that the case needed to be dropped to help end a diplomatic stalemate between the world’s top two powers.

The deal also opens US President Joe Biden up to criticism from China hawks in Washington who argue his administration is capitulating to China and one of its top companies at the centre of a global technology rivalry between the two countries.

In an exclusive on Friday Reuters news agency reported that the US reached a deferred prosecution agreement with Meng.

Nicole Boeckmann the acting US attorney in Brooklyn said that in entering into the agreement “Meng has taken responsibility for her principal role in perpetrating a scheme to defraud a global financial institution.”

The agreement pertains only to Meng and the US Justice Department said it is preparing for trial against Huawei and looks forward to proving its case in court.

A spokeswoman for Huawei declined to comment.

Sigh of relief

At a hearing in Brooklyn federal court on Friday that Meng attended virtually from Canada Assistant US Attorney David Kessler said the government would move to dismiss the charges against her if she complies with all of her obligations under the agreement which ends in December 2022.

He added that Meng will be released on a personal recognisance bond and that the US plans to withdraw its request to Canada for her extradition.

Meng pleaded not guilty to the charges in the hearing.

When US District Court Judge Ann Donnelly later accepted the deferred prosecution agreement Meng sighed audibly.

A Canadian judge later signed Meng’s order of discharge ending her bail conditions and allowing her to go free after nearly three years of house arrest.

She was emotional after the judge’s order hugging and thanking her lawyers.

Speaking to supporters and reporters on the steps of the court afterwards Meng thanked the judge for her “fairness” and talked of how the case had turned her life “upside-down”."

Editors note: Throughout the growing season Mike Hogan OSU Extension Educator for Agriculture & Natural Resources in Franklin County will answer gardening questions submitted by Dispatch readers. Send your questions to hogan.1@osu.edu.

Q: I have recently noticed that several toadstools have popped up in my lawn. They look like the white mushrooms you buy in the grocery store are they edible? Why did they suddenly appear?

A: A variety of mushrooms can grow in a lawn. The term ""toadstool"" typically refers to a mushroom that is toxic poisonous or simply inedible.

Although it's not clear the exact species of mushroom that has appeared in your lawn we generally do not recommend eating wild mushrooms without positive identification. An old adage says that “there are old mushroom hunters and bold mushroom hunters but there are no old bold mushroom hunters!”

Most of the species of mushrooms that grow in lawns are not poisonous. A few species will make people and pets sick.

Mushrooms that appear in the lawn are naturally occurring fungi that thrive when suitable conditions occur and a food source is present. The rainy conditions experienced over the past several weeks provided suitable soil moisture for the mushrooms to begin to grow. The food source that spurs mushroom growth is any type of organic matter in the lawn. This includes decaying tree roots underground a thick layer of thatch in the lawn pet waste and even droppings from wildlife such as rabbits or deer. There is no need to remove the mushrooms as they will not last very long.

Q: Several large black walnut trees in our landscape have tent caterpillars on many of the branches. Will these insects kill these large trees?

A: The weblike nests that you are seeing at this time of the season are actually the result of fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea). This caterpillar insect has two generations each season but the second generation is much more noticeable in late summer and fall because of larger second-generation nests.

Black walnut (Juglans nigra) is the most common host for the outbreak and large mature trees can sometimes have nearly every branch tip wrapped in webbing created by this insect. In the absence of black walnut trees fall webworms will feed on oak poplar hickory poplar ash sweetgum redbud and even apple and other fruit trees.

Fall webworms feed in groups inside their protective webbing. The insects feed on the tissue of leaves inside the webbing consuming everything except the leaf veins.

Typically only the leaves inside the silk webbing are consumed by the insect.

Fall webworms are more of an aesthetic nuisance than a threat to the long-term health of trees so control is rarely warranted especially on large trees such as yours. The exception to this would be newly planted young trees that are infested with webworms. In this case the nests and its contents of caterpillars can be removed from small trees by hand and deposited into a bucket of soapy water for disposal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3RvbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8yNi9oZWFkLXRvLXZlcm1vbnQtZm9yLXZpdmlkLXZpYnJhbnQtZmFsbC1mb2xpYWdlL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3RvbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8yNi9oZWFkLXRvLXZlcm1vbnQtZm9yLXZpdmlkLXZpYnJhbnQtZmFsbC1mb2xpYWdlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Head to Vermont for vivid vibrant fall foliage,"The days are shorter and still feel a bit warm here in the Northeast. But in the evening that crisp autumn air is blowing in.

And I say this: Forget the pumpkin spice flavored everything: Give me the foliage.

Few places give you more ways to celebrate all that seasonal color than Vermont.

This week as far northern Vermont moves toward peak color and all points south from there begin their show it’s a great time to head north.

First some honesty from Michael Snyder Vermont’s “Chief Foliage Forecaster” (or as he is officially known commissioner of forests parks and recreation for the State of Vermont).

“I was burned by too many misguided snow reports as a kid so I always like to be transparent” he said.

Snyder notes that the state did experience an uptick in LDD caterpillar impact on the west side of the state as well as some Maple Leaf Cutter caterpillar impact on some hillsides throughout the state.

The good news he said is that most has grown back and even with the spots where it has not the vast majority of trees are healthy the weather has been cooperative and the colors are starting to burst.

In other words: The show will go on.

Dylan Debruyn meteorologist for Local 22 and 44 in Burlington told the Herald that viewers are already sending in photos showing brilliant color against the Vermont backdrop with enthusiastic comments.

“The geography of Vermont makes it unique and beautiful” said Debruyn who grew up in Plymouth.

“The lakes the mountains the fields — it’s all just a perfect backdrop for this” he said.

“The hype is there for a great foliage season” he added. “It always lives up to expectations.”

How to see it all?

Snyder says the timeline can dictate where in the state you head — and can also give you a few opportunities to see peak colors over the coming six weeks or so.

First up he said is the Northeast Kingdom “where the show begins.”

The Northeast Kingdom is sparsely populated and dotted with quaint towns. Taking Route 2 can bring you to some great spots.

Pro tip? Head to Jay Peak (jaypeakresort.com) and take a tram ride — or hike — to the top of the mountain for foliage views of both the U.S. and Canada.

The foliage peak moves south bit by bit into mid Vermont in early October and then spreading both west and south.

Vermont has ample spots for cycling hiking kayaking and canoeing as well.

“Seeing foliage from the water is a special experience” Snyder said. “The combination of the water forest and hillsides well you just cannot go wrong with it.”

Some less busy and totally worthy foliage spots include the Molly Stark State Park (vtstateparks.com/mollystark.html) a lovely park just past the Massachusetts border in Wilmington where you can hike to a fire tower have a picnic with a view and savor nature. That’s a great choice for later in the season as the southern locale means later peak color.

Farther north should you head out sooner Elmore State Park (vtstateparks.com/elmore.html) offers fire towers along hikes water views and more.

Those who like bikes should consider heading up to Burke Mountain where mountain biking is king. Located far north Burke is a great spot for any level cyclist even a first timer to get out and move among the color.

It also should be a law that every foliage peeper spends some time hanging out at a Vermont brewery. Yes the beer is great (craft beer was pretty much born in Vermont) but so are the settings. You can find just the right brewery for you via the Vermont Brewer’s Association (vermontbrewers.com). And yes most are family friendly.

Another favorite foliage visit many have may seem strange: Montpelier.

The state capitol is a city but it’s quaint comfortable walkable and most of all tucked up against nature. The view of the capitol building surrounded by autumn colors is totally worth a visit and their downtown is perfect for shopping and dining among the beauty.

Foliage season is busy in Vermont but with its wide open spaces plentiful lakes unique mountain towns and an endless supply of “oh my gosh” vistas there’s room for all.

“You can’t go wrong is my point” said Snyder. “Vermont foliage is well known for a reason.”

Alfie from Oswestry who is best known for creating the Knife Angel at the British Ironworks was asked by the arts channel to be one of the three sculptors in the Midlands round of the competition to make a piece of art for the community.

Landmark aired the round this week which saw Alfie up against Jason Wilsher-Mills and Luke Perry.

Alfie said he had just two weeks to dream up and create his sculpture.

Alfie with his caterpillar

""I wanted to express how I and others felt in lockdown trapped in their houses. However I also also wanted to show that people could evolve in lockdown and come out of it like a caterpillar will evolve into a butterfly.""

After the decision to create a caterpillar Alfie who started his craft as a stonemason then chose concrete and cement as his medium.

""Art can be very expensive particularly for someone on their own. I was working on a building site and I wanted to show that there are cheaper ways to create art.""

""I was going to carve it from a solid block but at the last minute we were told our piece had to be able to be dismantled to go in a lift.""

Alfie was delighted to have poet Benjamin Zephaniah as his guest judge.

He told Alfie that he loved the idea of the caterpillar evolving and was delighted when he realised he was the Knife Angel sculptor.

""It was great that he knew about the Knife Angel and the anti-knife crime message behind it. He is an absolute legend.""

Alfie didn't win the Midlands heat but said it was a great experience and he had been honoured to be asked to take part.

When the caterpillar was placed in Dale End Park there was a lot of criticism and suggestions that is was a waste of public money.

""It is really great to finally to able to explain that it wasn't made with public money and to be able to explain the reason I created it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1aW5uZXNzd29ybGRyZWNvcmRzLmNvbS93b3JsZC1yZWNvcmRzLzEwNzQwMC1sYXJnZXN0LWhpZ2gtcmVhY2gtZGVtb2xpdGlvbi1leGNhdmF0b3LSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Largest high-reach demolition excavator,"High-reach demolition excavators are vehicles that resemble mechanical diggers with extremely long digging arms used for knocking down tall buildings.

CenterPoint Energy Inc.’s (NYSE: CNP) Indiana-based natural gas business CenterPoint Energy Indiana North has filed a request with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) to continue its natural gas infrastructure improvements during the next five years to comply with federal pipeline safety rules and to ensure the company’s 625000 natural gas customers in north central central and southeastern Indiana continue to receive safe reliable gas service for decades to come.

Previous policy set by the Indiana Legislature allows utilities to recover federal-mandated costs as well as submit their forward-looking capital investment plans to the IURC for consideration. In 2013 the company filed an initial seven-year gas system modernization plan with the IURC to recover planned capital expenditures through 2020.

“We continue the investments in our natural gas infrastructure to ensure we maintain a safe reliable system” said Richard Leger Vice President of Natural Gas Distribution Indiana and Ohio. “CenterPoint Energy remains committed to a continued focus on meeting federal requirements and adhering to safety standards.”

The natural gas system improvements are a continuation of efforts over the last seven years to upgrade and maintain portions of CenterPoint Energy’s 13000-mile network of distribution mains and transmission pipelines through its pipeline replacement and transmission line integrity management programs. The work will primarily consist of replacing 341 miles of bare steel and cast-iron distribution mains with new mains most of which will be plastic as well as inspecting and upgrading transmission pipelines. Together these efforts will call for an estimated $1.2 billion in investments.

If the plan is approved as filed customer bills will not reflect these investments until 2023. Additional improvements will adjust bills modestly in subsequent years as the infrastructure projects are completed.

“While these infrastructure enhancements are critical to ensuring adherence to federal requirements affordability of our natural gas service remains top of mind” added Leger. “As these improvements are completed we’ll continue to operate a safe and reliable delivery system with minimal impact to customer bills.”

Over the last seven years pipeline replacement work has been ongoing in more than 50 cities that have bare steel and cast-iron mains in the company’s north central central and southeastern Indiana service territory.

However the almost exponential increase in gas prices could paradoxically accelerate the adoption of “greener” energy including ammonia and thus be “good news”.

a. The facts

Europe is in the grip of a veritable “gas price crisis” with each day bringing new record high energy prices. The increase has been blamed onlow gas storage levels reduced supplies from Russia demand from Asia low renewable energy production and nuclear maintenance outages. Prices are expected to continue to rise in the coming months with analysts predicting that the coming winter will be extremely harsh. That said renewable energies that are considered more expensive could start to become more affordable. One of these is green ammonia.

b. Green ammonia to come into its own

When electricity needs to be produced the cheapest energy sources are used first: wind solar and hydro. If they are not available or do not provide enough capacity more expensive energies are added in the following order: lignite (low quality coal) nuclear coal gas andfinallygreen ammonia.

You may ask rightly what green ammonia has to do with this list of energies. Scientists recently discovered a potentially revolutionary feature of ammonia by using it as an energy source. Some believe that the compound is well on its way to replacing fossil fuels in all their applications. Today there is even talk of a future “ammonia economy” in which ammonia would represent the “missing link” capable of making decarbonisation a reality and a good alternative to hydrogenfor example.

c. What is ammonia?

Ammonia (NH3) consists of nitrogen and hydrogen. Gaseous at standard temperature and pressure it can be liquefied at -10°C kept liquid at 10 bars or preferably in “cryo-compressed” form. All these processes are well controlled industrially.

Ammonia is heavier but denser than liquid hydrogen i.e.still 3.6 times more voluminous than a petroleum product (compared to 4.8 times more for liquid hydrogen). It can be used in some fuel cells or in the large diesel engines of today’s ships with some modifications. Some believe that using ammonia as a fuel in its own right -without converting it into hydrogen -could be extremely efficient. With minor modifications ammonia can be burned in conventional internal combustion engines and gas turbines making it easy to roll out in the industrial sector.

d. There is grey ammonia and green ammonia

Today the world cannot do without ammonia. Half of the world’s food production depends on it as it is the key component of nitrogen fertilisers. It is also used to process animal feed. However 5% of the natural gas produced globally is used to produce “grey”ammonia. Today there is only one technically feasible alternative: to use green hydrogen (produced in a decarbonised way) to manufacture “green” ammonia.

In short green ammonia is derived from renewable energy sources. Green ammonia production uses hydrogen from renewable energy sources instead of natural gas or coal and thus reduces greenhouse gas emissions. It is a renewable carbon-free ammonia production process. The technical and technological difficulties in producing green ammonia should be solved. The most difficult problem today is green ammonia’s economic viability. It takes a lot of decarbonised electricity to produce green hydrogen and green ammonia and it is much more expensive than using natural gas. Decarbonised electricity prices will therefore have to continue to fall and non-intermittent hydro nuclear and geothermal generation will have to be available to power industrial facilities.

e.What are the characteristics of green ammonia?

Green ammonia has several characteristics including

•Easier to liquefy than hydrogen: Hydrogenmust reach cryogenic temperatures below -253°C to be transported in liquid form. This process alone requiresenergy equivalent to one third of the total production of liquefied hydrogen. Ammonia on the other hand liquefies at -33°C and requires only a small amount of pressure to do so.

•Ease of transport: Unlike hydrogen ammonia is already shipped worldwide in large quantities and many ports are already able to store and process it safely.

•Conversion using renewable energy: As Engie points out converting ammonia into hydrogen normally requires large amounts of thermal energy from fossil fuels which is paradoxical given the reason for using this compound. But in November 2020 researchers at Northwestern University announced thatthey had developed an efficient process to achieve this conversion using only renewable electricity.

•A ‘greener’ element: Ammonia does not emit carbon for one simple reason: it does not contain carbon. But that doesn’t mean it’s risk-free. Critics point out that burning ammonia can release nitrogen and nitrates whose cycle is not as well researchedas that of carbon.

f. What growth for the theme?

The green ammonia market is expected to generate revenue of nearly $850 million by the end of 2028 from around $13 million in 2019 at a CAGR of 62.84% during the forecast period (2021-2028). Factors such as the growing concern about the environmental pollution caused by increasing greenhouse gas emissions from the production of ammonia from conventional fossil fuels isone of the major factors expected to drive market growth.

In addition the increasing adoption of energy-efficient technologies for ammonia production is also expected to create numerous opportunities for market growth over the forecast period.

g. Maritime transport in focus

Ammonia has the considerable advantage of possessing an energy density nine times that of lithium-ion batteries and three times that of compressed hydrogen gas. This means that it is ideal for powering the engines of large ships. For the record it is estimated that the sector is responsible for around 2% of global carbon emissions. Ammonia is one of the only zero-carbon fuels capable ofenabling players in the sector to sail. MAN Energy Solutions a marine engine manufacturer has announced that its first ammonia engine could be in service as early as 2022. Japan committed to using ammonia for shipping by the end of the decade and has even started burning it in its thermal power plants.

h. Who are the leaders in green ammonia?

Today several major ammonia producers around the world have announced plans to produce hydrogen by electrolysis with decarbonised electricity and then green ammonia. The Norwegian group Yarafor example one of the world’s largest producers of fertiliser and ammonia has pilot projects in Australia Norway and the Netherlands. By electrifying its ammonia production plant in Norway Yara says it will be able to reduce its CO2emissions into the atmosphere by 800000 tonnes per year. The US-based CF Industries Spain’s Fertiberia and Iberdrola the Asian Renewable Energy Hub and Australia’s Fortescue Metals Group have also launched projects.

i. Conclusion

Ammonia will not replace fossil fuels. But it is both an essential element for feeding the planet and a potential alternative fuel especially for shipping. The current rise in the price of “conventional”energy will a utomatically make certain “green” fuels previously thought too expensive more affordable (also considering the indispensable state subsidies). Green ammonia is one of such fuel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8yNS93aGF0LWEtbW9kZXJuLWVuZXJneS1jcmlzaXMtbG9va3MtbGlrZS1hbmQtd2h5LW5vLWNvdW50cnktaXMtc2FmZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What a modern energy crisis looks like and why no country is safe,"Megawattageddon. Gasapocalypse. Energastrophe.

Call it what you will the energy market news coming out of the U.K. paints a dystopian image of what happens when an economy making the righteous transition to affordable clean renewable power has to turn to pricey gas to keep moving forward.

As the effects of the energy transition ripples across every corner of society Britain’s experience is a cautionary tale for the rest of the world an example of what can—and very likely will—go wrong as countries around the globe stumble on their transition to green energy.

China has already warned food security could be impacted as skyrocketing coal prices affect fertilizer supplies. In the EU the consumer impact of the power crunch has already had political reverberations as electricity bills soar in the face of low gas reserves ahead of the winter.

But it’s the U.K. where the pain hurts the most.

How the dominoes fell

The domino effect that led to the U.K.’s current pain started with a cold spell. After the chilly winter of 2020 to 2021 saw the U.K. and much of Europe draw down its energy reserves the world began to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. Coming out of their slumber Europe and Asia began to compete for the limited gas supplies of the U.S. Norway and Russia—all of whom were refilling their own reserves.

Not surprisingly gas prices rose with prices on the spot market climbing by 400% since the start of the year while electricity prices have jumped 250%.

As gas costs started to eat into profits firms that couldn’t afford this spike began shutting down.

In the fertilizer industry two large U.K. factories owned by U.S. firm CF Industries Holdings have temporarily closed up shop and Norwegian firm Yara has also cut production at a number of its European sites. That in turn has led to a shortage in carbon dioxide a by-product from fertilizer production that is used to stun animals before slaughter and a shortage of dry ice to cool foods in storage and transit. And that in turn has put the U.K. supermarket supplies of chicken and ham fizzy drinks and ice cream in jeopardy. In just one example online grocer Ocado Group stopped supplying frozen food to U.K. customers because of the dry ice shortage.

“[We] are on a knife-edge situation” said British Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths.

Many in the energy industry are quick to say that this period of high prices will pass and things will soon return to normal. They avoid using apocalyptic terms like “energy crisis” and instead suggest that the price hikes reveal the flaws of the market-based U.K. energy system that has found itself heavily dependent on the same gas that it has been attempting to wean itself off of.

But there are plenty of reasons to believe that this energy crunch is not a one-time show.

“This phenomenon is happening around the world as we continue to increase the penetration of renewables which is what we want. And we need to continue going down that path” said Anthony Catachanas CEO of Victory Hill Capital Group an asset manager that owns a portfolio of gas plants that are turned on at times of peak electricity use—known as peaker plants—for very high prices.

A “zigzag line”

The energy transition won’t be a smooth one but “a zigzag line” said Joost Bergsma head of renewable energy fund manager Glennmont Partners.

“The direction will not change there will always be more renewables on the system but people have to be aware of the risks and the volatility issues of getting to that higher point” he said.

In the past the U.K. relied on its own North Sea gas reserves to provide energy at a moment’s notice with little of the need for gas storage that the rest of Europe has. But as its production slowed the country ramped up its renewable output to maintain its energy independence. This boom in renewables—especially from offshore wind in the North Sea—has meant that the U.K. has made fast progress in cutting coal combustion with a record-breaking two coal-free months recorded in the summer of 2021.

The problem is that as the U.K. mothballed coal plants the country became more dependent on the international gas spot market as its sole flexible source of power generation to fill in when its normal sources fell short.

When gas prices were low and the wind was generating a solid 25% of the U.K.’s energy make up which it did on average across 2020 no one seemed to notice this issue. But as soon as North Sea winds slowed as they did this summer—dropping production to only 7% of the country’s energy makeup—international gas prices soared. And security affordability and emissions all suddenly became very important.

The surprise and shock shown by governments in the face of these price spikes is a bit disingenuous to the eye of some in the industry who see instead a lack a planning by leaders who are happy to accept low prices when they’re offered but unwilling to pay for the plans to mitigate the spikes that inevitably follow.

“Shocker. Volatile prices are volatile. They go up and down” said the head of an energy financial advisory firm who asked to remain anonymous. He asked if countries really wanted stable prices “then why do you encourage the most volatile price determination?”

Taking into account the phase-out of coal (and nuclear power) in the U.K. volatile gas however expensive is simply still necessary.

“This is perfectly expected. This is the natural consequence to what the energy mix is” said Catachanas of Victory Hill the asset manager that owns gas peaker plants. “We have smiles on our faces at the moment” he noted as gas-fired power generation is being brought in to balance the grid.

For Catachanas the energy “crisis” is really a matter of “anticipation”—or the government’s lack thereof.

Who pays?

Regardless of whether the market is working as intended or the spikes are predictable the U.K. government is scrambling to figure out who will bear the brunt of the cost. Should consumers pay higher electricity bills as wholesale prices climb?

At least four energy companies who joined the electricity distribution market in recent years have gone bust since the beginning of August unable to keep up with the global spike in wholesale gas prices. (Fortune’s London-based correspondent’s own renewable energy-focused electricity provider Bulb is also rumored to be going under.)

“I do have sympathy for consumer prices but at the same time there has to be some balance. You can’t force supplier companies [to eat] higher input costs” said Bergsma of Glennmont Partners. “The lesson is it is a shared responsibility between the consumer supplier and the government.”

Unfortunately this is most likely to impact poorer income households. According to Reuters data in 2019 and 2020 the households in the lowest income decile spent almost three times as much on gas and electricity as a proportion of their total spending compared to those in the highest decile.

And U.K. consumers are not the only ones facing energy price spikes. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has announced a temporary tax cut and a reduction in extraordinary profits made by energy companies to help consumers in the country. The Italian government has spent €1.2 billion to cut the increase in energy prices for households with its Prime Minister Mario Draghi pledging another €3 billion to help consumers in the coming months. France has already announced a €100 subsidy for almost 6 million low-income households.

The need for flexibility

The U.K. is an extreme example. It has seen a rapid influx of renewables over the past decade while its energy system’s peak needs are still centered on the gas market. But this is a global issue one with a lesson for countries around the globe as they begin the energy transition: one failure can collapse a system without sufficient backups.

“[This problem] is not entirely isolated to Europe” says Bergsma of Glennmont Partners pointing to a recent crisis in Texas where a severe winter storm battered inadequately insulated natural gas infrastructure and froze wind turbines. Texas has the largest renewable power generation of any U.S. state.

As the world moves away from nuclear energy and fossil fuels there will be growing demand for flexible sources of power that are be able to respond to the peaks and troughs of intermittent renewable energy. And those will not always be clean.

“We’ve seen it in Australia very prominently” said Catachanas. While renewables have a place in Australia coal still provides 70% of its energy mix. This “comes as a result of renewable power generation not being able to be relied on sufficiently by the grid so they turn to coal which is more emmisive more costly and less efficient” Catachanas said.

For now security of supply is still safe. “I don’t see a reason for blackouts because there are more than enough sources of electricity supply. It’s just going to be expensive” says Carlos Torres Diaz head of gas and power markets at energy research firm Rystad Energy.

But as long as natural gas continues to stay the extremely volatile commodity it is soaring gas prices and shortages will continue—and likely grow.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L3RoZS1ncmVhdC1kZWJhdGUtZm9vZC1lbmVyZ3ktYW5kLWZ1ZWwtaXMtYnJpdGFpbi1ydW5uaW5nLW9uLWVtcHR5LTEyNDE3NjA40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is the supply crisis short or long term? The Great Debate will examine what's happening - and how long it might last,"It's unclear exactly how long the fuel shortages will last.

Many of the major retailers say deliveries are continuing and a joint statement from the likes of Shell and ExxonMobile reiterated pressures were caused by ""temporary spikes in customer demand not a national shortage of fuel"".

If people keep panic-buying shortages in some places might drag on.

However AA President Edmund King said on Saturday that he thought the shortages wouldn't last long.

""The good news is you can only really fill up once - you've got to use the fuel so this should be a short-term thing"" he told the BBC.

""So once people have filled up they won't travel more than they normally travel so this strain on the system should ease up in the next few days.""

To try to alleviate the problem and get fuel to where it needs to be the government said on Sunday that it was suspending competition laws.

This will allow the fuel industry to share information and target petrol stations most in need.

Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said enacting the Downstream Oil Protocol would ""ensure industry can share vital information and work together more effectively"".

The government is also considering using the army to help deliver fuel.

The overarching lorry drivers' crisis - a problem shared by several other European countries - also doesn't look like being solved any time soon meaning shortages of some goods are set to linger.



The 100000 shortfall is huge and the backlog of tests cancelled during COVID will take months to work through.



Plans to speed up the process of getting a HGV licence may help in the longer term.

The government announced plans to speed up the HGV testing process to allow 50000 more tests per year.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told Sky News it should make a significant difference.

""Many more tests are being made available now so we should see it smooth out fairly quickly"" he said.

But business leaders say the government's decision to temporarily allow 5000 extra drivers into the UK for the Christmas rush ""will not be enough"".

Andrew Opie director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium said the measures ""will do little to alleviate the current shortfall"".

""Supermarkets alone have estimated they need at least 15000 HGV drivers for their businesses to be able to operate at full capacity ahead of Christmas and avoid disruption or availability issues.""

British Chambers of Commerce president Baroness Ruby McGregor-Smith also said the scheme was ""insufficient"".

And what about the CO2 shortages also threatening supplies of items such as poultry and pork - is that just a temporary blip?

The government deal to cover energy costs for CF Industries - which produces around 60% of the UK's supply - is only for three weeks.

It means one of its two sites - at Billingham on Teesside - is operational again.

The business and energy department said the deal gives ""limited financial support... whilst the CO2 market adapts to global gas prices"".

But if prices remain high it's unclear whether government support will continue.

Energy regulator Ofgem has said the high prices might not be temporary and small business minister Paul Scully told Sky News he was preparing for a ""worst-case scenario"".

Also on the food supply front an additional 5000 poultry workers are to be allowed into the UK for the next few months to fill vacancies.

It remains to be seen how far this will go to keep shelves stocked as demand ramps up ahead of Christmas.

They’re back big time. Three of the big four banks are back – while Wells Fargo keeps getting slapped on the wrist – after all four were out of it last year due to pandemic-rated financial restrictions. Intel fell out of it. But the rest of Big Tech is in and Apple bigger than ever. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway after rightfully dissing share buybacks for years has become one of the largest share buyback queens. And Charter Communications has jumped into it massively.

The top 10 companies – ranked by their cumulative buybacks over the past five years – bought back more of their shares than ever in Q2: $85 billion according to S&P Dow Jones Indices this week accounting for 43% of the total share buybacks by all S&P 500 companies. Since 2014 these 10 companies bought back $1.13 trillion of their own shares.

The two surges in the chart below – first after the corporate tax cuts in 2017 and second after Q2 2020 – quadrupled the quarterly rate of share buybacks for these 10 companies from around $20 billion a quarter in the four years through 2017 to $85 billion in Q2 (data via YCharts.com):

The top 10 share buyback queens based on their share buybacks in Q2 2021:

Top 10 Companies Share Buybacks in Billion $ Q2 2021 12 months 5-year total 1 Apple [AAPL] 25.6 89.7 334.1 2 Alphabet [GOOG] 12.8 40.0 87.7 3 Facebook [FB] 8.4 19.2 51.1 4 Oracle [ORCL] 8.0 21.6 93.8 5 Microsoft [MSFT] 7.2 27.4 92.4 6 JPMorgan [JPM] 6.2 11.0 81.5 7 Berkshire Hathaway [BRK.A] 6.0 30.5 43.5 8 BofA [BAC] 4.2 8.1 78.5 9 Charter Comm. [CHTR] 3.5 14.9 42.8 10 Union Pacific [UNP] 3.1 5.2 28.1

Rounding out the top 20 are in that order: Lowe’s Home Depot Morgan Stanley P&G Citigroup Walmart HCA Healthcare Visa Chubb and Mastercard. Wells Fargo and Intel which used to be in the Top 10 have fallen off the list entirely.

In total 294 of the S&P 500 companies reported buybacks in Q2 of at least $5 million down from 335 companies in Q1 2021. But the top 10 did the lion’s share of buying.

Combined they bought back $199 billion of their own shares in Q2 the fourth largest amount ever behind the records in the three quarters through Q1 2019 following the corporate tax cuts (blue columns in the chart below).

Since the beginning of 2012 the S&P 500 companies have bought back nearly $5.5 trillion of their own shares with the top 10 share buyback queens accounting for 25% of it.

But in recent years this has gotten a lot more top heavy. In Q2 2021 the top 10 accounted for 43%.

But without the Top 10 share buyback queens the share buybacks by the remaining 284 companies amounted to only $114 billion (red line) roughly flat with Q1 and below most quarters in prior years – that’s how top-heavy this scheme has become:

Even today as crazy as this sounds the $5.5 trillion that the S&P 500 companies incinerated on buying back their own shares is a lot of money. They could have been invested in expansion projects in the US and in labor in the US rather than in cheap labor overseas and in training or god forbid the companies could have tried to somewhat less aggressively dodge US income taxes and pay a little more given that the US government deficit has been horrendous for years and has become more horrendous with the corporate tax cut of 2017 and has become a lot more horrendous starting in March 2020

Along with share buybacks comes the corporate debt and it has ballooned as many companies borrowed heavily to fund the share buybacks.

Nonfinancial corporate debt (bonds and loans outstanding owed by companies other than lenders) spiked in the first half of 2020 and in Q2 reached a new record of $11.2 trillion having soared by 73% over the past eight years. The $5.5 trillion incinerated on share buybacks played a large role in creating this debt:

The primary purpose of share buybacks is to undo the dilution of their EPS metric that occurs due to massive executive stock-based compensation packages. These share buybacks hide the cost of stock-based compensation on EPS; and many of those share buybacks are funded with debt but debt doesn’t impact EPS.

In terms of actually lowering the share count: Only 5.4% of the companies that did share buybacks reduced their share count by at least 4% year-over-year according to S&P. This 5.4% share was down from a 17.8% share a year ago and from the 28.2% share in Q1 2016.

CMG,Chipotle Mexican Grill,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA5LzI2L3dhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LXdvdWxkLWxvdmUtMy11bnN0b3BwYWJsZS1zdG9ja3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's Why Warren Buffett Would Love These 3 Unstoppable Stocks,"Finding companies with attributes that the legendary investor looks for is a solid investment strategy.

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%) the conglomerate headed by Warren Buffett owns a massive stock portfolio worth well over $300 billion today. From consumer electronics and financial services to automobiles and telecommunications Berkshire certainly owns a diverse range of businesses.

The Oracle of Omaha favors companies that are easy to understand have a strong brand and benefit from a competitive advantage. With this perspective in mind a team of Motley Fool contributors have identified Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 0.19%) Costco Wholesale (COST 1.05%) and Salesforce (CRM 0.55%) as three outstanding businesses with features that Warren Buffett would love.

Popularizing the fast-casual dining experience

Neil Patel (Chipotle Mexican Grill): Buffett is very familiar with the restaurant industry having previously owned Restaurant Brands International. But the fast-casual pioneer Chipotle possesses some key characteristics that every investor should be looking for.

With 2853 total locations and trailing-12-month revenue of $6.8 billion Chipotle has developed a widely recognized consumer brand. Given that an estimated 30% of restaurants fail in their first year reaching this level of scale is no easy accomplishment. Chipotle has become adept at marketing leaning on social media channels and introducing celebrity-inspired burrito bowls to convey the real ingredients and simple cooking methods used. It wasn't until July 2021 that the business aired its first-ever national TV commercial which just goes to show that offering high-quality food at affordable prices speaks for itself.

Bolstering the brand even further is a focus on digital. In the most recent quarter orders via the company's website mobile app and third-party delivery services accounted for nearly half of all sales. And there are now more than 23 million Chipotle rewards members who have the ability to order their favorite items ahead of time. Of the 56 new locations the business opened in the second quarter 45 were equipped with a Chipotlane which is the drive-through option. Serving customers in whatever ways are most convenient for them is table stakes in today's hyper-competitive restaurant and retail environment.

Something Warren Buffett would really appreciate is Chipotle's proven pricing power. Following an increase to employee wages the company raised menu prices by up to 4% in June. But this had no adverse impact on demand. In fact Chipotle was able to register an impressive 24.5% restaurant-level operating margin in the quarter the highest since Q3 2015. ""Consistent with the past we saw very little resistance with the price increase in any of these channels"" CEO Brian Niccol mentioned on the recent earnings call.

The stock has soared nearly 400% over the past five years but based on a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 76 it is by no means cheap. Chipotle is a fantastic business and it has the traits Buffett seeks out in his investments. However the absence of a margin of safety would probably keep him away.

A bulk-sized moat

Jeremy Bowman (Costco): Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was a longtime owner of Costco Wholesale the membership-based warehouse retailer but the conglomerate sold the stock late last year. It wasn't clear why though it may have been for valuation reasons. However Costco shares have continued to gain since.

Though Buffett may have parted with Costco there are a number of reasons why Costco still looks like a classic Buffett stock.

First Costco is the clear leader in warehouse retail. The company only has two direct competitors Walmart's Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club and Costco is significantly ahead of both of those rivals in key metrics like sales per square foot and overall revenue. In fact Costco is the second-largest brick-and-mortar retailer in the U.S. behind Walmart with $196 billion in revenue last year.

The membership model offers a number of competitive advantages or economic moats as Buffett would put it. It locks in customers and encourages them to spend more money at Costco stores. Costco prices its products at near cost encouraging customer loyalty and creating a business model where membership fees which are $60 per year for most customers make up the bulk of its profits. Costco has a 90% customer retention rate in North America and it ranks near the top in customer satisfaction surveys a strong sign for the business's future growth.

The company continues to open new stores unlike many large retailers and invest in its e-commerce platform which surged during the pandemic.

As malls struggle and other brick-and-mortar retailers falter Costco's business model remains a winner and its rock-bottom prices will keep customers flocking to its stores. Costco even has a history of paying generous special dividends every few years.

In the retail industry only a few stocks look as bulletproof as Costco.

A force to be reckoned with

Eric Volkman (Salesforce): It's been said before but it's worth repeating and emphasizing -- if there's one thing Buffett loves in a company above nearly everything else it's a moat.

I feel that Salesforce has a wide one. It's very much the dominant company in the ever-expanding world of customer relationship management (CRM; not coincidentally the company's ticker symbol too). In fact its estimated market share of nearly 20% (as gauged by tech market researcher IDC) is higher than the four trailing competitors combined.

Another thing Buffett admires -- heck all investors admire -- is a business that continues to scale. Salesforce delivers growth in spades. In its most recently reported quarter a mix of organic improvement and well-considered recent acquisitions (corporate communications specialist Slack Technologies for one) lifted total revenue by a meaty 23% year-over-year to over $6.3 billion.

That wasn't a quirk or a one-off. Salesforce has posted very forceful top-line growth for years. From its fiscal 2017 to 2021 -- hardly a long stretch of time -- the company managed to more than double its total annual revenue from just under $8.4 billion in the former year to over $21 billion in 2021.

Profitability has jumped around some but in recent years the company has landed more consistently in the black and convincingly at that. The trailing four quarters of non-GAAP net income were respectively $1.4 billion $1.1 billion $975 million and $1.6 billion. Buffett would be well pleased with the double-digit net margins attached to those figures which range from 17% to 30%.

Granted some of this growth is due to the pandemic which kept employees at home and necessitated the kind of remote-teamwork solutions Salesforce specializes in. However it's likely we're shifting from a traditional office work regime to more of a hybrid model for a great many professions so the company has a very long runway in front of it.

It realistically believes that vaunted double-digit growth will continue to the tune of at least 23.5% for the entirety of 2021 and 20% for 2022. Those are consistent and strong improvements particularly considering how long Salesforce has been on the scene.

They are also the kinds of hard-to-ignore figures Buffett loves to see in his companies. He should really consider buying a stake in this one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3QucGgvZWF0ZHJpbmsvdGhlLWxhdGVzdC1lYXQtZHJpbmsvODc1MDgvYmVzdC1idXJyaXRvcy1kZWxpdmVyeS1hcHBzLWE0OTM1LTIwMjEwOTI2LWxmcm3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Best Burritos You Can Order on GrabFood and Foodpanda,"(SPOT.ph) Tex-Mex ranks high as one of our go-to cuisines when it comes to savory dishes and burritos happen to be a top-tier dish.

Researches interactions and verifications carried out indicated that preventive security steps and safety features put in place to checkmate such incidents in countries such as US and South Africa are either non-existent in Nigeria or have been jettisoned thus leaving Nigerian drivers at the mercy of criminally minded individuals. This is even as insurance coverage meant to act like a buffer in case of an eventuality while on active ride is fully enjoyed by their counterparts in these countries.

Endangered species

On the night of June 10 2021 Sunday Adeyanju an e-hailing driver with one of the ride-sharing companies in Nigeria accepted a ride request from an elderly man to Ajah Lagos State to be paid for in cash.

Minutes into the end of the trip he felt his blood go cold when the man who hitherto appeared harmless pointed a gun at the base of his neck. As Adeyanju slowly steered his car to stop by a pedestrian bridge along the axis as he was directed two menacing looking men appeared from the shadows stripped him naked and robbed him of his valuables. They later escaped aboard two motorcycles.

Over time this has become the daily experience of e-hailing drivers across the country as they are robbed maimed or killed by criminals hiding under the cloak of riders (passengers).

There is no doubt that the emergence of ride-hailing companies that provide app-based on-demand transport services have made commuting easy affordable and comfortable for many Nigerians. Besides the app platforms have provided jobs for the unemployed and those eager to have multiple sources of income.

In Nigeria and Africa as a whole practically all the cities enjoy the presence of these app companies.

However the thriving business which involves the engagement of independent contract drivers who earn based on commission PUNCH Investigations gathered has seen them basically being denied the rights and protections obligatorily enjoyed by employees and their counterparts abroad.

Making their job a difficult one is the security risk they face daily which has cost some their lives and left many with disabilities and permanent traumatic scars.

Their greatest concern and fears however lies in the fact that nothing was being done by the ride-hailing companies to put adequate security and safety measures in place to protect them.

But bent on surviving the harsh economic conditions prevalent in the country the e-hailing drivers told our correspondent that they are positively determined to face the risk associated with their work one day at a time.

One of them is Victor who described e-hailing drivers in Nigeria as endangered species.

For him nothing best captures the personality of his colleagues who are alive to recount horrid tales of their experiences with men of the underworld.

Victor lives with the traumas of two life-threatening encounters he had not long ago while using both Bolt and Uber apps. Because of the experiences he ends his job daily by 6pm and does not accept ride requests from certain pick-up spots.

“Some requests are declined and are out of bound to me no matter the surge at the time and the money I stand to make” he told our correspondent.

Recalling his close shave with death Victor said while on the Bolt app he accepted a request from a male passenger for a ride to a location in Ketu.

He recalled that as soon as the man dropped at his destination and he tried to drive out of the street he was surrounded by young men armed with cutlasses and cudgels.

He recounted “I was told to wind down and had to obey because there was no escape route. One of them slapped me as I pleaded for them to spare my life. They collected my two phones ATM cards driving licence and the money I made for the day before allowing me to go. The crime was later reported at the Alapere Police Station.’’

He said the second experience still gives him goose bumps each time he remembers it.

The e-hailing driver alleged that the response from the two ride-sharing companies for the losses he incurred was sorry adding that no attempt was made to trace the riders.

Victor lamented that not profiling riders had done e-hailing drivers unquantifiable damage adding “It is sad that we are always in the dark about who we carry daily while the companies have all our details.”

Mr Oche Oche is another that escaped death by a whisker on several occasions.

Looking crestfallen the Benue State indigene said he recently lost a friend and colleague Morenikeji Oluwaniyi while on active ride on September 5 2021.

The 27-year-old was a medical doctor who converted his Toyota Corolla to an Uber ride to make ends meet.

The young man accepted a ride booked by one Ahmed who requested to be conveyed to Ikeja around 10pm on Sunday. He was reportedly strangled by the suspect and his three accomplices that later joined the ride at the Abule Egba area of Lagos State.

They dumped his corpse and made away with his vehicle but were later apprehended with the aid of a tracker in the stolen vehicle.

The deceased Oche said was among the many whose lives were cut short and accused the app companies of not empathising with families of deceased drivers or those that have suffered losses on the job.

“You can’t contact them when in distress. All they are after is their 25 per cent commission. There is no form of insurance for the drivers. If something happens to any of us they won’t follow up.

“The doctor was my friend. We were together in the morning before he was killed at night. I have friends that have been attacked wounded and their cars money and ATM stolen at gunpoint. Tomi Waziri a young Uber driver lost his sight after he was attacked by robbers. It has not been easy for us. We operate in fear” he lamented.

Like Victor Oche bemoaned non-profiling of riders noting that it should be the first step towards addressing cab hailing crimes.

“Riders should be profiled with valid and traceable means of identification. The app companies have our driving licences and have gone on to ensure that we get verified after providing Bank Verification Number National Identification Number and passport photographs. Meanwhile they don’t have details of riders only phone numbers.

“A passenger can have up to seven phone numbers and open different accounts with them because what the app companies request is just a rider’s phone number. Those with criminal intentions have capitalised on it to register accounts with fictitious names. You can imagine when a name comes up on your app as lion tiger demon code ghost nikita or jakau.

Continuing he said “Riders can be verified by being mandated to provide their BVN. But with fears over hackers accessing accounts with BVN NIN can serve because it automatically provides the identity of a phone user. The Federal Road Safety Corps provided the app companies with a database with which they can verify a driving licence just by imputing the number on the licence.

“These app companies can liaise with those that developed the software and request a template with which riders can be verified. All that is needed is to input the NIN linked to the phone number and the network provider will give every required detail. If the name provided doesn’t correspond with the phone number the rider should not be activated.”

A distraught Oche alleged that Bolt recently made it possible for a rider to end an active trip without the knowledge of the driver noting that criminals have taken advantage of it to unleash mayhem and short-change drivers.

E-hailing drivers targeted elsewhere

Attack on e-hailing drivers is not limited to Nigeria. Based on research countries such as the United States South Africa Brazil and Mexico top the list.

In December 2019 following several public complaints regarding the safety of Uber in the US the company released its first ever comprehensive safety report which revealed that 3045 sexual assaults and nine murders were carried out in the US within 2018 and part of 2017.

According to the American technology company of the 3045 reported sexual assault cases in 2018 (up from 2936 in 2017) 235 were rapes and the remainder were varying levels of assault.

The report however revealed that 42 per cent of those who reported sexual assault were Uber drivers.

Based on crime data obtained by Reuters covering January 1 to December 31 2016 attacks on Uber drivers rose from an average of 13 per month in the first seven months to 141 per month in the rest of the year in Brazil especially in Sao Paulo.

In South Africa attacks on e-hailing drivers are at a record high especially from metered taxi drivers who feel threatened by their presence.

According to a report published in The Guardian (UK) on February 6 2020 with the headline ‘Rough ride-share: Why drivers are also at risk of violence’ some Uber drivers said they resorted to self-help by carrying weapons and adding safety features to their cars for protection against attacks.

In the report a driver nicknamed ‘Angry Uber Driver’ said he stockpiled and concealed an arsenal of weapons in his 2016 Honda Civic.

In the report the co-founder of Legal Rideshare a law firm that specialises in Uber accidents and injuries Bryant Greening noted “Crimes against ride-share drivers are grossly underreported.

“We get calls every day from drivers who have been victimised by passengers. It’s much more common than anybody really understands” he added.

Different clime different cab-hailing rules

However PUNCH Investigations discovered what could be likened to discriminatory treatment by Uber as it chose to adopt measures to curb attacks on its driver-partners in the US.

Following the 2019 report Uber developed new software to protect their drivers known as the “emergency button” on Uber’s driver app.

Once the emergency button is activated key details such as location licence plate and car model are automatically sent to a 911 dispatcher who responds immediately.

Also part of the security measure was the new “selfie check” feature which enables a driver to match a photo with a face before the passenger enters the car.

Made available to drivers in the US is the RideCheck App which can detect rare events such as unexpected long stops on a trip or possible vehicle crashes.

The technology it was learnt proactively checks in with riders and drivers to see if everything is fine and the app provides tools that they can use to get help if needed.

In Brazil and Mexico Uber introduced a new safety feature into its app that allows drivers and passengers to make an audio recording during trips.

However when PUNCH Investigations inquired from the Nigerian e-hailing driver Victor if any of the aforementioned security provisions were provided for them they said the only feature enabled on their Uber and Bolt apps is an emergency number linked to the Lagos State Fire Service.

“The number is of no use as it is barely answered. If anyone responds at all it would be hours after harm would have befallen the driver. We complained and nothing was done. The only feature which riders and drivers make use of is trip sharing” he added.

Data banks

Though there are no pointers to the fact that Uber profiles riders in the US however there is evidence to show that it has comprehensive details of riders as it harvests data and has long provided such to US law enforcement officials in emergencies and criminal investigations.

According to a report in Forbes data from Uber was used extensively by public health officials to track riders and drivers presumed to have come in contact with those infected with COVID-19.

Such data according to security experts could be used to trace a rider suspected of or linked to criminal acts.

However in Nigeria our correspondent learnt that in as much as information like real time location and phone numbers are documented Nigeria’s flawed centralised database that could confirm and synchronise a citizen’s information quickly is non-existent.

Drivers families in South Africa enjoy insurance cover

In 2019 Uber revealed via newspaper publications that it has extended its Partner Injury Protection cover for driver-partners to include a daily payment benefit in Nigeria.

According to Uber on its website it partnered with AXA Mansard an insurance company to provide e-hailing drivers with protection under the programme.

At the time Uber General Manager for West Africa Lola Kassim said that driver-partners were covered from the moment they accepted a trip while driving to pick up a rider and until the trip ended and that riders would also be covered.

Kassim noted that in the unfortunate event of an accident resulting in an injury during a trip driver and riders would have access to benefits such as medical cover death and funeral payment permanent disability and daily payment benefit for a driver injured or hospitalised for more than 24 hours as a result of an accident during on-trip and unable to drive because of the injuries.

Bolt on its part offers Bolt Trip Protection to both riders and drivers and much publicity was given to it on its South African blog.

Based on a publication on the blog dated June 2020 it was underwritten by Oaksure Financial Services South Africa.

The money earmarked for the insurance (R50000) is meant to cover unexpected injuries emergency medical expenses hospital stays and trauma counselling for up to six weeks after the incident.

Our correspondent confirmed from Uber drivers that the Partner Injury Protection Programme was launched in 2018 but was stopped. They also claimed that there was no form of insurance for drivers on any of the e-hailing platforms.

They also alleged that Bolt on its part had never insured or paid any amount to any of its drivers.

“Nobody has benefitted from it in the past” Benjamin a driver with Bolt claimed.

Meanwhile PUNCH Investigations discovered that a similar Partner INJURY Protection Programme by Uber which had been in operation in South Africa since August 1 2018 and managed by Chubb Insurance South Africa Ltd is still active.

According to a report published on October 1 2018 by Uber on ‘Safety tips for Uber drivers’ on its South African blog “As of 2017 driver-partners are covered with insurance against accidental death permanent total and partial disabilities during any trip with Uber via Chubb’s South African Subsidiary Chubb Insurance South Africa Limited.”

The insurance cover also has safety features and provides access to quality and affordable private healthcare cover for not only driver-partners but their families on a voluntary basis.

Aside from having an effective insurance cover for e-hailing drivers in South Africa other benefits include fuel rebates special deals on servicing and maintenance including having the chance to choose from three vehicle insurance partner companies.

No insurance cover for Nigerian e-hailing drivers – PEDPA

The Association of Professional E-hailing Drivers and Private Owners Association is the umbrella body of e-hailing drivers in Nigeria.

Its National President Idris Shonuga said contrary to claims by Uber and Bolt that it had insurance cover for e-hailing drivers none of its late members or those that suffered injuries during active rides had benefitted.

He said that statistics showed that over 100 of its members had been attacked while on an active trip while a record of over 20 lost their lives and others left with permanent disabilities.

“I was a victim of a vicious attack. We will get to know how functional the insurance is with the doctor that was killed on an active ride. Already Uber has deactivated his account” he alleged.

He alleged that the system of the app companies was porous and exposed them to all manner of people noting that members of the association had observed strikes and protested against the situation yet nothing changed.

He said “There is no adequate mechanism to help the drivers know who they are going to pick. Riders book randomly and an individual can book for anybody. Some criminal elements have seen these loopholes and have taken advantage of it to perpetrate evil.

Reiterating the call for profiling of riders with NIN Shonuga said “Men with families and assets running into millions of naira are daily exposed to people with phone numbers that can easily be thrown away if they commit any crime. If anything happens they disassociate themselves from the act.”

‘Security management essential’

A security analyst Kabir Adamu said that the app companies needed to engage the services of local security risk experts to manage the challenges faced by their driver-partners.

He revealed that such expert support which was a measure adopted abroad was at its implementation stage before it was disrupted by the pandemic.

He said “App companies have a global security plan but due to peculiarities in each country there is need to have ground support. First is to help them to understand those peculiarities and more importantly to manage them.

“I am aware they are having many challenges in Nigeria and they need the support of the parent company to manage the experiences. Unfortunately the process of engaging security risk management locally was halted. I don’t know why despite the resumption of activities because of the pandemic they have yet to conclude the process. Security management is a detailed process. First is being aware of these risks and putting in place mitigation measures.”

Adamu who is the Managing Director of Beacon Consulting Nigeria noted that one of the challenges was the belief by the drivers that they were not adequately documented.

He said though there could be people circumventing the process of opening accounts by providing fictitious details he was aware that strict measures were put in place for those opening accounts with the app companies.

He however blamed such development on the Nigerian system.

“The ride-sharing companies are probably relying on the fact that for anyone to have an account the person must have been documented. But we know there are persons capable of circumventing that process. However the issue of not being properly documented needs to be thoroughly investigated. They do have processes but just that they are not enough to prevent attacks on their drivers.

“The app companies should be able to operate in Nigeria the same way others do and support their drivers to reduce associated risk. They have to recruit local security risk management support that would help them to constantly analyse and recommend measures to mitigate the risks. There are many things that can be done on their part to increase the documentation of those that want to open an account with them.

He added “For instance if there are exceptions to the bank account requirements those exceptions should be stopped immediately. Anyone who wants to use their services should have a bank account. If possible they should adopt the NIN procedure.

“We can’t force the government to do what it’s supposed to do. There are regulatory agencies such as the Central Bank of Nigeria that have oversight over banks and it is its responsibility to ensure that every account holder is properly documented. It is not the responsibility of app companies to ensure that.”

Adamu advised the drivers to be security conscious avoid hot spots and share details of the ride with a colleague or trusted person as a form of self security precaution.

Uber committed to safety

A Senior Account Manager with JNPR South Africa Karabo Keepile who spoke on behalf of Uber said the app company had contributed to new safety benefits like tracking with Global Positioning System which was not possible before.

Though she refused to put a figure on the number of drivers that have lost their lives on active duty she explained that the management needed to defer to law enforcement agents decisions on what they desired to make public and when.

“Uber’s Law Enforcement Relations Team will cooperate with police investigation in accordance with its law enforcement guidelines” she added.

She assured that the app company remained committed to improving safety by creating accountability and transparency urging riders and drivers to report all issues to the police and Uber to ensure involvement.

She said “We have 24/7 incident support and drivers have access to an in-app emergency button to third party security to get needed help. The app displays the driver location and trip details which can be shared with emergency services” she said.

Keepile noted that Uber regularly shared safety communication tips with its drivers through email and in-app messages adding that it was continuously working to build better tools processes and partnerships to raise the bar on safety.

She stated that Uber offered Injury Protection at no cost noting that like other insurance policy it was subject to terms conditions and limits.

Bolt keeps mum

All efforts to reach Bolt proved abortive as calls made to its support office were not answered or returned. There was also no response to the text message sent as of the time of filing this report.

Police committed to Nigerians’ safety says spokesman

The Force Public Relations Officer Frank Mba said that the Nigeria Police Force understood the risk associated with e-hailing drivers’ job assuring that the police were ready to work and collaborate with them and their regulators to ensure enhanced safety.

Speaking exclusively with PUNCH Investigations Mba said that the police treated every life crime infraction of laws and every threat to the life of every Nigerian seriously.

Mba noted that cases of Uber drivers becoming victims or suspects were treated with equal level of seriousness maintaining that every crime mattered to the police.

He said “There have been instances where innocent drivers were attacked and innocent riders were also attacked by drivers. We will continue to evolve new crime fighting strategies to deal with some of these emerging crimes and threat to life and property of Nigerians. We will work with all relevant stakeholders including cab-hailing drivers to ensure we protect them and other citizens.”

On possible security measures he noted that in some countries cameras were fitted especially in buses but was unaware if such was possible in Nigeria and what the cost implication could be considering the high cost of data.

He however advised e-hailing drivers to withdraw their services from known dangerous areas especially late at night.

Mba stated “Such areas are peculiar to Nigeria as they also exist in countries such as South Africa and the US even with surveillance cameras installed. As an Uber driver if you get a ride request to these known dangerous places at past midnight why should you go there? Drivers should always have the emergency numbers of the law enforcement agencies within the locality where they usually operate to easily call for help when faced with threats. Timely report of crime should be made at the nearest police station.’’

He also advised e-hailing drivers against operating with tinted glasses so that people could easily notice when something unusual was to happen and intervene.

Other features include the Apostles without Judas a citadel representing heaven and the jaws of Hell. Christ bleeding from the nails and with a gaping wound in his side is flanked by his mother Mary and John the Baptist.

Mr Lawes said: “The church’s original Doom it is thought was painted in the 1420s or 1430s and was plastered over during the Reformation.

“The Victorians uncovered it in 1884 but since then it has suffered further and it is now hard to discern.

“So it was a genuine thrill to be asked to recreate it using traditional techniques. A great deal of research had been done on the original with regard to the pigments used.

“And with the knowledge gained from examining the country’s more complete paintings I was able to interpret the Woodham Ferrers’ version.

“It is not as big as the original but I hope it captures the colour and drama and that it provides a sense of what worshippers would once have been looking at as they attended services.

“We are not used to our churches being decorated with bright coloured paintings but it was once common.”

‘Desire to bring the painting to life’

Nia McIntosh a heritage consultant using money from the National Heritage Lottery Fund has overseen a wide Heritage Hub project at St Mary’s.

She said: “The original Doom has been through a lot over the years. It was damaged in a storm in 1989 and has deteriorated further despite conservation interventions.

“It’s now very hard to see which was why we wanted to find out what it had looked like originally and create a new version. We were able to with money from the Friends of Friendless Churches.

“My desire was to bring the painting to life for our visitors and congregation; to create more of an immersive experience and transport people back to the medieval period.

“Steve is an expert in this area and he examined the parts that remain of the original and studied documentary evidence from examinations since it re-emerged in 1884.

“Tests were done on the remaining paint to establish exactly what pigments were used and examination into extant Dooms enabled an interpretation which is as close as we can get.

“I’m sure there hasn’t been a Doom painting using traditional techniques created for a parish church since the Reformation.

“St Mary’s has other medieval paintings and decorations and we are currently hosting an exhibition and events to celebrate it.”

The exhibition Doom and discovery; wall paintings in the medieval church runs until the middle of June.

Other experts involved include Sara Charles a medieval book production expert who hand made the original recipe pigments and the brushes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmR5c3Rhci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDI0LzA1LzEyL2ZpcnN0LWNodXJjaC1vZi1jYW5uYWJpcy1pbmRpYW5hLW1hcmlqdWFuYS1jaHVyY2gtd2hhdC10by1rbm93LWhvdy10by1qb2luLXN0b25lcnMtd2VlZC1pbmRpYW5hcG9saXMvNzM2Mzg2OTIwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indianapolis has a marijuana church.

What is the Church of Cannabis?

The First Church of Cannabis was founded by Levin in 2015 in response to Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act which was signed into law by former governor Mike Pence on March 26 2015 and went into effect on July 1 2015.

When the law finally went into effect on July 1 the doors of Levin's beloved establishment opened that same day as previously reported by the IndyStar. According to the First Church of Cannabis website the group's mission is to ""celebrate life's great adventure by building on compassion good health and love.""

While the group is unable to participate in the ""holy sacrament"" of being able to light up at their regular Wednesday service they've found other ways to fill the time according to the IndyStar. A typical service starts with a shorter sermon from Levin before opening the floor to members to discuss concerns. They also perform a ""diety dozen"" with affirmations of marijuana as a means of healing. Learn more about the ""diety dozen"" here.

Where is the First Church of Cannabis?

The First Church of Cannabis is located at 3400 S Rural St. in Indianapolis.

Who founded the First Church of Cannabis?

Levin 68 founder and leader of the First Church of Cannabis is a long-standing marijuana advocate who began working with the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) in the late 19990s according to the church's website. He eventually started his own pro-cannabis organization ReLegalize Indiana.

Levin also ran for political positions as a Libertarian in the early 2010s with marijuana legislation as a key focus but came up short. When the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed ""Bill took this as an opportunity to establish The First Church of Cannabis on the basis of 'Cannatarian' religion where love is the most important and including the sacrament cannabis"" according to Church of Cannabis.

Marijuana Church challenges Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act

Levin and the Church of Cannabis filed a lawsuit against the state of Indiana Pence and Attorney General Greg Zoeller in July 2015 with the claim that denying them the right to smoke in public infringes on religious freedom. A second lawsuit was filed on March 3 2016 against the city of Indianapolis the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department and former Police Chief Rick Hite.

The filed suits argued that members' use of marijuana at the Church of Cannabis should be protected under Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act but was dismissed by the Indiana Court of Appeals in December of 2018.

""I feel sorry for the people who are not educated in this subject matter"" Levin previously said to the IndyStar. ""We'll keep doing what we're doing because we're doing God's work.""

FILE PHOTO: Chora Museum or Kariye Mosque re-opens its doors to visitors and worshippers in Istanbul

By Ali Kucukgocmen

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey has opened the ancient Chora church one of Istanbul's most celebrated Byzantine buildings to Muslim worshippers after it was used as a museum for more than 70 years making it the second such major conversion under President Tayyip Erdogan.

Erdogan a champion of pious Muslims in Turkey and head of a party with Islamist roots turned Istanbul's world-renowned Hagia Sophia from a museum into a mosque in 2020 in a ceremony attended by tens of thousands of people.

That move was criticised by church leaders and some Western countries who said reconverting Hagia Sophia risked deepening religious rifts. Erdogan said this was interference in sovereign rights and that he was determined to protect Muslims' rights.

The original Chora or Kariye church dates back to the 4th Century and was turned into a mosque by the Ottomans. It became a museum in 1945 and Erdogan signed an order in 2020 converting it back into a mosque. It reopened on Monday after restoration.

The outer halls were preserved as a museum with visitors able to view the prized mosaics that dot the ceiling unhindered. Curtains concealed the mosaics in the building's prayer section in line with Muslim traditions.

People were seen lifting the coverings to look at the mosaics of Jesus and of Mary with the infant Jesus.

Ferdy Simon a British tourist said he would have preferred the building to remain as a museum so that people could see the mosaics and frescoes there. ""It seems to be a political gambit"" he said speaking outside the Chora.

""It's a bit of a shame when you see devout women who have come here to pray and they are told they can't go into the main narthex area"" he added referring to the fact that the main prayer section is reserved for males as in all mosques.

'POLITICAL GAIN'

Ugur Gokgoz a Turkish man who came to pray said it was Turkish people's right to use the Chora as a mosque adding that the artefacts inside the museum were preserved.

""There was a small section reserved for prayer. At the end they didn't tear everything down and turned it into a mosque"" he said.

A church was first built at the site in the 4th century but most of the existing building dates to an 11th century church that was partly rebuilt 200 years later following an earthquake.

The Church of the Holy Saviour in Chora built near the ancient city walls of Constantinople contains 14th century mosaics and frescoes showing scenes from biblical stories.

They were plastered over after the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 but brought to light when - like Hagia Sophia - it was converted to a museum by Turkey's secular republic in 1945.

Burcin Altinsay Ozguner Turkey head of the International Council on Monuments and Sites said the Chora artefacts are unique and the best way to make them available for researchers is to maintain the building as a museum.

""Of course there are political gains behind it"" she said adding there was no obvious need for a mosque in the case of both Hagia Sophia and Chora with mosques right next to them.

Two major companies — Bloomfield-based health insurer Cigna and New Britain-based tool and storage giant Stanley Black & Decker — are making loans totaling $1.7 million through the Capital Region Development Authority.

“The fact that these two companies are participating financially in a project that is so significant to Hartford’s future and Hartford’s development is a strong statement that they have confidence in where we are headed and they believe that a strong and vibrant Hartford is good for everyone” Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin said.

The first phase of 270 mixed-income apartments and storefront space in the North Crossing development planned around Dunkin’ Donuts Park is visible in the upper right-hand corner of this aerial photo from August. (Mark Mirko / Hartford Courant)

Bronin said the city and CRDA which helps finance projects with state taxpayer-backed loans and equity investments have had conversations with corporate leaders in recent years about the goals of redevelopment in the city especially around increasing housing to make downtown and the city’s neighborhoods more vibrant.

“I am hopeful that this initial pair of investments will be the first but not the last” Bronin said.

The low-cost loans from Cigna and Stanley Black & Decker are contributing to the financing of the $200 million-plus North Crossing the former Downtown North or DoNo. The first 270 of 1000 or more apartments eventually planned for around the ballpark are now under construction at Morgan and Main streets and could be ready for occupancy in the spring.

The loans signal that large corporations are getting increasingly comfortable with the city’s redevelopment strategy and its results since CRDA was formed in 2013.

The $85 million conversion of the 777 Main office tower in Hartford into 285 mixed-income apartments was completed in 2015 The tower is 90% occupied as of the latest count by the Capital Region Development Authority which helped finance the project with state taxpayer-backed loans and equity. (Courant file photo)

Since then CRDA has invested $117 million of public funding in low-cost loans and equity investments supporting $435 million in development in more than two dozen housing projects in and around downtown. Almost all of those projects converted former commercial spaces into rentals with 2100 apartments created according to a CRDA analysis in May toward a goal of reaching 3000.

Based on property appraisals from before and after the conversions $294 million of value has been created CRDA said. The amount of tax revenue generated for the city wasn’t immediately available.

Michael W. Freimuth CRDA’s executive director said the string of housing conversions have for the most part held their occupancy levels. There was a dip during the height of the pandemic in 2020 but the majority now at are 90% or better with a few exceptions Freimuth said.

If momentum builds behind more corporations making loans into redevelopment it may be possible to begin dialing back a little on the public investment in projects that now have a demonstrated track record Freimuth said. That he said also could allow CRDA to focus more of its lending to promising — but still risky — projects particularly in the neighborhoods.

“It’s a measure of where we’ve come from and where we are” Freimuth said. “It’s an important achievement but we still have a long way to go.”

Hartford’s history is marked by often heavy corporate involvement in city redevelopment efforts.

In the 1950s and 1960s powerful corporate chief executives were part of the so-called corporate “bishops” which influenced development and philanthropic pursuits.

Even into the 1980s insurer Aetna now owned by CVS Health Corp. was helping to reshape downtown partnering on the construction of CityPlace I.

A decade earlier Aetna was instrumental in financing the construction of the nearby Civic Center with a downtown shopping mall. The Civic Center is now the XL Center and the mall is long gone.

Stanley Black & Decker which has established an advanced manufacturing “center of excellence” on Constitution Plaza in downtown Hartford said investing in redevelopment is another way to strengthen the capital city an essential component for a thriving Connecticut.

“Our support of the DoNo project one of the largest redevelopment projects underway in downtown Hartford is one way we are working with partners like Cigna to help drive positive change in the city of Hartford” Stanley Black & Decker said in an email.

Cigna said it supports investments aimed at revitalizing Hartford neighborhoods and as a health care company providing “access to quality affordable housing is critical to helping people lead happier healthier lives.”

The redevelopment loans open a new investment front for the city but Bronin and others say the corporate community has been active for years in supporting the city in other initiatives.

In 2017 Aetna and two other major insurers in the city — The Hartford Financial Services Group and Travelers Cos. Inc. — committed to donate $50 million over five years to stabilize the city’s finances.

In Hartford’s Asylum Hill neighborhood The Hartford has committed more than $10 million in grants for housing rehabilitation projects and other pressing needs in the community around where the insurer is headquartered.

EGGER celebrates one-year anniversary of production start at Davidson County plant

LEXINGTON — This month marked one year since EGGER officially started production at its facility near Lexington.

Located in the I-85 corridor the plant is the company’s first in North America and focuses on manufacturing raw particleboard and particleboard lamination as the Austrian-based company aims to better serve the U.S. market.

The facility which now employs more than 400 employees has upheld its commitment to Davidson County’s economic growth and investment in the local workforce by exceeding the number of projected jobs created during phase one. The second phase of development which will focus on finishing lines for added production value is set to begin in 2025 with an additional 300 jobs planned over the next 10-15 years.

“It is hard to believe how far we’ve come since first selecting Lexington as the future home of EGGER’s 20th plant to now being fully operational for 365 days and counting” Carsten Ritterbach plant manager commercial services said in a news release. “We are immensely grateful to everyone who has played a role in EGGER Lexington’s brief history and we look forward to continuing to build the company’s presence in the Davidson County community as we gear up for phase two in the coming years.”

Construction on the one million square-foot facility began in April 2018 with production officially starting last September – on time – despite being in the middle of an ongoing global pandemic. The facility contributes to the regional economy through the purchase of wood byproducts from sawmills in and around the state and through work with a range of local suppliers.

Small Business Administration announces supplemental awards through Shuttered Venue Operators Grant

Administrator Isabella Casillas Guzman announced that the Small Business Administration began supplemental award notifications to eligible applicants this week through the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant (SVOG) program.

Thus far the SBA has awarded over $10 billion in economic relief to nearly 12000 venues providing support to theaters live venues and other entertainment and cultural hubs as they recover from the pandemic re-open and continue contributing to local economies.

Per the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses Non-profits and Venues Act and the American Rescue Plan signed into law by President Joe Biden those who received an initial grant and illustrate a 70% loss when comparing 2021’s first-quarter revenues to the same in 2019 are eligible to receive a supplemental grant.

“America’s performing arts venues and related businesses have been among the hardest-hit during this pandemic. Our SBA team has helped approximately 12000 of these treasured community institutions secure a combined $10 billion to weather this crisis and build back better” Guzman said in a news release. “The majority of the Shuttered Venue Operators Grants have gone to businesses with 50 employees or less – which means we’re reaching our smallest businesses who suffered disproportionate impacts from the pandemic and were often left out of early rounds of relief.”

Semenjak pisah dengan Katie Holmes pada 2012 lalu Tom Cruise jarang sekali digosipkan dekat atau pacaran dengan selebriti lainnya. Bersama Hayley Atwell pun menjadi kisah cintanya yang paling lama setelah perceraian itu.

Hingga saat ini Tom Cruise sudah tiga kali menikah yakni bersama Mimi Rogers selama tiga tahun hingga 1990 lalu Nicole Kidman selama sepuluh tahun hingga 2001 dan terakhir Katie Holmes selama enam tahun serta memiliki anak yakni Shuri.

Sebelumnya dilaporkan jika rumah produksi film Mission Impossible 7 yakni Paramount telah menggugat perusahaan asuransinya pada Senin (30/8) waktu setempat karena menolak untuk menutupi sebagian besar kerugian yang diterima Paramount akibat adanya penutupan/lockdown saat pandemi pada produksi film tersebut.

Melansir dari Variety Selasa (31/8/2021) berdasarkan isi dari gugatan itu Paramount menuntut perusahaan asuransi studio Chubb karena mereka hanya akan membayar US$ 1 juta atau setara dengan Rp 144 miliar (dengan kurs Rp 14.400/dolar AS) untuk mengganti kerugian COVID-19.

kerugian yang diterima oleh Paramount ini diakibatkan oleh tertundanya proses produksi sebanyak tujuh kali antara Februari 2020 dan Juni 2021 di mana setidaknya enam di antaranya adalah akibat dari pandemi.

Oleh karena itu Paramount berpendapat bahwa penutupan terkait pandemi seharusnya memicu ketentuan kebijakan dari asuransi tersebut karena penutupan dimaksudkan untuk melindungi para pemain agar tidak sakit."

And everyone from hyperscalers to small businesses can look forward to new capabilities and future-proof infrastructures.

But that’s only part of the story. Especially when combined with Cisco’s Acacia optics Silicon One’s greatest impact may be on sustainability with wide implications for energy savings unconnected communities and the planet itself.

For some deeper insights on Silicon One we spoke with Adam MacHale vice president of EMEAR Service Provider for Cisco and a passionate advocate for sustainability.

Q. Thank you Adam! First off perhaps you could share a few thoughts on how sustainability fits into Cisco’s overall purpose of driving an inclusive future for all.

A. There’s been a real change in the tone and the level of engagement and it’s fantastic to see. Sustainability is now among the top three topics in any conversation across our organization. It’s in the way that we engage with customers it’s in all product conversations and in our approach to hybrid work and return to office. It’s in how we build circular economy principles into all our products and how we get that into our supply chains.

Q. Why is Silicon One such a game-changer?

A. If you look at service providers as an example in some cases telcos represent 2 to 3 percent of a country’s energy consumption. They build their businesses around the network. And Silicon One is at the heart of the machines that can drive that forward in a much more sustainable efficient way — especially when combined with the investments we’ve made in Acacia and optics to simplify the way we build these networks. That can have a dramatic impact. For example Swisscom estimates it can achieve a 40 percent power saving by converging down to Cisco infrastructure.

In terms of performance if you consider internet traffic growth there are various figures that get quoted between 25 percent CAGR and up to 50 percent in 2020. So it has been a struggle just to keep up without overloading the silicon. But the amazing thing about Silicon One is just the performance that we can get out of that chipset and the simplification that we can get within those platforms.

Now we can actually build the silicon ahead of the growth curve effectively doubling the performance at half the power. If you can have half the power consumption of say a telco — or even better for all our IP infrastructure that changes things dramatically.

Q. And how does Silicon One affect the economics of the internet?

A. If you look at Sub-Saharan Africa as an example parts of the rural infrastructure are reliant on diesel generators. So if we can make these networks much more power efficient the move to more sustainable lower-cost power sources becomes viable. Also by lowering the cost point of the infrastructure delivering those services we can look at connecting the unconnected. The impact that has on a local economy healthcare education and well-being can just be huge.

Q. Combined with Cisco’s Acacia optics Silicon One enables a new paradigm routed optical networking. Aside from its great capabilities what are the implications for sustainability?

A. Traditionally networks are built on layers. You’d have the fiber layer an optical layer and you’d have the routing layer on top. So on every one of those sites you’d have two or three boxes consuming power. And you’d have to look after them manage them.

What we’re doing with new technologies like Acacia optics which are small and pluggable into a router is you can collapse it all down into one box. You immediately simplify the network and reduce boxes which reduces power. Then you reduce the price point because you don’t need all of that bulky infrastructure within those platforms. So that’s another way that we're transforming networks with simplicity. And by adding automation to run them more efficiently. If there’s high demand it can switch on more capacity; if there’s a low demand switch off some of the infrastructure.

Q. That simplicity translates into a kind of democracy doesn’t it? By making the technology easier to deploy and use.

A. To connect the unconnected you need the skill sets to be able to roll the technology out and then continue to run it. Through Cisco Networking Academy we are making those skills readily available to all. And by simplifying with automation and changing the price point the more accessible it becomes for everybody.

Q. How does the smaller size of these components impact supply chains or recycling?

A. It definitely affects the shipping supply chain and the energy used in actually getting those products out into the world. But there are also fewer components more recyclable materials and less energy used to build them. And with a simpler modular approach to building out the network we can reuse parts of that infrastructure somewhere else when we need to upgrade where they can still have huge value. The more reusable and modular the more chance we get to increase the lifespan and the use of those boxes which from a sustainability and a circular economy aspect becomes really important.

Q. What do you see for the future and how can Cisco continue to help support sustainability?

A. I’d like us to move much quicker in adopting these technologies. If you think about the story of the pandemic and how quickly governments and people changed how they did things who would have believed that we could have moved that quickly? We did things in the space of weeks that would have taken years before. So I think we need to build on that and be much bolder in how we’re looking to connect the unconnected enable sustainability and transform infrastructures.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlcG9ydGVybmV3cy5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEvMDkvMjUvYmVuamFtaW4tYmFsbGluZ2VyLXJvc2NvZS1rZWVwLXJvbGxpbmctd2Vlay01LzU4NjQ5NTUwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Benjamin Ballinger Roscoe keep rolling in Week 5,"Just two years ago the Benjamin Mustangs were bottom feeders at the 1A level winning just one game in 2019.

They are now a force at the six-man level and Friday proved that.

Benjamin earned a 62-50 win over Class Division I No. 10 Roby. The Mustangs are now 5-0 and have outscored opponents 300-130 to start the season.

“We played hard” Benjamin coach Shannon Waters said. “There were some things we did offensively with some different looks that we thought we could take advantage of that worked out for us. And defensively we had a couple of big turnovers — a fumble and an interception.”

Two years ago the Mustangs finished with a 1-6 record losing five games by more than 20 points. Waters traced the on-field improvement to a program-wide culture change.

“I’ve always thought this would be the group that would change the atmosphere” Waters said. “A winning culture wasn’t expected so we’ve changed that and now we expect to win. They’ve started to believe in themselves.”

They might crack the 1A Division II rankings for the first time this season after the impressive road win. Benjamin sits in a good spot to contend for District 8-1A Division II.

“It’s going to be tough so we have to make sure that we’re playing our hardest” Waters said.

For Roby the Lions are now 3-1. They have another tough test in Week 6 when they will face Jayton on the road.

Bears upend Llano in OT

Ballinger has now won three in a row after beating Llano in overtime Friday. On the opening drive of overtime quarterback Carter Arrott hit Blake Collum in stride for a 27-yard touchdown pass.

Llano answered but the Yellowjackets missed their extra point giving Ballinger a 35-34 win.

Arrott led Ballinger’s offense notching five total touchdowns — three passing two rushing. His longest haul went on a 43-yarder to Collum.

For the Bears this was revenge. Last year’s game against Llano was a blowout with the Yellowjackets winning 35-0.

Now Ballinger enters Week 6 with a 3-1 record riding a three-game winning streak. Next up for the Bears is a home test against a Brady team that has been up-and-down to start the year.

Big fourth quarter pulls Cisco away from Comanche

After last week’s loss to Jim Ned Cisco made a statement in Week 5 defeating Comanche 41-14 at home.

Cisco trailed early however. The Loboes were behind 7-0 at the end of the first quarter but then their offense woke up. Cisco scored 21 points in the second quarter to lead by 14 points at halftime.

Comanche responded well scoring again in the third quarter to make it a seven-point game after three. But the Loboes surged again in the fourth scoring 21 points and running away with a 41-14 win over a 3A squad.

Dual-threat quarterback Hunter Long fueled Cisco’s offense running for 239 yards and three touchdowns. He also completed three passes for 55 yards.

Running back Isaiah Longoria also was crucial adding 90 yards and three touchdowns on the ground on just seven touchdowns.

For Comanche Hudson Welch completed five passes for 57 yards and a touchdown while Miguel Martinez also contributed to the passing game with a touchdown. Tailback Luke Wilson ran for 70 yards on 15 attempts.

Non-district play is now in the rearview mirror for both teams. The 4-1 Loboes kick off district play on Oct. 8 against Winters. The Indians face Dublin that day for their district opener hoping to escape from an 0-5 hole.

Lions pounce Tigers

Albany couldn’t have asked for a much better showing against Anson on Friday.

The Tigers won 48-2 for their fifth win of the season. After just one quarter Albany already led 20-2 and the Tigers only built on the rout from there.

Albany averaged more than 8 yards per play while Anson averaged just 2.9 yards per play. The Lions notched 23 first downs compared to the Tigers’ 10.

Jaheim Newton was Albany’s leading rusher with 164 yards and a touchdown (11.7 yards per carry. And behind center Cole Chapman was excellent completing 12 of 14 pass attempts for 207 yards and four touchdowns.

The Tigers have given up just 23 points through five games helping them start 5-0. They play one more game before beginning district play: an Oct. 1 showdown against Olney at home.

Anson is now 2-3 after the loss. The Tigers have a week off before facing Stamford on Oct. 8 for their district opener.

Roscoe wins fourth straight

The Plowboys’ winning streak is now at four after they defeated New Home 44-12 on Friday. After a slow start Roscoe scored 37 unanswered points to run away from New Home and improve to 4-1.

Seth Wilcox had three rushing touchdowns while Ivan McCann and Alec Vasquez also scored on the ground. Quarterback Jax Watts threw two touchdown passes — one to Watts and one to Antonio Aguayo.

After a season-opening loss to Hawley the Plowboys have been dominant in their four-game winning streak. They have defeated Stamford Miles Christoval and now New Home all by double digits.

Before getting the week off in Week 7 the Plowboys play their final non-district game on Oct. 1 against Sudan on the road.

Strawn wins shootout

Friday’s battle between Strawn and Westbrook — two ranked teams at the 1A level — was an offensive dogfight.

The teams went back and forth but Strawn pulled away in the fourth quarter to win 68-52 and stay undefeated. Strawn is averaging 65.6 points per game this season.

The Greyhounds are ranked No. 2 in 1A Division II. Before starting district they face Fort Worth Covenant Classical on Oct. 1.

After the loss the Wildcats are 2-3 but that record is deceiving. Their losses have come to Motley County Water Valley and now Strawn — all of which entered Week 5 in the 1A rankings.

Westbrook hits the road next week for a game against 2-2 Garden City.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53b21lbm9maW5mbHVlbmNlLmNhLzIwMjEvMDkvMjYvaG93LXZpdmlhbi1rYXllLWVtYnJhY2VkLWhlci1kaWZmZXJlbmNlcy1hbmQtYnVpbHQtYS1tdWx0aS1taWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1oYWlyLWJ1c2luZXNzLTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Vivian Kaye embraced her differences and built a multi-million...,"By Sarah Kelsey

People have been trying to get Vivian Kaye to conform to preconceived societal standards since she was a kid. As a Ghanaian immigrant and one of four sisters it was expected she would attend school get a degree and settle into a solid and stable career. But spend just a few minutes chatting with the effervescent and empowering entrepreneur CEO and founder of KinkyCurlyYaki — a first-of-its-kind premium hair extension company for Black women — and you know fitting into a mould was something she was never going to let happen.

“People have always tried to fit me into a shape but I’m a rhombus or parallelogram” she says with a laugh. “I’m the black sheep. I’m the queen of the pivot the queen of solving problems and the queen of being me!”

Vivian says her entrepreneurial spirit likely developed as a young girl watching her mother selling wares at Ghanaian markets to feed her family. “She did it all with me strapped to her back” she says. Her family eventually immigrated to Canada with the help of her father and she went on to graduate high school. By university Vivian realized school wasn’t really her thing and that she would rather find work by capitalizing on her “superpowers” — namely confidence curiosity innovative thinking and the ability to speak two languages.

It was a gamble that paid off. Vivian immediately found work in call centres which evolved into roles in medtech and fintech. This led to a job at a company supporting entrepreneurs working for a boss who pushed her to try new things. “Even though he was the most random white guy he helped me to see myself and to be who I am today” she says.

With that encouragement Vivian started a wedding business as a side hustle. “I saw an opportunity to help brides find better wedding decor without spending millions” she explains and her instinct was right — it grew to six figures.

“Online word of mouth was huge for my company because nothing like it existed. I hit my first $1 million without placing a single ad.”

And then a chance meeting with a woman in 2012 changed her career trajectory forever. “I had been looking for protective hair in the form of a wig weave or braid but there weren’t a lot of options for women on the market — everything was based on white European hair textures” she says. “I really wanted to solve my own problem so I joined social media groups with people like me.” They shared specifics about vendors who sold the kinds of hair Vivian was looking for from curly to braided.

“Then one day I wore some hair to an event and a Black woman pulled me aside and said ‘who does your hair?’ I was like ‘girl this is a weave.’ And I thought if she would buy my hair a ton of other women would too.”

So with the help of some human hair sourced from India a Rubbermaid bin and the support of the Internet Vivian launched KinkyCurlyYaki. It immediately took off. Today the company stands as the originator of an entire niche in the hair industry and has become so popular that companies have begun trying to replicate its business model.

“Online word of mouth was huge for my company because nothing like it existed” Vivian says. “I hit my first $1 million without placing a single ad. It was all about influencer marketing on social media before influencer marketing was a thing and using social media groups to talk about my products. I also hit the jackpot with online shopping. KinkyCurlyYaki started when people were becoming more comfortable with spending money online.”

Vivan says learning the ins and outs of doing business in a digital world has been paramount to her success but she openly states her company wouldn’t have become successful if she wasn’t the person running it.

“I didn’t have preconceived notions about how things would go. I started this because I wanted to solve my own problem and those of other women who looked like me.”

“What no one can compete with is me. I get high on my own supply and I resonate with customers because I’m not afraid to go to work with my afro. I know what it feels like to be judged by others because of my hair so I can communicate with my customers in a way no one else can.”

She also attributes part of her success to her approach to business in general. “I didn’t have preconceived notions about how things would go. I started this because I wanted to solve my own problem and those of other women who looked like me” she explains.

And from there Vivian defined success on her own terms — which she recommends all entrepreneurs do. “If you’re worried about ‘making it’ you have to define what that means for you. For me it was about flexibility especially after my son was born because as a single mother I wanted to stay home and raise him. I wanted a business I could do at 2 a.m. while he was sleeping” she says. “If money is your number one driver you are going to be sorely disappointed in anything you do.”

Vivian also has advice for anyone who doubts themselves: sit back and ask “What would Chad do?”

“There are some mediocre men out there who don’t have any idea what they’re doing but they walk into roles because they know they might not know B but they have A and C figured out. You as a woman can figure it out. Stop looking for someone to give you permission to be you and be successful. Don’t be the damper to your own light. If someone doesn’t like the path you’ve taken? Well they can kick rocks with flip-flops.”

Vivian adds that everyone will face challenges when building a business but it’s the ability to push through difficult times that will make the impossible possible.

“The past 18 months of the COVID pandemic have been difficult — as a business person and a mother” she says. “But shit transforms into manure. Manure helps things grow it fertilizes. In order to grow you sometimes have to wade through the shit to get to the place where success happens.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldG9yYWNsZS5jby51ay9BcnRpY2xlNjk0MzcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tech Stocks Bubble Valuations 2000 vs 2021,"Tech Stocks Bubble Valuations 2000 vs 2021

The US stock market has been content to rally to new highs with many stocks going to the Moon including most of our AI tech giants a rally that I have been distributing into to the extent that I have now sold 80% of my holdings in the Top 6 AI stocks in my portfolio some of which I have been accumulating for over a decade (Microsoft). The primary objective of this analysis is the determine where we stand in terms of THE TOP after all all bull markets eventually do top either ending with a CRASH (1987) or a bear market (2000 and 2007). So what to hold and what to sell is the question I am asking myself with a view to riding out a potential bear market / crash where this analysis deploys a new automated metric of individual stock SELLING LEVELs so that one better knows where one stands in terms of ones portfolio all in just one table. After all the risk we all fear is that of a 2000 style collapse that sends stocks lower for the next 20 years! Remember that bear market bottomed with a 85% collapse for tech stocks! Yes one could say the likes of Amazon Microsoft Apple had become dirt cheap but that would have been a very painful and prolonged discounting event. So a case of balancing the risks of letting some stocks ride whilst cashing in those that will pay a heavy price for their over exuberance all whilst being aware of the AI mega-trend trundling along in the background.

And we have the likes of AMD going to the MOON yes in hindsight we can all wish we had bought more I came close in Mid May to buying more but at that time was fully invested and thought it unwise to take on even more risk on. But I and my patrons have had plenty of opportunities to buy AMD all the way from the March 2020 lows right up until my analysis of 10th of May at a price of $78 or better that AMD traded down to several times so I will give AMD extra attention in this article.

Stock Market Bubble Valuations 2000 vs 2021

How to quickly know if a stock is over valued or under valued\? Simply divide the annual earnings by the price and you get a trailing price / earnings ratio. Whilst far from being perfect hence why I have long since progressed to what I call the EC Ratio a formulae used to better determine if a stock is Expensive or Cheap (EC) based on 15 metric that also includes the Price / Earnings ratio. Nevertheless I still use the P/E ratio when referring to stocks because I generate the EC ratio only for a handful of stocks. Maybe one day I will get around to writing a web application that automatically generates it for any stock and makes the results available to patrons.

So how do today's tech giant market cap stocks compare to those of March 2000 at the peak of the Nasdaq dot com bubble.

Firstly here is how the giant mega-trend corps of the dot com era have faired over the past 21 years.

Microsoft's stock price in March 2000 was trading at $120 on a earnings multiple of 56 as the stock was in a race to become the worlds first $1 trillion market cap stock. Set this against today's price of $289 and multiple of 36 coupled with an EC score of 71. So whilst Microsoft today is not exactly cheap neither has it reached its 2000 bubble valuation for that Microsoft would be trading at $450! And before one considers holders having been invested in winner that survived the dot com crash bear in mind the following chart which shows that Microsoft (allowing for stock splits) would only have cleared its Dot com high during 2017! That is 17 YEARS! And during that time one would have seen the value of ones investment fall to a low of 25% of the stocks high.

CISCO - The backbone of the then fast developing internet much as Tesla is the backbone of the fast emerging EV and automated vehicles sector with the likes of Google throwing tens of billions into AI and robotics each year. Everyone owned Cisco just as everyone owns Google Amazon Apple or Facebook stock today.

Back In March 2000 Cisco was trading at a price of $146 on a PE of 120 to the moon TO THE MOON! Where many were concerned Cisco WAS the Internet one of the most valuable certification tracks of the time were those by Cisco where even I was CCNA certified desperately trying not to get further sucked into the highly costly Cisco certification tracks where CCNA gave way to CCNP to CCIE and beyond the certifications were mushrooming into more OTT levels than what scientology has! CCNA OTTIV where after decades and several hundreds of thousands of dollars one would become one with the internet be able to move data packets around with their mind! Other companies soon saw what a money spinner the certification tracks were and so the likes of Microsoft started their own such as Microsoft Office certifications but I digress.

So what happened to the King of the Internet Cisco which according to many at the time was destined to go to the MOON!

Well even 21 years later Cisco has still not even recovered to the half way mark in market cap terms even the share price trades below the March high of $146 splitted to $78 this despite extensive buy backs in recent years to try and drive the price higher to overcome that $78 brick wall!. The P/E ratio says it all as to why where Cisco's current P/E of 23 is a far cry from 120 that it was trading at 21 years ago and thus sowed the seeds for what transpired since.

Imagine all those who either bought in the months before or after the dot com bubble top and decided to hang on have YET to break even! You have to understand that in March 2020 it was a done deal Cisco was the Nvidia was the Amazon was the Apple of its time destined to become the worlds first $1 trillion stock! Whilst everyone recognised there were many over priced stocks but CISCO was BLUE CHIP! Cisco was going to OWN the future! GAME OVER as Cisco WAS the internet!

Just as many take today's multi trillion dollar corps as unassailable blue chips. And then we have the insane valuations of the likes of TESLA trading on a PE of 364! Understand this when the bubble bursts Tesla's fate will be worse than any of the top 5 of 2000!

Digging further into the depths of internet history courtesy if Cisco's network hardware here's what one investment analyst (Paul Weinstein) working for First Boston said of Cisco in March 2020.

""We humbly submit that over the next two to three years Cisco could be the first trillion dollar market cap company and don't think they woudln;'t love it"" As Weiensten put Cisco on a ""Strong Buy"" at virtually it's final HIGH! Three years later Cisco instead of doubling had collapsed to 1/10th it's March high!

INTEL's 2000 stock price high of $76 had the chip giant trading on an earnings multiple of 42 which is hardly exuberant in today's terms. Today Intel trades at $54 on a P/E of just 12. If intel was trading on par with that of its 2000 high then the stock price today would at $189. Which also suggests Intel has never managed to fully recover from the dot com bust mostly down to failure to innovate due to bad management hence for a good 6 years was stuck at 7nm whilst tiny competitors such as AMD have grabbed CPU market share. In recent years every time Intel dips below $48 I tend to buy a little who knows given it's low valuation a breakout above $76 may send Intel to the moon once more. And this is how the Intel stock price has faired over the past 21 years.

The EC ratio for Intel is just 10 which makes Intel in any era bull or bear dirt cheap! Look even if AMD is crushing it like a bug at an EC of 10 there really isn't much downside! Hence any dip is a buy op even if upside is going to take several years of INNOVATION!

I think you get the picture so I won't repeat the exercise for Oracle and IBM.

Tech Stocks in a Bubble today?

US GDP in 2000 was $10 trillion with Microsoft at 5.65% of US GDP today's largest stock is Apple on a market cap $2.4 trillion which is 10.5% of US GDP of $22.7 trillion!

Yep sorry to burst your bubble but we are in a bubble!

And remember I am not looking at the loss making junk stocks of that age but the tech giants. Hence why I de-risked by selling out of Nvidia Apple Microsoft and Amazon. Whilst I will cling onto Google at 50% and Facebook at 30% as they are the best of the best.

Amazon to the MOON 2021! Then what?

YES Apple Amazon Facebook Google and Nvidia all have highly compelling reasons for why they should all continue keep going to the MOON! But so did all of the tech giants in 2000!

And 20 years on only Microsoft eventually made it through to the other side to new all time highs. Imagine holding Intel in 2000 for which one had every reason to continue to hold just as there is every reason to hold Google Apple or Amazon today! And then look at what happened to the likes of Intel over the next 20 years! Where the stock price is STILL yet to trade to new highs! And this despite stock BUYBACKS!

As for Intel today well it is where Microsoft was about 5 years ago when everyone thought it was game over for Microsoft just as everyone thinks its game over for Intel today given that AMD has won! BUT I am pretty confident that we will be seeing Intel in the not too distant future leaving it's sleeping giant status and doing it's own moon shot.

So I hope this acts as a wake up call for my Patrons who think investing is just a case of dollar cost averaging as one really does need mechanisms to disinvest from over valued stocks even though it is is extremely hard to do so after all no one wanted to sell any of the tech giants in March 2000 given the amount of too the moon cool aid that was sloshing around at the time but within a few short months many wish they had!

For instance it was painful for me to hit the SELL button on Microsoft a stock that I have been accumulating from when it was trading in the $20's! With my intention to buy back some day soon but as what has happened to chinese stocks illustrates one just does not know what is around the corner that could trigger a collapse in stock prices by 50% or more to a level where most are then too afraid to buy.

So in a few months time we may be living in a completely different world where the likes of Microsoft Amazon and Apple after a plunge in price have most investors who were happy to pile in at all time highs with their dollar cost averaging mantra are then too scared to either buy or sell as they watch in fear stock market armageddon take place all whilst the MSM blogosFear and Youtubers reinforce their state of paralysis acting as echo chambers just regurgitating that which others have posted.

As for what I will be doing ? BUYING the PANIC! Even if I turn out to be early because during the mayhem most of the pieces of the puzzle will be unknown.

The brainchild behind the company’s success is Girish Mathrubootham -- the founder and CEO of Freshworks and his journey started with humble roots.



Hailing from Trichy

Rathnagirish Mathrubootham was born in March 1974 in a middle-class family. Son of a retired banker from the small town of Trichy in Tamil Nadu Girish started his schooling from Campion Anglo-Indian Higher Secondary School.

Coming from a broken family after his father divorced his mother when he was just 7 and remarried three years later left a strong emotional scar that made it difficult for him to understand relationships.

He later went on to complete his graduation in B.E - Electricals and Electronics from the Shanmugha Arts Science Technology and Research Academy in 1996 followed by a Masters In Business Administration from the University of Madras specializing in marketing.

Journey to his big break

Girish worked at a number of companies including HCL Cisco eForce AdventNetInc before he finally worked with the tech giant Zoho where he served as the Director and Vice President of Product Management.

While at Zoho a comment on HackerNews inspired him to start his own IT Helpdesk product in 2010 dubbed Freshdesk based out of a 700 feet warehouse in Chennai with his colleague Shan Krishnasamy.

Freshdesk to Freshworks

Freshdesk revolutionised the way customers interacted with the companies using social media. Freshdesk offers companies to address customer complaints across different channels allowing them to have information such as account details subscriptions or payment information in a quick-accessible manner.

It took eight years for the company’s revenue to touch $100 million. Soon after in 2017 the company rebranded to Freshworks and set up its headquarters in California with global offices in India Australia the UK and Germany.

The company today is worth Rs 95000 crore or $13 billion with over 50000 customers across the globe including major brands like Hugo Boss Honda Toshiba Cisco and others.

Next up are companies with sizable revenue from China also in the spotlight due to the nation’s ongoing regulatory clampdown. Industrial stocks are a key focus for US market watchers while those in Europe are looking at miners.

Fears that an Evergrande collapse might spark financial contagion and curb growth in the Chinese economy roiled global markets on Monday. That anxiety moderated after the developer agreed to settle some local note interest payments but the problem is far from over with dollar bond holders yet to receive a coupon due.

Here are some of the stocks and sectors in traders’ sights:

Property Peers

Evergrande’s size coupled with Beijing’s tighter scrutiny of the real-estate sector will continue to have a significant bearing on property developers. The company has about 2 trillion yuan ($310 billion) in assets -- equivalent to 2% of China’s gross domestic product according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. calculations so any disposals could well disrupt the market.

Regardless of what happens to Evergrande China’s home prices are now at risk of “meaningful downside"" Citigroup Inc. says.

The Hang Seng Property Index dropped to its lowest in five years earlier this month. The 12-member gauge include Country Garden Holdings Co. which lost 25% since March-end and China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. which fell 16%.

Lenders and Investors

Shares of companies that have lent money to or invested in Chinese real-estate firms will remain volatile as traders mull the potential for a spike in bad loans and asset write-downs.

While policy makers are expected to provide support some banks may become victims Citigroup analysts including Judy Zhang wrote in a note on Wednesday.

Citi’s analysis of Chinese banks’ loan exposure to high-risk developers suggests credit risk is highest for China Minsheng Banking Corp. Ping An Bank Co. and China Everbright Bank Co. It sees Bank of Nanjing Co. Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank Co. and Postal Savings Bank of China Co. as less vulnerable.

China Banks Downplay Risks After Evergrande Missed Payments

While Chinese insurers have factored in concerns about potential impairment losses PICC Group’s enterprise value would be hit most among mainland-listed insurance companies in a worst case scenario. That’s followed by Ping An Insurance Group Co. according to Citi’s Michelle Ma in a note on Thursday.

Asian Suppliers

Suppliers of building materials and appliances to Evergrande’s projects will be closely scrutinized to assess how much the indebted property developer owes them and what its rise and fall may mean for recurring earnings.

Shares of Evergrande units such as Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd. -- which have halved this year -- and China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd. -- which are down over 90% -- also remain on watch.

U.S. Industrials

Any restructuring that weighs on the world’s second-largest economy will have ripple effects through the most economically-sensitive and globalized stocks in America. Industrial firms often seen as bellwethers for the U.S. economy’s health may take the hardest hit.

U.S. industrial manufacturers have an around 10% of sales exposure to China according to estimates from JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Stephen Tusa. Stocks to watch include General Electric Co. Otis Worldwide Corp. and Honeywell International Inc. as well as heavy construction and equipment maker Caterpillar Inc.

European Miners

In Europe Evergrande’s crisis is reverberating across the basic materials stocks.

China accounts for 62% of revenue at BHP Group Plc. 58% at Rio Tinto Plc and nearly half at Anglo American Plc and Glencore Plc according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Cement makers like HeidelbergCement AG as well as building suppliers including Kone OYJ and Schindler Holding AG may be directly affected by the Evergrande fallout according to strategists at Liberum.

He's been selling the same cold beer at the ballpark for years. But even after five decades as a vendor with the Philadelphia Phillies John Culin says it never gets old.

He's been selling the same cold beer at the ballpark for years. But even after five decades as a vendor with the Philadelphia Phillies John Culin says it never gets old.

PHILADELPHIA Pennsylvania -- When 16-year-old John Culin chose a part-time job he certainly hit a home run.

""I've been working as a vendor since 1971 so this is year 50 for me"" he said.

Culin 66 started selling hot dogs during Veterans Stadium's inaugural year. Now the Aramark vendor is strolling down the aisles with cold beer at Citizens Bank Park.

""If I thought of this as a job I probably would not have lasted this long"" he said.

Culin also has fond memories working at various concerts selling at the All-Star game in 2004 and working at the Live Aid benefit concert in 1985. While working at the Vet he used to befriend the wives of various Phillies players who sat behind home plate.

And even though he loves working in the beautiful Citizens Bank Park he jokes that walking up and down the aisles was easier at its predecessor.

""As much as I like this stadium the steps at the Vet were better"" he said. ""These steps are three feet long so you have to take two steps on every one.""

Still with each step comes the opportunity to make a sale and interact with loyal Phillies fans.

""I don't care what people in the newspapers and all say about Phillies fans the Phillies fans that I run into are the best people in the world"" said Culin.

A baseball fan at heart Culin was disappointed when fans were prohibited from attending games during the COVID-19 pandemic. But he remained faithful that he would place cold beers in the hands of fans once again.

""This past June when we got the call to come back was the best news I've received in a long long time.""

When he's not working at the ballpark Culin is an insurance adjuster. He hopes to continue enjoying ball games and working alongside his family of Aramark employees for a few more years to come.

Global Citizen Live represents a call to action to end extreme poverty and build momentum ahead of the G20 Summit in October and UN Climate Conference COP26 in November.

The campaign calls on world leaders businesses and philanthropists to urgently commit resources to: meet the $15-20 billion funding shortfall of the $100 billion promised annually to the most vulnerable countries confronting climate change; businesses to help curb emissions through joining the Race to Zero campaign and pledging 1 billion additional trees by 2022 in support of the 1t.org ambition to conserve restore and grow 1 trillion trees this decade; $6 billion to provide food to 41 million people facing famine; 2 billion COVID-19 vaccines to be redistributed to low-income countries by early 2022; and for Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna to share mRNA technology with the WHO-backed Africa mRNA vaccine hub.

More than US$1.1 billion 157 million trees and over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines were announced during Global Citizen Live thanks to partnerships between government philanthropy non-governmental organizations and the private sector.

Global Citizen Live featured a remarkable lineup of world leaders advocates and artists supporting the campaign and its mission to end extreme poverty. Across seven continents tens of thousands of Global Citizens were in attendance over 24 hours as millions streamed the live broadcast event globally.

As a result of the hard work of many partner organizations the Global Citizen Live campaign announced:

157 million trees including 77 million trees by 2022; and more than US$300M to defend the planet

“Quite rightly future generations will hold us responsible. So join me and with one loud and united global voice call on the biggest greenhouse gas emitters — the G20 group of nations — to make much bolder commitments to cut emissions"" COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma told the audience during the New York event. “Call on the richest countries to make good on their promise of money to support developing countries deal with the impacts of climate change and call on world leaders to deliver an outcome at Glasgow we can all be proud of.”

Over US$800 million to defeat poverty and address hunger crises.

“Shame on us. At the height of COVID-19 the billionaires’ average net worth increase per day was $5 billion. And yet I am begging to feed the poor! Shame on us ... If we do not act today millions will starve nations will destabilize and millions will migrate by necessity"" said World Food Programme Executive Director David Beasley. ""If we are struggling today with a population of over 7 billion what do you expect will happen when there are over 10 billion people on earth by 2050? And by 2050 due to climate change we anticipate over 1 billion people to be displaced around the world! Wake up New York. Wake up Planet Earth.""

Over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines for those most in need.

“We have what we need to vaccinate the world. But the experts told us here’s what’s getting in the way: They said many countries are ready to produce vaccines at home. Yet they aren’t allowed to because ultra-wealthy pharmaceutical companies are not sharing the recipes to make them. These countries have the means ability and the workers to start manufacturing. All they are waiting for is the vaccine intellectual property to be transferred over” said Prince Harry The Duke of Sussex during the New York show.

“Every single person on this planet has a fundamental right to get this vaccine. That’s the point — yet that’s not happening. While in this country (and many others) you can go almost anywhere and get vaccinated billions around the world cannot. This year the world is expected to produce enough doses to meet the target of vaccinating 70% of people in every single country. But it is wrong that so much of the vaccine supply has only gone to just 10 wealthy nations so far and not everyone else” said Meghan The Duchess of Sussex.

Announcements were made by the European Commission the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) Belgium Colombia Croatia the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) France Germany Ireland Luxembourg the Netherlands Norway Spain United States UNESCO the Green Climate Fund and the Paris Peace Forum.

Global Citizen Live also saw announcements from the US states of Hawaii and Washington; the Brazilian states of Amapá Amazonas Ceará Piauí Pará and Paraíba; the City of Paris France; the municipality of Asker Norway; and 43 cities in Maharashtra State India.

Financial and in-kind announcements were also made by many corporate and philanthropic partners including Accelerit Technologies Aspiration Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Capgemini The Charles Stewart Mott Foundation The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) Duolingo The ELMA Vaccines & Immunization Foundation Global Solidarity Fund Leaders in Motion Academy The LEGO Foundation Private Foundation Rotary International Salesforce Mastercard Namati PepsiCo The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation World Wide Technology and Zendesk.

P&G Stanley Black & Decker and Starbucks.

Global Citizen also worked with existing Race to Zero members to join the campaign’s Climate Coalition to encourage others to sign on to the Race to Zero ahead of COP26. Climate Coalition members include: Amazon Bayer AG Boston Consulting Group Capgemini Dentsu International DocuSign HP Inc. Intuit Lendlease P&G RELX Salesforce Schneider Electric Uber Unilever Walmart Inc. and Zurich Insurance Group.

Global Citizen presented Global Citizen Live a 24-hour global broadcast and streaming event featuring an extraordinary lineup of artists and performances from all over the world including: Lagos Paris New York City London Sydney Seoul Rio de Janeiro Los Angeles and Mumbai.

The 24-hour live broadcast event aired globally on ABC BBC FX iHeartRadio YouTube Twitter and other platforms to millions of viewers around the world. On-site safety and precautionary measures including mask-wearing social distancing and proof of vaccination were taken as part of all events which were attended in person by Global Citizen activists from around the world.

In the lead up to Global Citizen Live Global Citizen called on action takers to demand that the world's wealthiest nations redistribute 1 billion vaccine doses urgently this year and 1 billion more by early 2022; support the proposal to waive intellectual property rights on the production of COVID-19 vaccines and other medical tools backed by over 100 countries; and call on Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna to share mRNA technology with a new WHO-backed mRNA technology transfer hub based in South Africa.

Global Citizen also called on countries around the world to reduce fair share national emissions to prevent more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming and for developed nations to deliver on their promise to provide $100 billion annually to address the climate needs of developing countries. G7 nations and billionaires were also called on by Global Citizen and its partners to end the hunger crisis by contributing at least $6 billion for the urgent provision of millions of meals for 41 million people on the brink of famine.

Global Citizen Live represents an ongoing campaign led by citizens around the world to take action to urge governments corporations and philanthropists to make urgent change in line with the United Nations’ Global Goals and the Global Citizen Recovery Plan for the World.

“Global Citizen Live is not a celebration but an urgent call to action” said Mick Sheldrick co-founder and Chief Policy and Government Affairs Officer at Global Citizen. “We’re campaigning hard to get the world on track to end extreme poverty calling on world leaders to step-up at the G20 and COP26 summits. Global Citizen Live is the beginning of a month-long countdown!”

Global Citizen Live highlighted the efforts and announcements of 67 governments six philanthropic foundations and 40 corporate partners alongside global advocates and campaigners. Among millions of Global Citizens stood key global leaders partners and advocates at the forefront of Global Citizen’s mission to end extreme poverty: UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed Executive Director of the World Food Programme David Beasley CEO of Namati Vivek Maru Rotary President-elect Jennifer Jones Global Goals Champion and Advocate Eddie Ndopu President of the Ford Foundation Darren Walker President of the Paris Peace Forum Steering Committee Trisha Shetty Hip Hop Caucus President and CEO Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr. UN Next Generation fellow Valeria Colunga advocate Eunice Akoth and more.

“A Global Citizen is aware of the fact that we all share one planet one health one common destiny — and that every one of us matters” said Ursula von der Leyen president of the European Commission in support of the campaign. “Everyone can make a difference by working together finding global solutions to global problems with unity cooperation and solidarity.”

As leaders step up to curb emissions combat climate change and defend the planet at Global Citizen Live more ambition is needed ahead of the COP26 Climate Summit.

Global Citizen and its Race to Zero partners worked to secure commitments from many of the world’s largest companies and cities to develop verified science-based targets to reach net zero emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.

Corporate partners and cities signed up to the Race to Zero initiative a science-based campaign to drive climate targets in line with the Paris Agreement. Global Citizen Live saw 13 companies valued at $1.3 trillion in market capital join the Race to Zero initiative. New signers include five Fortune 100 companies the largest consumer goods company in the world the largest tool maker in the world and the largest hotel group in the world.

Private sector organizations that officially signed on to the Race to Zero as a part of the Global Citizen Live campaign include: Akamai Technologies American Express BD (Becton Dickinson and Company) Boston Scientific Corporation Cisco Delta Air Lines DocuSign IHG Hotels and Resorts Marriott International Inc. P&G Stanley Black & Decker and Starbucks who have each signed on to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5 and Citi which joined the Race to Zero via the Net Zero Banking Alliance.

Global Citizen also worked with existing Race to Zero members to join the campaign’s Climate Coalition aimed at encouraging peers vendors and partners to sign on to the Race to Zero ahead of COP26. Climate Coalition members include Amazon Bayer AG Boston Consulting Group Capgemini Dentsu International DocuSign HP Inc. Intuit Lendlease P&G RELX Salesforce Schneider Electric Uber Unilever Walmart Inc. and Zurich Insurance Group.

""Urgent and widespread climate action is vital to unlock the pace and scale of decarbonization required by science. Every nation company and individual must play their part. This innovative collaboration with Global Citizen has delivered additional major US businesses to our campaign for the world's most ambitious climate leaders. With just one month until the milestone climate conference COP26 we are now calling on more companies worldwide to join Business Ambition for 1.5 degrees Celsius and play their role in delivering bold climate action to halve global emissions by 2030"" said Tom Dowdall Science Based Targets Initiative Campaign Lead.

While Global Citizen has been in contact with hundreds of companies to sign on to Race to Zero many of the world’s largest companies and top emitters failed to respond to Global Citizen’s outreach after several attempts. These companies must step up to sign on to control their emissions and protect the planet now not later. Global Citizens will continue to campaign and call on these companies to join Race to Zero by COP26 in November this year.

Global Citizen also worked with American Forests and 1t.org to ensure a sustainable climate and a nature-positive planet by conserving restoring and growing trees supporting the global movement to save and restore 1 trillion trees by 2030. A total of 157 million trees will be protected and restored by 2030 including 77 million by the end of 2022.

Global Citizen Live received support from 12 members of the United States Congress calling for legislative measures to meet the goal of 100 million trees being protected conserved and planted in cities across America by 2030 including: Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) Rep. Nanette Barragán (CA-44) Rep. Donald McEachin (VA-4) Rep. Chellie Pingree (ME-1) Rep. Marcy Kaptur (OH-9) and Rep. Jimmy Panetta (CA-20).

Mayors governors and sub-national representatives also showed their support from around the world including: Lene Conradi Mayor of Asker Kommune Norway; Hilary Franz Commissioner of Public Lands Washington; David Ige Governor Hawaii; Anne Hidalgo Mayor Paris; and the Brazilian governors of Amapá (Waldez Góes) Amazonas (Wilson Miranda Lima) Ceará (Camilo Santana) Pará (Helder Barbalho) Paraíba (João Azevêdo) and Piauí (Wellington Dias).

""The protection of the wild is a major task of our generation. Global Citizens have called on leaders to take decisive steps in the right direction. We commend the Brazilian governors of Amapá Amazonas Ceará Pará Paraiba and Piauí for their commitments to environmental protection and strong climate actions"" said Rodrigo Medeiros of Re:Wild.

On Aug. 23 and in support of local advocates Coldplay invited eight Brazilian governors to join Global Citizen at Global Citizen Live in September to pledge to protect critical natural resources throughout their regions. Governors made announcements from across Brazil including six states from the Amazon at the front lines of climate change. The Brazilian states announced plans to reduce emissions increase the number of protected areas and create state-wide climate mitigation and adaptation plans.

Thank you for joining us at #GlobalCitizenLive@AminaJMohammed as we join in unity to defend the planet and defeat poverty! We greatly value our partnership with you and the @UNhttps://t.co/jc4IQFI78Dpic.twitter.com/O8rzPzLb4u — Hugh Evans (@Hughcevans) September 25 2021

This weekend’s announcements build on earlier commitments over the last 18 months as part of the Trillion Trees Campaign. Global Citizen Live celebrates the global 1t.org community for its commitment to conserve restore and grow trees including the following organizations with existing 1t.org pledges contributing to the trillion tree ambition by 2030: Amazon Aspiration AstraZeneca Clif Bar & Company HP Inc. Iberdrola Jonas Philanthropies Trees for Climate Health Initiative Nestlé Pottery Barn SAP SE tentree Travelers Unilever UPS and VMWare.

“It is inspiring to see the world’s largest companies governments and individuals of all ages unite to make ambitious commitments to protect and restore our planet. 1t.org’s collaboration with Global Citizen Live to scale investments in our trees and forests will be an integral part of the solution in tackling pressing ecological and societal challenges” said Nicole Schwab Co-Head of Nature-Based Solutions at the World Economic Forum. “Global Citizen Live shows that collective action at a global scale is possible.”

Leaders make commitments toward $100 billion climate promise but at least $15 billion shortfall remains ahead of COP26.

During UNGA leaders made commitments in support of honoring their promise to provide vulnerable countries with $100 billion annually to respond to climate change. During his UNGA address President Joe Biden announced that the US will increase its climate aid commitment to $11.4 billion by 2024. Despite being a step in the right direction this is still far less than what is contributed by the EU according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute. The G20 must keep their promise to provide an additional $100 billion annually to protect vulnerable nations from climate change. We have five weeks in order to meet this promise.

""The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how strongly the health of one person depends on the behaviour of the other. We need decisive action and solidarity both on individual and societal levels to leave the COVID-19 pandemic behind us. Today at Global Citizen Live I join Global Citizen's calls for more vaccine equity and a stronger commitment to an encompassing solution of the pandemic that is sensitive to the capacities and needs of different countries. I thank all Global Citizens for advocating and strongly supporting the work of WHO “ said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Director-General of World Health Organization.

During the Global Citizen Live campaign Italy committed to substantially increase its climate financing in the run-up to COP 26. Global Citizen will hold them accountable to this commitment.

From New York The Green Climate Fund supporting developing countries to reduce emissions and build resilience announced they would be accelerating the delivery of over $1.2 billion in the coming months.

Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez during his UNGA address and in response to a tweet from Coldplay announced €30 million for the Adaptation Fund an international fund that finances projects and programs aimed at helping developing countries to adapt to the harmful effects of climate change albeit much more is needed for Spain to meet its fair share.

Meanwhile both Denmark and Norway affirmed their commitments to significantly increase their climate financing commitments said Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen declaring:

“Denmark will contribute 1% of the collective target of $100 billion. And 60% of our climate aid will help developing countries adapt to climate change. If we can — G20 can! Let’s send a message to the G20 that cannot be misunderstood: Do not come empty-handed to Glasgow” said Frederiksen.

CODE RED. It’s no secret that the climate crisis is here & it’s a massive threat to our planet. The US has an opportunity to lead the world to a sustainable future. It starts with the #BuildBackBetter act. Join me alongside @GlblCtzn to take action to support. #CodeRedCongresspic.twitter.com/mRPVqeUJOt — Rachel Brosnahan (@RachelBros) September 24 2021

Global Citizen believes that Austria Australia Portugal Spain and Italy should also increase their contributions toward meeting the $100 billion pledge. We are grateful to ODI and Sarah Colenbrander for their analysis and support through the Global Citizen Live campaign. Global Citizen is urging US citizens to contact their local member of congress. The United States must live up to its promise.

Global Citizen Live calls code red for Congress and urges the United States Congress to pass most consequential climate legislation in US history.

“We have the chance to make history soon when Congress could pass essential climate legislation through the Build Back Better Act... We need a true groundswell of public support to show Congress that this critical legislation must pass without getting watered down” said Hip Hop Caucus President and CEO Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr.

Over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines pledged at Global Citizen Live in a step toward vaccine equity but too little too late as huge gap remains.

Inequitable vaccine distribution has left millions of vulnerable communities unprotected and reversed decades of progress against other infectious diseases and the broader Global Goals for Sustainable Development. To end this pandemic we must make the COVID-19 vaccines available to all everywhere. Global Citizen Live is grateful for its partnership with the ACT Accelerator the Pandemic Action Network the ONE Campaign and others in the collective effort to address vaccine inequity and injustice.

Extraordinary action is needed in the fight against COVID-19 and world leaders are uniquely positioned to enable a global recovery by ensuring everyone has access to life-saving vaccines tests and treatments. On Sept. 22 US President Biden convened world leaders to commit to vaccinate at least 70% of people in every country by this time next year to break the chain of transmission and end the pandemic. But more than promises are needed; without action the virus and its mutations will continue to threaten us all and undermine the global economy.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield took to the Global Citizen Live stage to reiterate the call for everyone to have access to COVID-19 vaccines especially vulnerable refugees whose circumstances have been further impacted by the pandemic. Global Citizen welcomes US leadership to galvanize efforts to vaccinate at least 70% of people in all countries by September 2022 but hopes to see this promise met by comprehensive action from the US. This includes sharing all excess and unused doses in hand or on order for 2021 as soon as possible providing funding and support to help lower income countries get doses from tarmac and into arms and critically by actively promoting an intellectual property waiver at the World Trade Organization and pushing pharma companies to share mRNA vaccine technology with Africa and other lower-income regions.

More than 60 million COVID-19 vaccines to be shared with countries in need were announced through Global Citizen Live. However the world must step up to redistribute a total of 2 billion vaccines by early 2022. In advance of Global Citizen Live Prime Minister Sanchez’s UNGA announced 7.5 million new vaccine doses and €2 million for UNITAID at Global Citizen Live. Taoiseach Micheál Martin confirmed 1.3 million COVID-19 vaccine doses primarily through COVAX on behalf of Ireland. This is Ireland's first dose sharing commitment to date and represents one dose for every five Irish citizens.

Croatia also stepped up announcing another 200000 COVID-19 vaccine doses primarily through COVAX following a €500000 and 50000 dose pledge to COVAX made at Global Citizen’s VAX LIVE in May.

""In the global fight against COVID-19 we need commitments to be matched with action. We thank Global Citizens for their tireless advocacy to support vaccine equity and we thank the governments of Croatia Ireland and France for their substantial vaccine donations during Global Citizen Live. This pandemic is the great public health challenge of our time and we urgently need to unlock more vaccine doses to ensure that the most vulnerable in our global village are protected.

Pa. on Sept. 11 2021. Read more

If the Phillies are to push their way into the postseason they’ll have to do it without one of their key relievers as an oblique injury will keep Archie Bradley out for the remainder of the regular season.

Bradley who is one of Joe Girardi’s preferred high-leverage relievers felt discomfort in his side after pitching on Thursday night. A similar injury put him on the injured list earlier this season for five weeks but Bradley hopes to return next month if the Phillies reach the postseason.

“It’s the toughest thing as a player to go in and talk about something being wrong because you want to play and you don’t want something to be wrong” Bradley said Saturday afternoon. “But when you feel something you have to be honest. And so I went in got looked at this morning and there’s definitely some stuff going on. It didn’t feel as bad but it was like man this reminded me a lot of what I felt earlier this year.”

Without Bradley Girardi’s high-leverage options appear to be closer Ian Kennedy Hector Neris and José Alvarado. Sam Coonrod another option is dealing with a thumb injury that the team hopes he can pitch through and Connor Brogdon is on the injured list until at least Tuesday.

Cam Bedrosian struggled Friday in a big spot and Bailey Falter has never pitched on back-to-back days. Ramón Rosso a seldom-used low-leverage reliever could be asked to pitch late innings. With a week left in the season the options are slimming

Bradley finished the season with a 4.34 ERA and 7.1 strikeouts per nine innings both of which were the worst marks of his career since moving in 2017 to the bullpen. But he seemed to be finding a groove as seven of his last eight appearances were scoreless.

“I’m not afraid to speak honestly. Not only us making the playoffs but I’m a free agent at the end of the year. All that plays into my head” Bradley said. “But I was very close to not saying something and trying to pitch through it. But then it’s like ‘Man what if I hurt it worse what if really one two or three days could be the rest I needed?’ And then obviously getting it looked at it was worse than I think we all thought it was. If there was any chance of me being able to pitch through it I would definitely be doing that. It’s just not really an option at this point right now and so the plan is do everything we can to rest it and heal it and try to be ready to pitch in the playoffs.”

Oblique injuries tend to linger so it’s probably optimistic to count on Bradley for the postseason. If the Phillies win the division their first game would be Oct. 8 less than two weeks after Bradley was placed on the injured list. Bradley does plan on travelling with the team for the final six games in Atlanta and Miami.

“I bring energy. There’s a lot I do inside the clubhouse that helps us get ready to play” Bradley said. “I’m not dead. I’m hurt you know? Don’t get me wrong I’m bummed I’m pissed but at the same time the Phillies have to go beat the Pirates today. And so I’m going to continue my rehab but also continue to be the leader of this team. Not the leader but a leader on this team and continue to push these guys. We still have a chance to go win. That’s the only way I pitch again this year is if we go win. I want that for both of us.”

The Phillies will need to add relief pitching again this offseason and Bradley 29 said he is open to returning next season.

“I would love to come back here. I loved it here. I loved everything about it. I loved the guys” Bradley said. “I think when you look at it from a professional standpoint the core group of guys is here. You look at the rotation coming back next year. The core position players are here. I still consider myself a high-leverage reliever that has more to prove and better days to pitch ahead of him. Not that I pitched bad. I know I am capable of being better.”

“I hope we do make the playoffs. But I felt like this group of guys came together this year. We started something. You don’t get a chance very often to look at the next couple of years and think you can really truly compete. You look at the groups of the Utleys and Rollins and Howards. I think we have a group like that here. If we can keep some guys together and maybe bring me back it would be really cool.”

Extra bases

The Phillies placed Matt Moore on the 60-day injured list to make room for Kyle Dohy on the 40-man roster. ... Matt Vierling started in center and batted leadoff as Odubel Herrera was held out by a sore right ankle. ... Adonis Medina is the leading candidate to start Sunday’s bullpen game against Pirates right-hander Max Kranick who is from Lackawanna County."

Akuna has been trading cryptocurrency since 2017 with teams trading spot futures and options.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2EzNTA0MzVjLTc0MDAtNGJkNi1iMzYwLWVlYjc1ZmFhNmIzY9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Traders take up derivatives tied to Libor replacement,"Print this page

Lenders have been slow to adopt the official substitute for the scandal-tarred Libor interest-rate benchmark but derivatives traders are now giving it an enthusiastic welcome.

Action in futures options and swaps markets tied to the new secured overnight financing rate — Sofr — has shot up since the summer. These derivatives enable users to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates.

Industry representatives picked Sofr in 2017 as an alternative to the London interbank offered rate or Libor the borrowing benchmark that was tarnished by a rate collusion scheme. Banks will be barred from underwriting new loans using Libor starting in 2022.

Shifting market participants off US dollar Libor the biggest and most important Libor rate has been slow in part because Sofr had not been market-tested. The first Sofr-backed leveraged loan was not offered until earlier this month more than three years after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began to publish the rate.

By comparison the use of Sofr-linked derivatives is perking up. Last week $240bn of US dollar interest rate swaps based on Sofr were traded equivalent to about 13.5 per cent of the total dollar Libor and Sofr market according to data from the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. In June Sofr-linked swaps accounted for only about 3 per cent of the market.

Volumes increased in part because of a regulatory initiative from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission in July called Sofr First aimed at the derivatives market. The programme switched derivatives pricing on some traders’ screens from Libor to Sofr.

“[Sofr First] was a big deal in terms of driving Sofr volumes across the Street. It’s more specific to swaps but it no doubt has also generated more hedging activity in futures” said Mark Cabana head of US rates strategy at Bank of America.

At CME Group the biggest US futures exchange operator the number of outstanding contracts in listed derivatives based on Sofr has risen 90 per cent since the start of the year.

“The market has made far more progress in adopting Sofr and is much larger than we appreciate” said Sean Tully CME’s head of financial and over-the-counter products. “In the lending and the cash markets it is taking a bit longer. But in the derivatives markets much more has happened.”

Libor is based on the interest rate at which banks say they would lend to other banks. Sofr is based on market transactions and represents the overnight cost to borrow cash backed by US Treasury debt.

While Sofr may become popular in derivatives markets its uptake in the loan market is not assured. Cabana said that bank lenders as well as some companies had indicated they didn’t believe Sofr was well suited for them.

Unlike Sofr credit risks are incorporated into Libor. When the risk associated with lending money increases during bouts of market volatility Libor rises while Sofr moves less. Banks could therefore face the prospect of lending money at a steady Sofr rate while their own funding costs which are linked to credit risk are rising.

“We believe we are going to be in a multi-reference rate environment where Sofr will initially be dominant but the persistence of that dominance is unclear to me” Cabana said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxwZ2EuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9hY2UtZm9yLW5hc2EtaGF0YW9rYS1hZ2FpbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ace for Nasa Hataoka Again,"For those that missed Nasa Hataoka’s ace on No. 11 at the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship on Friday don’t worry. She did it again.

On Saturday Hataoka found the bottom of the cup on No. 6 from 175 yards with a 5-iron for her fourth-career ace since 2018. She became just the fifth player in LPGA Tour history to make two aces in one tournament - the first since Ayako Uehara at the 2016 CP Women’s Open - and is the fourth to do it in back-to-back rounds. Hataoka is also the fourth player to have at least two aces in two different seasons joining Betsy King (2 1979 and 2 1990) Meg Mallon (2 1999 and 2 2001) and Charlotta Sorenstam (2 2001 and 3 2002).

“When I hit the ball it felt really good. It went the way it was supposed to go. Though I never suspect it would be a hole-in-one it was amazing” said Hataoka. “[Recording two aces] is obviously something that's not able to be done so easily so I really really feel proud of it.”

Jennifer Kupcho who played alongside Hataoka the first two days at Pinnacle Country Club witnessed the memorable aces from Nasa and was quite impressed. “It's pretty cool. I don't think many people have done that” said Kupcho who currently sits at 9-under after going 67-66 on Friday and Saturday. “I have never witnessed one and to witness two in two days is really cool. Super excited for her.”

Hataoka who won the 2018 Walmart NW Arkansas Championship to become a Rolex First-Time Winner is now tied for the 36-hole lead heading into the final day with major champion Minjee Lee. She set the tournament scoring record of -21 in her victory and said it’ll take a low score like that to end Sunday on top once again.

“When I won it was the best score of the tournament so although it is very hard to go for it I think I'll just aim for that and try to go for the win” said Hataoka who has already earned a victory in 2021 at the rain-shortened Marathon LPGA Classic.

For the hole-in-one CME Group will donate another $20000 to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital which is leading the way the world understands treats and defeats childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. The 2021 season has now seen 15 aces for a total of $300000 donated to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZkaWdlc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L2xwZ2EtaG9sZS1pbi1vbmUtbmFzYS1oYXRhb2th0gFCaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29sZmRpZ2VzdC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbHBnYS1ob2xlLWluLW9uZS1uYXNhLWhhdGFva2EvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nasa Hataoka makes two holes-in-one at LPGA event becomes fifth player to do so,It's safe to say that Nasa Hataoka is liking the par 3s at the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship.

He chugged a 1.5-liter bottle of Coca-Cola to hydrate due to hot weather and had a fatal gas buildup the New York Post said.

About six hours after ingesting that massive amount of soda he experienced symptoms that included a swollen stomach and severe pain and was rushed to a Beijing hospital.

Although the man had no underlying health issues doctors discovered he had an elevated heart rate rapid breathing and low blood pressure. A CT scan then determined atypical levels in both his intestinal walls and the portal vein that supplies the liver with blood.

“This in turn had reportedly caused him to suffer a hepatic ischemia otherwise known as ‘shock liver’ which is caused by a lack of oxygen to the organ” The New York Post notes.

Staff tried to remedy the problem by releasing gas from the digestive system and administering medication but they were unsuccessful and the man died 18 hours later.

According to Professor Nathan Davies a biochemist at University College London the official cause of death is unknown. Still it's highly improbable that it was due to a Coca-Cola overdose.

He suggests that the man could have died of a bacterial infection instead.

“These bacteria could’ve formed a pocket of gas in the intestinal wall which then leaked into other parts of the body such as the portal vein” he told the New York Post.

More research will be done to determine the exact cause of death.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3N0YXRlc3ZpbGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NvY2EtY29sYS13aXRoLWNvZmZlZS1pcy1wcmV0dHktZ29vZC1jb21iaW5hdGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlX2E2ZDBkZGMwLTFiY2MtMTFlYy1iYzZkLTNmNWE3OTcwNzk1ZC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca-Cola with coffee is pretty good combination,"While strolling the aisles of the friendly Food Lion grocery on Old Mountain Road recently I noticed that the Coca-Cola folks have a new line of beverages: Coca-Colas infused with coffee.

Not only that but the new carbonated beverage comes in three flavors. There’s vanilla caramel and dark blend each 12 fluid ounces (355 mL) and 70 calories per can. I checked the ingredients label. “Powdered coffee from Brazilian coffee beans” it read.

These three flavors have double the caffeine of your regular Coca-Cola. Normal “classic” Coke has 2.85 mg of caffeine per ounce while the new Coca-Cola with Coffee boosts that to 5.75 mg per ounce. That ought to get you up and running in the morning and the old ticker ticking.

Curiously I hadn’t seen any print or televised advertisements for this new line of Coke products. Doing research on the internet I discovered that the new Coke products apparently debuted in January 2021. I have heard from an anonymous source that these new Coke products were successfully tried out in Europe.

I have never mixed regular classic Coca-Cola with coffee or even thought of doing so but I was willing to make an impulse purchase of the three and give this new beverage a try for you dear reader. I like coffee and I like Coca-Cola. You’d think that two “good” things would always go well together.

However this reminds me of what I have dubbed “The Shrimp Ice Cream Paradox.” Stay with me. I like to eat shrimp boiled or fried. I also like most flavors of ice cream. But shrimp ice cream? No thank you. I have trouble even imagining what that might taste like.

Anyway as I said I bought single cans of the vanilla caramel and dark blend flavors at $1.79 each plus tax.

Thankfully Coke’s new creation did not go anywhere near the shrimp-flavored ice cream scenario. I tried the vanilla-flavored one first. It had a pleasing taste like a vanilla Coca-Cola. Honestly I could not distinguish the taste of coffee. I liked the caramel coffee-infused Coke even more than the vanilla-flavored one.

Finally I tried the “dark blend.” Even better. This drink would make a fine float with a scoop of DeLuxe vanilla ice cream in it.

You have to admire the Coke people for trying something new in the so-called “Cola Wars” with their main competitor Pepsi Cola.*

The Coca-Cola people have not always been successful with their innovations. Remember the “New Coke?” It came out in 1985 was renamed “Coke II” in 1992 — I would have gone for “Son of Coke” as its name — and then was dropped from their product lineup in 2002.

Some of you may recall “Tab” also a Coke product and the company’s first diet soft drink. It debuted in 1963 but was discontinued in 2020. Most people who drank Tab seem to have preferred the taste of “Diet Coke” which came later. You never know what will catch on and what will not.

I have a suggestion: If the Coke-flavored-with-coffee beverages this trifecta of tastiness does not go over well someone perhaps the people at Folgers or Chase & Sanborn or Starbucks could always try coffee flavored with Coca-Cola.

It might be worth a try. And for proposing this I think whoever runs with it should fork over to me 10 percent of the gross profits. I’ll settle for five; I’m a reasonable man.

KeNiuLe Dairy Co Ltd a joint venture between the global beverage giant The Coca-Cola Company and China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited launched its first brand in the chilled milk market in the country to tap the fast-growing sector as health-conscious Chinese consumers have increased demands for nutritious products.

The new product Fairlife is expected to bring three new high content nutrition milk products: whole white milk low fat white milk and chocolate milk. These milk products use ultrafiltration which is an internationally patented technology that retains more nutrients in raw milk and removes some ingredients such as lactose offering multiple benefits including high protein content high calcium content zero lactose and a longer shelf life (28 days) according to the company. For example Fairlife said every 100 grams of its product contains 5.3 grams of high-protein while the average level of chilled milk products is about 3 grams.

The joint venture was established in 2020 and has built a modern dairy plant in Bengbu East China's Anhui province.

The introduction of Fairlife a wholly owned subsidiary of the Coca-Cola Company has based on its good sales records and penetrations in many oversea markets. According to the Coca-Cola Company the sales and household penetration across the North America market has grown consistently with strong double-digit growth each year since launch. Fairlife is on track to achieve $1 billion in annual retail sales in North America in 2021.

The move also signals the global beverage producer's debut in the dairy sector in the country.

""Adding Fairlife to our growing portfolio here in China is an important step for Coca-Cola China to accelerate its transformation into a total beverage company to meet the diverse needs of Chinese consumers"" said Vamsi Mohan Thati president of Coca-Cola Greater China and Mongolia.

""We are committed to introducing more high-quality product choices for Chinese consumers and to contributing to the realization of the Healthy China 2030 goal.""

By partnering with Mengniu to establish the joint venture KeNiuLe the firm hopes it will make full use of the advantages of both parties including dairy development and processing techniques brand influence supply chain and distribution channels said the president.

Meanwhile the new dairy product is part of Mengniu's efforts to bring more advanced and diversified nutrition products to Chinese consumers though gathering high-quality resources from the world said Lu Minfang president of Mengniu Group.

""Fairlife will fill the gap of the Chinese dairy market and create infinite possibilities in the category of chilled milk"" he said. Currently chilled fresh milk – Shiny Meadow -- is considered a strong driver for Mengniu's revenue growths with the sector increasing rate reaching 120 percent according to its fiscal interim report this year.

Speaking on the prospects of the chilled milk market Thati who took office as president in 2020 is confident of the steady growth of the value-added dairy market.

""China has a very large dairy market... We believe there is always an opportunity to provide people with more choices especially those who are looking for dairy-based products of great taste and strong nutrition"" the president said.

The company is planning to introduce more Fairlife product options in China based on responses from the market said Thati.

A series of innovative dairy categories boosted by new technology have been rolled out including fresh milk cheese and yogurt with market shares and nutrition levels continuously upgraded said Chen Junshi chief adviser of the China National Center for Food Safety Risk Assessment.

He added the new ultrafiltration technology used by Fairlife and KeNiule is paving away for more nutritious milk products to be developed in China.

According to data from China Dairy Conference this year the per capita consumption of dairy products in China was 38.3 kilograms last year a rise of 20 percent than that of 2015 driven mostly by rapidly-growing demand for chilled fresh milk and cheese categories.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbnRoYWlsYW5kLmNvbS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLzQwMDA2NjU20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,[Weekender] Metaverse: the new gold rush,"Earlier this month Coca-Cola Korea also opened “Coca-Cola Wonderful Island” on metaverse platform Gather Town -- a virtual space where users can experience the company’s latest plastic recycling campaign.



When users visit a place known as “Coca-Cola Factory” they can see the process of how plastic bottles are turned into cooler bags.



“We came up with the Wonderful Campaign to raise awareness of the value of transparent plastic bottles which are high quality resources and allow consumers to experience the process of resource circulation and its positive impact” one official at the company said.



Cyworld the country’s first-generation social networking service which recently came back to life also joined the list of companies entering the metaverse by signing a strategic partnership with Hancom a South Korean office suite software developer last week.



The partnership will see the two companies create a virtual meeting service for corporations.



Netmarble also recently launched Metaverse Entertainment to develop a virtual reality platform and offer game-related metaverse content including one involving the management of virtual idols.



Others are using it to recruit or train staff.



CJ OliveNetworks an ICT solutions provider of CJ Group held a two-day recruitment event on Gather Town overcoming the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.



Designed based on the company’s headquarters the virtual space had a main hall and counseling rooms. Job seekers created their own avatars to join the event and were able to speak with other participants.



Samsung Electronics has also joined the trend offering online consultation sessions to potential job seekers in the metaverse in an effort to reach out to the Millennial and Generation Z demographic.



The list of companies that has incorporated the metaverse in their recruitment process is growing across the sectors ranging from SK Telecom LG Innotek to CJ ENM to name a few.



The metaverse boom has also swept the construction industry. In August Lotte E&C became the first company in the field to hold a recruiting fair in the metaverse using Gather Town with some 400 job seekers taking part.



Keeping in line with its identity the online event recreated some of the company’s most famous building projects including its apartment brand Lotte Castle Lotte World Tower and Lotte World.



One participant said taking part in the event as an avatar in a virtual world felt like “being in a video game” and that more free and honest two-way communication was possible.



Lotte E&C said it plans to continue using a metaverse platform for future events.



“Participants are free from space and time constraints as they do not have to be at a certain place at a certain time. For organizers it means less burden regarding COVID-19 guidelines” one official at the company said.

A Chinese man allegedly died after chugging 1.5 litre of Coca-Cola in 10 minutes.

It was said that the man's rapid consumption led to a fatal gas buildup in his body which starved his liver of oxygen and eventually led to his death the Daily Mail reported.

The freak accident was detailed in the journal “Clinics and Research in Hepatology and Gastroenterology.”



The man who wasn't identified started experiencing a swollen stomach and severe pain six hours later which prompted him to visit the Chaoyang Hospital in Beijing.

The tests carried out revealed that the patient - who had no underlying health issues - had an elevated heart rate low blood pressure and rapid breathing. CT scans found he had pneumatosis an abnormal presence of gas in the wall of his intestine and his portal vein.



The scans also revealed he hepatic ischemia otherwise known as “shock liver” which is caused by a lack of oxygen to the organ per the report.



At that point the medical staff tried to save the man by releasing the gas from his digestive system. They also administered medication to help safeguard his liver and other body parts from further damage the Daily Mail reported.

Despite doctors efforts the man’s condition continued to worsen until he passed away 18 hours after treatment."

Teams must cut their 2024 rosters down to just 12 spots from as many as 18 training camp players. And while this year’s WNBA draft class is undoubtedly rife with talent only 18 draftees remain rostered ahead of Monday's final cuts. Last year just 15 of the league’s 36 draftees made it onto their team’s opening-day squad.

And it's not just rookies. Veteran players are also on the chopping block even former title-winners: On Thursday the Minnesota Lynx waived 2021 WNBA champ Ruthy Hebard.

But with every wave of cuts players that survive dismissal inch closer to claiming a coveted roster spot. The Las Vegas Aces have already reached that magic number 12 opening the door for draft picks Dyaisha Fair and Kate Martin to stay on with the reigning champs.

Additionally Dallas has whittled their training camp group down to 12. Fifth overall pick Jacy Sheldon and undrafted rookie Jaelyn Brown continue to remain in the mix.

Other teams meanwhile still have decisions to make. Seattle currently lists 13 players while others like New York still have a full 18 players in training camp. It’s likely that the final preseason game will tip roster decisions one way or another as coaching staffs continue to evaluate performance and playing time.

But being cut doesn't mean the end of the road for everyone. Should players be waived they can still be signed to short-term hardship contracts with teams carrying injured players on their permanent rosters.

Koepka and his partner Daniel Berger argued Saturday with a pair of rules officials that a drain placed near a bunker to the right of the fairway would interfere with Koepka's downswing.

The issue is more serious because Koepka has been dealing with a wrist injury.

“If I break my wrist it’s on (expletive) both of you” Koepka told the officials after the ruling was made.

According to Rule 16.1 free relief is allowed when an abnormal course condition including immovable obstructions such as a drain ""physically interferes with the player's area of intended stance or area of intended swing.""

But referee David Price would not grant relief because he said the drain did not interfere with Koepka's swing. Another official Mark Litton was called over and also refused relief for Koepka.

Charlie Neibergall/AP Team USA's Brooks Koepka reacts after making a putt on the 10th hole during a four-ball match at the Ryder Cup at the Whistling Straits Golf Course Saturday Sept. 25 2021 in Sheboygan Wis.

""Have you ever seen me hit a ball? Don't you think my club might hit right here?"" Koepka argued as he pointed at the drain tucked into the area near a bunker and situated a pace or two ahead of the ball.

After the ruling Koepka chopped down on the ball and got it to the front of the green. He and Berger combined to two-putt and tie the hole.

With a growing client list and $5 million round of series-A funding ransomware protection software company HeraSoft needed a central location for its formerly dispersed administrative staff. Now the company is based in the former county courthouse building 504 Silas St. and anticipates doubling or tripling its local staff in the next year.

“Real estate prices are very affordable services on the whole are very affordable relative to a top 50 U.S. city. All of these things for an early stage company like ours — we’re not a Fortune 500 company — we have to be really cognizant of everything we do. How we direct our resources is really critical” Anthem Blanchard said.

“I think with the COVID era that’s upon us people are appreciating less dense environments. Bartlesville is so neat … because it feels like a town that’s three to five times bigger.”

'Like Christmas':New bargain store opening in Eastland Shopping Center offers unique twist

While the company plans to move more administrative sales and business development positions to its new headquarters it will maintain offices for research and development in Houston and programming in Sao Paulo Brazil he said.

In its Sept. 7 meeting the Bartlesville City Council approved a Bartlesville Development Authority program to offer those moving for the company $10000 for buying a house in the city or $20000 for building one as an incentive for inbound employees to live locally instead of in Owasso or Tulsa.

BDA President David Wood said in May when the Bartlesville Development Trust Authority was working with HeraSoft on possible building renovations it contacted BDA about a possible opportunity.

“So for us it wasn’t about landing the company it was about maximizing the community’s benefit from their decision – capturing new employees as new residents” Wood said.

“There was very little downside risk for us to offer the relocation incentive with an unlimited potential upside. Apple Computers was started in a garage so one never knows. It made sense for us to support them on a pay-as-they-grow basis. Certainly diversification beyond the cyclical oil and gas industry makes Bartlesville more resilient.”

With the large employment base and presence of both ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 making the community feel bigger and the growing role of the technology industry in the economy as a whole Anthem Blanchard said he feels the company has a lot of room to grow in its new home.

“It’s interesting to come to Bartlesville and feel like you’re still in a city but not have all the hassles. Everything is more efficient. In this day and age you can do everything electronically and not have to suffer through traffic” Anthem Blanchard said.

“All in all it’s a great location.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vanVzdHdvbWVuc3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vd2UtZ290LW91ci1nb2F0LWJhY2stZGlhbmEtdGF1cmFzaXMtaGVyb2ljLXJldHVybi1saWZ0cy1tZXJjdXJ5LXRvLXduYmEtc2VtaWZpbmFscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'We got our GOAT back': Diana Taurasi's heroic return lifts Mercury to WNBA semifinals,"Diana Taurasi looked like she might need to come off the floor multiple times on Sunday. She winced and she hobbled favoring the injured left ankle that kept her out of the Mercury’s first-round win over the Liberty the one that earned them the chance to meet Seattle in this second-round single-elimination game.

But Taurasi kept on playing. Not only that: She made two big shots and one key free throw in overtime that helped the Mercury upset the defending champion Storm on their home court 85-80 and advance to their seventh WNBA semifinals in the last nine seasons.

Brittney Griner led Phoenix with 23 points (on 11-for-17 shooting) and 16 rebounds. Taurasi finished with 14 points five assists and four rebounds — on one good leg.

“Obviously you want to be out there with your teammates and we’ve had such a grind of a season” Taurasi said after the win. “Against New York I was just not ready to play. The decision was ‘Can I help?’ And if I could help in any capacity I was going to try to play today.”

The Storm — playing on Sunday without Breanna Stewart who sat on the bench with a boot on her injured left foot — executed their game plan well in the first half. Seattle’s defense held Taurasi to just three points in the half and the entire Mercury team to nine in the second quarter riding a 15-0 run to a 35-32 lead at the break.

But as Storm head coach Noelle Quinn and Sue Bird explained after the game sending double teams to Griner and switching guards on Taurasi to try to account for the extra space can only work for so long.

In other words once Taurasi got hot from the field it was game over.

“Dee gives them automatic confidence swag all of the above just by being on the floor” Quinn said. “Early on testing out her mobility I thought we did a decent job. But what happens when you have the greatest player in our game on the floor is that she hits timely shots.”

“What happened in overtime was we made a couple mistakes that gave her two open shots” Bird added. “And you can’t give a player like that an open look whether they’re on half a leg or not. Of course that’s who she is so it’s no surprise and that’s why you can’t make those mistakes.”

Taurasi is not only a one-of-a-kind scoring threat; her mere presence also gives her team a sense of comfort. Skylar Diggins-Smith said again Sunday that she chose Phoenix in 2019 free agency so she could play with Taurasi and Griner. And Griner when asked what’s allowed her to unlock another level in her game this season while seated next to Taurasi and Diggins-Smith during the postgame press conference said: “When I look to my left and I see them of course anyone would play with ease.”

The Mercury will meet the No. 2-seeded Las Vegas Aces in the semifinals with Game 1 set for Tuesday at 10 p.m. ET (ESPN2). It will be Taurasi’s 10th semifinal series all with Phoenix.

Bird 40 was asked about her future after the game including by ESPN’s Holly Rowe on the court as the Seattle crowd chanted “One more year!” It’s still unclear whether she will come back to the Storm.

Taurasi 39 is expected to return next season after signing a two-year maximum contract with Phoenix in February. She’s already won three championships with the Mercury during her 17-year career. As she goes for her fourth title — which for what it’s worth would tie her with Bird — Taurasi is focusing on simply being on the court for her teammates.

Because when their leader is in the lineup the Mercury like their chances.

“For someone who hasn’t been able to run for three weeks almost … to come into overtime and make two big plays that’s why they talk about she’s the GOAT because she finds a way” said coach Sandy Brondello.

“We got our GOAT back. She was a little fatigued out there. I’m not sure she’ll be able to walk tomorrow but she grinded it out and found a way.”

It marked the second time in the Raiders' first three games -- both at home -- they overcame a two-touchdown deficit to win in overtime.

They also did it against Baltimore on ""Monday Night Football"" during the opening week of the season.

Raiders quarterback Derek Carr found Bryan Edwards for 34 yards before Peyton Barber put together runs of 27 and 8 yards to put Las Vegas on the Dolphins 11-yard line to eventually set up the winning score.

After Miami's Jason Sanders made it a one-score game with a 46-yard field goal midway through the fourth quarter Jacoby Brissett scrambled on fourth-and-goal for a 1-yard touchdown with :02 left in regulation. Brissett's passed to William Fuller for the 2-point conversion forced overtime.

The teams exchanged field goals in overtime before Carlson's winner.

Miami which ranks in the top 10 in several defensive categories allowed the Raiders to go 3 for 3 inside the red zone and a 54% conversion rate on third downs (7 of 13)."

Jeanette Lee “The Black Widow” finished six rounds of cancer chemotherapy over five months this past June. She also had major cancer surgery during that time-period. The relative success of those treatments were assessed as being “As good as could be expected“ by Lee’s medical team.

Though Lee has been playing recently her condition and the effects of the therapy has obviously not allowed her to prepare for the tournament as she normally would. Lee decided to enter for more therapeutic reasons than professional ones. “Playing and competing in tournaments is what I love to do” explains Lee. “I wanted to feel that feeling again and connect personally with my fans again. They have been so overwhelmingly supportive I want to be out there among them.” Lee continued “The cancer and the chemo has affected my stamina and preparation so I have no idea at what level I can perform. However I guarantee that I will compete with everything I have.”

The days of NBC Sports making every single Premier League game available “for free” to soccer fans in the United States who had access to NBC Sports Live Extra are long gone. The world has changed a lot since NBC’s Premier League debut in 2013. And as each season has passed NBC Sports has used the Premier League to find new and innovative ways to increase their revenue as well as locking in viewers to keep their cable or satellite TV subscription.

With the July 15 public launch of Peacock — NBC’s streaming answer to the competition’s Disney+ CBS All-Access and Hulu — the expectation was that non-televised matches of the Premier League would begin on Peacock in August 2020. But with today’s news NBC Sports has decided to accelerate the start date to June 20 with the live broadcast of Bournemouth against Crystal Palace on Peacock Premium.

That match which will also be available via NBC Sports Gold is just the starting point. In total between June 17 and July 2 Peacock Premium will stream seven matches from the Premier League. Soccer fans without Peacock can watch those seven via NBC Sports Gold as another option.

In all seven of those games they feature lower tier Premier League clubs. The only exception is the July 1st clash between Arsenal and Norwich which may ruffle the feathers of Gunners supporters. But again NBC Sports Gold is another option for that game so it’s not the end of the world.

Having said that soccer fans have to jump more hoops than they did before to watch Premier League soccer. Peacock Premium isn’t available to the general public until July 15 so only Comcast Xfinity customers can access it. But not all Comcast Xfinity subscribers — only those with X1 or Flex.

If you’re not a Comcast customer with a X1 or Flex NBC Sports Gold is offering a reduced rate of $9.99 for the remainder of the 2019/20 season through July 31. It’s certainly a good value to get the matches but it comes with the caveat that it includes an auto-renewal of $64.99 for next season once the July 31st date arrives.

For the hardcore soccer fans it’s important to get up to speed on Peacock since the streaming service will broadcast the non-televised Premier League matches next season (along with NBC Sports Gold).

The three different versions of Peacock are:

1. Peacock Free — No access to live Premier League games (no access to replays either).

Peacock Free includes next day access to current seasons of TV shows popular movies curated daily news and sports programming including the Olympics Spanish-language content select episodes of marquee Peacock originals and tent-pole series

2. Peacock Premium — Available for free to Comcast Xfinity customers. Will be available to the general public beginning July 15 for $5 per month. Live non-televised Premier League games will be available to subscribers. Replays of non-televised games will be available the next day.

For the 2020/21 season Peacock Premium (and NBC Sports Gold) will stream more than 140 non-televised Premier League matches to viewers in the United States.

According to NBC Peacock Premium features “thousands of hours of iconic shows and megahit movies plus full series episodes next day airing of current NBC hits Peacock Originals premier sports exclusives and channels you can only watch on Peacock.”

3. Peacock Premium without ads — As the name suggests an ad-free version is available to Xfinity customers for $5/month and for $10/month to the general public.

If you’re a Comcast customer then Peacock Premium appears to be — sight unseen — a worthy addition to your subscription. But what it does for everyone else is to create another paywall to understand and consider in a world where more and more media organizations are putting content behind subscriptions. The Peacock Premium price point is competitive but we’ll have to see if the value it provides is worth a subscription. (Currently Peacock Premium is offering a huge deal on their annual subscription).

Personally speaking Peacock Premium has already pushed me to make a move. As a cord cutter who has Comcast Xfinity only for the Internet service I had been holding off on Comcast’s offer of a free Flex streaming device because I already own a Roku Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV stick. What do I need another streaming box for? But with the news that Premier League games will be available sooner than expected on Peacock Premium it compelled me to order Flex for free. Will it increase the likelihood I’ll stay as a Comcast Xfinity Internet customer in the future instead of switching to AT&T or another ISP? And will it compel more consumers to sign up for Peacock Premium too? We shall see.

The Heritage Fine Arts Guild is pleased to welcome back Colorado artist Robert Gray for another of his popular watercolor workshops. A Denver native Gray is an award-winning watercolor artist who conducts watercolor and acrylic workshops in Colorado and Arizona.

Gray’s paintings often depict western action; but whatever the theme his aim is to keep the work exciting with a loose style and lots of bright colors. According to Gray his aim is always technique and style rather than subject and his workshops consistently reflect that philosophy.

Towards his mastery of the medium Gray attended workshops by such noted artists as Charles Reid Frank Francese Eric Wiegardt Don Andrews Tony van Hasselt and William Condit.

His paintings reside in corporate collections in the United States and in many foreign countries as well. Best of Show ribbons include Littleton’s 1999 “Own an Original” Roxborough Arts Council’s 2012 “Autumn in the Arts” and Heritage Fine Art Guild’s 2013 “This is Colorado – Statewide Juried Exhibition.”

The workshop is held at the First Presbyterian Church of Littleton at 1609 W. Littleton Blvd in Littleton from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Cost is $35 for All Heritage Fine Arts Guild members and $50 for non-members. Space at the church is limited to 12 students. Membership is only $40; sign-up forms are at http://heritage-guild.com/membership.html

The pitching was strong on both sides but the Motor City Kitties just could not make it happen with the bats and on the basepaths.

Saturday offers a chance to even the series for the Olde English D behind another premier prospect pitcher while the Royals send a greenhorn fresh off the farm to try and steal the road set. Here is a look at what is lined up for tonight’s action.

Pitching Matchup: LHP Tarik Skubal (8-12 4.25 ERA) vs. RHP Jon Heasley (7-3 3.33 ERA in AA)

Game 154 Pitching Matchup Pitcher IP K% BB% FIP fWAR Pitcher IP K% BB% FIP fWAR Skubal 142.0 26.8 7.6 4.91 1.0 Heasley (AA) 105.1 27.7 7.9 4.59 -

Much like Casey Mize yesterday Tarik Skubal will be on a workload limit as his season winds down ostensibly set for a three-inning stint before giving way to the bullpen. Since his pitch cap was put into place he has started three games throwing a trio of frames in each putting up a 4.00 ERA 3.72 FIP and a tidy 1.00 WHIP striking out 12 to just one walk. The best of the three came on Sept. 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays in which he gave up a hit and a walk while striking out six over three shutout innings.

Jon Heasley will take the bump for the Monarchs for just his second career major league appearance after leapfrogging Triple-A straight into the show. The former 13th round pick out of Oklahoma State’s first outing was also a start back on Sept. 17 against the Seattle Mariners in which he lasted just four innings surrendering four runs on six hits including a pair of dingers while walking none and striking out two for the loss. It is hard to extrapolate how well he fits into the big leagues based on those four frames but the results are not that surprising given the jump he made.

Fortunately there was enough of a sample of the 24-year-old’s repertoire that we have an idea of what he has to offer. According to Baseball Savant the right-hander has a 93.5 mph four-seam fastball that he uses primarily with a secondary selection consisting of a 79.6 mph curveball 85.5 mph changeup and a scarcely-used 93.5 mph sinker. He leaned on the four-seamer 48 percent of the time while the curve and change was utilized almost identically throwing them 17 and 16 times (22.7 and 21.3 percent) respectively against Seattle.

Key Matchup: Offense vs. Heasley

The bats looked weak on Friday for Miguel Cabrera Night of all games and that is just not going to get the job done this weekend. On the mound for KC is a fresh pitcher that is ripe for the pickings who appears to have gotten a late-season call-up a little bit before he is ready. While the Tigers’ batting order is not one that necessarily strikes fear in the heart of its opponents it does feature plenty of professional hitters who should know how to handle the youngster.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVlcC5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL21sYi90aWdlcnMvMjAyMS8wOS8yNi9kZXRyb2l0LXRpZ2Vycy1wbGF5b2Zmcy1tbGItMjAyMi1hbC1hdmlsYS1jaHJpcy1pbGl0Y2gtYWotaGluY2gvNTg1Mjc0OTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Detroit Tigers reveal plan for 'big push' for 2022 playoffs,"Your subscription supports:

COP,ConocoPhillips,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vdmVuZXp1ZWxhbmFseXNpcy5jb20vbmV3cy8xNTMzMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Venezuela: Opposition Leader Guaidó Under Fire Over Alleged $1.3 Billion Settlement,"Multinational corporations look to collect on arbitration awards as the US-backed opposition’s management of foreign assets is increasingly challenged.

Mérida September 25 2021 (venezuelanalysis.com) – Venezuela’s self-proclaimed “Interim President” Juan Guaidó has drawn severe criticism over a reported agreement to pay US $1.3 billion to US corporation ConocoPhillips.

The alleged settlement was revealed in a report by Delaware District Court-appointed “Special Master” Robert B. Pincus on a proposed “sale procedure” of Venezuelan assets to meet creditor demands.

“The Venezuela Parties [opposition-appointed boards] have indicated that they have reached an agreement with ConocoPhillips regarding the outstanding amount of ConocoPhillips’ Judgment” which “totals $1287664420 as of July 20 2021” reads the 73-page text seen by Venezuelanalysis.

The figure references the $2 billion awarded to the Houston-based multinational in 2018 by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in compensation for assets at the Orinoco Oil Belt nationalized by the former Hugo Chávez government. The Pincus report revealed that ConocoPhillips “has received (or seized) at least $753998726” between 2018 and 2019 before US sanctions cut off the Maduro government from international markets and stopped it from servicing debt.

For his part Guaidó released a statement denying the $1.3 billion deal stating that the court’s document is “mistaken.” “The interim government has not signed any payment agreement with ConocoPhillips. There are no contracts in progress for the sale sale process or share relinquishing from PDVSA PDV Holding and/or CITGO with ConocoPhillips or other creditors” it read.

However both the alleged under-the-table agreement and its denial were condemned by analysts and opposition supporters alike. Economist Francisco Rodríguez blasted the right-wing politician for his handling of Venezuela’s assets abroad and the lack of transparency in his dealings with creditors.

“Were oil exploitation rights in Venezuelan territory surrendered?” the expert asked on Twitter. He also recalled the “interim president” previously claiming not to have resources to assist Venezuelans affected by the economic crisis.

Rodríguez likewise questioned Guaidó’s allegation that the disclosed agreement with ConocoPhillips was a mistake. “The expert’s report was presented to the court on August 9. The Venezuelan lawyers had until September 1 to object” he added pointing at the document’s mention of direct communications with the “interim government.”

US government to ‘reassess’ CITGO protection in 2022

Merge and acquisition expert Robert B. Pincus was appointed as “special master” by US District Judge Leonard P. Stark in May as part of the case brought forward by Crystallex. The Canadian mining firm is likewise looking to collect on a $1.4 billion arbitration award and has set sights on CITGO an $8 billion-worth US-based Venezuelan oil subsidiary. The company was seized by Washington and handed to Guaidó after his self-proclamation in January 2019. The US’ recognition has meant that only opposition-appointed boards have been involved in litigation over Venezuelan enterprises in US courts.

The special master’s report recommended a sale procedures order and ideally a “negotiated outcome” to satisfy all claimants including Crystallex ConocoPhillips and holders of the PDVSA 2020 bond. Pincus also defended his actions in the document having been mired in controversy for exceeding the $2 million legal fee limit and an alleged conflict of interest over hiring advisors with “success fees” compensations.

Despite court approval efforts to seize or auction CITGO shares have been barred by the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in an attempt to protect opposition-held companies. US authorities have renewed orders banning the seizure of Venezuelan assets without a special license.

In response to a recent letter from Crystallex attorneys OFAC maintained its stance arguing that the “sale of the PDVH [CITGO’s holding company] shares at this time would be inconsistent with United States foreign policy interests.”

The September 10 communication claims the US will “reassess” the decision during the first half of 2022 “as warranted by changed circumstances.” The timing coincides with the expiration of the previous opposition-controlled National Assembly (AN). Though its term ended in January 2021 after legislative elections took place it continued to be recognized by Washington. Guaidó and his followers “extended” the mandate for a year in a move deemed unconstitutional by the Venezuelan Supreme Court.





to finally compensate Rusoro for the losses it suffered as a result of the expropriation of its investments” company CEO Andre Agapov said in a statement. The executive added that the gold miner would continue its “enforcement efforts” against Venezuelan assets.

Rusoro was awarded a $967.77 million compensation in 2016 at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) for the 2011 nationalization of its mining operations in the southern state of Bolívar by the Chávez government. However the corporation calculates interest at $652.23 million leaving the total at $1.62 billion.

Venezuelan authorities and the Guaidó opposition have not commented on the case. Caracas had objected to the ICSID award arguing that Rusoro’s portfolio was valued at just $51.4 million at the time of the nationalization. A 2019 decision by the Paris Court of Appeal to dismiss the award was recently overturned by the higher French Cassation Court. The Venezuelan government is reportedly preparing a new legal challenge.

Opposition infighting over Monómeros turmoil

The US-backed faction’s handling of foreign-based enterprises was likewise questioned by opposition allies in recent days following the Colombian government’s decision to take control over Monómeros Colombo-Venezolanos a subsidiary of Venezuela’s state petrochemical company Pequiven.

While the Maduro government called the move a “flagrant theft” Guaidó thanked the Iván Duque administration for “protecting” the agrochemical producer.

The stance was fiercely criticized and on Monday high-ranking figures from the 2015-20 National Assembly penned a letter to the Colombian president expressing concern for the “harmful consequences” of the Monómeros’ takeover.

The former deputies accused the Guaidó-appointed board of engaging in a “deliberate strategy to bankrupt the company” as well as acts of “sabotage” and “misinformation.” They called on Duque to “not let third-parties” take over the company. However according to journalist Vladimir Villegas Guaidó opposed the letter and refused to sign it.

On Thursday the company’s administration filed for bankruptcy and will look to reach an agreement with creditors

“Oh my God I am so nervous. I’ve never done anything like this before” the the 24-year-old Calexico native said during the opening reception last week of “Crisis y Cosecha” which translates to “Harvest of Crisis” a study on the ways the Imperial Valley has changed over the past 18 months under the COVID-19 pandemic.

Her pieces “Esenciales” a “wheat-pasting” artwork adhered to a false wall and “Migrant Workers are Essential Workers” a set of decals handed out during the reception were created to bring awareness to the struggles migrant workers have faced during the pandemic.

“Migrant workers are paid terribly and were some of the last to get access to COVID vaccine and (personal protective equipment) supplies but they were still out there working” said Aguirre who recently entered San Diego State University-Imperial Valley campus’ teaching-credential program after graduating with a bachelor’s degree in liberal arts.

This subject was deeply personal for Aguirre because she comes from a family of migrant workers. She spoke of watching her family struggle as they continued to work through the pandemic without any of the benefits that other essential workers saw and that moved her to create her pieces.

Her works were part of what coincided with the reopening of SDSU-Imperial Valley’s John Steppling Art Gallery in Calexico for the first time in 18 months. The reception on Thursday Sept. 23 was a dual celebration anchored by the exhibit co-curated by Imperial Valley Equity and Justice Coalition and the Associated Students at SDSU-IV.

The university and the coalition also partnered with the Latino Community Foundation and Comite Civico del Valle to host “Crisis y Cosecha” which features Imperial Valley artists and is an expansion of an online exhibit titled “Imperial Valley Hope and Resilience.”

“There are a lot of pieces from creatives that is their first time showing at any exhibit. Our groups reflected on how it’s so important to support creatives and to support the work and really to have a platform for them to have this experience” said Daniela Flores co-organizer from I.V. Equity and Justice Coalition during the reception.

One wall of the exhibit is dedicated to a single mural which won the San Diego State University Social Justice Mural Contest at SDSU’s main campus also by artists new to the gallery space.

Painted by SDSU-IV students Alma R. Medina Sergio Ojeda and Samantha Ramirez “The Struggle for a Bilingual Education” highlights the struggle bilingual students face when only being allowed to speak one language. After “Crisis y Cosecha” ends after Nov. 4 the mural will movie to SDSU-IV’s library.

Medina stands next to the mural she created with two other artists “The Struggle for a Bilingual Education” which focuses on the struggle bilingual students face in schools during the “Crisis y Cosecha” opening at the John Steppling Art Gallery on San Diego State University-Imperial Valley campus in Calexico on Thursday Sept. 23. | MARCIE LANDEROS PHOTO

“On the left side we have a depiction of someone who is not allowed to speak freely language. We have a reference to Prop. 227 which is a proposition that enforced English only in classrooms and students that were only speaking Spanish were not allowed to get bilingual classes that they needed” Medina said on Sept. 23.

“And on the right side we have a girl that’s supposed to represent the positive side of that someone who’s allowed to speak both languages freely however they wanted and mix them up. And that’s why we also have a reference to like an opposite Prop. 58 which is when Prop. 227 was taken out” she added. “And now this is something that allowed for bilingual education for our students.”

Medina was born in Mexicali but immigrated to Calexico when she was 4 years old. Her own struggles the piece she said recalling when schools mandated English only yet she spoke primarily Spanish.

Medina much like Aguirre is attending SDSU-IV’s credentialing program though Medina’s focus is on being able to teach math in high school.

The exhibit featured artworks that were created in response to a variety of events in the last 18 months including the 13 migrants who lost their lives outside Holtville in March and the pre-pandemic Mexicali Resiste a movement born of protesting efforts to build a Constellation Brands brewery in the Mexicali Valley which was part of a larger issue of the privatization of water in the region.

“This is an exhibition that is kind of like the second part of something that we organized with the Imperial Valley Equity and Justice Coalition and the Steppling Gallery a year ago” gallery director Luis Hernandez said during the reception. Hernandez is also an art instructor at the Calexico campus and Imperial Valley College.

“And in that time a year ago we organized an online exhibition. And this is kind of like the continuation now like a physical exhibition where you can see the world in person which is a very different experience not just looking at images on the screen” he said. “Now you have a chance to look at paintings and also like three-dimensional works also cultural works. But again the experience is very different (from) one year ago.”

All participating artists will receive an honorarium with funds provided by the Latino Community Foundation. Some of the artwork will be for sale by the artists. The exhibit can be seen through Nov. 4 from 6 to 8 p.m. Mondays through Fridays.

“I’m just taking it all in” said Linda Abarbanell associate professor of psychology at the Calexico campus who attended the opening. “I’m glad that there’s a lot of people that showed up for this. And it’s been nice to be able to interact with some of the artists and the incredible talent that we have here in the Imperial Valley in here on our campus as well.

Job losses and facility closings will persist in the Canadian cannabis industry for the next few quarters as long as companies struggle to cultivate and retain their customer base industry analysts believe.

The warnings come ahead of earnings reports from two major cannabis companies – Aurora Cannabis Inc. and Tilray Inc. – over the next 10 days. Last week both companies separately announced they were shutting production facilities and cutting jobs.

Edmonton-based Aurora said 8 per cent of its work force will be affected by the upcoming closing of Aurora Polaris a 300000-square-foot facility once touted as the company’s “centre of excellence” for “high-margin” production of cannabis derivative products such as edibles. Tilray too – as part of a cost-cutting exercise since its merger this spring with Aphria Inc. – announced it will shut down an indoor growing facility in Nanaimo B.C. a 60000-square-foot space that was designed to produce pot primarily for the medical market.

“The underlying theme in this whole business has been fierce unrelenting competition. If you’re not on your game you can’t distinguish your product and you don’t have the right cost structure you’re going to be roadkill” said Chris Damas a long-time cannabis analyst and now independent consultant for the industry.

Major cannabis producers have been retrenching workers for almost 18 months now. Aurora laid off well over a third of its staff or almost 1000 employees in 2020. Tilray embarked on job-cutting measures last year laying off more than 15 per cent of its work force before the merger with Aphria. Canopy Growth Corp. also went through two major layoff rounds over the course of 2020 and 2021 while shutting down five production facilities.

Aurora’s situation is particularly dire analysts say. Unlike competitors of its size such as Canopy Growth Corp. and The Cronos Group it has not received hefty investments from large alcohol or tobacco companies to sustain a strong cash position in the face of declining revenues. (Constellation Brands owns almost 40 per cent of Canopy while Altria Group owns roughly 45 per cent of Cronos.)

“There is no success on any front for them. Not one product form not one category” said Andrew Carter an analyst with Stifel Financial Inc.

Mr. Carter’s research using data from cannabis intelligence provider Headset suggests that Aurora has been the poorest performer in terms of pot sales to retailers suffering a 65-per-cent decline in sales in August compared to August 2020. Canopy Growth by comparison saw its sales decline by 38 per cent in the same period. Tilray’s sales were down 17 per cent.

The closing of Aurora Polaris – which cost the company an estimated $50-million to construct and opened in February 2019 – is warranted and unsurprising Mr. Carter said.

“I suppose layoffs are necessary. But it doesn’t fix the fundamental problem for Aurora which is ‘Why don’t consumers want to buy your product?’” he said.

There is no clear answer. The company’s most popular brand San Rafael was a hit in the first year following legalization. But as more premium cannabis brands entered the market competition increased leaving the company to focus more on sales of its derivative products – vape pens and edibles. That market segment too was rife with competitors and Aurora’s products did not resonate with consumers enough to justify such expensive production facilities.

At the height of the cannabis industry boom in Canada Aurora owned eight facilities across the country and a 1000000-square-foot production space in Odense Denmark spending hundreds of millions of dollars on leasing costs and renovations to design the greenhouses for cannabis cultivation. But over the past 18 months the company’s business has been whittled down to just two domestic production centres in Edmonton and Bradford Ont.

Some analysts predict that Aurora Sky a state-of-the-art indoor growing facility next to the Edmonton International Airport which cost an estimated $150-million to construct and renovate could also shut its doors if the company’s sales do not pick up.

According to Mr. Damas the facility closings for Aurora reflect the fact that the company failed not only in capturing the value segment of pot sales – sales of cheaper cannabis – but also the derivatives market. “They have about a quarter of the chocolate market in Ontario. But that’s still not enough” he added.

Tilray’s situation is slightly different. While Aurora was forced to downsize because it simply had to conserve cash analysts say Tilray could potentially operate at the status quo but has instead chosen to streamline its operations in light of uncertain demand for its products and a growing focus on its American and international operations.

Prior to its merger with Aphria Tilray had almost 1000000 square feet of cultivation space in Canada mostly concentrated at its High Park Farms property in Enniskillen Ont. That facility was shut immediately following the merger. Only one of Tilray’s old production facilities in London Ont. is still part of the merged company and it functions as a distribution centre not a cultivation hub.

“Tilray is not necessarily overspending right now” Mr. Carter said.

He pointed out that two massive Aphria production facilities – Aphria One and Aphria Diamond – were more than enough to sustain the company’s supply thus it made sense that Tilray would embark on downsizing.

In its most recent earnings chief executive officer Irwin Simon said he believed Tilray could earn up to $4-billion in revenue by the end of 2024 with roughly $1-billion coming from its Canadian operations. Its current annual revenue is roughly $620-million. But in a note to clients Tamy Chen an analyst with Bank of Montreal called Mr. Simon’s predictions “lofty” and “underpinned by many bullish assumptions.”

Mr. Damas the cannabis consultant called the current state of the industry “Darwinist in nature.”

“It’s survival of the fittest. So once you get labelled with a bad reputation be it broken promises to shareholders or low-quality product it’s hard to change consumers’ minds.”

The final varsity race of the day saw teams that year in and year out are among the best in their states. Christian Brothers Academy NJ placed three runners in the top 10 and all five scorers in the top 20 to beat Xavier CT 59- 96.

Now at least one big-box retailer is trying to prevent a repeat of that frenzy as the Delta variant has driven caseloads higher in many parts of the country.

The retailer Costco which is known for its bargains on bulk food and cleaning supplies confirmed in a fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday that it was “putting some limitations on key items” such as toilet paper cleaning products and Kirkland Signature water.

The company did not specify what those limits were but Richard A. Galanti the executive vice president and chief financial officer of Costco pointed to “the uptick in Delta-related demand.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtY29zdGNvLWNoYW5nZWQtaXRlbXMtZmFsbC0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 4 Costco Items Have Changed Customers Say — Eat This Not That,"Unlike other grocery stores there are actually significantly fewer items at each Costco warehouse—even though they are huge. However Costco members know these products well and can tell when something has changed even in the slightest. Recently they have noticed some favorites throughout the warehouse are not what they use to be.

Many of them documented their findings on social media with some even asking if others noticed it too. Here are a few of the items people say are not like they normally are.

Pumpkin Pie

Costco members have been enjoying the huge pumpkin pies in the bakery section for a few weeks now. But there's a big difference between this year's pies and last year's—and it doesn't have to do with the pumpkins inside or the flaky crust. It's actually the price.

Not only is the 3.5+ pound dessert massive and great for a crowd but it used to be a staple at $5.99. However this year's pumpkin pies are $1 more. When looking at the total on the receipt at the end of a warehouse trip this price hike may not seem like a big one but in 2019 Costco sold 6.1 pies and so this will likely bring in additional millions for the company.

Blueberry Muffins

This bakery treat isn't a seasonal one like the pumpkin pie but is still loved by many and some have noticed that they are tasting different lately and they aren't sure why.

Reddit user @Kmmontanez recently inquired about it on the social media site asking if anyone else knows if they changed the recipe or something because they have noticed that they are tasting different and hardly have any blueberries. Others say it may be a different baker or type of berries.

Unfortunately we still aren't sure why this is. Costco never responded to Eat This Not That!'s request for more info.

Kirkland Meatballs

This bag is 6 pounds but some Costco members have noticed that the meatballs have gotten smaller and bigger in the last year. Reddit user @NowEvenBetter posted a comparison photo of the meatballs from July 2020 April 2021 and now. The oldest meatball is 28 grams and the second oldest is 14 grams and the meatballs from September 2021 are 18 grams.

The progression doesn't mean much other Costco members say in the comments noting that as long as the bag weighs 6 pounds it doesn't matter how big the actual meatballs are.

Paper Towels

This product change at Costco isn't necessarily new. Members first noticed the rolls included in the Kirkland Premium Towels went from 160 sheets to 140 back in April and is a direct result of the demand that skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The good news though is that it is temporary.

""This change enabled us to increase the number of sell units we can provide to our members and provide better in stocks so that members can more easily find the product in our stores"" a spokesperson said in a statement to Eat This Not That!. ""We do want to assure you that we did not increase the price per sheet to our members . . . We recognize this change is not ideal and hope to return to the original 160 sheet per roll item as soon as possible.""

JP Morgan is one of several investment firms that raised its price target for Costco following its fourth-quarter earnings report which beat expectations. Net sales for the quarter rose 17.5 percent to $61.44 billion from $52.28 billion last year. In addition net sales rose 17.7 percent for the fiscal year to $192.05 billion from $163.22 billion the previous year.

Comparable sales were strong across all regions especially in Canada where they rose close to 20 percent.

Still the average analyst isn’t as bullish on Costco shares as JP Morgan is over the next twelve months. The average price target of the 17 Wall Street analysts following the stock in the last three months is $479.47 with a high forecast of $525.00 and a low forecast of $385.00. The average Costco price target represents a 2.51% change from the last price of $467.75.

One problem with Costco stock is its valuation. The stock is trading at 40 times the next six-month earnings almost twice P/E of the S&P 500.

Then there are supply chain issues that may limit sales growth in the short run. Already the company has announced purchase limits to certain items that are in short supply.

I am bullish on this stock. (See Costco stock charts on TipRanks)

Costco: Good Company and Good Investment

Costco is a good company and a good investment. It’s a good company because it’s popular among consumers paying membership fees for the privilege to shop at its stores. The company is ranked highly in several high-profile company lists including the American Customer Satisfaction list where it beat Amazon (AMZN) back in 2018.

Costco is a good investment because it has delivered superior returns to its shareholders. Over the last ten years Costco has delivered an average annual total return of 21.54 percent compared to the 16.57 percent for the S&P 500.



Plenty of Room for Long-term Growth

Costco is the 3rd largest global retailer and the 12th largest Fortune 500 company with a market capitalization of $206.78 billion. It currently operates 817 warehouses including 565 in the United States and Puerto Rico 105 in Canada 39 in Mexico 30 in Japan 29 in the United Kingdom 16 in Korea 14 in Taiwan 13 in Australia three in Spain and one each in Iceland France and China. The company also operates e-commerce sites in the U.S. Canada the United Kingdom Mexico Korea Taiwan Japan and Australia.

This number of stores is a fraction of the amount that the world’s largest retailer Walmart (WMT) has meaning that Costco has plenty of room to grow. That’s especially true in China where the company has only one store. Seeking bargains customers have been storming the store.

While it’s unclear whether Costco will achieve JP Morgan’s bullish target in the short term one thing is clear: Costco has plenty of room to grow and deliver superior returns to long-term investors.

If you are one to commonly shop at Costco you may have noticed the several layers of plastic packaging. To protect our planet and our future Costco needs to rid its brand of plastic packaging and find a compostable or more sustainable material.

Plastic containers like pop bottles can be recycled they cannot be recycling infinitely. When plastic is recycled it requires ""virgin plastic"" to be turned into a new pop bottle. The other kind of plastic the kind that you find wrapped around packages or what your produces comes in is not recyclable. Additionally the production of plastic has immense environmental impacts. According to the World Economic Forum about 4-8% of annual global oil consumption is associated with plastics. In 2015 the CIEL reported that manufacturing polyethylene plastics are responsible for 184.3 to 213 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent which is about as much as 45 million passenger vehicles emit during one year.

The wholesaler said that it is struggling to keep products on the shelves due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

In addition to an increase in demand as the Delta variant spread across the country the company has been dealing with numerous supply chain issues. Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti explained that the wholesaler has enough items to meet demand but is having a hard time getting them to stores across the country.

""A year ago there was a shortage of merchandise"" Galanti said during a quarterly earnings call. ""Now they've got plenty of merchandise but there's two- or three-week delays on getting it delivered because there's a limit on short-term changes to trucking and delivery needs of the suppliers so it really is all over the board.""

He did not provide specific details about the number of items customers will be allowed to purchase.

Galanti said that Costco is working on long-term plans to mitigate supply chain issues in the future.

""Despite all these issues we continue to work to mitigate cost increases in a variety of different ways and hold down and or mitigate our price increases passed onto the members"" Galanti said."

Just a few steps from Henry II’s 12th century castle keep the Crown & Castle hotel is a highly rated restaurant with 21 rooms.

Expect oak beams stylish décor and a traditional bar with a real open fire for cooler days. Walls are adorned with interesting artwork. And there’s a large terrace for outdoor eating and drinking within sight of the keep.

Good quality unpretentious food is at the heart of what the Crown & Castle offers in its lively restaurant with delicious dishes created by the head chef Jake Lawrence and his team.

Rooms are furnished very comfortably and include TV free Wifi a hospitality tray and luxury toiletries as standard. Single travellers will find the Good House rooms at the front of the hotel perfect for one. There are Garden Rooms with semi-private terrace access. Terrace Rooms have French doors looking out to the castle. Or indulge in the suite – which boasts a balcony with sweeping views over the Ness.

Dogs are welcome to stay with their owners in one of the five dog-friendly garden rooms as well as on the terrace in the bar and to sit alongside their owners at a bookable dog-friendly table in the restaurant.

Talking about why you should stay awhile in the village Crown & Castle general manager John Morrell says: “I think one of the best things about Orford is being able to get away from it all. You can’t not be drawn in by the peace and tranquillity of Orford and the surrounding countryside. Fantastic big skies and amazing coastal views really add to the sense of escapism. Without doubt the best way to see it is take one of our walks from the Crown and Castle my personal favourite being the 3.5 hour walk around the river to the Butley Ferry.

“As you come back into the village from your walk you may be tempted to pay a visit to Pump Street and check out a rhubarb doughnut or one of their amazing sausage rolls. Don’t forget to leave room for some dinner back at the Crown and Castle though!

“Venturing further afield our guests love a trip to Sutton Hoo or a touch of retail therapy in Snape Maltings where you can also catch a trip on the river.”

Where to eat in Orford

Pump Street’s Bakery and Café

This much-loved spot is open in the centre of Orford from 9am to 2.30pm Thursday to Sunday. Pick up a loaf of their award-winning sourdough perhaps a frangipane-filled ‘bear claw’ to take away after breakfast or lunch –which focusses on highlighting their own baked goodies and the best of British produce. There are warm ham and cheese croissants. Garlicky sausage rolls. Slices of sourdough topped with Westcombe cheddar and homemade pear chutney. Pancakes make an appearance at the weekends. And their own hot chocolate is gorgeous.

The Jolly Sailor

Open for food from 12noon to 2.30pm Mondays and Wednesdays to Sundays with evening meals from 6pm to 8.30pm Wednesday to Sunday The Jolly Sailor is everything a rural country pub should be.

Real ale is on draught at the bar. Fires crackle in the cooler months. And the food is well-made hearty traditional fare – from good old fish and chips to ham egg and chips. Vegetarians are well catered for. And it’s incredibly family friendly. On warmer days sit out in the garden and orchard with views over the marshes.

Crown & Castle

Jake’s menu screams Suffolk – with many of the ingredients on the menu sourced from within or close to Orford. Platters of Pinney’s seafood. Butley oysters on the shell. Fruit from High House in the puddings. Typical dishes include ham and leek pie with colcannon mash and Orford-landed skate wing with chorizo and cockle butter. There are always daily specials taking the seasons into account. And do save room for pud.

Shops in Orford

Pinney’s

Overlooking the quay this multi-award-winning shop has its own smokehouse supplying the store and other farm shops and restaurants in East Anglia and beyond with everything from beautifully silky salmon to mackerel eel and homemade pates. The full range can be found here including smoked chicken. And take a look at the wet counter to see what’s come off their day boat that morning. The shop also sells thoughtful gifts and cards.

Orford General Stores

Quite possibly one of the best village shops in the country. It’s a Post Office. They’ll have your papers and magazines. You can pick up that dog food you forgot. Or logs for the wood burner. But more importantly there is good food. A meat counter is replenished regularly by Friday Street Farm Shop. Bread and cakes come in from three local bakeries. Milk is delivered daily. The deli counter is filled with fine cheeses cured meats and more. You’ll find local fruit and veg. Wine. Beer. Everything you could possibly need to pull a very good breakfast picnic or supper together.

Pump Street Chocolate Shop

Perched on the other side of the street from the bakery and café this place is a chocolate-lover's dream. Alongside their own bean-to-bar chocolate (try the one with finely milled rye crumb) are bars from other artisan makers chocolate-inspired books and kitchenalia.

Orford Country Market

Held every Saturday from 9.30am to 1pm in the Town Hall. You’ll discover hyper-local meat fish eggs pies jams home-grown plants and crafts. Entry is free and you can buy refreshments there.

The London-based filmmaker was born into the industry having joined her mum director Aileen O'Sullivan on set for a role in local mini-series The Governor as a child.

After becoming an assistant director on films like Dame Jane Campion's An Angel at My Table Hobbs went on to Australia where she directed shows like Heartbreak High and The Slap which got her invited to the UK to work on Broadchurch. The rest as they say is history.

Hobbs said awards ceremonies are always ""quite loaded occasions"" and she was not expecting to get an Emmy.

""And then I had that very odd sensation of kind of time travelling backwards and me thinking 'oh oh my god I think they just said my name - now I have to do something'.""

She said prior to the announcement she was quite relaxed but when she found out she had won uttered an expletive in surprise.

""I had no idea that the fact that I had sworn was captured on camera until my family gleefully sent me the clip - so I was very embarrassed.""

Hobbs said The Crown has an extraordinary level of resources which she initially found terrifying.

But she said it was a supportive and generous producing team.

""The best producers I've ever worked with to be honest and perhaps it's because they have that scale of budget to support them and they assign a personal producer to each director which is an unusual thing in television but it means you feel very supported right from pre-production until the end of your post.""

Hobbs said prior to the show she was not a monarchist nor even a royal follower but that allowed her ""to perhaps examine what the humanity was for them"".

She said The Crown increased her respect for the breadth of the royal experience particularly for the Queen.

""I have extraordinary respect for that woman and what she does and what she represents and her duty above all else to her country is something that I can't help but admire.""

Members of the royal family can offer a lot as individuals such as Prince Charles' environmental work and they are doing a job by representing an institution which the public expects them to uphold Hobbs said.

""There's a duality there it's easy for us to get stuck into them and yet we still expect them to be there and be those representational figures.""

Hobbs said the royal family is at a particularly challenging time right now but they have also had challenges in the past which they have come through.

The Crown's changing cast

She said one of the things that was initially terrifying but which she now likes about The Crown is that every two years they change the cast.

""It allows you to jump time in a way that is sometimes harder when you're ageing actors ... you know there's a life lived in the energy of someone's body that's harder to portray just through ageing makeup.""

Emma Corrin played Princess Diana in the fourth season of The Crown but she has been replaced by Elizabeth Debicki for its fifth season.

Hobbs said Corrin did a fantastic job playing Diana but it was when she was 24.

""And then when Diana needed to jump to someone who's going to travel another decade really and to become much more of a woman someone who's been in a marriage for ten years someone who had two children - you know Elizabeth Debicki has a different feel a different level of maturity and energy to her.""

Hobbs said Debicki ""is a wonderfully complex and sensational Diana"" who has less of an innocence than Corrin did when playing Diana.

Often it is the director's job to ""get out of the way"" and let the actor do ""what's bubbling up inside them"" Hobbs said.

She said an example was in the scene involving then prime minister Margaret Thatcher where she realises that if she stops fighting she does not know who she will be if anything.

""I thought it was really important that the Queen didn't empathise with that she views it as a job and when the job is over you walk away.""

Hobbs said she was very moved by the way that actress Gillian Anderson pushed Thatcher through that scene.

London life

Hobbs said there's a necessary diversity that comes from living in a city the size of London and it can give you the freedom of anonymity.

She said one of the positive things that has come from the Covid-19 pandemic is that Londoners are now checking in on each other more often.

""There's a kind of connectivity born from the pandemic which I'm incredibly grateful for.""

She said many restaurants now have tables outside which has traditionally been more common in New Zealand and Australia than London.

""And yes it's going to get colder but just that idea of having more of an outdoor life has never been a very London thing and it's kind of exploded with this.""

Hobbs said she and her family are very happy in London and she would like her teenage daughter to be able to finish her schooling there.

But she said she still misses New Zealand.

""It would be hard for me to put into words how much I miss New Zealand how much I miss the people how much I miss the land and the light.""

Hobbs said that has become more profound knowing that they cannot return to New Zealand due to the pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhcmxpbmd0b25hbmRzdG9ja3RvbnRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvMTk2MDUwNDUubmFpdmUtZGFsZS10b3duLWRlYWxlci1zb3VyY2VkLWRydWdzLXJlcXVlc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Naive' Barnard Castle drug seller starting 28-month prison sentence,"Jack Tallentire sold a variety of class A B and C drugs to order in and around Barnard Castle but Durham Crown Court heard that there was an element of “mickey-taking” by some customers.

Some of the drugs that were requested including the psychedelic substance lsd popular in the 1960s he was unable to sell having sourced them following specific requests.

The court was told Tallentire’s activities were brought to a halt after he was approached and stopped by police as he left an address in Barnard Castle carrying a rucksack on October 15 last year the day after his 26th birthday.

Shada Mellor prosecuting said on being told he was to be searched he made off from police who pursued him and retrieved his back-pack.

A search of the bag revealed a selection of drugs including quantities of cocaine ecstasy lsd ketamine and the class C substance etizolam plus some dealing “paraphernalia”.

Tallentire handed himself in to police the following day and in a search of his home a quantity of cannabis was recovered from a bedroom wardrobe.

Miss Mellor said the defendant made full admissions in interview with police when he admitted ownership of the drugs recovered some intending to sell and some for personal use.

He said he had been selling drugs for about a year initially cocaine moving on to other substances at the request of friends making about £100 profit per week.

Tallentire told police he was working alone and gave police the values of the various drugs found based on what they would fetch on sale.

Miss Mellor said based on those values the overall amount recovered by police would amount to £3025.

The defendant of Green Lane Barnard Castle admitted six counts of possessing drugs with intent to supply three in class A two at B and one at C.

Michele Turner mitigating said her client who has no previous convictions acted “out of a certain amount of naivety”.

She told the court: “He was never going to be a millionaire from these offences.

“He lives in a rural area with limited social activity and no big market place.

“To a degree he was a bit of a laughing stock around the area.

“Some of the drugs he was asked to source are obscure and not fashionable and he was unable to sell them.

“There was to come extent a degree of mickey-taking.

“He did feel important when people contacted him but not always for the right reasons.”

Miss Turner added he would use the money made to fund his hobby of buying car parts.

Recorder Simon Kealey QC said despite what was said there was still a financial advantage to his activities.

He imposed a 28-month prison sentence and ordered forfeiture and destruction of the recovered drugs and paraphernalia.",,,,,,

It was a busy Saturday night for the Perdido Queen Dinner Cruise Boat when they pulled up to the dock they had an unexpected surprise.

“When we got back there was a train that had stopped which is not abnormal “Perdido Queen Captain and Owner Willie Jones said.

Jones said what was abnormal is the amount of time the CSX train sat there trapping some of the dinner guests staff and their vehicles on the other side of the tracks behind the Convention Center.

“Their crew had run out of hours so they had to stop the train and leave it. They said there would be a new crew inside of two or three hours” Jones said.

Jones said he started calling everyone he could think of to try and get it moving.

“This has never happened before. A 15 to 20 minute wait we’ve had before but never anything this long. I don’t anticipate it happening again” Jones said.

CSX said in a statement “CSX strives to be a good neighbor and limit the impact our operations have on the communities we serve. We work closely with the entities on the waterfront in Mobile to manage our operations in a way that allows us to coexist. Unfortunately last night a delay in switching train crews caused us to block the waterfront. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this caused.”

Jones said the train finally moved after an hour and a half of waiting.

“Everybody was so happy when they moved the train. It really was an exciting time when that train finally moved” Jones said.

Jones said they love their customers and being part of the riverfront but there are some obstacles like this they have to deal with.

“We are talking to the city and the state ports to see if there’s anything we can do to ensure this doesn’t happen again. But you know they’ve been working on that for a long time now” Jones said.

Jones said he doesn’t want this to deter anyone from coming because there are other options for parking on the south side of the Convention Center on the other side of the tracks and another way over the train to get to their cars.

(AP) — Flora Harlow has become used to change.

Over the last several years she has been in and out of permanent housing at times working while being homeless. Today she lives with others in a small encampment colloquially called “Cooterville” by some.

The tight-knit community nestled in the trees off of Willow Street and under CSX train tracks has evolved over the years according to Harlow.

But the encampment is scheduled to be cleared by Nov. 12 and while a new government-sanctioned encampment may be up and running shortly after some still remain skeptical of its benefits. And many have yet to find a better alternative.

Harlow who goes by Flo said she’s sure some in the homeless community will choose to move into the sanctioned encampment.

“But for the people who kind of rely on this place it may not be good” she said.

Cooterville has become a commune-like space for those who live there. When a person stops by to announce a church is giving out food and soft drinks at Bigger Vision another camper reminds others they plan to cook dinner that night and all were welcome to join.

As Harlow sits along a fallen tree Tink a camper’s dog jumps up to join the conversation. Everyone is familiar with Tink considering her as much as part of the extended family as any other camper.

“She demands attention” Harlow joked.

Since its founding Cooterville has grown to encompass a community that largely regulates itself. Harlow said around 8 or 9 people permanently live in the camp today but numbers have grown to 15 at times.

“Before we let somebody move in we’ll all talk about it and either agree or disagree” she said. “You can’t just come in and do whatever you want whenever you want.”

The encampment is also a space for those who may not permanently live there but have created close ties with those who do. And people who have gone on to move into apartments sometimes return to see everyone according to Harlow.

“Anybody needs a place they come here” she said. “If they don’t feel safe they come here.”

One iron-clad rule is that those who are caught stealing are promptly kicked out of the camp she said. They also ban those who fight because it draws attention.

While the encampment is called Cooterville by some Harlow said the real Cooterville was actually further up the hill away from the main road. The man who originally built it over a decade ago was called Cooter and infamously had raccoons for pets she said.

The encampment was eventually pushed further down the hill due to some campers stealing on CSX property Harlow said. Since being pushed closer to the road the encampment has drawn more attention and not all of it has been good.

A spokesperson for CSX Transportation said the company had received multiple complaints about the camp from local landowners. A deadline of Sept. 5 was originally imposed for the campers to move by but it was pushed back to November.

The delay came after city police notified CSX a government-sanctioned encampment was in the works that could provide an alternative according to City Manager Blaine Williams.

“My understanding I wasn’t part of the conversations is that CSX agreed to extend that time to try and bridge it closer to when the sanctioned homeless encampment will be up and running” he said.

The city currently is looking for an organization to head the encampment which will determine what it eventually looks like. But Williams said CSX has been collaborating with police and local officials to accommodate the campers on the property.

“By their right they could have the police remove them” he said. “So I want to give credit to CSX for trying to work with the community on this.”

In Cooterville many have questions about what this encampment will look like and who will be involved. Some have expressed feeling left in the dark about the entirety of the process not entirely sure if they will even be secured a spot in the camp.

The campers each have their own personal journeys that led to Cooterville. And for some they said their time out there has led to skepticism when it comes to receiving help.

For Harlow the journey to Athens came after she moved in and started taking care of her mother who had Alzheimer’s and dementia several years ago. When her mother died she found out her stepfather took out additional mortgages on the home which was eventually foreclosed.

Out on the streets she met her uncle who already had experience living homeless in Athens.

“He was the one who taught me how to hustle out here” Harlow said. “He passed away a couple of months after my mom. I went from staying with her and taking care of her to coming out here and him trying to teach me how to be homeless.”

Over a year ago she worked at a Family Dollar near the encampment. Harlow said a manager for the store was willing to work with her because she worked hard but when he eventually left the store a new manager pushed her out upon finding out her living situation.

“Her first sentence she said to me was ‘In Madison county homeless people don’t even come in my parking lot’” she recalled. “I was fired within a week.”

After the encampment was moved closer to the road earlier in the year campers said people started dumping their garbage on them.

“We have people who come by in cars and put their trash at the foot of our camp” Harlow said. “They’ll just stop and drop stuff… I mean just trash and it makes us look bad.”

Barrett Smith who doesn’t live in the encampment but often spends time there shared similar sentiments.

“People dump their trash on us under the guise of donations” he said. “The streets get littered but I try to come out here on the weekends and clean up some of the litter.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtwY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3NzdW4vYXJ0aWNsZV82MjAxNjZkZC1kN2IwLTVmZTAtYTVhYS04ZmFiZTFhNjkyMzUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shortline railroads provide vital links | News Sun | kpcnews.com,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Silveira the son of former fighter and American Top Team coach Conan Silveira continued his rise in the sport Friday at LFA 115 where he knocked out Tee Cummins just 49 seconds into the first round to claim the promotion’s vacant light heavyweight title.

There wasn’t much action in the main event at Menominee Nation Arena in Oshkosh Wisc. until Silveira ended the feeling-out process by throwing a head kick. Cummins defended low expecting the kick to the body which opened him up to a clean landing on the right side of the head. Once he dropped to the canvas Silveira pounced with follow-up punches for the quick referee stoppage.

It was the start of a career marked by prestige (a Nobel prize in 1929) sexual intrigue (fuelled by his portrait of gay desire Death in Venice not to mention a novella hinting at incest in his wife’s family) and the contortions of life as a public intellectual at a time of global tumult (he was alternately courted and persecuted by the US as American fears turned from Hitler to Stalin).



Over 18 date-stamped place-tagged chapters from Lübeck in 1891 to Los Angeles in 1950 Colm Tóibín’s new novel dramatises the life of Mann by focusing on the author’s hidden yearnings as a married father of six as well as the more pressing problem of how to position himself amid the dawning horrors of Nazi Germany.



A section set in Munich in 1922 tells us that Mann or Thomas walked past anti-communist demonstrations “a few times... He did not pay attention” a line that all but winks at the reader. When someone suggests to Thomas years later that he ought to write a novel about Hitler’s rise from his own perspective as someone who was living in Munich at the time he excuses himself by observing that back then he was busy watching his children grow up – although the early part of the book more than once shows him enthusiastically reporting a child’s latest milestone to his wife only for her to tell him it’s old news.





The Magician’s wider angled approach doesn’t match the intimacy Tóibín generated in The Master

Such moments are a sign of how subtly Tóibín develops his central theme of what can escape the eye of seclusion-seeking writers lauded for their observational gifts. Overall though the impression left by his somewhat confounding enterprise is rather more blunt. An early paragraph dealing with Thomas’s sexuality begins: “There was a boy in his class with whom he had a different sort of intimacy.” Despite the unpromising start the ensuing scene is well done rich in longing and awkward jeopardy. But as the novel proceeds and Mann becomes a celebrity among other writers and artists (not least his own children) you sense its panorama unfolding with increasing strain: “In his mind he went through where each member of the family was...”



Tóibín’s deceptively plain close-third narration in Brooklyn and Nora Webster allowed those novels to speak through his characters as well as over them a technique that generated much pathos. Here it tends to get in the way of the insight a non-fictional register might afford while at the same time shutting down the possibility that the reader’s imagination might fill in a blank or two. Take this line: “He disliked the idea that his father had seen through his illusions without realising how real they often appeared to him.” In a biography that would be hypothesis; in a novel it’s definitive and in a novel about a real-life figure it feels presumptuous. It doesn’t help that a writer’s job even in a lifetime as epochal as Mann’s evades dramatisation almost by definition – a state of affairs only highlighted by our occasional peek under the bonnet: “Thomas had never arrived in Venice by sea before. In the instant that he caught sight of the city in silhouette he knew that this time he would write about it.”



Of course Tóibín managed to pull off the trick once before but it’s hard not to feel that The Master his novel about Henry James worked because it focused on a particular moment of crisis (the failure of James’s 1895 play Guy Domville). While it obviously makes sense to show Mann against a backdrop of worldwide upheaval The Magician’s wider angled approach doesn’t match the intimacy Tóibín generated in The Master. When we read what Thomas was up to “as 1914 wore on” or that “for Thomas the change from complacency to shock was a swift one” when he saw Hitler’s support surge in 1930 it adds to a reading experience that feels uncomfortably even pointlessly stranded in a stylistic no man’s land between biography and fiction.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvcGh5c2ljYWwtY2hlbWlzdHJ5L2NoZW1pY2FsLWJvbmRpbmcvTm92ZWwtUC1OLWNoZW1pc3RyeS85OS9pMzXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Novel P and N chemistry,"Researchers have put phosphorus and nitrogen to new use. One group made a prismatic P 3 N 3 molecule for the first time ( Nat. Commun. 2021 DOI: 10.1038/s41467-021-25775-1 ) and a second group found a molecule that can add phosphorus mononitride to another molecule under milder reaction conditions than was previously possible (ChemRxiv 2021 DOI: 10.33774/chemrxiv-2021-zxtmf ). P and N are an unstable and often explosive combination in molecules something both teams were able to overcome at least for a short while.

At the University of Hawaii at Manoa astrochemist Ralf Kaiser and colleagues were ionizing mixtures of phosphine and dinitrogen ices in an attempt to simulate interstellar space chemistry. They didn’t find what they were looking for Kaiser says but they noticed in their mass spectrometry data a signal for prismatic P 3 N 3 . The molecule had never been synthesized before. It shares its shape and valence electron structure with prismane once proposed to be the structure of benzene. Scientists have synthesized just a few molecules with this geometry all as cores of larger organometallic complexes; the strain of repulsive interactions between nonmetal elements makes this geometry very unstable. The group’s prismatic P 3 N 3 survived at least 10 µs. Kaiser hopes the discovery may help scientists find ways to produce longer-lived versions of it and other isomers. He thinks it may lead to new energetic molecules like explosives while Massachusetts Institute of Technology inorganic chemist Christopher (Kit) Cummins writes in an email “Metastable compounds such as this one may offer synthetic pathways to novel classes of electronic materials.”"

“Understanding your privileges and how to leverage them so we can support others is a key component in being an active ally” CVS employees were told on an online call Fox Business reported.

“Allyship is the act of advocating for as well as supporting communities other than your own” the instructor said. “So being an ally means that we’re aware of our own identities as well as the intersectional identities of others. We’re recognizing and actively mitigating bias and we’re modeling inclusive leadership behaviors.”

Employees were asked to complete a “personal commitment plan” listing ways they will “take specific action” to “mitigate bias” and “practice conscious inclusion” in the next five days five weeks and five months.

“Making those measurable commitments is an important step to actually making sure that you are moving forward in this journey” the instructor said. “Wherever you currently are in the journey. We all have room to grow.”

Slides from the presentation offered guidance on how to practice “allyship” including “seeking to learn about and understand the needs of marginalized people” according to the report.

The presentation also told employees in leadership roles to “prioritize promoting diverse talent” and said that senior directors and above would “formally or informally” mentor one diverse mentee a year.

The news comes days after journalist Christopher Rufo reported on a CVS Health training that told employees to circle their identities from a list of options that included race gender sexuality and religion and to then reflect on their “privilege” during a discussion with coworkers.

The report said examples of privilege according to a checklist in the training included celebrating Christmas having a name that is easy to pronounce and feeling safe in your neighborhood at night Rufo said.

CVS Health is reportedly holding a “conscious inclusion workshop” that aims to teach employees to hold each other “accountable” for non-inclusive behaviors as part of a nearly $600 million committment to address racial inequality according to an earlier Fox Business report.

""Understanding your privileges and how to leverage them so we can support others is a key component in being an active ally"" CVS employees were told on an online call obtained by Fox Business.

""Allyship is the act of advocating for as well as supporting communities other than your own"" the instructor added. ""So being an ally means that we’re aware of our own identities as well as the intersectional identities of others. We’re recognizing and actively mitigating bias and we’re modeling inclusive leadership behaviors.""

At another point in the recording employees were told to fill out a ""personal commitment plan"" outlining ways they pledge to ""take specific action"" to ""mitigate bias"" and ""practice conscious inclusion"" in the next five days five weeks and five months.

""Making those measurable commitments is an important step to actually making sure that you are moving forward in this journey"" the instructor told employees. ""Wherever you currently are in the journey. We all have room to grow.""

Fox Business also obtained slides from the presentation which provided instructions on how to carry out ""allyship"" including ""seeking to learn about and understand the needs of marginalized people.""

Another slide instructs employees in leadership roles to ""source diverse talent"" and ""prioritize promoting diverse talent."" Additionally the slide said that senior directors and above ""will formally or informally mentor one diverse mentee a year.""

The audiotape comes on the heels of a report from journalist Christopher Rufo who obtained CVS Health training that told CVS employees to circle their identities — including race gender sexuality and religion — and then to reflect on their ""privilege"" during a discussion with co-workers. According to Rufo ""Examples of privilege according to a checklist included ‘celebrat[ing] Christmas’ ‘hav[ing] a name that is easy to pronounce’ ‘feel[ing] safe in your neighborhood at night’ and ‘feel[ing] confident in my leadership style.’""

Additionally Rufo’s report said that employees were told to acknowledge their ""white privilege.""

Last month Fox Business reported that CVS Health is holding a ""conscious inclusion workshop"" that aims to teach employees how to hold each other ""accountable"" for non-inclusive behaviors.

An internal email obtained by FOX Business showed David Casey SVP of Workforce Strategies and Chief Diversity Officer discussing the four-week program. The first three weeks included 20-30 minutes of self-study per week leading up to a two-hour virtual workshop in the fourth.

In the email Casey continued by outlining different skills employees will build during the workshop's fourth week. Those included learning how to ""identify unconscious bias in your day-to-day interactions and experiences"" ""demonstrate bravery by speaking up and having difficult conversations when observing non-inclusive behaviors"" and ""commit to holding yourself and your colleagues accountable to consistently embrace diversity of all kinds and take swift action against non-inclusive behaviors.""

CVS Health did not immediately respond to a request from Fox Business on the recently obtained audio but said in a statement last month that the new workshop was ""part of our nearly $600 million commitment to address racial inequality.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzYXQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMS8wOS8yNS9jdnMtdG8tb2ZmZXItcGZpemVyLWJvb3N0ZXItc2hvdC1hdC12YXJpb3VzLXRleGFzLWxvY2F0aW9ucy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CVS to offer Pfizer booster shot at various Texas locations,"The Pfizer booster shot is now available to eligible populations at various CVS Pharmacy locations according to a release from CVS.

The company said the booster shot will be available at 495 locations in Texas beginning Friday Sept. 24.

CVS provided the following recommendations regarding eligibility for the booster shot:

People 65 years and older and residents in long-term care settings should receive a booster shot of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine at least six months after their Pfizer-BioNTech primary series.

People aged 50 to 64 with certain underlying medical conditions should receive a booster shot of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine at least six months after their Pfizer-BioNTech primary series.

People 18 to 49 who are at high risk for severe COVID-19 due to certain underlying medical conditions may receive a booster shot of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine at least six months after their Pfizer-BioNTech primary series based on their individual benefits and risk.

People aged 18-64 years who are at increased risk for COVID-19 exposure and transmission because of occupational or institutional setting may receive a booster shot of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine at least six months after their Pfizer-BioNTech primary series.

Eligible individuals interested in receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster or their initial vaccine series can make an appointment at CVS.com

Advanced scheduling is strongly recommended for individuals looking to receive the booster shot to ensure that it is available at the pharmacy location of their choice.

How much the manufacturers stand to gain depends on how big the rollout proves to be.

U.S. health officials late on Thursday endorsed booster shots of the Pfizer vaccine for all Americans 65 and older — along with tens of millions of younger people who are at higher risk from the coronavirus because of health conditions or their jobs.

Officials described the move as a first step. Boosters will likely be offered even more broadly in the coming weeks or months including boosters of vaccines made by Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. That plus continued growth in initial vaccinations could mean a huge gain in sales and profits for Pfizer and Moderna in particular.

“The opportunity quite frankly is reflective of the billions of people around the world who would need a vaccination and a boost” Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said.

Wall Street is taking notice. The average forecast among analysts for Moderna’s 2022 revenue has jumped 35% since President Joe Biden laid out his booster plan in mid-August.

Most of the vaccinations so far in the U.S. have come from Pfizer which developed its shot with Germany’s BioNTech and Moderna. They have inoculated about 99 million and 68 million people respectively. Johnson & Johnson is third with about 14 million people.

No one knows yet how many people will get the extra shots. But Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen expects boosters alone to bring in about $26 billion in global sales next year for Pfizer and BioNTech and around $14 billion for Moderna if they are endorsed for nearly all Americans.

Those companies also may gain business from people who got other vaccines initially. In Britain which plans to offer boosters to everyone over 50 and other vulnerable people an expert panel has recommended that Pfizer’s shot be the primary choice with Moderna as the alternative.

Andersen expects Moderna which has no other products on the market to generate a roughly $13 billion profit next year from all COVID-19 vaccine sales if boosters are broadly authorized.

Potential vaccine profits are harder to estimate for Pfizer but company executives have said they expect their pre-tax adjusted profit margin from the vaccine to be in the “high 20s” as a percentage of revenue. That would translate to a profit of around $7 billion next year just from boosters based on Andersen’s sales prediction.

J&J and Europe’s AstraZeneca have said they don’t intend to profit from their COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic.

For Pfizer and Moderna the boosters could be more profitable than the original doses because they won’t come with the research and development costs the companies incurred to get the vaccines on the market in the first place.

WBB Securities CEO Steve Brozak said the booster shots will represent “almost pure profit” compared with the initial doses.

Drugmakers aren’t the only businesses that could see a windfall from delivering boosters. Drugstore chains CVS Health and Walgreens could bring in more than $800 million each in revenue according to Jeff Jonas a portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds.

Jonas noted that the drugstores may not face competition from mass vaccination clinics this time around and the chains are diligent about collecting customer contact information. That makes it easy to invite people back for boosters.

Drugmakers are also developing COVID-19 shots that target certain variants of the virus and say people might need annual shots like the ones they receive for the flu. All of that could make the vaccines a major recurring source of revenue.

The COVID-19 vaccines have already done much better than their predecessors.

Pfizer said in July it expects revenue from its COVID-19 vaccine to reach $33.5 billion this year an estimate that could change depending on the impact of boosters or the possible expansion of shots to elementary school children.

That would be more than five times the $5.8 billion racked up last year by the world’s most lucrative vaccine — Pfizer’s Prevnar13 which protects against pneumococcal disease.

It also would dwarf the $19.8 billion brought in last year by AbbVie’s rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira widely regarded as the world’s top-selling drug.

This bodes well for future vaccine development noted Erik Gordon a business professor at the University of Michigan.

Vaccines normally are nowhere near as profitable as treatments Gordon said. But the success of the COVID-19 shots could draw more drugmakers and venture capitalists into the field.

“The vaccine business is more attractive which for those of us who are going to need vaccines is good” Gordon said.

They popped home to see family at Christmas and have been stranded by the pandemic for the last nine months.

The band should have been touring the States this summer alongside country superstar Brad Paisley.

Instead they have been writing via zoom with UK and US songwriters playing a few local gigs and keeping fans up to date on social media.

With a return to the US in their sights for later next month the former Notley High School students hope to sign off with a final concert at Witham Public Hall on October 8.

They are also raising funds for Danaher Animal Home at Wethersfield.

Nate said: “We’re all massive animal fans and we’re really missing our cat Biscuit who’s back home in the States.

“When we visited Danaher we all fell in love with some of the gorgeous kittens and having seen the brilliant work they do we were very happy to support such a good cause.”

The lads have lived in Nashville for the last six years and have had hits including Love At First which has been streamed more than half a million times 11:11 and So Good.

It’s been such a tough year for us on the fundraising front that we are extremely grateful for all their support and want to say a big thank you to them and everyone who buys a ticket

They have also played at the world-renowned ""mother church"" of country music – the Ryman Auditorium.

They first hit the headlines when they appeared on The X-Factor in 2013.

Then called Next of Kin they moved judge Nicole Scherzinger to tears with their song Can’t Find Me which was co-written with mum Diane.

The experience spurred them on to seek success in America.

Still writing songs with her sons Diane joined them for the visit to Danaher.

The charity has lost over £190000 over the last 18 months due to the cancellation of fundraising events and the closure of its six shops at the height of the pandemic.

Danaher CEO Deborah Satchell said: “It was fabulous to show Nate Mark and Kieran around and great that they had the chance to meet some of our animals and say hallo to staff and volunteers.

“It’s been such a tough year for us on the fundraising front that we are extremely grateful for all their support and want to say a big thank you to them and everyone who buys a ticket.”

Essex County are at the Public Hall on October 8 at 8pm. Doors open at 7.30pm.

Tickets are £15 on 0345 017 8717 or from the visitor information centre at Witham Town Hall.",,,,,,,,,,,,

She’s been on my TV show The Big Joe Henry Variety Show and she’s been on my show on the beach in Seaside Heights.

When I came up with the Big Joe Henry Variety Show I wanted a variety side to the show to showcase both musicians and artists and also those entertainment acts that have a novelty affect.

Cara was the perfect addition to the show. She has some amazing ability to spell and talk backwards with lightning speed! At first I thought it was a setup. I thought maybe she had certain words that she studied and could do that with rapid fire delivery.

I was wrong audience members would shout out words and she without hesitation could spell them backwards then pronounce the word that she just spelled. The audience loved it and so did I; this was the novelty talent that I wanted. What a talent.

In real life Cara is a teacher in Freehold and she amuses her students with her backwards spelling and pronunciation talent. I shared a clip of her appearance on my TV show The Big Joe Henry Variety Show above.

Enjoy her performance. Thanks Cara for sharing your talent with us.

CEO Ron Donahue and his wife founded the company five years ago after long working as paramedics. Donahue who started working as an EMT in college worked his way up to the vice president of another ambulance company and eventually opted to strike out on his own.

""We had been in the ambulance business for 17 18 years basically all our careers"" he said. ""We decided to try something for ourselves and recruited partners we have had over the years.""

The company now has offices in LaPorte Highland Burns Harbor and Whiting.

""We've been blessed with great staff"" he said. ""Word has spread about how well we treat the patients. The growth has been grassroots.""

The company was signed to a multiyear deal by Cleveland-Cliffs to take over ambulance service at the steel mill in Burns Harbor and then was approached by BP about its refinery in Whiting the largest in the Midwest and in BP's portfolio worldwide. InHealth staffs ambulances at both industrial sites 24/7 as both are the size of small cities with thousands of workers and have inherent hazards that are unavoidable in working with steel that's weighted by the ton molten iron ore as hot as lava and highly flammable petrochemicals.

""We all live and work in this area and the steel mills employ so many people"" he said. ""It's excellent to be able to support the labor of thousands of people in the area. I've had family members who used to work at Bethlehem Steel that's now Cleveland-Cliffs. Family members made their livelihood at that mill working midnight shifts while I was growing up. Now it's the next generation. When I was a kid you couldn't go back in there so as just a personal thing it's great to be able to go in and see the mill.""

The company has boosted its staff including of dispatchers billers and drivers by about 35% over the past year to keep up with the growth. It also launched an EMT class in Valparaiso to prepare about 20 students per cohort to work in the industry.

""We kept the rate pretty low to get people in the door"" he said. ""We had a lot of interest from students who were unemployed people in the Region. We ended up filling the cohort and even had a waiting list. The next class got pushed back to January as there's a lot of people who want to get into the field.""

InHealth is looking to continue to add staff as it seeks to grow.

""We are rigorous in our hiring process but it has to be a good fit especially ethically and morally"" he said. ""The company is built on people. We don't make a product like skateboards. It's people caring for people so you have to hire the right people and get them in the right positions.""

Well it says so right there on the sides of the long nose and it also sports the decals in front of the rear wheels. The whole vehicle is finished in green with yellow accents rides closer to the road and sports drag radials at the back for extra traction.Despite the obvious modifications it can still haul some decent cargo in the bed that has otherwise remained open. But its biggest secret lies under the hood because as we already mentioned in the intro it boasts a V8 powertrain with forced induction. We know nothing about the engine but we reckon it produces hundreds of horses most of which are rather tame.That’s right if you came here hoping to see a record-setter then you will be disappointed to find out that it was schooled by some rather old yet powerful machines at the Hot Rod Drag Week 2021. This John Deere may look wild but it is a 12-second machine so in theory a stock Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat  not to mention a Super Stock or a Demon could put it in its corner without breaking a sweat.Now in case you missed it there was another dull-looking but extremely powerful Volvo 200 at the same event. The old Swedish grocery-getter is a full-blown dragster capable of posting dizzying times which it did as it ran the quarter mile in just 6.93 seconds at 203.3 mph (327.2 kph).

All the tractors and the combine are monitored through the John Deere Operations Center app – which James describes as a great management tool.

“John Deere seems to get things right and we bought one of the latest 8RX tractors earlier this year which has proved a real game changer. It was chosen for drilling but it is proving so versatile that it is preferred now for almost all the top-work.

“The Tuckwells team is always interested in what we are doing and we deal mainly with sales representative Steve Buckett and the service manager Glen Sweeting. Roger Gregory has serviced our combines for the past 30 years and is never phased by problems – he just gets on and fixes them.”

Impressive design

Combine operator Steven Mynott is also impressed by the combine’s design and describes its performance as fantastic. “I usually set up the combine using John Deere’s default settings for the crop then experiment with the optimisation. The design makes it easy to achieve high work rates with minimal losses and the sample quality is excellent.”

Steven said the HDX header’s contour following accuracy makes his job much easier. “On the third headland pass when travelling across the tramlines there is usually no need to reduce the speed as the header floats so well. It hugs the ground and in laid crops just tilting the header forward to push the knife down under the crop ensures nothing is left on the ground.”

Double knife sections achieve an excellent cut even in dense straw in damp conditions and Steven said that he often hasn’t realised when blade sections have been damaged until checking the combine the next morning as the cutting performance remains so good.

“Daily maintenance is quick and easy and the engine bay remains clear of dust and chaff. I cleaned the engine air filter for the first time after harvesting 500ha and although a small amount of dust was present it definitely didn’t need cleaning. For the first few days I opened the cooling pack door to check and clean it but it was always spotless so I don’t check it as often now.”"

According to a report from CBS News “more than 1600 people have been banned by Delta Air Lines since the federal government has required airplane passengers to wear masks.”

According to the CBS report there are now over 4000 people in the US on various airline banned lists but that number does not include those from American Airlines and Southwest airlines as those companies do not release their data.

“We’ve also asked other airlines to share their “no-fly” list to further protect airline employees across the industry – something we know is top of mind for you as well. A list of banned customers doesn’t work as well if that customer can fly with another airline” said a Delta Air Lines memo reviewed by CBS News that was sent to flight attendants.

The US Federal Aviation Administration has received 4385 reports from airlines this year about unruly passengers including 3199 reports involving passengers refusing to comply with federal mask requirements.

CBS says that “representatives of the FAA met this week with representatives of the airlines to discuss ways to reduce unruly behavior and asked the airlines to commit to more action.”

CBS also reports that “airlines started enforcing federal mask mandates in June 2020 and the FAA implemented its zero-tolerance policy regarding unruly behavior in January.

Among the five largest U.S. airlines Delta Air Lines (DAL -0.28%) is the only one that has not ordered the Boeing (BA -1.51%) 737 MAX. In recent years the airline giant has dealt primarily with Airbus (EADSY -2.05%) for new jets.

That said Delta has periodically held talks with Boeing about a potential 737 MAX order. In a recent webinar for the company's pilots CEO Ed Bastian stated ""There's certainly a place ..."" for the 737 MAX in Delta Air Lines' fleet. Let's take a look at what this news means for Boeing and Delta.

The speculation continues

During the roughly 20-month grounding of the 737 MAX order activity dried up. (The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year certainly didn't help.) A year ago with the FAA on the verge of recertifying the 737 MAX for commercial service Boeing started looking to line up new orders for its troubled jet. It was particularly eager to sell dozens of ""white tail"" aircraft that were built in 2019 and 2020 for customers that had subsequently canceled those orders.

At the time Reuters reported that Boeing had talked to Delta about taking perhaps 40 of those white-tail 737 MAX jets. That might have opened the door for the airline giant to place additional 737 MAX orders in the future. However Boeing and Delta never reached a deal and Boeing has now sold virtually all of its white tails.

Delta still has regular discussions with Boeing though and management clearly is interested in the 737 MAX -- at the right price. In fact Bastian (the Delta CEO) indicated in his recent remarks that he was surprised the two sides hadn't reached an agreement.

Major fleet needs at Delta

The biggest thing going in Boeing's favor is that Delta Air Lines will need a lot of narrow-body jets over the next decade. Last year the airline retired its 737-700 MD-88 and MD-90 fleets which totaled 87 aircraft at the beginning of 2020. It also plans to retire all 91 of its Boeing 717s by the end of 2025.

Beyond those confirmed retirements Delta's 55 Airbus A320s are over 25 years old on average its 116 Boeing 757s are 23 years old on average and its 77 Boeing 737-800s and 57 Airbus A319s average nearly 20 years of age. All of these fleet types will be due for retirement within 10 to 12 years at most.

On the flip side Delta took delivery of 25 new narrow-body jets last year and 22 more in the first half of 2021. Nevertheless Delta could need over 400 narrow-body jets over the next decade just to replace retiring aircraft on a one-for-one basis. Normal fleet growth and the carrier's plan to continue shrinking its regional fleet in favor of more mainline flying will add to its aircraft needs.

This creates an enticing opportunity for Boeing to make a splash with a sizable 737 MAX deal. On the other hand as of June 30 Delta already had outstanding orders for 206 narrow-bodies along with options for 100 more A321neos and 50 more A220s. Last month it exercised 30 of its A321neo options. In short the carrier has already made arrangements for most of its near-term fleet needs.

Delta is serious but not desperate

Within Boeing's 737 MAX family the 737 MAX 8 could be a good fit in Delta Air Lines' future fleet. Among the narrow-body jets that Delta has purchased over the past decade there's a yawning gap between the 130-seat A220-300 and the 180-seat 737-900ER. The 737 MAX 8 -- with room for about 160 to 165 seats in Delta's configuration -- would fill that need nicely.

This likely explains Delta's continuing interest in the 737 MAX. However Boeing has been trying to shore up pricing for the 737 MAX whereas Delta Air Lines has a reputation as a ruthless negotiator with respect to aircraft purchases. That will make it harder to reach a deal.

Delta doesn't need to replace its A320s and 737-800s (its current midsize narrow-body jets) immediately. As a result it can afford to wait for Boeing to drop its asking price before placing any orders. Moreover during the same webinar Bastian said that Delta sees further opportunities to buy ""gently used"" aircraft like the 29 used Boeing 737-900ERs that it agreed to purchase last quarter.

Indeed the pandemic has created a glut of used jets with at least 15 years of life left depressing prices. Thus unless Boeing has a radical change of heart with respect to pricing investors shouldn't expect Delta to place a 737 MAX order soon. The airline would be better off tapping into the ample supply of cheap used jets if Boeing doesn't offer deep discounts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZ3JlZWtjaXR5dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMjYvYXRoZW5zLWFpcnBvcnQtZGVsdGEtYWlybGluZXMv0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly9ncmVla2NpdHl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8yNi9hdGhlbnMtYWlycG9ydC1kZWx0YS1haXJsaW5lcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Athens Airport: Delta Airlines Brake Problems During Landing Forces Emergency Response,"An alarm was signaled at Eleftherios Venizelos Airport after a Delta Airlines plane was forced to land despite brake problems.

According to Mega TV the Delta aircraft was flying from Atlanta to Athens and reported a brake problem to the control tower.

Specifically the plane with 248 people on board had overheated brakes.

Firefighters and ambulance staff quickly rushed to the spot.

The plane carrying 248 passengers landed at 10:56 a.m. local time (0756 GMT) without any assistance in the form of special foam as had been reported in some media. Everyone on the plane is OK.

The benefits of staging is that cramped messy and older-looking homes can have their interior quickly transformed for photographs and home opens to raise the selling price – however this comes at a cost not every seller is able to afford.

For a cheaper option staging has now gone virtual.

Although not a new concept Arcadia Group Sales Manager Brett Hancock said digital staging technology had drastically improved.

TheNightly Get in front of tomorrow's news for FREE Journalism for the curious Australian across politics business culture and opinion. READ NOW

“I’ve been using digital staging for probably the last six or seven years but in the last two or three years it’s certainly gotten a lot better and it’s just getting better as technology progresses” he said.

“In the early days of digital staging it was very basic and probably did more damage than anything I would say but it does give a much better perspective of the property.”

Mr Hancock said digital staging was specifically useful for apartments – as moving furniture was a lot more difficult – and was more affordable in comparison to physical staging which could cost upwards of $3000.

“Real staging is quite expensive but it’s obviously the best option because when people do come to look at the property they can actually see the furniture in the home and sit on it feel it see the sizes and how it works in the space” he said.

“But this is the next best thing – to stage virtually you can do it for $300 to $500.”

Century 21 Advance Realty Principal and Director Paul Duffy said his team started incorporating digital staging at a time when there were no physical services in the South West.

“It was quite an expensive ordeal to stage a property” he said. “Back then it was over $5000 a house for four weeks to stage.

“It was a lot cheaper to pay $100 to stage a house with virtual furniture than it was for physical staging.”

Mr Duffy said the online interest of a home increased tenfold when the property was staged – whether physical or digital – compared to an empty home.

“They’re seeing a dream” he said. “Buyers go through hundreds of houses on the internet and if it has been staged you will get more views with potential buyers clicking through every image to really study the house which is more likely to lead to a phone call.”

Mr Duffy said technological advancements meant even he struggled to tell the difference between physical and virtual furniture on his own listings.

“Everything like coffee tables flowers on benches and pictures on walls – when we first started five years ago some of that looked a little bit tacky and it just wasn’t quite right” he said.

Mr Hancock said using digital staging was a balance of exposing the potential of the home without overdoing it and misleading buyers.

“It definitely is an effective tool as long as it’s used correctly” he said. “You don’t want to put a king-sized bed with bedsides into a property that can only fit a single bed so it needs to be done effectively and we need to be accurate in the way it’s presented.

“That’s something that you do need to have an understanding of because it can give people the wrong impression of the size of the property if it’s not used correctly.”

According to Mr Hancock the ability to quickly shift between different styles to better suit potential buyers is another big advantage not available in the past.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If you're planning a big trip overseas one important item to sort out is how you'll pay for purchases. You might figure you can just bring your credit cards along and use them as you would in the United States.

You can do that -- and in fact a credit card is a smart way to pay since you don't need to carry much cash. But there are some problems and additional expenses you can run into if you aren't prepared.

1. Some credit cards charge foreign transaction fees so bring one that doesn't

A foreign transaction fee is a fee for purchases made with international merchants. The standard amount is 3%. With a card that charges that much you'd pay an extra $30 on top of every $1000 in spending abroad.

Fortunately there are plenty of credit cards with no foreign transaction fees. Travel rewards credit cards generally don't charge them and even some cash back cards don't have this type of fee.

Before you travel outside the country check if your credit cards have foreign transaction fees. If you don't have a card without this fee it's worth applying for one to save money.

2. You may need to notify your credit card issuer you're traveling

Some credit card issuers allow cardholders to set up travel alerts to let the card issuer know where you're going. That way when you start making purchases in another country they don't look like potential credit card fraud and get blocked.

Several major card issuers including Chase and American Express have phased out travel alerts in recent years. You might find that you don't need to create a travel alert with your credit card. However there are still many card issuers that use travel alerts. It's best to check in case yours does.

3. Visa and Mastercard are the most widely accepted card networks

There are four credit card payment networks: Visa Mastercard Discover and American Express. You can see which network a credit card belongs to by looking at the logo on the bottom-right corner of the card. In the United States all four networks are widely accepted. Most merchants that accept credit cards accept cards from all networks. That isn't always true overseas.

In terms of international acceptance Visa and Mastercard are the best credit cards to have. Discover and American Express are working on wider acceptance abroad but they're lagging behind.

4. Don't let the merchant convert the transaction to dollars

Some businesses abroad ask if you want to pay in the local currency or U.S. dollars. If you choose dollars the merchant uses a feature called dynamic currency conversion to change the currency of the transaction.

This may seem convenient and help you keep track of expenses but it's a bad deal. The merchant gets an exchange rate that's favorable to them. As the customer you get the short end of the stick and you may also get charged a fee for using the service.

It's always better to pay in the local currency. You get a much better exchange rate by letting your credit card issuer handle the currency conversion.

5. Many international merchants don't accept credit cards

Credit card acceptance is the norm in the United States but it varies in other places. In general big businesses usually accept credit cards. And in major cities credit card acceptance tends to be high among merchants of all sizes. In small and mid-sized cities it can be hit or miss. You may find that many businesses only accept cash and their own country's debit cards.

Carry some of the local currency with you just in case you need it. It's also a good idea to check online regarding credit card acceptance in the country you're visiting.

No one wants to have a credit card get declined on vacation or to come home to a bill full of extra fees. Now that you know more about using credit cards overseas you can navigate your international trip without surprise issues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3RlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMjYvbG9uZG9ucy1kaWNlLXJhaXNlcy0xMjJtLWF0LWEtNDAwbS12YWx1YXRpb24tZm9yLWl0cy1pbnRlbGxpZ2VudC1ldmVudC1kaXNjb3ZlcnktYW5kLWJvb2tpbmctcGxhdGZvcm0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,London's Dice raises $122M at a $400M valuation for its intelligent event discovery and booking platform,"COVID-19 really put the kibosh on live events in the last 18 months but in the world of tech it also meant that live event startups that found a way to survive and grow throughout the period got a lot of attention. In the latest development Dice — a London company that has built a platform to help people discover and attend live events that might be of interest to them — has raised $122 million a funding round that sources tell us values the company at $400 million.

SoftBank Vision Fund 2 is leading the round a Series C with iPod “father” and Nest co-founder Tony Fadell (by way of Future Shape) Blisce French entrepreneur Xavier Niel Mirabaud Cassius and Evolution — all previous backers — also participating. (Previous investors in the company also include DeepMind co-founders Mustafa Suleyman and Demis Hassabis notable given the company’s early focus on data science and recommendation algorithms.) Prior to this round Dice had raised around $45 million according to PitchBook estimates.

Dice focuses these days mostly on live music and in the peak of the pandemic as everyone was locked down it rejigged its business model to focus on livestreaming: now with some 6400 livestreamed events and thousands more in-person events under its belt to appeal to a wider audience with a wider range of needs it is expanding around a multimodal strategy providing options to discover and attend/buy tickets to both streamed and in-person live events.

The new funds will be going toward expanding Dice’s geographic footprint with a special focus on the U.S. since this is where Dice’s business seems to be growing the fastest at the moment as cities and consumers gradually come out of pandemic hibernation to spend time together again in some cases at a frenetic pace. Phil Hutcheon Dice’s CEO and co-founder said that in New York alone over 1 million people used Dice to find and attend events in the single month of August.

(Sidenote on investors and founders: Hutcheon co-founded Dice in 2014 with Ustwo the agency that also spawned Monument Valley helped incubate Tray.io and has worked on number of other creative projects alongside its digital agency business: I’ve confirmed that Ustwo which hadn’t had an operational role in Dice in years has also sold its shares in the startup in this round.)

Giants like Ticketmaster Live Nation StubHub and Eventbrite dominate the landscape for ticketing for events but Hutcheon contends that these and other legacy platforms are too static and not fit for the modern age and specifically modern demands.

They are expensive both for event organizers and attendees to use and they have been slow to address both some of the more damaging parts of the event industry such as ticket touting and counterfeiting; and some of the more promising aspects of it such as providing better insights to event organizers based on all the data that can been gleaned from the average event browser and consumer.

“The world has been opaque around live performance but it’s now 2021” Hutcheon said in an interview. “The answer to shift it all is transparency. [Legacy ticket companies] make it all much more complicated than it should be.”

Dice’s answer has been to focus on three areas Hutcheon said. First is making ticketing easy and secure for users and venues. Second is discovery: making sure people who are interested in a particular performance are given reliable recommendations of other events they might like in locations that are realistic for them to visit. And third is community. In Dice’s case this originally (and still) means finding like-minded people on the site as well as visiting Dice and knowing what your friends or people like you might be interested to see. Now on top of this is a wider mandate for community Hutcheon said.

“We didn’t think about it in the beginning but loneliness has been a big issue” he said noting that one-third of 17-21-year-olds a sweet consumer spot for the company have reported loneliness during the pandemic. “Getting out to see culture brings people together.”

Dice took a very tech approach to addressing all of this. First it focused on building a network of venues and promoters with which it works very closely on ticketing — currently there are over 3600 of them covering not just music venues and promoters but also theaters and their ecosystems. Alongside this it has built a data set of its own created around those who visit the site and shop for events which in turn is used to help build and recommend events to “lookalike” visitors to Dice.

Then the tech stack that this sits on is focused around digital mobile-based ticketing to prevent reselling and counterfeiting and provide a legal way to resell tickets where the venue can refund a purchase and resell itself over Dice. It continually provides analytics to venues artists and promoters so that they can better understand how and where they are seeing demand for specific gigs and artists when to consider larger or smaller venues and more.

All of this helps Dice stand out in what is otherwise a pretty crowded market that has on top of that been toiling through dicey times. And just like Hopin and its huge boost due to virtual events it’s helped Dice attract investors.

“The concert business is a tangled mess of archaic tools and taxing ‘industry standards’ where artists are paid last. Venues shell out for marketing and are beholden to ticket conglomerates. Fans have to hunt for shows and regularly buy overpriced tickets from secondary markets or scalpers. This doesn’t make sense!” said Fadell in a statement. “DICE reengineers the entire live industry not just a part of it: Venues are connected to fans and artists. Artists get transparency access and control. Fans easily discover local shows and global livestreams and buy scalper-safe tickets with a single click.”

All this was neither quick nor easy to build and scale. Dice now active in dozens of cities has been deliberate about those city launches: It chooses a place to build relationships with multiple venues so that as Hutcheon described it a rich picture of a city’s music (and other) events can be sketched out and filled in — and subsequently feed the recommendations for more events. The recommendations are a lucrative part of its business with discovery driving more than 40% of tickets sold on Dice.

Hutcheon believes that Dice’s recommendation algorithms “are a huge advantage” but so is its selectivity. “We’re pretty careful about what gets onto Dice. The big question for us was how do you scale curation? Our solution has been to partner with the best organizations and venues and great bookers or artists.”

Pointedly Dice doesn’t tap social graph data from other platforms which partly meant that Dice took some 3.5 years to get its own platform off the ground.

Building its own dataset Hutcheon said “was seen as stupid at the beginning. ‘You could get there so much faster if you used Facebook’s Open Graph’ people told us. But now it’s seen as smart for a couple of reasons: it gives us more control but it’s also pro-privacy. If a site visitor doesn’t want recommendations and only wants to see what is popular then that’s fine too.”

Dice doesn’t tap social data from other platforms but it does leverage them to bring more audience to its service: it counts Spotify among its partners in that regard.

The next stages for Dice will be about not just expanding to more cities and netting in more live in-person events — provided pandemic R-numbers being controllable — but also to continue innovating on the livestreaming side. There is a lot of room for improvement there.

“We were seeing artists on Instagram doing pretty amateurish lame performances so we simply appealed to artists by saying: Get paid and do this properly” Hutcheon said. The focus so far has been not just on any performance but trying to create iconic and distinctive ones: Think Nick Cave playing in London’s Alexandra Palace.

“The fact that people were buying tickets in advance for livestreams made me realize that people needing things to look forward to” he added. He still thinks that will continue even as venue doors reopen. Dice’s live events data shows that for in-person events where tickets are purchased on its platform about 80%-85% of all tickets were sold to people living in major cities close to the event. But when it came to virtual livestreams only 39% came from major cities: “Older consumers or younger kids who couldn’t have gone to see Nick Cave in Ally Pally.”

Now they can and that kind of “special” stream that isn’t a replication of anything a ticket buyer could see in person will be what Dice focuses on ahead. “This why we built the livestreaming stack. The future is hybrid broadcasting” said Hutcheon.

“We believe DICE’s technology has the capacity to transform the future of live entertainment” said Yanni Pipilis managing partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers in a statement. “Alongside the flexibility and security of seamless ticketing the platform connects fans artists and venues in a completely new way … We are excited to partner with DICE to help create remarkable event experiences for fans all over the world.”

Dice says that it is currently on track to have 49000 artists and creators using its platform by the end of 2022.",,,,,,

(WAFF) - Ten fires were intentionally set across Madison county over the weekend. Police connected one man to all ten of those fires set over a span of 3 hours. All ten fires happened between 5:20 pm and 8:36 pm on Saturday.

Plato’s Closet in Huntsville was one of the stores that sustained fire damage after the multiple fires on Saturday.

WAFF went to the scene of Plato’s Closet in Huntsville. According to store employees that we spoke to the store sustained smoke and water damage. While it’s dry now at one point the store had two to three inches of water due to firefighters and sprinklers. The smoke and water also damaged the inventory at the business.

”We believe they were intentionally set by one suspect that we do have in custody. We don’t believe there are additional suspects” said Huntsville Police PIO Rosalind White.

The employees believe the fire was started using lighter fluid and a lighter. The store will be closed for at least a few weeks.

“We don’t know what’s in his head we don’t know what led him to do this other than he told investigators he felt like this is something that he was led to do” said Brent Patterson. “Whatever that means I don’t know but we’re going to use every available resource we have to make sure it doesn’t happen again with this individual.”

Huntsville police say Hubbert is now facing six additional charges from Huntsville Police. According to HPD investigators charged Hubbert with six counts of attempted arson on Friday for the other fires he is accused of intentionally setting in Huntsville.

According to Madison Police Hubbert now faces two charges of attempted arson. Those charges are in connection with the incidents at Champy’s and Publix in Madison.

According to Brent Patterson with MCSO Hubbert is now charged by the Madison Co. Sheriff’s Office with first-degree arson connected to the Dollar General fire on Winchester Road.

Connecting the dots

Dollar General Fire on Winchester Road in Huntsville (none)

The Madison County Sheriff’s Office the Huntsville Police Department and the Madison City Police Department have all opened an arson investigation into the fires.

HPD officials say they believe all the fires were set intentionally. An investigation is underway to determine a connection.

HPD arrested 24-year-old Nicholas Tremaine Hubbert on Saturday night. He has been charged with arson and booked into the Madison County Jail with a $60000 bond.

The Madison Police Department announced that it was investigating fires at the Champy’s and the Publix on Madison Blvd. Both businesses reported fires on Saturday night. The department said it will be working with adjoining police jurisdiction to investigate the alleged arson.

The Madison County Sheriff’s Office says it believes one suspect is connected to all ten fires in the Huntsville-Madison area. The sheriff’s office says it has evidence that proves Hubbert was connected to all 10 arsons that happened Saturday night.

The first call came in at 5:20 pm for a fire at Walmart on 6140 University Drive. Then Madison Fire and Rescue received calls for Publix and Champy’s at 6:02 pm and 6:07 pm. Police say Hubbert proceeded to Aldi Dollar General at 1604 Winchester Road Kroger Dollar General at 125 Winchester Road Plato’s Closet McDonald’s and ending at Dick’s Sporting Goods at 8:36 pm.

Huntsville Fire and Rescue Fire Chief Howard McFarlen says crews were efficient as possible.

“The trucks were dispatched to Aldi’s for smoke in the building. On the way they passed the Dollar General store that they could see was on fire. The captain made a great decision to split the resources to send part of them to Aldi and part of them to stop there” said McFarlen.

He says HFR had enough manpower to manage the fires.

“We were really close to start calling in overtime personnel. We were handling everything but again we saw and pattern and didn’t know when it was going to stop” said McFarlen.

North Escambia’s newest Dollar General is now open as another one is under construction and two more are planned in the area.

A quiet grand opening was held Friday for a new Dollar General at the corner of Highway 297A and West Kingsfield Road in Cantonment. Escambia County granted a conditional use to allow the 8960 square foot store in an area that is zoned for low density mixed-use up 6000 square feet. A conditional use in the zoning category allows for retail sales up to 35000 square feet.

The Escambia County Board of Adjustment approved the conditional use with the stipulation that the store have a residential area design with wood siding and a shingled roof.

Construction is nearing completion on a new 9291 square foot Dollar General store in the 7000 block of North Century Boulevard in Century. An opening date has not been announced.

Dollar General’s development company has development applications for two more North Escambia stores in the works. One is on 1.89 acres on the west side of Highway 29 between Ten Mile Road and Roberts Road just north of Kingline Equipment.

The second is in Walnut Hill at 7100 Highway 97 on the north side of the intersection of South Highway 99. There are currently two residential structures on the 5.3 acre property which is across the road from a former farm supply retail business.

Hesperia Deputy City Manager Rachel Molina told the Daily Press that Big Lots is moving into the old Orchard Supply Hardware building in the Midtown Square shopping center.

“Big Lots tenant improvements were approved early this month but they still haven’t pulled permits” said Molina about the store which will be located near the Stater Bros. supermarket.

Big Lots was once located near the corner of Main Street and Ninth Avenue in Hesperia but Molina said the store closed some years ago.

Ace Hardware meanwhile is preparing for its final inspection to obtain its certificate of occupancy as the company prepares to move into the former Dollar General building Molina said.

In 2018 Dollar General officials closed the Hesperia store on the corner of G Avenue and Main Street as part of the company’s “continual review” on how to meet customer’s needs Dollar General spokeswoman Crystal Ghassemi told the Daily Press at the time.

The company also shuttered its store near the corner of Lorene Drive and Seventh Street in Victorville as part of the company’s review Ghassemi said.

In 2013 Dollar General added 2963 square feet to the existing 6286-square-foot building in Hesperia that once house a Hollywood Video.

Hollywood Video filed for bankruptcy and closed its doors in 2010 after companies like Netflix and Redbox increased competition.

(WTOC) - Police continue to search for a suspect who tied victims up during an armed robbery in Richmond Hill.

Richmond Hill Police Captain Brad Sykes said it’s been several years since anything like this happened in Richmond Hill. He says no one was seriously injured but the nature of this robbery is odd.

Capt. Sykes said a man entered the store right before closing and tried to get two employees to open the safe but they couldn’t. He then tied them up with rope or twine he found in the store.

One of the employees grabbed the gun the suspect sat down but the suspect grabbed it back and hit the employee in the head. Police say it’s unclear whether the gun was real or not.

There were two customers in the store but Capt. Sykes says they didn’t see much.

He said this is not common in the area. The last robbery he remembers was several years ago at a gas station near the interstate.

“We rarely have this type of thing happen in Richmond Hill and for a suspect to target a Dollar Store of all places...seems kind of odd” Capt. Sykes said. As far as police know the suspect didn’t get anything. Police have no leads now but they are optimistic about the investigation.

Capt. Sykes said the only information on the suspect they have is that he is a Black male and he was wearing a COVID-19 style mask.

Several people including a business owner next door were shocked to hear what happened.

“It really concerns me because we feel so free and we feel like especially in a small community like we’re in and it breaks my heart and scares me too” said Ervin Smith who lives in Pembroke.

Ervin Smith comes here often.

“About two or three times a week to this Dollar Tree.”

And Jason Wasileski owns a tattoo shop a few doors down. He says his store had just finished closing and they left about 20 minutes before the robbery.

“9:00 is not you know. It was 9:20 or something. I’m here all the time at 9:20” said Wasileski.

Both of them say this area isn’t known for this kind of crime.

“It’s kind of like a sleepy town. You don’t expect nothin’ like that around here. You don’t usually hear nothing about nothing like that. It’s pretty wild for sure” said Wasileski.

“Well it scares you especially the older you get and I think about the danger that could happen” said Smith.

Wasileski says his store is taking all the precautions they can to make sure they’re ready for anything.

“We’re just like I said hoping for the best and preparing for the worst so that’s about it.”

The Richmond Hill Police department says they’re working with descriptions from the store employees that witnessed what happened. They have no leads at the moment but they are optimistic about the investigation.

(WAFF) - Ten fires were intentionally set across Madison county over the weekend. Police connected one man to all ten of those fires set over a span of 3 hours. All ten fires happened between 5:20 pm and 8:36 pm on Saturday.

Plato’s Closet in Huntsville was one of the stores that sustained fire damage after the multiple fires on Saturday.

WAFF went to the scene of Plato’s Closet in Huntsville. According to store employees that we spoke to the store sustained smoke and water damage. While it’s dry now at one point the store had two to three inches of water due to firefighters and sprinklers. The smoke and water also damaged the inventory at the business.

”We believe they were intentionally set by one suspect that we do have in custody. We don’t believe there are additional suspects” said Huntsville Police PIO Rosalind White.

The employees believe the fire was started using lighter fluid and a lighter. The store will be closed for at least a few weeks.

“We don’t know what’s in his head we don’t know what led him to do this other than he told investigators he felt like this is something that he was led to do” said Brent Patterson. “Whatever that means I don’t know but we’re going to use every available resource we have to make sure it doesn’t happen again with this individual.”

Huntsville police say Hubbert is now facing six additional charges from Huntsville Police. According to HPD investigators charged Hubbert with six counts of attempted arson on Friday for the other fires he is accused of intentionally setting in Huntsville.

According to Madison Police Hubbert now faces two charges of attempted arson. Those charges are in connection with the incidents at Champy’s and Publix in Madison.

According to Brent Patterson with MCSO Hubbert is now charged by the Madison Co. Sheriff’s Office with first-degree arson connected to the Dollar General fire on Winchester Road.

Connecting the dots

Dollar General Fire on Winchester Road in Huntsville (none)

The Madison County Sheriff’s Office the Huntsville Police Department and the Madison City Police Department have all opened an arson investigation into the fires.

HPD officials say they believe all the fires were set intentionally. An investigation is underway to determine a connection.

HPD arrested 24-year-old Nicholas Tremaine Hubbert on Saturday night. He has been charged with arson and booked into the Madison County Jail with a $60000 bond.

The Madison Police Department announced that it was investigating fires at the Champy’s and the Publix on Madison Blvd. Both businesses reported fires on Saturday night. The department said it will be working with adjoining police jurisdiction to investigate the alleged arson.

The Madison County Sheriff’s Office says it believes one suspect is connected to all ten fires in the Huntsville-Madison area. The sheriff’s office says it has evidence that proves Hubbert was connected to all 10 arsons that happened Saturday night.

The first call came in at 5:20 pm for a fire at Walmart on 6140 University Drive. Then Madison Fire and Rescue received calls for Publix and Champy’s at 6:02 pm and 6:07 pm. Police say Hubbert proceeded to Aldi Dollar General at 1604 Winchester Road Kroger Dollar General at 125 Winchester Road Plato’s Closet McDonald’s and ending at Dick’s Sporting Goods at 8:36 pm.

Huntsville Fire and Rescue Fire Chief Howard McFarlen says crews were efficient as possible.

“The trucks were dispatched to Aldi’s for smoke in the building. On the way they passed the Dollar General store that they could see was on fire. The captain made a great decision to split the resources to send part of them to Aldi and part of them to stop there” said McFarlen.

He says HFR had enough manpower to manage the fires.

“We were really close to start calling in overtime personnel. We were handling everything but again we saw and pattern and didn’t know when it was going to stop” said McFarlen.

It was the apartment building itself—a grand-looking mansion on the Rue de Braque in the heart of Paris‘s Le Marais district—that seduced Thomas Fournier. “I found the main courtyard magnificent with its Louis XVI portal and fluted Doric columns” he recalls. The complex called Le Petit Hôtel de Mesmes was restructured in the early 18th century by the king’s architect Germain Boffrand. The interior of his 500-square-foot unit however told a much different story—one of the 1980s. “No trace of the past had been preserved” says Fournier. The flooring was laminate there was carpet upstairs the kitchen featured melamine countertops and in the middle of it all was a monumental concrete staircase. Fortunately Fournier who founded his own architecture and interior studio in 2020 after working for three and a half years as a project manager for Laura Gonzalez’s agency saw the glass half full. “It was a great playground for an architect” he says.

Fournier chose to redo everything except the location of the existing mezzanine which is where the bedroom and bathroom are located. He replaced the laminate flooring downstairs with solid oak chevron and added cornices in the ceiling and lacquered wood baseboards. The eyesore staircase was demolished and replaced with a vintage helical one from 1900 sourced from Normandy which Fournier positioned near the double-height window.

With the sad 1980s remnants gone the designer got personal. The bathroom evokes his Italian roots and memories of his grandparents’ home with its new red marble wall pedestal sink and hand-painted Tuscan shower tiles. Fournier looked primarily to Italian architects from the 1930s to 1970s such as Renzo Mongiardino Piero Portaluppi and Carlo Mollino for inspiration. “Reminders of my origins make me feel good” he says.

Armchairs Vico Magistretti; Lamps Jean Roger; Lithograph (above sofa) Alejandro Otero.

Red Vase (on coffee table) Jean Roger; Brass Lamp (on shelf) Laura Gonzalez.

In an effort to maximize the main living area Fournier designed a large bookcase clad in plaster that fits perfectly around the sofa. The shelves were made to be extra-large so he could display vases and tall lamps (he added electrical outlets to create a bright atmosphere rather than rely on stark LED lighting). “A library is an infinite space of expression” he says. The structure saves space but it also sets the scene for staging in a very symmetrical way (peep the two lithographs and wall lights on either side). “I imagined this space like a cinematographic set” explains the designer.

Lithograph (reflected in the mirror screen) Jesus Raphael Soto.

Mirrors were an important part of that vision. The beveled glass screen reflects the natural light streaming in from the 13-foot-high window. In the tiny bedroom upstairs a similar mirror helps hide the dressing area while also making the room appear twice as big as it really is. “The challenge was to make the upper space pleasant to live in” says Fournier.

Wall Light Jean Roger.

Painting the walls dark green gave the lofted area an impactful presence but it also creates a cocoonlike effect that’s prime for sleeping. To block out the morning light and isolate the area from the hangout space below he added interior shutters. Depending on the position of the doors the panels alter how green the walls appear.

Chairs Martin Visser et Walter Antonis.

The dining area is meant to feel like a lounge space. It’s complete with a custom bench that allows Fournier to fit a total of 12 people around the 1930s Italian table (which also got extendable leaves). Nearby: one of two plaster lamps designed in the style of Jean-Michel Frank—a treasured possession. “I also love my collection of ceramics by Barbara Billoud who works incredibly poetically with raku (a Japanese enameling technique)” he says. The living room is decorated with Dedar Pierre Frey and Jim Thompson fabrics.

Fruit Basket Yvon Roy. Candleholder Paul Milet.

The kitchen on the other hand boasts IKEA cupboards. Fournier topped the oak veneer cabinets with a bespoke Sarrancolin marble countertop that matches the pale green walls. “I wanted to lend prestige to an interior that was doubtless very beautiful in the past but devastated by time and transformations” he says. Now it’s got that grand chalet vibe just minus the square footage.

To share awareness for the beauty and history of our art of Technical Analysis of financial markets in this educational post I look at the six fundamental principles of Dow Theory applied to Bitcoin and its current macro/local trends.1. Markets Discount Everything2. The Market has 3 Trends3. Major Trends have 3 Phases4. Markets must Confirm Each Other5. Volume must confirm the Trend6. A trend is assumed to be in effect until is shows clear signals it has reversed“ Charles Dow and his partner Edward Jones founded Dow Jones & Company in 1882.Most technicians and students of the markets concur that much of what we call technical analysis today has its origins in theories first proposed by Dow around the turn of the century.Dow published his ideas in a series of editorials he wrote for the Wall Street Journal.Most technicians today recognize and assimilate Dow's basic ideas whether or not they recognize the source.Dow Theory still forms the cornerstone of the study of technical analysis even in the face of today's sophisticated computer technology and the proliferation of newer and supposedly better technical indicators.On July 3 1884 Dow published the first stock market average composed of the closing prices of eleven stocks: nine railroad companies and two manufacturing firms.Dow felt that these eleven stocks provided a good indication of the economic health of the country.In 1897 Dow determined that two separate indices would better represent that health and created a 12 stock industrial index and a 20 stock rail index.By 1928 the industrial index had grown to include 30 stocks the number at which stands today.The editors of The Wall Street Journal have updated the list numerous times in the ensuing years adding a utility index in 1929.In 1984 the year that marked the one hundredth anniversary of Dow's first publication the Market Technicians Association presented a Gorham-silver bowl to Dow Jones & Co.According to the MTA the award recognized ""the lasting contrbution that Charles Dow made to the field of investment analysis.His index the forerunner of what today is regarded as the leading barometer of stock market activity remains a vital tool for market technicians 80 years after his death.Unfortunately for us Dow never wrote a book on his theory.Instead he set down his ideas of stock market behavior in a series of editorials that The Wall Street Journal published around the turn of the century.In 1903 the year after Dow's death S.A Nelson compiled these essays into a book entitled The ABC of Stock Speculation.In that work Nelson first coined the term ""Dow's Theory.""Richard Russell who wrote the introduction to a 1978 reprint compared Dow's contribution to stock market theory with Freud's contribution to psychiatry.In 1922 William Peter Hamilton (Dow's associate and successor at the Journal) categorized and published Dow's tenets in a book entitled The Stock Market Barometer.Robert Rhea developed the theory even furtherIn the Dow Theory (New York: Barron's) published in 1932.Dow applied his theoretical work to the stock market averages that he created; namely the Industrials and the Rails.However most of his analytical ideas apply equally well to all market averages. “John J. Murphy Technical Analysis for the Financial Markets 1999 Page 23-24yemala",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMjYvc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LWZ1dHVyZXMtb3Blbi10by1jbG9zZS1uZXdzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dow rises tech shares drag down broader market as 10-year Treasury yield tops 1.5%,"watch now

U.S. stocks were split on Monday as Treasury yields rose and traders braced for the final week of a volatile September. The S&P 500 slipped by 0.28% to 4443.11 and the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.52% to close at 14969.97 as tech stocks struggled. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 71.37 points to 34869.37 as energy stocks and bank shares pushed higher.

CNBC

The divergence for the major averages came as Treasury yields rose. The 10-year Treasury yield increased on economic optimism and inflation fears briefly topping 1.5% on Monday. That's the highest since June and up from 1.30% at the end of August. ""We believe that these [bond market] moves have provided the spark for another 'Value Rip' across equity markets. In our view the direction of longer-term interest rates should remain the #1 driver of market returns sector rotation & thematic performance in the weeks ahead"" Chris Senyek of Wolfe Research said in a note to clients. The economic recovery trade was also supported by stronger-than-expected reading for durable goods orders on Monday.

Major tech stocks including Alphabet Apple and Nvidia were lower in Monday's session weighing on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Tech stocks are seen as sensitive to rising yields because increased debt costs can hinder their growth and higher rates can make their future cash flows appear less valuable. But stocks linked to the economic comeback increased as tech shares fell with U.S. Covid cases continuing to roll over. U.S. cases averaged about 120000 per day over the last week according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University down from a 7-day average of more than 166000 cases at the peak of this latest wave in early September. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said on Sunday that he thought the U.S. could return to normal ""within a year"" though annual vaccinations might be needed. Carnival Corp rose 3.7% and United Airlines added 0.6%. Shares of Boeing jumped 1.3%. The rise in yields appeared to boost financial stocks on Monday with the KBW Bank Index climbing 2.9%. Shares of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase rose more than 2% making them some of the best performers in the Dow. Another bright spot for the market was energy with stocks like Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum climbing as WTI crude continued its September run topping $75 a barrel. Natural gas prices also rose on Monday as investors monitored concerns of an energy shortage in Europe.

The moves for energy show there are ""concerns over supply in both the crude oil and natural gas markets"" said Adam Karpf a portfolio manager and managing director at CIBC Private Wealth. ""We've talked in the past about this really being a demand-driven recovery and rally with the reopening trade and so that is part of what's going on but I think the most recent uplift is also a function of supply concerns.""

Government shutdown?

Investors are monitoring the progress in Washington as lawmakers try to prevent a government shutdown a default on U.S. debt and the possible collapse of President Joe Biden's sweeping economic agenda. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that she expects the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill to pass this week but voting on the legislation may be pushed back from its original Monday timeline. Congress must pass a new budget by the end of September to avoid a shutdown and lawmakers must also figure out a way to increase or suspend the debt ceiling in October before the U.S. would default on its debt for the first time. ""DC will start garnering more attention in the coming weeks as the political calculus around passing infrastructure bills and the debt ceiling debate likely guarantees some market moving headlines"" wrote Tavis McCourt institutional equity strategist at Raymond James.

Richard Duane Dow 60 was booked into Douglas County Jail after the jury returned a verdict in a two-day trial this week.

Dow was arrested Aug. 24 2019 in connection with a crash that occurred along Highway 395 three miles north of the state line.

While his priors were not admitted into evidence Dow has served prison time for felony driving under the influence.

Under Nevada law any subsequent conviction for DUI is punishable by a mandatory prison sentence of up to 2-15 years and a minimum $2000 fine.

Attorney John Oakes challenged the breathylizer test Dow took on the grounds that Nevada Highway Patrol trooper didn’t make sure his mouth was clear of foreign objects and that it wasn’t administered within the required two hours.

•A Carson City woman received a suspended 1-4-year prison sentence for principal to sale of a controlled substance.

Brittany Ludington 29 was arrested on May 8 in connection with a March 20 drug transaction.

Her attorney said she served a jail sentence in Carson City on a drug charge and was released to Douglas County on Sept. 17.

• A Gardnerville woman involved in a Feb. 25 2020 drug transaction was not arrested on a warrant until last summer when she said she’d been clean for several months.

Mariah Lanai Kizer 41 is facing up to 1-4 years in prison and a $5000 fine at her Oct. 25 sentencing.

An initial report that she was arrested in 2020 was incorrect.

• A Texas couple faces sentencing after they failed to complete requirements of a deferred sentence for child endangerment.

Chan Chu 43 and Tiffany Nguyen 42 admitted to leaving a 4-month-old infant alone in a Stateline hotel room while they gambled.

Both were required to be in court on Tuesday.

Attorneys said they’d been in contact with them and made it clear they were required to be in court in person.

Douglas County District Judge Tod Young set an Oct. 26 sentencing date.

Neither completed a gambling course required at their September 2019 sentencing.

• The attorney for a man who’s working on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico said he blamed Hurricane Ida for not appearing in court for sentencing on Tuesday.

An Oct. 26 sentencing date was set for David Allen Monroe who is facing sentencing on a charge of attempted grand larceny of a purse containing $300 on Dec. 21 2019.

It’s up to the judge whether the charge will be treated as a gross misdemeanor or a felony.

""It was more so of a secret because I didn't want anyone to know I had seizures because of the stigma and ignorance behind epilepsy"" Goldsmith said.

After the robbery despite not having had seizures previously for years she began to have them in the shower in her car at a restaurant and even at her job. Less than three months on the job and still in her probationary period her manager eventually terminated her.

""And that was their little loophole"" Goldsmith said. ""They didn't fire me for my seizures. I just didn't hit my 90 days.""

Having difficulty finding and maintaining jobs because of her disorder she decided to move back to Pensacola to be with her family.

ICYMI:United Way of West Florida awards $700000 to community programs

The Equality Act 2010 protects people from discrimination including on the basis of disability but such as with Goldsmith's experience there are loopholes where individuals with disabilities can still be discriminated against during employment.

Goldsmith was determined to make sure others didn't go through the same experience.

On Dec. 12 2020 she founded and became president and CEO of her nonprofit Eis4Epilepsy. In the coming months she would stack her board with people mainly women who either have epilepsy or have seen a seizure taking place.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention there are more than 3 million adults and 470000 children with epilepsy in the United States. There are about 223900 people in Florida with active epilepsy including 27300 children under the age of 18 and 196600 people 18 and older.

Goldsmith met one of her board members through a friend who helped her during a seizure while at dinner at The Melting Pot. While everyone was conversing she was staring off into space and friend Krystal Legg saw what was happening.

""They were all panicking but my mom has seizures"" Legg said. ""So I stood up and I grabbed her and we laid her on her side.""

A physician was also at the restaurant and an ambulance was called. Goldsmith learned later she had experienced both an absence and grand mal seizure.

Legg later introduced Goldsmith to Shiraya Lewis.

Lewis 24 first experienced a seizure when she was 13. After leaving her grandmother's house she felt exhausted and wanted to rest but her mother didn't think anything was wrong and told her to clean her room before she went to bed.

""So I started to go clean"" Lewis said. ""But after that I don't remember anything.""

Lewis had to get the rest of the story from her mother Sametrice Lewis who heard a loud banging noise coming from her room. When she went to open the door she couldn't open it.

""I tried to get into her room but she was behind the door having a seizure"" Sametrice said. ""My boyfriend at the time was able to help me push her to the side so we could open the door and grab her.""

They brought her to the emergency room but no one could diagnose her because the seizure could have been triggered by a variety of causes. She continued to have regular seizures for several years but by the time she turned 19 the seizures had become so bad they knew they needed help.

Tests determined she was having about 45 to 50 seizures while she was sleeping. Brain scans led to the epilepsy diagnosis.

Lewis learned to be cautious not knowing what might trigger a seizure. She was craving her independence but couldn't drive or do many of the activities her friends did. She had a seizure just outside the supermarket during her first job due to the stress of balancing school and long work hours.

Even with the support of her family Lewis knew she wanted to do more not only for herself but others who are struggling with epilepsy. She met Goldsmith and the pair bonded over their interest in bringing awareness of epilepsy and helping those who have it to not feel so dependent on others.

""You don't have to be so hard on yourself"" Lewis says. ""You can become something out of life you can do whatever you put your mind to and we want to be able to speak to people not just in Pensacola but all around the world.""

Lewis joined Eis4Epilepsy in February as the vice president. Lewis and Goldsmith have a book coming out called ""Epilepsy = Our Experience + Yours"" exploring their seizures mental health and responses from health professionals with journal prompts at the end of every chapter. It is set to be released on Amazon and on their website eis4epilepsy.com on Oct. 16.

Goldsmith and Lewis also plan to continue to reach out to the community to educate and get rid of the stigmas surrounding epilepsy whether that's in schools or in the workplace.

Eis4Epileptic will hold its first fundraiser at Five Below 1650 Airport Blvd. from Oct. 1 to 9.

Special to Fort Myers News-Press

NAPLES FL – More than 300 REALTORS® real estate professionals and local leaders interested in the economic health of Collier County and its effect on the local real estate market attended either in-person or virtually the Naples Area Board of REALTORS® (NABOR®) ninth annual Economic Summit “A View from the Top” on Tuesday September 7 2021 at the Hilton Naples. Three top economists provided a qualitative look into factors affecting the economy and shared their analysis of influencers affecting growth and home sales activity in the near future.

The data-filled hybrid event began with a welcome message from NABOR® President Corey McCloskey followed by remarks from event sponsor B.J. Cottrell who is managing partner of the FIRPTA Group. Long-time Summit moderator Jeff Lytle set the tone of the day by assuring attendees that they would hear answers to questions about the pandemic’s impact on the economy and whether it will continue to influence the housing market.

First to take the stage was Dr. Brad O’Connor Florida Realtors®’ chief economist and head of its Industry Data and Analysis department. After giving a comparative overview of Florida and local housing activity Dr. O’Connor revealed that data showed the luxury home market in Florida has improved more than other price segments in the last year. He then referred to data from the United States Postal Service (USPS) which showed New York had the highest number of residents who relocated their permanent address to Florida in 2020. The USPS data also revealed new residents came from mostly urban cities and boroughs like Manhattan Chicago and Boston.

Dr. O’Connor’s presentation included an historic perspective of pricing data. “Prices have not gone down in 10 years in Florida. But while the median closed price for single family homes appears to have plateaued in the last few months condominium prices have continued to rise.”

Dr. O’Connor added that “If all the homes currently in forbearance in Florida were on the market we would have eight-months of inventory.” He was quick to assure the audience that the current home default situation does not have the same qualities as what happened 10 years ago because of tighter lending rules.

Presenting virtually Dr. Lawrence Yun the chief economist for the National Association of REALTORS® announced that the “work-from-home” trend will outlast the pandemic and predicted it will also continue to have a big influence on where people choose to buy a home in future years.

Because America is experiencing a home supply shortage Dr. Yun pointed out that rents have increased 8 percent over the last year. He also predicts rents may continue to rise because home prices are also expected to continue to increase due our inability to meet demand. In fact he said “One year ago home prices were 20 percent lower so some buyers are getting priced out today.” Dr. Yun also revealed that for these future buyers rental payment history will be used as a factor to qualify for a mortgage.

Dr. Yun predicts home prices will continue to rise 5 to 10 percent in Florida and possibly up to 20 percent in the Naples area.

Last to present at the Summit was Dr. Elliot Eisenberg a national economist and acclaimed speaker who was the former senior economist with the National Association of Home Builders. Dr. Eisenberg whose presentation style injects humor into an often-mundane topic made it unequivocally clear that “the above trend growth will continue through next year”. He showed several graphs that identified consumer behavior activity during the pandemic including how retail sales spiked when everyone was in quarantine and how the services sector is expected to overtake retail consumption as a preferred way to spend money now that consumers are becoming less timid to leave their homes.

Dr. Eisenberg said “Under normal conditions when you exit a recession supply and demand go up together. But not now.” That’s because demand has skyrocketed as people are hungry to return to pre-pandemic consumer behavior but the pandemic’s influential grip caused all production to stop – for both the retail and service sectors – and production can’t keep up.

Dr. Eisenberg said the stock market provided a 10 percent return annually on average over the last 10 years but predicts the average return may temper to around 5 percent annually over the next 10 years. Of importance to REALTORS® he said “Household balance sheets are spectacular. We want to spend and consume and do it’s just that we can’t get people to make [goods] and service [our needs]. However when the [pandemic] recession began we were forced to stay at home and it created forced savings. As a result this forced savings allowed many people to save $25000 which is why we saw an increase in first-time homebuyers in 2021.”

In conclusion Dr. Eisenberg said he does not anticipate the Federal Reserve will raise rates until late 2022. However he warned that we need to keep an eye on housing because “if rents continue to rise it will drive the inflation numbers up and the Fed may be forced to raise rates before it wants to.”

The Economic Summit is a collaborative effort of the NABOR® Board of Directors Media Relations Committee and the Economic Summit Task Force under the leadership of Rick Fioretti Economic Summit Committee chair.

But some “Detroit Stories” made his Saturday night Sept. 25 return to the DTE Energy Music Theatre a little more special.

The shock rock pioneer Rock and Roll Hall of Famer and proud Detroit native even after many decades of living in Arizona came to DTE riding the success of his “Detroit Stories” album which was recorded partly in Royal Oak and topped Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart after its February release. With at least one of the local players Detroit rock fixture Johnny “Bee” Badanjek watching in the pavilion Cooper added three of the album’s tracks to the set — punky rockers “Go Man Go” and “Social Debris” and his cover of Mitch Ryder & Detroit’s arrangement of the Velvet Underground’s “Rock and Roll.”

Even without any fanfare or commentary about the album and its local roots the trio laid a bit of a sonic Olde English D on the night which played better at DTE than it likely will anywhere else on the five-week tour.

And they fit seamlessly into the 85-minute 23-song show that maintained Cooper’s crown for grand-scale rock ‘n’ roll theatricality another (literally) bloody good time that had the 10000 or so at DTE on their feet in the early fall chill and singing along even to deep Cooper cuts such as “Fallen in Love” and “Roses on White Lace.”

Following a crowd-revving opening set from former Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley — which included band favorites such as “Strutter” “Shock Me” “Cold Gin” and of course “Detroit Rock City” — Cooper’s show extended the Nightmare Castle motif and “plot lines” he introduced back in 2019. The stage featured three levels of medieval set and torture dungeon props with two appearances by a giant monster puppet (for “Feed My Frankenstein” and “Teenage Frankenstein”) and a large macabre infant that helped launch a confetti catapult during “Billion Dollar Babies.” The 73-year-old Cooper showing no lasting effects of the COVID-19 he contracted last year made multiple costume changes deftly moving from top hat and tails (both white and black) to a blood-splattered smock and a military jacket while his wife and backup vocalist Sheryl played ghoulish bride ghost during “Roses and White Lace.”

Most impressive was how Cooper and the band a week into the tour and playing at full-throttle front-loaded some of the biggest hits and still had plenty of momentum after that. Favorites such as “No More Mr. Nice Guy” “Under My Wheels” and a triplet of “I’m Eighteen” “Poison” and “Billion Dollar Babies” were all delivered within the first 40 minutes throwing down a gauntlet for the show’s second half.

Cooper has long made ritualistic crime and punishment the moral and musical centerpiece of his shows and for this year’s edition he stayed with the story of crazed and evil Lord of the Manor busting out of his straightjacket (“Steven”) attempting to murder an infant (“Dead Babies”) and executed for his crime — with his wife playing “Madame Guillotine.” Resurrection and presumably redemption (as if that was needed) followed with “Escape” and “Teenage Frankenstein” while the show came to its traditional rocking end with “School’s Out” segueing into a bit of Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall Part 2” while giant balloons bounced around the pavilion.

It was by the time Cooper and the band took its final vows like a visit from a genuinely loved relative one whose absence was felt last year — and whose return was genuine balm and a reminder that even in troubled times there are some things like a great time with Alice Cooper that don’t change.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdob3N0Y3VsdG1hZy5jb20vd2F0Y2gtYWxpY2UtY29vcGVyLWdldC1hLXN0cmVldC1uYW1lZC1hZnRlci1oaW0taW4td2VzdGxhbmQtbWljaGlnYW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch Alice Cooper Get A Street Named After Him In Westland Michigan,"Favorite son of Michigan and Rock and Metal legend Alice Cooper had a street named for him on Thursday September 23. 2021! to unveil “Alice Cooper Court” at Eloise Asylum (30712 Michigan Avenue) in Westland Michigan near Detroit. Cpooper’s latest album is Detroit Stories! WCSX-FM morning personality Big Jim O’Brien from “Big Jim’s House” joined Motor City rock legend Alice Cooper

“Alice Cooper Court” is the third street name created by WCSX honoring Motor City rock icons. Other Detroit-area landmarks include “Bob Seger Boulevard” and “Glenn Frey Drive.”

The official ceremony began at 2 p.m. ET hosted by Jim O’Brien and included remarks from Cooper who attended the unveiling prior to his concert performance at the DTE Energy Center Saturday September 25. It also featured a live performance by Alice Cooper cover band The Nightmare.

“I love the idea that they’re naming streets after rock stars in Detroit” Cooper told the crowd according to the Detroit Free Press going on to suggest “Iggy Avenue” and “MC5 Street.” “There’s probably more rock stars than politicians.”

To commemorate the dedication the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in Cleveland added an official “Alice Cooper Court” street sign to its “Legends Of Rock” exhibit which features a new Alice Cooper display. In addition to the street sign fans can check out Alice’s original electric chair prop and costumes worn from his iconic tours.

“Rock and roll is as much about the spectacle and visual as it is the sonic. Inductee Alice Cooper spawned a new generation of rock and roll with both” said Nwaka Onwusa chief curator and vice president of curatorial affairs Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. “We are thrilled to add the official street sign to our exhibit as we celebrate Alice Cooper’s legacy with fans and share stories behind the music he created.”

The video is taken from the band's August 2021 livestream event filmed at The Palladium in Worcester MA and was directed by David Brodsky and Allison Woest for MyGoodEye.

""This is one of my favorite songs off the album so I'm glad it is getting some attention and a visual component"" said vocalist Jesse Leach. ""It's a song about facing down the odds and finding confidence to overcome and conquer a situation. I originally wrote it as a battle cry song with my warrior Highland Scottish Norwegian and Swedish ancestors in mind. However it can be about friendship love or even the camaraderie of being in a band traveling the world. The title says it all — 'Us Against The World!'""

Debraione DeCarl Fulmore 29 who lives at 1604 Daybreak Drive was driving a tan van Thursday afternoon in Clermont when a Lake County sheriff’s deputy ran the van’s license plate number and found that the registered owner had a suspended driver’s license and a seize tag order had been issued.

The deputy also discovered that Fulmore has four prior convictions for driving while license suspended and he was wanted on a Hillsborough County warrant charging him with felony battery.

He was taken into custody and booked at the Lake County Jail on $1000 bond.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL215Zm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy9ub3J0aC1jYXJvbGluYS9waWVkbW9udC10cmlhZC93ZXN0LW1hcmtldC1zdHJlZXQtY2xvc2VkLWluLWdyZWVuc2Jvcm8tYWZ0ZXItY3Jhc2gtcG93ZXItb3V0YWdlcy1yZXBvcnRlZC_SAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly9teWZveDguY29tL25ld3Mvbm9ydGgtY2Fyb2xpbmEvcGllZG1vbnQtdHJpYWQvd2VzdC1tYXJrZXQtc3RyZWV0LWNsb3NlZC1pbi1ncmVlbnNib3JvLWFmdGVyLWNyYXNoLXBvd2VyLW91dGFnZXMtcmVwb3J0ZWQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,West Market Street closed in Greensboro after crash power outages reported,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://myfox8.com/news/north-carolina/piedmont-triad/west-market-street-closed-in-greensboro-after-crash-power-outages-reported/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL215Zm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy9ub3J0aC1jYXJvbGluYS9waWVkbW9udC10cmlhZC93ZXN0LW1hcmtldC1zdHJlZXQtY2xvc2VkLWluLWdyZWVuc2Jvcm8tYWZ0ZXItY3Jhc2gtcG93ZXItb3V0YWdlcy1yZXBvcnRlZC_SAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly9teWZveDguY29tL25ld3Mvbm9ydGgtY2Fyb2xpbmEvcGllZG1vbnQtdHJpYWQvd2VzdC1tYXJrZXQtc3RyZWV0LWNsb3NlZC1pbi1ncmVlbnNib3JvLWFmdGVyLWNyYXNoLXBvd2VyLW91dGFnZXMtcmVwb3J0ZWQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzI1L3BlcnNvbi1kaWVzLWFmdGVyLXNob290aW5nLW90ci1wb2xpY2Utc2F5L9IBWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzI1L3BlcnNvbi1kaWVzLWFmdGVyLXNob290aW5nLW90ci1wb2xpY2Utc2F5Lz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police identify woman killed in Over-the-Rhine shooting,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - One woman is dead and two other people are injured after a shooting in Over-the-Rhine Saturday morning.

Officers say they were dispatched around 5:30 a.m. to East McMicken Avenue near Grant Park.

Brandi Turner 35 was pronounced dead at the scene police said.

Officers say that two other people were shot and taken via private vehicle to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center.

Their conditions are unknown at this time.

Grant Park Neighborhood Watch Captain John Donaldson says he isn’t surprised that the shooting happened but is surprised that crimes are still happening in the area.

Donaldson says that sometimes it is common to see about 100 people on East McMicken around 2 a.m.

He adds that there are several cameras and LED lights installed by Duke Energy in the area.

“They added LED lights all throughout this area so at nighttime it is like a stadium through here. So it’s easy to see. This is not the place to commit crimes” Donaldson said. “You are going to get caught.”

Police do not have a suspect.

It is unclear as to what led up to the shooting.

Officers are still investigating.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Cincinnati Police Department Homicide Unit at 513-352-3542.

On this late August evening about 10 men gathered as they do each month to vent get advice and talk about the things they don’t feel comfortable sharing with others.

“I’m a mechanic but it’s not my passion” Payton 30 said. He’s most happy when he’s racing on a skateboard he said and wants to own a skate shop. It would be for everyone but particularly minority skateboarders who feel like him.

He used to be ridiculed for his choice of activity and “acting white” he said. People also scoffed at and discouraged him when he talked about his dream of a shop.

That’s not the case at meetings of Brother’s Keeper a Virginia Beach support group where boys and men listen network and talk about relationships goals and mental health. His brother-in-law Troy Eaton started the group last year.

Troy Eaton founder of Brother’s Keeper talks with a group of young men during a meeting at his home on Sunday August 29 2021 in Virginia Beach Va.

The group isn’t connected to Barack Obama’s organization of a similar name.

Eaton started it on Facebook last May after reading men post about suicidal thoughts and having trouble coping with life’s stressors.

One post read: “I can’t take this life. … I’m ready to end it all.”

Eaton 51 can remember when a classmate died by suicide about 40 years ago in Queens New York where he grew up. Kids teased the boy because he was poor and often came to school with dirt on his face and hands. The boy hanged himself.

“I just think I don’t ever want to be in a position to hear it see it or experience it again” Eaton said before the August meeting. “It might be bad today but it could be better tomorrow. Things change.”

Eaton now has nearly 130 members on Facebook and they include therapists in Chicago and Philadelphia a producer in Los Angeles and people in Georgia New Jersey and New York. The group had its first in-person meeting in May. Everyone’s welcome regardless of race religion or background.

Most meetings bring out 20 or fewer people. The men have become friends though and often connect on their own.

Eaton is a former line cook and trainer at Dave & Buster’s and uses his savings to run a small office about 10 minutes from his house. The space isn’t big enough for large meetings so they gather in different locations. They hope to have a building by next summer.

He usually has help setting up the meetings but sometimes such as in August he did so alone.

By 6 p.m. on this Sunday the tent was up kabobs and hot dogs grilled drinks chilled and music was playing before the men pulled up. By 6:30 nearly 10 people had arrived including Virginia Beach Mayor Bobby Dyer who came by to catch up with Eaton for a few minutes. He then had to leave.

Eaton reached out to Dyer in June 2020 to tell him about the group. The mayor has been to every Brother’s Keeper event and the two often have breakfast discuss ideas such as a podcast and a youth basketball tournament. Dyer said mental health is one of the top issues the city’s Inclusion Diversity Equity and Accessibility Commission has identified as a priority.

“Troy and all the folks that work with him help us come together and fill in the gaps that the government can’t always help with” Dyer said.

As Eaton started the meeting men grabbed drinks and hot dogs and took their seats. Eaton then opened the mic to members.

Steven Mirabel first came to the group because of his friend Payton. Then he found a reason to come on his own. Mirabel is an aspiring writer and comedian and said the support is making him feel more comfortable in front of crowds. It was his first time speaking in an intimate setting though.

“I’m wearing this shirt right now in pride” he said pointing to his black and white Brother’s Keeper T-shirt. “I’m wearing the shirt right now in ambition. Thank you guys for being around.”

“Now you know that you can do it” Eaton said to him after his speech.

Mirabel and Payton said Eaton is naturally supportive and encouraging — an embodiment of the group. He pushes people to put their plans in motion as opposed to knocking ideas down they said.

Two recurring topics Eaton said are co-parenting and relationships. He’s well versed in both. He had his first child when he was 17 and was in a relationship for 26 years.

Troy Eaton founder of Brother’s Keeper cooks hot dogs for his group’s monthly meeting at his home on Sunday August 29 2021 in Virginia Beach Va.

“I had three kids and couldn’t buy a beer” said Eaton who moved to Hampton Roads in 1988.

He’s always known the importance of male support. When he was young Eaton received some guidance from his father but he was miles away in New York. Eaton often sought advice from older men he knew.

Now he has six children ranging in age from four months to 34 and 12 grandchildren. He wants to be that support for them and others.

Recently Eaton was standing outside his home around 10:30 at night and a car screeched to a halt at his curb. It was one of his group members. The man had just left his home after a heated argument with his partner.

Troy Eaton founder of Brother’s Keeper holds his 4-month old son Santiago at his home on Sunday August 29 2021 in Virginia Beach Va.

The man talked with Eaton laughed and held Eaton’s 4-month-old son Santiago Justice. The man left calm.

“That’s what it’s about” Eaton said. Men need to find someone to talk to when they are angry instead of taking it out on their partners and possibly getting violent and going to jail.

“We can’t have that.”

The man continues to come to most meetings and often stops by Eaton’s house or office.

Some people think the group is a place to whine Eaton said. That’s not true. The men talk and try to leave their worries behind when meetings are over. When they can’t Eaton connects the men with therapists.

“People say the weight of one feather can snap a man’s psyche so if we can get together and remove these feathers and make it lighter for you it keeps your mind right.”

These stocks will benefit,"The U.S.' electric grid imagined for 20th century life is in desperate need of an overhaul as 21st century challenges wreak havoc on the industry and the customers it serves. Infrastructure is outdated technology has evolved and extreme weather events fueled by climate change have shown again and again the vulnerabilities of our current system. And that desperately needed upgrade comes at a stratospheric cost: by the end of the next decade the U.S. electrical grid is facing a $338 billion investment shortfall according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. Widespread power outages this year including two massive events in Texas alone — Hurricane Ida and the severe winter weather that hit the state in February — have garnered national attention and President Joe Biden has emphasized the importance of upgrading the grid. The bipartisan infrastructure bill outlines $65 billion in spending for the electrical system which includes the buildout of transmission lines as well as research and development funding for ""smart grid technologies that deliver flexibility and resilience"" according to the plan's fact sheet. The proposed and massive spending on infrastructure will be required to fundamentally transform the grid from a centralized operation where power flows in one direction to an interconnected network with two-way communication. On-site power generation means houses and vehicles will constantly be sending information back to the utility providing real-time analysis and even stored power when necessary. This communication is the basic idea behind the so-called ""smart grid"" — not one specific change but rather an overarching framework that utilizes the latest technology to make the grid more reliable efficient safer and economical noted Andrew Little research analyst at Global X ETFs. Where utilities once had a constant supply of coal or gas to meet any sudden spike in demand intermittent power creates new challenges since it's impossible to bank on constant sun or wind. Monitoring the available supply is becoming more complex as distributed power and storage becomes integrated with the legacy grid and as customers who generate their own power act as providers. ""[The power grid] still looks in its DNA much like it did 100 years ago"" said Mark Dyson a principal with RMI's electricity practice. ""There's a broad recognition that we need to reimagine some of the basic technology and even architecture of our power grid to meet the needs of where we see ourselves today."" Opportunities for investors Large-scale problems can create opportunities for investors of course and rethinking the grid is no exception. Given the complexity of the electrical system and the many pieces it relies on companies across sectors and industries are involved — from the nuts and bolts of the hardware to the software to the wiring to the construction crews that install new equipment. For investors looking for broad exposure in the remaking of the grid there are several funds that track the industry as a whole including the First Trust Nasdaq Clean Edge Smart Grid Infrastructure Index Fund . The fund trades under the ticker GRID and has roughly $570 million in assets under management. Shares are up 19% for 2021 thanks to strength in names like MicroVision  Johnson Controls  On Semiconductor and Acuity Brands . Top holdings are Aptiv  Schneider Electric  Johnson Controls  ABB and Eaton Corporation . There's also the SPDR S & P Kensho Intelligent Structures ETF ; it's smaller with around $54 million in assets under management. The fund's top holdings are Evoqua Water Technologies  Carrier Global  Xylem  Badger Meter and Johnson Controls . For investors looking for more specialized bets one option is Itron . The company offers advanced metering infrastructure which helps utilities better understand consumption practices through a constant flow of data. With this information utilities can improve operational efficiency and enhance grid reliability. They can also utilize programs like demand-response systems which focus on cutting usage to match available supply rather than ramping up supply to meet elevated demand. For example a smart thermostat could raise the room temperature to reduce demand while an electric vehicle could be unplugged and charged at a later time when demand isn't as high. Itron's stock hit an all-time high back in March but has declined more than 30% since. In August shares dropped a staggering 26% in one day after the company missed quarterly estimates thanks to component constraints which management expects to persist through 2021 and into 2022. Still Raymond James upgraded the stock from outperform to strong buy following the slide. While supply chain bottlenecks might be a near-term headwind the firm said demand is not disappearing and also pointed to strength in the company's software division. ""Power grid modernization — a facet of both climate mitigation and adaptation — is a theme to which Itron is uniquely leveraged among U.S.-listed companies"" the firm wrote in a note to clients. Analysts at Baird are less certain however and the firm cut the stock to a neutral rating in August due to the lack of clarity around the supply chain problems. But the firm did acknowledge Itron's leading position. ""We view ITRI as the best pure-play smart grid company and would recommend shares for investors looking for exposure to secular trends toward efficiency smart metering and networking"" analysts led by Ben Kallo said in August in a note to clients. Smart meters are the foundation of a two-way communication network between individual homes buildings and other devices and the grid and can help with everything from load control to outage notification to shifting consumption in places that have time-of-use pricing. They've been around for more than a decade but are still not in every property across the U.S. An April study from The Edison Foundation estimated that 107 million smart meters were deployed in the U.S. by the end of 2020 which is about three-quarters of U.S. households. In addition to Itron Switzerland-based Landis+Gyr is another company involved in smart metering and grid edge solutions. And then there are the companies that make the hardware and software to actually bring renewable energy to the grid. This is done through inverters which are often referred to as the brains of a solar system since they convert the DC from solar modules into AC current for the grid. SolarEdge and Enphase Energy are among the companies that make these specialized inverters. Both stocks are down double-digits for the year amid broad weakness in renewable energy stocks. But research firm KeyBanc recently said it sees a rebound for Enphase on the horizon. ""We like ENPH's core microinverters business where it enjoys significant market share and is well-positioned to capitalize on growth in the U.S. resi solar market"" the firm said while initiating coverage on the stock with an overweight rating. For investors who are wary of focusing on one specific technology whether it be solar wind hydrogen or battery storage Morgan Stanley said targeting the equipment makers can be a safer bet. ""We are confident in the long-term trends around energy transition but the adoption of individual technologies can happen at a different pace"" the firm said in a recent note to clients. ""Electrical equipment's integral role in all of these initiatives lowers the risk of imperfect timing...This is a megatrend in industrial markets and we expect a significant amount of capital to chase this trend"" the firm added. Morgan Stanley pointed to Hubbell and Eaton Corp. as two specific beneficiaries. As more and more elements in our lives go electric from cars to commercial buildings the firm believes the electrification opportunity will hit $45 billion by 2030. There are also industrial conglomerates that recognizing the opportunity in the space offer software-as-a-service. Emerson Electric  Honeywell and Johnson Controls are among the companies that work along with utilities on such projects as a building's management system which helps commercial buildings manage their energy needs. While there are many ways to take advantage of the evolving grid Cowen was quick to note that investors should maintain a long-term timeframe rather than hoping for fast gains. ""We caution investors that this transition in the electric utility network will not happen overnight; it will be a multi-decade-long process providing slow and steady growth"" the firm said. - CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.

A few days ago we published a story about a 1993 barn find Toyota pickup truck that had only 84 original miles on it predicting this would score a fair amount. It sold on eBay on Friday for $45100 with the winning buyer swooping in at the last moment with $100 more than the previous bidder to nab it.

eBay

This unusual find was purchased new in 1993 driven for 80 miles and then pulled a Sleeping Beauty for 28 years in a New Hampshire barn. In July the second buyer brought it home and put only four miles on it ostensibly to make sure it’s still running properly (which he says it is). He then put it up for auction on September 14 with a starting price of $20000; I imagine he’s happy with the final selling price.

The original description of the truck is enthusiastic with the prolific use of exclamation points to convey the seller’s recognition of what he had on his hands: “This was purchased new in 1993 and driven approximately 80 miles then put in a barn where it remained unused until I purchased it in July this year. It now has 84 Original Miles On It !!!!!!!”

Except for the battery fuel tank fuel pump and fuel pickup assembly the truck is all original. On the outside the truck is in beautiful shape and finished in Evergreen Pearl with a few minor dents said to be from something falling against it in the barn.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vcG9rLW1vbi1vcmVvcy1lbWJsYXpvbmVkLWxlZ2VuZGFyeS0wMzI0MjA3ODkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pokémon Oreos emblazoned with the legendary Pokémon Mew are being listed on eBay for $100000,"Pokémon enthusiasts are hunting for the creatures again - this time in their cookies.

The Oreo x Pokémon collection contains a rare Pokémon Mew and people are on the lookout for it.

Some eBay sellers are trying to cash in by fishing out Mew cookies and listing them for up to $100000.

Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.

Pokémon enthusiasts are hunting for the rare Mew in their Oreo cookies and eBay sellers are looking to cash in.

Oreo's Pokémon collaboration was launched this month with each of the cream sandwich cookies coming with Pokémon designs on the chocolate wafers. There are 16 designs in total including Charmander Bulbasaur and Pikachu - but there is also the elusive Mew a legendary psychic Pokémon.

Oreo described the Mew cookie as a ""super-rare Mythical Pokémon"" in the set adding that there is a ""random assortment"" of designs in every package.

A family-sized pack of Pokémon Oreos is selling for $3.59 at Target. But Insider saw over 6000 listings of the Mew cookies on eBay with resellers listing prices that varied from a couple of dollars to a whopping $100000. The prices appeared to be pegged to the condition the cookie is currently in and the packaging it comes in.

The ""rare mew Oreo"" that was listed for $100000 comes in a plastic bag. However it is unclear if its condition of the $100000 cookie is much better than the second-most-expensive Mew Oreo listed on eBay for $69000 which was advertised as an ""absolutely perfect"" brand-new Oreo.

The Pokémon franchise launched in February 1996 as a game on the Nintendo Game Boy console.

Decades later the Poké-craze for collectors' items is still on. There have been jet planes consoles and cars released in connection with the series. It is estimated that sales of Pokémon-related merchandise movies games and shows top around $100 billion.

The trading of rare Pokémon cards is a multi-million dollar industry with tournaments that sold around 2.1 billion cards in 2016 alone. DJ Steve Aoki and influencers like Logan Paul have indulged in the hobby - with Aoki picking up a $220000 first-edition Charizard card at auction and Paul opening super-expensive decks of the cards on his YouTube channel.

WEDDINGS can be incredibly expensive but one savvy bride and groom have proven that they don't have to be.

Newlyweds Alex and Dan Lilley created their dream wedding with 130 guests for just £4000 - and it was all thanks to a variety of nifty tricks and hacks.

The couple from Harby in Nottinghamshire utilised second-hand websites such as eBay and Facebook Marketplace to bring their dream wedding to life while keeping costs low.

Thrifty Alex 33 even grew her own bouquet of flowers to walk down the aisle in front of their 130 guests.

After getting engaged in 2019 Alex a store supervisor and 38-year-old Dan a factory maintenance manager wanted to marry on a budget while saving for a house renovation.

The parents of four-year-old Samuel think that their clever hacks saved them around £15000 - and it was the perfect day.

""People can pay thousands and thousands for their dream wedding but we couldn't justify it"" Alex said.

""Doing everything ourselves was ten times the amount of stress but the end result was amazing.

""We were nervous but the end result was better than we ever could have imagined.

""We managed to keep budgets low and still have the perfect day - I wouldn't have changed a thing.""

Alex and Dan had shelved their wedding preparation for two years due to the pandemic but eventually decided to take the leap and set a date in March.

In order to juggle a pricey home renovation on their three-bed bungalow alongside their wedding they decided to take a thrifty approach wherever possible.

With the date set for August 21 it was all hands on deck for the couple alongside their friends and family to bring everything together in the ultimate DIY mission.

But despite the odds stacked against them with a 130-person guest list the couple's spending totted up to just over £4000 - miles below what many couples choose to spend on their big day.

Alex said: ""We just couldn't justify using the money on the wedding when we knew it was needed on our house.

""I searched online and saw a lot of people saying their weddings cost upwards of £20000 and we weren't going to spend that.

""But at the same time we really wanted to get married so we aimed to do both.""

The couple had their service at a local church - totalling £536 - before everyone took a five-minute stroll back to their house where they hosted the reception in the back garden.

They cut costs on music by taking their own sound system and using a seven-day free trial on YouTube to stream it - and dodged paying for a verger as their friend at the church offered to step in for free.

The outfits worn by the couple their son and their bridesmaids were second hand from a variety of websites. Alex bought her own dress a Kenneth Winston originally worth over £1500 for a steal of just £220 on Facebook Marketplace.

Alex added: ""I did have to pay an extra £60 to have the dress altered by a seamstress - but it was still a great deal.""

The enormous marquees erected in their back garden were borrowed from friends for free with £160 spent on strands of lights to give it a cosy feel.

Their giant three-tier cake was made by a dedicated family member for free as a wedding gift - while green-fingered Alex grew her bouquet in their own back garden using packets of seeds totalling a just handful of pounds.

Her home-grown bouquet was made of an arrangement of cosmos lavender eucalyptus gypsophila and achillea.

Food on offer was a buffet spread to feed their 130 hungry guests - prepared by their loyal bridesmaids the day before - and featured Mediterranean-style dishes including baked salmon antipasti kebabs and a bean salad.

Shopping at Aldi they bought the whole lot for £400 - around £3 a head - along with bottles of own-brand Pimms and prosecco totalling £130.

By buying most of their decorations from stores such as The Range and Dunelm they kitted out the entire 'do with candles chalkboards bunting and hay bales for under £200.

Entertainment included hiring a local musician for £150 a photo booth for £275 and a children's bouncy castle for £50.

The total cost of the wedding came to around £4030 thanks to their thrifty approach - instead of the tens of thousands many spend on their perfect day.

""It was ten times the stress doing it yourself rather than paying someone else but the end result was better than we imagined"" Alex explained.

""We're lucky to have such supportive friends and family.""

The couple got the best of both worlds by celebrating their wedding while still renovating their house - and Alex revealed the thousands of pounds they saved have already gone to good use.

""Earlier in the year we knocked down a wall in our home and made a new dining room"" she said.

""We also had a new patio fitted and re-turfed the lawn.

""Just six weeks ahead of the wedding we had a new driveway installed too.""

The newlywed parents set off on a week-long honeymoon in Cornwall with four-year-old Samuel before returning to married life to continue their renovation work.

Reflecting on their journey Alex said: ""It was partly me being stubborn and refusing to pay for something we could do ourselves - but it paid off!

""It does feel fabulous to have had that level of creativity.

""We wouldn't have changed a thing!""

That’s right if you have an unopened block of Cadbury limited edition Vegemite chocolate it might be best to hold onto it rather than ripping it open and taking a big ol’ bite.

The block which first dropped in 2015 and sold out in just two weeks is a lot kinder to the tongue for international vegemite-trying celebs like Selena Gomez or Steve Buscemi. Basically it’s the traditional caramel Cadbury with an extremely thin layer of vegemite in it.

And nearly seven years later there’s a limited supply that’s still going for a lot of dollaridoos on eBay.

While someone is listing two blocks for $60 another has started a bid at $50 with a buy-it-now price of $200. Side note: my favourite thing about the latter listing is the crinkled packaging.

In news that’ll make Moneybags from Spyro certainly pleased another is legitimately selling five of them for $500.

Holy fkn shit.

A standard block of Cadbury Dairy Milk is currently $2.50 at Woolies. That means that for five unopened blocks of Cadbury’s Vegemite pack on eBay you could buy 200 normal blocks. That’s a lot of chocolata.

Alternatively with that same kinda money you could nearly afford a Nintendo Switch console.

Back in 2017 Mondelez International ANZ director of marketing for chocolate Kjetil Undhjem claimed that the discontinued chocolate block was actually an experiment to get people to think of their other beloved chocolate flavours which is funny given all I can think about is the caramelised yeast in my mouth.

“The purpose of it wasn’t to launch a chocolate with Vegemite that would go into our repertoire the whole point of the campaign and activity was to generate talk about rediscovering your favourite chocolate flavours” he said per AdNews.

“We have 18 flavours in our blocks range and we wanted to create a conversation about flavours and rediscovering some of your favourites whether it’s top deck or crunchy or snack.

“We thought about the most disruptive flavour you can put in chocolate to get that conversation started.”

Anyway if you need me I’ll be mixing normal blocks of chocolate with Vegemite because my body ain’t made of coins."

There was no heated bidding and nothing went under a noisy hammer but large sums were still changing hands: the artist known as Beeple sold his work “First 5000 Days” for $69.3 million.

“It was the third highest price ever achieved by a living artist” said Beatriz Ordovás director of the postwar and contemporary art department at Christie’s Spain. This sale was a milestone not so much for the price but for being the first time a major auction house had offered a purely digital work of art that would be paid for in cryptocurrency and auctioned online. The authenticity of Beeple’s work was guaranteed by a non-fungible token (NFT) a unique digital certificate that is linked to a file.

In a world where everything can be replicated with a simple copy-and-paste NFTs lend uniqueness to an image and endow it with exclusivity. “They function as a guarantee of authenticity” Ordovás explained. Beeple’s work a huge collage made up of 5000 images made over the same number of days may have artistic value but it is the NFT associated with it that gives it economic value. Some see these assets as a revolution that will change the art world forever while others denounce what they see as a bubble that will burst and leave nothing but a trail of smoke.

Before making history at Christie’s the average value of a Beeple work hovered around $100. “Digital artists couldn’t sell their art like those working in the physical world. NFTs have ended that discrimination” explained Primavera De Filippi a researcher at Harvard University’s Berkman-Klein Center for Internet & Society and the French National Center for Scientific Research. De Filippi has an optimistic view of the technology and believes that it has enhanced the work of artists such as Beeple by replicating the limitations of the physical world to drive up prices: “NFTs have artificially created a form of digital scarcity and this enhances the value of a work” she said. NFTs have introduced new artists to the art market she believes and also introduced new buyers.

'The First 5000 Days' by an artist known as Beeple sold at Christie's for $69.3 million on March 11 2021.

The value of the digital art market grew by 299% last year according to the NFT 2020 Report and that is just the tip of the iceberg: the luxury market video games music and sports teams also want a piece. The first tweet by Twitter’s Jack Dorsey was sold in the form of an NFT for almost $3 million in March. A few days later the Nyan Cat meme (a cat with a rainbow trail) reached $600000. Singer The Weeknd sold a collection of music and videos last April for $2 million in the form of an NFT. Ozuna Steve Aoki and other musicians have also jumped onto the bandwagon. St. Petersburg’s Hermitage Museum will photograph its works and tokenize them selling off images that are in the public domain for thousands of dollars. Virtually any asset could be sold for an astronomical amount.

These NFTs are not bought with legal tender but with cryptocurrencies usually Ethereum the currency of the Ethereum blockchain. Blockchain technology guarantees the veracity of transactions over the internet and because of Ethereum’s central role in NFTs’ growth its value has climbed more than 1700% since the beginning of 2020. Many believe this growth is not organic.

“There is clearly speculation” said Andrés Guadamuz a professor at the University of Sussex and expert in digital intellectual property rights. “Many of us who have been watching this world have been caught by surprise by this fad” he added placing the tipping point at the beginning of this year and the sale of Beeple’s NFT.

The ever higher prices however are now starting to signs of an overheated market. Activity associated with NFTs has varied greatly across all trackable metrics. The number of people using NFT markets fell 80% from a peak of 650000 at the beginning of the year to about 128000 the first week of August. Sales volume was verging on an impressive $200 million last February but interest dropped sharply in subsequent months sitting at just $25 million in May according to the Statista website. Some saw this as the death throes of NFTs while others believed they only proved their extreme volatility. The market has ended up proving the latter opinion correct as in August NFT sales set a new record ($206 million).

What happens next is anyone’s guess. “Ethereum is a very unstable cryptocurrency” Guadamuz pointed out “and as such the astronomical prices we are talking about are to some extent illusory.” The see-sawing prices of Ethereum and its lack of real-world uses pushes investors to make risky bets which are increasingly disconnected from physical reality like playing poker with Monopoly money. “This is very real” disagreed the researcher Primavera De Filippi. “You can’t make a purchase with Ethereum but you can exchange it for legal tender whenever you want. It’s like saying gold is a fictional asset because you can’t go buy bread with gold bullion.”

Speculation has been a part of collecting art long before NFTs came along. But the newness and unfamiliarity of the technology makes it much riskier. “Trading in new and relatively unknown instruments such as NFTs is not so much a form of investment as a bet” said Jo Michell Associate Professor of Economics at UWE Bristol. The gamble is risky because market trends are not driven by relatively predictable behavior such as a company going bust or the progressive career of an artist. “A lot of the action is driven by herd-chasing” Michell added. But in the crypto-art herd not all cattle are created equal. “The very wealthy are willing to spend lump sums of money on status tokens such as NFTs” said the economist. “This leads to other more humble investors imitating them.”

Another reason for crypto-art fever is less often considered: psychology. The emotional attachment we have to certain items and the social status we imbue them with affects our understanding of their value. Collecting is based on this process from stamp collecting to the tulip mania bubble of 17th-century Holland when tulip bulbs were sometimes traded for mansions in the wildest example of how collecting can generate economic distortion.

Matt Stephenson is a PhD candidate at Columbia University and researches behavioral economics and NFTs from a psychological perspective. “People are excited about them because they have certain properties of the real-world objects that we’re used to” he explained. “They are unique can be owned sold destroyed and tracked over time. As a result if an artist creates NFT art it has the same properties as a traditional painting.

”The fact that people will pay millions for a NFT but not for a JPG file which is also used to save digital images says more about us than it does about the art market Stephenson believes. “Cognitive psychology suggests that humans can distinguish between virtually identical objects based on an intricate set of socially accepted interests beliefs and intentions” he said. Value therefore has a strong social component.

In early May Kyle Swenson’s Twitter feed started filling up with monkeys: monkeys in sunglasses monkeys in Hawaiian shirts monkeys in sailor hats with frozen smiles and funny faces. It was all a little weird Swenson thought until the 25-year-old Florida salesman bought his own monkey avatar. He had joined the Bored Ape Yacht Club a website selling NFT-linked avatars. The site launched on April 30 and put 10000 images of primates up for sale. Each avatar with a cartoon aesthetic and unique characteristics went on the market for around $200. They disappeared within a day. Most users bought several to resell or exchange them. Today they can only be purchased second-hand on the Open Sea platform and the cheapest one goes for about $45000. While the rarest apes reach astronomical figures more common specimens are more readily available. In a way they are like baseball cards only with a lot more money at stake.

Swenson has two Bored Apes two Bored Ape Kennels some Goatz some Pudgy Penguins some Alien Boys... These are all part of different NFT collections. Just as there were once soccer and Disney movie stickers at a newsstand there are NFT collections of all kinds on the internet. The Bored Apes are the latest to catch on. The first and most successful were the CryptoPunks. One of these eight-bit images sold at Christie’s last May for nearly $17 million.

Avant-garde art?

So why do people pay such exorbitant amounts? “From an artistic point of view I would say they are a piece of crap” stated Guadamuz bluntly. “But the value of the CryptoPunks is that they were the first.” De Filippi agrees with him while recognizing their simplicity and tracing an avant-garde lineage. “It’s like [Marcel] Duchamp who was the first to create ready-made works [everyday objects that were transformed into art only through their context]. That’s why his works have value for being pioneering.”

The first rule of Bored Ape Yacht Club is simple: monkey see monkey do. “Before I joined I barely had any followers on Twitter now I have a couple thousand” Swenson proudly confessed. The social component of NFT communities is important to collectors as gaining status and making noise about your collectibles can drive up the price. Essentially what makes you cooler sometimes makes you richer too.

There are no yachts or monkeys but the Bored Ape Yacht Club really functions as a social club. “When you buy a primate you join a community” explained Swenson who also founded the Bored Ape Gazette the newspaper of record for this community. Stephenson confirmed that there is a large component of social psychology in the rise of these collectibles. “There’s definitely a fun even childlike feel to collecting NFTs” he said. “And showing them to your friends collecting the rare ones...is definitely part of the appeal.”

This expert believes that the success of NFT collectibles depends on what is now known as the attention economy. Stephenson’s own profile picture on Twitter is a monkey with a funny face which means it’s easy to recognize him as one of the 10000 avatars of the Bored Ape Yacht Club. It was a gift: “That’s why he has a birthday hat.” Stephenson like many others has joined the party. And it’s one that seems far from over.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9lc3BvcnRzL2ZpZmEtMjItc291bmR0cmFjay1saXN0LXNvbmdzLWF2YWlsYWJsZS1nYW1l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FIFA 22 soundtrack: List of all songs available in the game,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/fifa-22-soundtrack-list-songs-available-game on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9lc3BvcnRzL2ZpZmEtMjItc291bmR0cmFjay1saXN0LXNvbmdzLWF2YWlsYWJsZS1nYW1l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vb3JsYW5kby1mbG9yaWRhLXNpbGljb24tdmFsbGV5LXRlY2gtaHViLWZpbmFuY2Utd29yay1lY29ub215LTIwMjEtOdIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vb3JsYW5kby1mbG9yaWRhLXNpbGljb24tdmFsbGV5LXRlY2gtaHViLWZpbmFuY2Utd29yay1lY29ub215LTIwMjEtOT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Orlando is positioning itself as a tech hub Silicon Valley rival,"Orlando has talent transport and low taxes.

Orlando has been shaking off Florida's reputation as primarily a place for tourists and retirees.

Instead the city is becoming a hub for tech defense training and finance companies.

Execs from EA Luminar and Stax told Insider why its tech scene is thriving.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Defense and technology startup Red 6 is opening a hub in Orlando to develop its airborne tactical augmented reality system.

It's one in a long line of companies including Lockheed Martin Oracle Verizon and Deloitte with offices in the central Florida city.

For years people have viewed the Sunshine State as primarily a vacation and a retiree destination but groups such as the Orlando Economic Partnership have been working to elevate its profile as a tech hub.

""In Orlando everyone knows the Disney story"" Tim Giuliani the Partnership's president told Insider. ""This part of the story that people don't know or don't recall is the space race.""

NASA started performing launch operations in Cape Canaveral more than 70 years ago. The city is also home to the Kennedy Space Center and US Army Air Force and Navy simulation command centers which has led to an influx of other technology defense and training companies.

""You have this cluster here that's developed over a long time and now you're seeing it get to a critical mass"" Giuliani said. ""You're seeing more companies moving out of California and New York.""

""We've made great strides in growing our reputation as a city where tech companies and start-ups can not only open expand relocate and thrive but be in proximity to some of the world's leaders in innovation"" Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer added.

Orlando has talent transport and low taxes

Execs from Electronic Arts Luminar and Stax told Insider that Orlando's big talent pool made it easier for them to recruit in the area.

""We have all these great colleges that are literally in our backyard"" Suneera Madhani founder of Orlando-based SME payments platform Stax said. These include the University of Central Florida the University of Florida and Valancia College.

Giuliani said there were half a million college students within a hundred-mile radius of downtown Orlando.

""We have been able to tap into that talent"" Luminar CTO Jason Eichenholz said. The self-driving LIDAR startup has around 400 employees with roughly 60% based in Orlando.

""In the early days of Luminar when we would meet with a potential customer and they'd have one specific LIDAR engineer we would have a millennia of men and women experienced in LIDAR technology which gave us a very unfair advantage compared to our competition"" Eichenholz added.







The execs said it was easy to recruit workers from other states to move to Orlando too.

Electronic Arts vice-president Daryl Holt said its Orlando studios had more than 850 employees – some from the area including many UCF graduates and some who relocated.

Migration to the state has boomed because of its warm climate low living costs and lack of income tax.

""Who wouldn't want to move to Florida?"" Mahdani said. Many of Stax's C-suites and middle management relocated from New York California and Atlanta he added.

Eichenholz said some young tech workers relocated to California to work for companies like Google Apple and Facebook but that once they had a family ""we do exceptionally well in being able to attract them back to Florida.""

The execs said Orlando had a pro-business environment and bustling tech community. Madhani for example sits on the board of Starter Studio a venture-tech accelerator that helped her set up Stax in 2014.

""It's a wonderful nexus point of industry education and government all rowing in the same direction"" Holt said.

Giuliani said Orlando is a well-connected city. As well as an international airport Brightline is due to launch a rail line connecting Orlando to Miami Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach in 2022.

""Obviously Silicon Valley is not going to die and New York's not going to die"" Giuliani said. ""There's just going to be more for everybody else.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLXVzLWNhbmFkYS01ODY4NzA3MNIBN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLXVzLWNhbmFkYS01ODY4NzA3MC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Music company buys NFT of 'Side-eyeing Chloe' meme,"""If we're going based off meme sales before it's a bit lower but we're so grateful for what it sold for"" said Katie.

However EA gave players a chance to preview the game before its release through the early-access version that went live earlier this week. While the game is fine for the most part the criticism comes from console players particularly the ones playing FIFA 22 on the Xbox Series S. Since the release of the early-access version many players have complained about the awful resolution scaling issue on the Xbox Series S.

Natively the Xbox Series S does support 1440p resolution at 60 FPS. However that’s not the case with FIFA 22 on the console. Unfortunately we couldn’t try the game on the Xbox Series S for ourselves. However ElAnalistaDeBits compares the game’s graphics on all the current-generation consoles in a YouTube video posted earlier this week.

When compared to the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 it becomes obvious that the Xbox Series S is nowhere close in terms of the graphics in FIFA 22. The character models are very blurry and have jagged edges and there’s a significant amount of ghosting and motion blur when the characters move. Even for 1080p resolution the graphics could’ve been slightly better than they are.

FIFA 22 on the Xbox Series S makes the characters appear far more artificial in contrast to the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. Of course a difference between Microsoft Corporation’s budget-friendly console and flagship one is to be expected. However the difference between the two consoles is significant to the point that FIFA 22 on the Xbox Series S feels like the previous generation.

Apparently this issue of resolution scaling is very common too. “doesn’t matter the scaling on Series S is horrendous jaggered edges looks like <720p scaled upto 1080p / 1440p not sure if its my monitor but its also very blurry when movement happens at speed its horrendous to play and hurts my eyes” said JoeH-87 on the EA Answers HQ forum. “t looks worse than the fifa 21 s|x version. Tried both 1080p and 1440p settings. Both seem to be upscaled from 720p?!” said macman85 on FIFA Forums.

Even when compared to the previous instalment to the franchise FIFA 22 is a noticeable downgrade. This brings the question; is it really worth paying $69.99 for the game? There are many games such as Resident Evil Village and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla that are very well-optimised for the 1080p and 1440p resolution on the console. However EA has set the bar really low for the FIFA franchise with this instalment. Hopefully the company takes note of this and resolves this issue in future updates.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Kathmandu Holdings Limited (NZSE:KMD) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?

Why Does Debt Bring Risk?

Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course plenty of companies use debt to fund growth without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.

See our latest analysis for Kathmandu Holdings

What Is Kathmandu Holdings's Debt?

You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers but it shows that Kathmandu Holdings had NZ$105.6m of debt in July 2021 down from NZ$241.3m one year before. However its balance sheet shows it holds NZ$142.6m in cash so it actually has NZ$37.0m net cash.

How Healthy Is Kathmandu Holdings' Balance Sheet?

According to the last reported balance sheet Kathmandu Holdings had liabilities of NZ$236.0m due within 12 months and liabilities of NZ$410.3m due beyond 12 months. On the other hand it had cash of NZ$142.6m and NZ$72.4m worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling NZ$431.3m more than its cash and near-term receivables combined.

While this might seem like a lot it is not so bad since Kathmandu Holdings has a market capitalization of NZ$1.10b and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution. Despite its noteworthy liabilities Kathmandu Holdings boasts net cash so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!

Even more impressive was the fact that Kathmandu Holdings grew its EBIT by 241% over twelve months. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings more than anything that will determine Kathmandu Holdings's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.

Story continues

But our final consideration is also important because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. While Kathmandu Holdings has net cash on its balance sheet it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Happily for any shareholders Kathmandu Holdings actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.

Summing up

While Kathmandu Holdings does have more liabilities than liquid assets it also has net cash of NZ$37.0m. And it impressed us with free cash flow of NZ$148m being 209% of its EBIT. So we don't think Kathmandu Holdings's use of debt is risky. When analysing debt levels the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example - Kathmandu Holdings has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.

While the conventional version is already available for order the manufacturer still needs about a year to launch the eCitan in the European market in the second half of 2022.

The vehicle is the fruit of a partnership with the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance and technically is basically the same as the the next-generation Renault Kangoo Z.E. called Renault Kangoo Van E-TECH Electric.

Noteworthy is that the Citan is the last Mercedes-Benz van with a conventional powertrain option and new models in the future will be only 100% electric.

Mercedes-Benz eCitan Mercedes-Benz eCitan

The eCitan will be available in cargo van and passenger Tourer versions but it's a commercial van and consumers will be pointed to buy the Mercedes-Benz EQT.

With a 44 kWh battery (usable capacity) the Mercedes-Benz eCitan is expected to have a WLTP range of 285 km (177 miles) - about 20 km more than in the case of Renault.

Other stats are the same (75 kW electric motor) 11 or 22 kW on-board charger and DC fast charging capability at up to 75 kW (10-80% SOC in about 40 minutes).

The cargo capacity of the Citan is up to 2.9 m3 or two Euro pallets while the payload is up to 320–752 kg depending on version. We guess that it will be similar in the case of eCitan.

The company uses a variety of limited and holding companies via Luxembourg Jersey and the Cayman Islands to ‘lose’ its profits and make a loss on its Dutch venture hence the zero tax bill the paper said.

The loss in the Netherlands has been created by interest charges on debts that the Dutch companies have with the Luxembourg companies the Volkskrant said.

Blackstone can deduct these interest expenses from its rental income in the Netherlands – leaving no profit and therefore no tax to be paid on the rent paid by its tenants.

The interest owed does not have to be paid either. Instead it is added to the loan every year increasing the debate and subsequently the annual deduction for interest paid the paper said.

In 2015 the then housing minister Stef Blok called on foreign investors to put money into the housing market and a number of investors have since moved in.

Blackstone now owns some 1700 homes in the Netherlands and they are valued at €793m on the company’s books.

Legal

Blackstone told the Volkskrant in a reaction that it meets Dutch legislation and all appropriate tax is paid.

‘The structure we use is in line with that used by institutional investors all over the world’ the company said. ‘In the past five years we have invested more than €4bn in the growth and improvement of our Dutch property portfolio including offices logistics hospitality housing and retail.’

Aggressive

Leiden University tax law professor Jan van de Streek told the Volkskrant that the Blackstone approach is ‘aggressive tax planning’ in the ‘danger zone’ to be considered abusive.

Tax offices are becoming more critical of the private equity approach and ultimately it would be up to the Supreme Court to say if this is legal he said.

Blackstone hit the Dutch headlines last month when it reported that 328 homes on its books in Amsterdam were empty. Property owners in the capital are required to brief the city council if their property is empty for more than six months but until that point the company had only made reports about six.

In 2019 the UN’s housing advisor accused private equity firms and Blackstone of exploiting tenants ‘wreaking havoc’ in communities and helping to fuel a global housing crisis.",,,,,,,,,,,,

By inductively heating and then rapidly cooling the mould of a plastic pack this technology simplifies the production of thinner-walled premium parts with unparalleled surface qualities whether glossy matt or textured thus bypassing the need for secondary decoration steps.

""Today there is a lot of questioning about the pack as a whole about the quantity of material used but also about the material used and the design. To address all these challenges pack manufacturers need help. We want to stand out as a solution that is complementary to the know-how of processors in the beauty sector by opening up possibilities in terms of moulding material saving and surface rendering"" explains Mathieu Boulanger. ""Either the converter is proactive and equips himself with our technology as is the case with Texen with whom we concluded a non-exclusive partnership agreement last year or it is the brand that proposes the technology directly to its suppliers"" he continues.

A sustainable approach as of the injection phase

""The use of induction allows controlling the temperature allowing the material to be more fluid and therefore to perfectly match the surface of the mould. This means we can reduce the part thickness offer material savings but also find the right temperature to sublimate the resin whether it is standard recycled or biosourced"" specifies the manager.

The Roctool equipment also allows for high value-added surface effects. The company will be giving a conference on this topic [1] at the Luxe Pack Monaco trade show. Also during the event Roctool will premiere a replication of a velvet effect with no completion stage. ""These new Velvet effects result directly from the surface of the tooling and give a fabric appearance to a plastic part with no painting or coating steps required"" details Mathieu Boulanger.

An approach favoured by Clinique

The Clinique brand of The Estée Lauder Group chose the Roctool technology to apply it in collaboration with the packaging developer Pinard to the bottles of its flagship product the Clarifying Lotion. The group says it intends to roll out this process to its entire portfolio of brands.

""At The Estée Lauder Companies we invest and innovate at every stage of our packaging processes to expand sustainable solutions and enable our brands to deliver premium quality experiences to our consumers"" explains Daniel Ramos Senior Vice President Global Packaging Estée Lauder Companies.

Like other big names in other sectors who have also been won over by the Roctool approach the cosmetics giant sees an opportunity to develop cutting-edge processes for sustainable prestige packaging.

""Consumers are now taking interest in manufacturing methods and brands who know this are relaying this message. We are in line with this approach and the next few years will see the use of the Roctool technology grow in very specific areas of beauty but always keeping in mind these three key priorities: reducing manufacturing steps moving to 100% eco-responsible transition resins while offering a higher level of design"" concludes Mathieu Boulanger.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIxMDkyNTAwNTAzMC9lbi9VV00tTGF1bmNoZXMtJUUyJTgwJTlDQk9MVCVFMiU4MCU5RC1HaXZpbmctTW9ydGdhZ2UtQnJva2Vycy1Ub29scy10by1BY2hpZXZlLTE1LU1pbnV0ZS1Jbml0aWFsLUFwcHJvdmFs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UWM Launches “BOLT” Giving Mortgage Brokers Tools to Achieve 15 Minute Initial Approval,"PONTIAC Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) the #1 wholesale and purchase lender in America announced today the launch of BOLT a self-service platform that provides the ability to get an initial approval for qualified borrowers in just 15 minutes.

This will provide them with a step-by-step process that will allow them to complete the initial approval when it’s convenient for them creating a faster experience and fewer underwriting touches.

“We're going to remember BOLT as a significant development in the mortgage industry that forever changed the way underwriting is done” said Ishbia. “UWM built this technology which uses things like doc recognition and indexing. This will allow initial approval of the file to be completed in minutes rather than hours while also ensuring guardrails and quality standards are in place as they always are with UWM to close clean loans.""

Our original story was about this lamp being sold on Facebook by a company called Ourmarketreport.com. Turns out thanks to an astute reader that is being reported as a scam site and the original idea is from an Etsy store owner named Gavin and his company Mamasboymask. And alas his version is sold out and came at a higher price tag. But all is not lost! If you love this design maybe visit his storefront and see what else he has to offer or maybe ask him to commission this awesome lamp for you! We’re sorry for the confusion]

Below is our original story. We have replaced the links to Gavin’s Etsy shop rather than the Ourmarketreport.com. Buy at your own risk:

Never fumble around in the dark Voor-keys again with this innovative table lamp. This over 14″ tall light definitely makes a statement and belongs in every horror lovers house whether you’re a casual fan of Friday the 13th or a hardcore aficionado.

As you all know in Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason Lives after a long battle with Jason Tommy (spoiler alert) sends him to the bottom of the lake with a rock secured by a heavy chain. This scene is so iconic that a few artists have done the same thing with life-sized models in lakes around the United States.

But if you can’t dive in to see the real thing this stainless steel nylon braid resin and wood novelty will definitely have the same effect only on a smaller scale.

Here are some specs according to mamasboymask:*

Sturdy Thick Glass with Screw Lid. Real Stained Wood Rustic Decking Style Lid with On/Off Switch.9V Square Battery Not Included (so no shipping restrictions)

Comes with ALL accessories as shown in the photos – including Neca Jason Part 6 Figure Sterling Silver weathered Chain Real chained rock Gravel Stones for the bottom of the lake Glass Suction Attachment to secure Jason afloat Velcro Strap for securing the Battery Splashproof Battery/electrical cover Jason’s Neca accessories if you would like to scatter various weapons on the bottom of the lake bed.

The item is custom framed by hand for a great piece of horror film memorabilia that is sure to be the centerpiece of your collection.

Best refrigerators at a glance

Best refrigerator: Whirlpool 25.2-cubic foot 3-Door 36-in French Door Refrigerator

Why we chose the Whirlpool WRF535SWHZ:

This Whirlpool fridge doesn’t offer much in the way of smarts but it manages to combine the right features with a beautiful design and plenty of space. It also comes with an affordable price tag so you can add elegance and functionality to your kitchen without paying too much. You can choose between stainless steel black stainless black or white getting just the right style for your kitchen.

It includes large French doors with humidity-controlled drawers that keep produce fresh with FreshFlow Produce Preserver technology. Another thing we really like about this fridge is that it doesn’t frost produce and milk as often as other models we’ve encountered even when you place groceries on the top shelf of the fridge. The interior water dispenser also provides EveryDrop water so you have easy access to filtered water.

Overall the Whirlpool WRF535SWHZ is somewhat basic when compared to some of the fancier smarter fridges available (like the Samsung Family Hub or LG InstaView) but it works well looks good and gives you just what you need for under $2000.

Best refrigerator for limited space: GE GLE12HSPSS

Why we chose the GE GLE12HSPSS:

This 11.9-cubic-foot bottom-mount fridge measures 24 inches across (an excellent choice for narrow spaces) with high-quality fingerprint-resistant stainless steel so it’ll maintain its stylish appearance. It has reversible doors making it even easier to fit the fridge in a smaller space. Plus it’s counter-deep which makes it fit flush with most counters and gives it a built-in look.

Although this fridge is small it still has plenty of space and it boasts quite a few cool features including high-quality LED lighting a removable wine rack frameless shelves and a no-frost freezer compartment. There’s also a Temp Zone Drawer where you can choose between three temperature settings for meat beverages or produce. It doesn’t come with an ice maker but does allow you to add one later on if you prefer.

Sensors in the fridge monitor and automatically adjust temperature and humidity levels and Max Cool and Fast Cool options allow you to create the optimal cooling environment for your foods. The GE GLE12HSPSS might not be the best fridge for you if you have a large family and you cook at home a lot but for those with smaller kitchens or who regularly eat away from home this fridge is a solid option.

Best budget refrigerator: GE French Door GNE25JMKES

Why we chose the GE French Door GE GNE25JMKES:

This fridge is well-stocked with features. Behind those sleek doors you’ll find a water dispenser while a drawer in the freezer fills up with ice so you don’t have to make it yourself. Its crisp LED lighting helps you see inside the 24.8-cubic-foot interior (17.5 in the fridge 7.3 in the freezer). That freezer is particularly large making this fridge a good choice for those who like to keep a large stock of frozen goods. There are two humidity-controlled drawers so you can choose settings for fruits or vegetables plus another full-width drawer with temperature controls for cold or coldest.

If a recent grocery trip takes the fridge from empty to stuffed the Turbo Cool button can help bring it back down to the correct temperature. The 6-gallon bins are adjustable and a “quick space” shelf folds underneath to accommodate taller items. The glass shelves and clear bins will help you keep track of your food too.

A nice French door fridge for the price the GE French Door GNE25JMKES is a steal when it goes on sale.

Best French door refrigerator: LG LFDS22520S

Why we chose the LG LFDS22520S:

While LG is often known for their high-tech appliances they can also make solid beautiful designs — and one of the best examples is this French door model which combines useful features with the French dual-door style. This helps add extra room to the fridge (especially when it comes to shelf space) while offering a very large freezer drawer that can really pack in supplies.

But the 21.8-cubic foot LG fridge has more to offer than just room. There’s a smart cooling system that carefully maintains the atmosphere inside for maximum freshness including multiple airflow channels. The two-tier freezer drawer allows for many different organization opportunities depending on what you want to freeze while the water/ice dispenser is intelligent while still being easy to use and clean. You can go for a slightly larger model if you want even more room (and have the kitchen space for it) but this size makes the most of the French door design at a more affordable price.

Best bottom freezer refrigerator: Whirlpool WRB322DMBM

Why we chose the Whirlpool WRB322DMBM:

Whirlpool’s 22.07-cubic-foot fridge includes an extra-spacious bottom freezer drawer to store all of your long-term supplies plus a handy ice maker. It’s pretty smart for a freezer — the built-in defrost monitors the freezer environment and runs defrost cycles whenever they are necessary to help deal with frost conditions fast while also saving energy.

The upper portion of Whirlpool’s fridge also impresses with two large humidity-controlled drawers spill-proof glass shelves and a temperature management system that monitors temperatures and makes adjustments based on the type of environment you’d like to create.

Note that the Whirlpool WRB322DMBM comes in several different colors to more easily match the inside of your kitchen and the door is reversible if necessary.

Best top freezer refrigerator: Maytag MRT311FFFZ

Why we chose the Maytag MRT311FFFZ:

Top freezer models tend to be affordable and strong options for users who don’t need a lot of freezer space but still use it for a limited amount of important items. This Maytag fridge with its 6.09-cubic-foot freezer and 20.5-cubic-foot refrigerator compartment is a perfect example. Available in multiple shades the fridge includes bright LED lights and easy electronic temperature controls.

Maytag also includes what it calls a “PowerCold” feature a button that instantly lowers the fridge temperature for a time to get everything in there cold again an ideal choice if the fridge has been open for a long time while cooking or unloading groceries.

Other features of the Maytag MRT311FFFZ include an optional space for an ice maker kit two humidity-controlled drawers and spill-proof glass shelves. It’s not the most feature-rich fridge on the market but it’s a solid top freezer model with Maytag’s high-quality components to rely on.

Best refrigerator under $1500: Frigidaire FRSS26L3AF

Why we chose the Frigidaire FRSS26L3AF:

If you’re looking for an affordable fridge that doesn’t skimp on useful features this Frigidaire dual-door model should hit the spot. It includes a sleek stainless steel design water and ice dispensers and 25.6 cubic feet of space. Frigidaire specializes in durable fridges at lower prices and this model is one of the best examples of its work!

Other useful features include the EvenTemp cooling system long-lasting and well-placed LED lights and thorough water filtration with an indicator light so you know when it’s time to replace the filter. There aren’t a lot of extra features on this fridge which helps keep the price low but everything here is high-quality and ready to last making it a great choice if you want to keep your spending under $1500 but still want to get the best possible design.

Best smart refrigerator: LG Studio Smart Wi-Fi Enabled 23.5-cubic foot Counter-Depth French Door Refrigerator



Why we chose the LG SRFVC2406S:

If you’re looking for the ultimate smart fridge this Wi-Fi-enabled fridge by LG is loaded with bells and whistles. It has the door-in-door InstaView feature with a mirrored-glass panel that lets you see inside the InstaView door and an adjustable bin that glides up and down to fit larger snacks and drinks. You also get dual ice makers with this model so you can have regular cubes crushed ice or round craft ice. Craft ice is especially fun as it lasts for so long in your drink and is a huge hit with guests.

The 23.5-cubic-foot fridge has the basics like temperature-controlled drawers water filtration and the ability to keep your foods evenly cooled. It even has digital sensors and delivers blasts of cool air to reach every corner of the fridge. Since this is a smart fridge it also works with Alexa and Google Assistant. Plus it boasts features like a door alarm a child safety lock and more.

What’s not to love about the LG SRFVC2406S? The price for one which comes in at close to $4500. Also even though this fridge makes excellent use of the space you can find models with much more space inside for your groceries.

Researching and buying tips

What’s the best brand of refrigerator?

Whirlpool tends to receive high marks from both consumers and analysts. Yale Appliances ranks Whirlpool as the most reliable appliance brand based on the number of appliances sold versus the number serviced. LG and Samsung rank second and third respectively. Many of the larger brands like GE KitchenAid and Kenmore also tend to receive respectable consumer ratings.

While Whirlpool is typically a safe bet not all refrigerators from the same brand are created equal. You may find a GE fridge that’s better than a similar model Whirlpool or you might find a Samsung fridge that’s better than a GE. There is no one-size-fits-all way to determine the best refrigerator brand so researching each refrigerator model individually is the best approach. However you can hold some comfort in knowing your fridge is made by a trusted brand like Whirlpool. You can find more information about the best refrigerator brands here.

What size refrigerator do I need?

This depends primarily on the size of your household the size of the space and the way you want the fridge to look in your space. You’ll need a minimum of 4 to 6 cubic feet for each adult in your household. You’ll probably also want to add an extra 6 cubic feet of storage space for occasions like dinner parties and holiday gatherings. If you’re a household of two and you don’t eat at home a lot 14 cubic feet should be fine. However if you’re a couple who eats at home and hosts gatherings at your house you’ll probably want at least 18 cubic feet. Families of four who eat at home and have older kids will want at least 24 cubic feet.

To find the right size fridge for your space measure the height width and depth of the space. You’ll also need to make sure you have enough space for the fridge door to open and make sure you have an additional inch or so behind the fridge and at the top for things like plugs and ventilation. You also have to make sure your fridge can fit through all of your doors hallways or any areas you have to navigate to get the refrigerator into the space. Refrigerators tend to come in 30-inch 33-inch and 36-inch sizes so spaces in kitchens often fall into one of these sizes.

What’s the best refrigerator organization?

Before choosing a refrigerator consider your shopping habits and how you organize your produce meats lunch meats and frozen foods. If you’re the super-organized type (maybe you label everything in your fridge) you might want a fridge with extra compartments. These extra compartments make it so you can separate fruits from veggies and lunch meats from cheeses. Modern refrigerators have a lot of different tools to help you like humidity controls for more sensitive vegetables or drawers designed to keep prepared foods cool before you eat.

Consider the freezer organization too and how you organize your frozen foods. Many bottom-freezer fridges have drawers that are wide and short while the freezers in side-by-side fridges typically have shelves that are taller and narrower.

What about ice makers water dispensers and vegetable drawers?

When you’re shopping for a refrigerator features like an ice maker and water dispenser might feel like extras but these are important factors to consider. When you’re going through your day-to-day routine you might wish you had an ice maker (or didn’t have one). Some people value having an ice maker because it lets you have ice on demand while others feel like it takes up too much space or that it’s a leak hazard if the power goes out while you’re on vacation.

Most water dispensers require a filter and you have to change it every six months. If you use the water dispenser regularly changing the filter is a small price to pay for the cost savings and environmental impact associated with using the dispenser instead of drinking from water bottles. However some people don’t want to deal with the hassle of changing the filter or they already have an existing water filtration solution in their home.

If you store a lot of fruits and veggies in your fridge it’s a good idea to look for a refrigerator with two separate humidity-controlled crisper drawers. This way you can store your fruits and veggies that rot like peaches pears and honeydew in a low-humidity drawer. You can also store your fruits and veggies that wilt like lettuce broccoli and cabbage in a high-humidity drawer.

Do smart refrigerators exist and should I buy one?

Smart refrigerators like the Samsung Family Hub and LG InstaView Door-in-Door Smart Fridge connect to Wi-Fi and this allows for additional features. They may have internal cameras so you can see inside of your fridge while you’re away from home or doors that automatically close when left open. They may also offer remote troubleshooting options or have a touchscreen interface on the front of the fridge.

If you value these types of features you should absolutely buy a smart fridge provided you’ve done your homework on the appliance.

Does refrigerator energy efficiency matter?

Absolutely. According to Energy Star if you replace your old fridge with an Energy Star certified one you can save more than $200 over the life of the product. In addition to the savings you’re also helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

What is the best month to buy a refrigerator?

Specific times of the year can largely sway the cost of your new potential refrigerators. Fridges are a unique home appliance and they don’t follow many other market trends. New refrigerator models are released in the spring unlike any other large home appliance. Manufacturers release fridges like they do the greatest coolers; spring is the best time to prepare for hot weather. March through May is the best time to lock in a new fridge or an excellent sale on last year’s inventory. Memorial Day is a prime time for exclusive fridge deals.

What Should I Look for in a Refrigerator Repair Warranty?

In addition to the length of the warranty — one year two years etc. — check exactly what’s covered. It’s common for a manufacturer warranty to cover one year of parts and labor which is just enough time to protect you in the event that your fridge had issues from the start. However it’s best to find a warranty that offers extended coverage for the compressor which tends to be a common issue later on down the line.

Do Bottom Freezer Refrigerators Have More Problems?

The biggest issues with bottom freezer fridges tend to be access issues as they often cost more involve more bending to reach items and they allow small children to more easily reach items inside of the freezer. However in terms of repair issues fridges/freezers with ice makers tend to have more issues than those without ice makers as the ice maker is somewhat of a common failure point.

How Do You Know Your Fridge is Dying?

If your fridge is older (12 plus years) if you’ve been having to perform a lot of repairs or if it’s not cooling the way it’s supposed to these are obvious signs you might need a new unit. Sometimes the signs are more subtle though. You might notice a lot of heat coming from the back of the unit your electric bill might be increasing or perhaps the fridge is making a loud noise.

How Do You Get Rid of Your Old Fridge?

You can donate or sell your old fridge on your own or you can ask if the delivery service for your new fridge will take your old fridge with them. Most areas offer some sort of appliance donation but you can also contact a local recycling center. If you have a working fridge consider selling it on a local yard sale site or on a site like letgo.

How we test refrigerators

One of our definitive markers for what makes an excellent refrigerator is its appearance. It’s the center of your kitchen and if it has a terrible non-functional design not only will you hate looking at it but it won’t work efficiently. Appearance is a significant part of our ranking system. Whether a fridge has any unique defining characteristics can improve its functionality as well. If your fridge can do things that others can’t it’ll feel like your investment is tailor-made to your home.

While our ranking system values your kitchen’s space constraints and the fridge’s aesthetics in our final numbers the appliance’s internal volume and ratios are just as essential. We also heavily consider performance. Keep an eye out for aftermarket customization options which can impact the amount of space inside your fridge. We have more details on how we test refrigerators and other appliances here.

You can expand your Xbox One memory by adding an external hard drive. Just make sure that these requirements are met by the external hard drive:

A minimum capacity of 256 GB

It supports USB 3.0

How to get more storage on Xbox One without hard drive

Apart from removing unused games you can free up more disk space as follows:

Press the Xbox button on your controller

Select Profile & system > Settings > System > Storage.

On the Manage storage devices screen select: Clear local Xbox 360 storage: This deletes Xbox 360 games saved locally but they’ll remain in the cloud. Clear local saved games: This deletes games saved to your hard drive but they’ll still be saved to the cloud.



How many Xbox games can 1TB hold?

An Xbox console with a 1TB hard drive can hold about 18 – 20 games. Chances are you might still remain with some extra space.

As digital downloads have gradually taken over for game discs Steam makes managing hundreds of games simple. But what happens when you fill up your storage? Can you change the game location in Steam? Can you move games to a different drive?

While Steam does an excellent job of managing your library you can control where games get installed and even move them if you upgrade your storage or want different locations.

Changing Game Locations in Steam

For games that come on a disc their size limit gets based on storage capacity. The games require updates that get stored on a drive. Downloaded games are massively huge but all files easily fit on hard drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs) in one central location—with minor exceptions of course. It’s not unusual for a game to take up 60-120GB of storage and with downloadable content (DLC) add-ons mods and save files storage is very much at a premium.

Steam creates a game storage folder by default but does let you choose where it makes it. You can also create different game folders within Steam and have them in other locations to suit your needs. Here’s how to do it.

Launch Steam then click on “Steam -> Preferences” at the top. Select “Downloads” from the navigational menu on the left. Under the “Content Libraries” section click on “STEAM LIBRARY FOLDERS.” In the “STORAGE MANAGER” window that appears add a new folder to download/install your games. Click the “+” icon. Browse for a new folder and click on “SELECT” to add it. You can also add a new folder by clicking on the folder where you want a new one to reside and select “NEW FOLDER.”

Now whenever you add a new game Steam will prompt you for the location to download and install it.

How to Move Game Downloads of Existing Steam Games

Many Steam users find that they run out of space on the currently used partition of existing storage or need to replace the drive due to failure or upgrade it to get more space. If Steam already exists and you already have games there you can move them if you want. Here are some ways to change game download locations in Steam.

There is a clunky way to move your games and a sensible one. As I tried both I’ll describe both. This first way is the inexact way but it works.

For a replacement drive or upgraded drive have your operating system recognize the new device and format it. Mac uses the Apple File System (APFS) and Windows uses the New Technology File System (NTFS). In the existing games location remove any games you no longer need installed to make the entire process faster. Copy your Steam folder to the new drive. Start Steam let it load and select a game. Right click the game and select “Properties.” Select “Local Files” and “Verify Integrity of Local Files.” Select the new location for Steam when it says it cannot find local files.

Copying your Steam folder will take a while which is why it makes sense to remove any games you don’t need. This solution doesn’t work with every game so you may want to uninstall it from Steam and reinstall it in the new location. You won’t have to download the files again. You can have Steam identify the game and add it to your library.

A better way to move games to a new drive is by creating a new games folder in that drive.

How to Create a New Games Folder in Steam

Creating a new Steam game folder is arguably a better way to move games to other locations. The process is built into Steam and means you can add games wherever you want. This method is a better solution for changing a game’s folder because it doesn’t require you to uninstall and rediscover games within Steam.

In Steam click on “Menu” at the top and select “Settings.” Choose “Downloads” then “Steam Library Folders” from the center. Select “Add Library Folder” and point it to your new games location. Name your folder and select it to add it to your “Games Library.”

How to Move Games between Steam Game Folders

Once you have multiple folders you can move games between them. If you have added an extra drive to fit more games you can add your new folder to the new drive and move games between them. Here’s how.

Select the game right click and select “Properties.” Choose “Local Files” then “Move Install Folder.” Select your new games folder and choose “Move Folder.”

This process retains all Steam links for the move and won’t interfere with saved games or other settings.

Combine Multiple Disks as One Partition in Windows 10 for Steam Games

If you add a new drive to your system rather than moving games extend the volume to include the existing game drive and the new one. Both Windows and Steam see a single partition but it becomes spanned over two different HDDs or SSDs. You can do this multiple times and it is a straightforward way to manage disk space. Here’s how to do it.

Add your new drive to your computer and have Windows format it. Select any drive in Windows Explorer right click and select “Manage.” Select “Disk Management” from the left of the new window. Convert your game disks from “Basic” to “Dynamic” by right clicking and selecting “Convert to Dynamic Disk.” Select your original games disk right click it then select “Extend.” Select the new disk in the new window and click on “Add.” Enter a size of your new partition on the right and select “Next.” Click on “Finish” to commit your changes.

The above process is a much more elegant way to manage games in Steam. You can theoretically add more disks when you fill them up and expand the partition as far as you like!"

Too many businesses are rolling over to accommodate the demands of woke activists.

Doing so writes Project 21 member Derrick Hollie only encourages the left to come back for more:

For America’s business leaders the question shouldn’t be “how long must we ride out the storm?” The question now is “are we ready for the moment when the mob turns against my organization?”

In a Newsmax commentary co-authored with Jack Kalavritino Derrick notes that succumbing to the woke mob does not have to be a certainty as long as a company is prepared:

With the right strategies and some courage blue chip multinationals and local mom and pop enterprises alike can navigate the woke waters. Indeed they will have to because calmer seas don’t seem to be on the horizon.

Over the past few years the left has made extraordinary gains in getting CEOs to align their companies with the progressive agenda:

“Engine No. 1 pushed three of their preferred candidates onto ExxonMobil’s board of directors despite owning just 0.02% of the company’s shares.”

three of their preferred candidates onto ExxonMobil’s board of directors despite owning just 0.02% of the company’s shares.” “North Face refused to fulfill a custom apparel order from oil and gas company Innovex Downhole Solutions.”

to fulfill a custom apparel order from oil and gas company Innovex Downhole Solutions.” “Delta and Coca-Cola… hitch[ed] their wagons to unfounded left-wing criticism of Georgia’s voter ID law.”

Yet it seems there truly is not a lot of thought – or passion – for those causes on the part of the business community other than trying to avoid harassment from the left. That’s the weak link that conservatives need to target.

As an example of this Derrick notes the rather sloppy display when it came to executives defending their actions in the Georgia election integrity battle:

Senator Tim Scott asked a group of banking CEOs to highlight what made the Georgia voting law so discriminatory. The awkward 14 seconds of silence – a total inability or unwillingness to answer – was a public relations black eye. The CEOs looked foolish or uninformed – something they would never tolerate of themselves on an earnings call.

There’s also the fact that woke business leaders could be hurting their workforce as well as potential new hires and customers:

Companies embracing wokeism also risk alienating conservative and moderate shareholders and consumers who are equally turning up the heat in response to corporate America’s genuflections to political correctness.

Derrick gives a shout-out to the National Center’s Free Enterprise Project which is the most active shareholder activist organization on the right. Derrick says that to make a difference like FEP does more work needs to be done to make sure “executives must know the facts – or non-facts – of what [the left is] claiming.”

Having all the eggs or rather all the humanity in one basket if you will is surely not an encouraging sign for the continuation of our species. It didn’t work very well for the dinosaurs. They walked on this planet for millions of years and were strong and unbeatable.

However an asteroid came hurtling down the atmosphere of earth and brought the reign of the dinosaurs to an end. That was about 65 million years ago. That was also the fifth and the last time there was a mass extinction. So it’s only a survival strategy to be on more than one planet. However the calls for becoming an interplanetary species might be playing right into the hands of climate action spoilers.

The warriors against climate action have deployed tactics to blunt any action that tries to stop the use of fossil fuels. Those tactics called the five Ds of the climate war are denialism deflection disinformation delayism and doomism. Once the revelation that fossil fuels usage was warming the planet left the confines of the ExxonMobil labs and became global denialism became the norm. Scientists and media attack dogs were unleashed with hefty paychecks to launch a sophisticated and aggressive denial campaign. Very few people today dwell in that phase. Even Rupert Murdoch’s media empire is shifting its stance toward climate change after spending decades denying it.

The Disinformation weapon in the arsenal of the fossil fuel industry is for spreading falsehoods about climate change. That while the planet may be warming it could be just natural environmental changes. That climate degradation is not due to human caused carbon emissions such as when the Murdoch owned media in Australia blamed the arsonists for the Australian bushfires last year.

Delayism and doomism sit on opposing perches yet cause people to behave in the same way. Delayism says no need to panic business as usual is fine. That the scientific community has been creating false alarms for decades now. The government and the private sector will figure something out. It creates lethargy which leads to inactivism. Elon Musk advocates for colonising Mars. It is with good intentions but what it does is convince people that there is a plan B or rather planet B and so they can just chill and go about business as usual without pricking their governments for action.

Doomism says we have almost reached the tipping point and so any action wouldn’t have enough effect to save us from the 6th extinction. The extreme alarms emanating from scientists journalists academia activists and so forth provide a sanctuary for those who have signed up to the belief that we are all doomed anyway. It is especially the favorite go-to argument of those who like to justify their no-action stance based on religion. That the end of times is unavoidable.

Deflection is the most sinister and cunning of all because it also includes dividing the well-intentioned activists. It basically tries to instill in our minds that climate action has to be taken by all of us. That we must change our lifestyles such as driving less eating less beef having fewer children flying less and so forth. This can easily lead to people quarrelling over each other’s actions as some sort of a licence before advocating for climate action. It changes the topic from fossil fuel industry and media collusion to individual hypocrisy.

Books such as The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells are great and insightful. However such books focus on the individual action more than on the actions of the fossil fuel industry and governmental policy changes such as carbon tax and subsidising and increasing the scale of clean energy production. And that focus toward the retail factor and away from the wholesale one is perhaps the most impeccable trick the devil has invented in the story of climate change.

Knotfest returned to Iowa for the first time since its inaugural year in 2012. It's also the closest the festival has ever been to Des Moines the city Slipknot — the festival's heavy-metal namesake — emerged from more than two decades ago.

In the time since its inception the festival has grown into an international affair with the festival being held in Japan in 2014 and Mexico the following year.

Though attendance for this weekend's event has not yet been released organizers anticipated as many as 30000 attendees.

More:Slipknot would probably reject a Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction Corey Taylor said

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

That 30000 attendance was reinforced by singer Corey Taylor who took the stage with the rest of Slipknot to end the night with a bang walking onto the stage bathed in blue light to perform ""Unstainted"" and ""Disasterpiece.""

""My friends my family it is so good to be home"" Taylor said to the sold crowd after the first two songs.

The last time Slipknow played in Iowa was for the 2019 State Fair drawing 17032 fans. At the time the group set the record for the new State Fair Grandstand stage. That record was usurped just over a month ago by Chris Stapleton who pulled 17320 attendees to his State Fair performance.

This year's line-up included other bands including Gojira Suicide Boys and Lamb of God the last of which also appeared at the first Knotfest.

Earlier this year Slipknot fans lost Joey Jordison's when he died on July 26. The drummer was 46 years old and though he'd left the band in 2013 his influence on the band was immeasurable as one of its founding members.

More than two dozen container ships appear to be stuck at sea miles off the south shore of Long Island according to a maritime traffic monitoring website as more than 60 vessels wait to dock at two of the country’s largest ports on the West Coast.

The logjam at the nation's three busiest ports comes as the economy reels from a supply chain crunch which as been exacerbated by a shortage of truck drivers. The situation has deteriorated to the point where supermarkets have been unable to stock their shelves with products while FedEx has had to reroute hundreds of thousands of packages.

MarineTraffic the global ship tracking site shows cargo ships and oil tankers clustered just a few miles off of the coastline that stretches from Long Beach in the west to Lido Beach and Jones Beach Island in the east.

As of 9pm local time the ships appear to have remained in place for hours.

The Port of New York and New Jersey appears to be beset by the same congestion caused by the surge in imports that has created a massive logjam of shipping containers waiting to berth in the waters of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

DailyMail.com has reached out to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey seeking comment.

Some two dozen container ships appear to be stuck at sea miles off the south shore of Long Island.

The New York area has not been immune to the supply chain crunch that is affecting the American economy.

John Catsimatidis the owner of the Gristedes grocery chain says that his stores have experienced shortages in Coca-Cola products.

'We have shortages in our New York stores because Coca-Cola they can't get truck drivers to deliver into New York City' he told Fox Business.

'And it's a serious problem.'

Earlier this summer New York and New Jersey surpassed Long Beach as the second biggest port in the country. Los Angeles is the largest port in the US.

In June LA recorded 467763 TEU of imports. TEU or twenty-foot equivalent unit is a unit of measurement used to determine cargo capacity for container ships and terminals.

The port of NY/NJ saw a 47.8 percent year-on-year increase in June. It recorded 390169 TEU according to The Load Star.

The increased activity at the ports is a result of the surge in imports driven by demand for consumer goods that Americans are eager to buy after the end of coronavirus-related lockdowns.

The enormous demand doesn’t appear to be showing any signs of slowing down in the near future according to analysts.

Earlier on Saturday a satellite image captured more than 60 container ships that are stuck waiting to dock outside the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach as a massive supply chain crunch hits the United States.

The extraordinary sight of vessels unable to berth is due in part because of a massive backlog that has been caused by a sudden surge in American buying ahead of the holiday season.

The number of ships that are currently anchored outside the major ports which moves 40 percent of containers in the United States has tripled over the course of the past two months to 62.

Amid a record-high demand for imported goods and a shortage of shipping containers and truckers the twin ports are currently seeing unprecedented congestion

Lines are now at their longest since the start of the pandemic.

The backup at the country's busiest port complex has been brought on by a pandemic-induced buying boom coupled with a labor shortage that has overwhelmed the port workforce according to port officials say.

The shipping traffic jams come as the US and some other economies are beginning to head towards normalcy and shows how messy the reopening of business is proving to be more than 18 months since the pandemic's onset.

It also shows just how fragile supply chains remain.

The 62 container ships waiting to dock include 42 container ships physically at anchor and 20 in drift areas according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California which tracks ship traffic in the area.

The West Coast ports have faced traffic since August when a then record-breaking 44 container ships were stuck off the coast due to similar disruptions.

The traffic-jam at the ports which serves as the main entry point for goods coming from China has even directly impacted the prices for artificial Christmas trees.

The port of Long Beach is now testing out a 24/7 pilot program that would expand the hours for cargo pickup to a time when there is less traffic in the region allowing for speedier deliveries.

'We are in the midst of an historic surge in cargo and our terminal operators and other supply chain partners are giving their all to keep it all moving' Port of Long Beach Executive Director Mario Cordero said in a statement.

'We welcome this pilot project by TTI as a first step toward extending gates to 24/7 operations and we encourage our cargo owners and trucking partners to give this innovative program a try.'

Shipping company FedEx is rerouting more than 600000 packages a day as it scrambles to cope with the labor shortage plaguing businesses throughout the US.

Raj Subramaniam chief operating officer at FedEx announced this week that understaffing problems have caused 'widespread inefficiencies' at the shipping company.

Subramaniam said that major shipping hubs like the one in Portland Oregon are running on '65 percent of the staffing needed to handle its normal volume.'

As a result the hubs are diverting about 25 per cent of the packages that normally come through Fox Business News reports.

FedEx Chief Operating Officer Raj Subramaniam said the inefficiencies are occurring across the US

The diverted packages must then be 'rerouted and processed which drives inefficiencies in our operations and in turn higher costs' Subramaniam said.

'These inefficiencies included adding incremental linehaul and delivery routes meaning more miles driven and higher use of third-party transportation to enable us to bypass Portland entirely.'

FedEx Chief Financial Officer Mike Lenz added that the problems will most likely persist for the rest of the year.

The labor shortages are not only delaying shipments but also affecting all shopping across the nation.

Shoppers looking to buy anything from electronics to sneakers to automobiles - and even household staples like toilet paper - could be out of luck as retailers face a dire combination of supply chain problems labor shortages and inflationary pressures with the holiday season fast approaching.

Costco on Thursday said it was reinstating limits on purchases of toilet paper paper towels and bottled water.

Nike is struggling to find enough shipping containers to deliver its merchandise from overseas.

And General Motors said it would cut production at its plants in Indiana Missouri and Tennessee this month because of the dearth of microchips. Ford Motor is also reducing truck production.

Prices for a cargo container have skyrocketed from $2000 two years ago to as much as $25000 this year

Nike has seen transit time of its merchandise being transported from its factories in Asia to the US double because of lack of containers port congestion and labor shortages

The moves come as Americans are getting ready to loosen their purse strings and hit the stores ahead of the fall and winter holidays.

A resurgence in COVID-19 cases had led to hoarding of household essentials last year during lockdowns forcing Costco to put limits on purchases of some household goods.

While there was a shortage of cleaning supplies even last year transportation issues this year are causing delays in deliveries to stores despite suppliers having plenty of stock Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said in an earnings call.

'A year ago there was a shortage of merchandise' Galanti said. 'Now they've got plenty of merchandise but there's two- or three-week delays on getting it delivered because there's a limit on short-term changes to trucking and delivery needs of the suppliers so it really is all over the board.'

The pandemic-driven port congestion and labor shortages have forced retail chains including Costco to spend more on transportation and labor digging into their margins.

Galanti said the bulk retail chain is placing orders early to restock merchandise. The company also has chartered three ships for 2022 that will transport containers laden with goods between Asia the US and Canada. Each vessel is capable of carrying 800 to 1000 containers at a time.

Costco is not alone: the global furniture giant Ikea has purchased its own shipping containers to move merchandise. And like Costco Walmart has also chartered ships to keep its stores well stocked ahead of the holidays.

Speaking at a conference earlier this month Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said that supply chain problems and inventory shortages are as severe as he can remember in his 30 years in the business.

In a bid to strengthen it's supply chain the mega-retailer is looking to hire an additional 20000 workers to fill full-time and part-time positions in 250 Walmart and Sam's Club stores across the US reported Fox Business.

Walmart is still facing skyrocketing labor and shipping costs amid supply chain backlogs.

Costco announced on Thursday it was bringing back limits on purchases of items like toilet paper paper towels and bottled water

Facing supply chain woes Walmart has chartered ships to keep its stores well stocked ahead of the holidays

Costco said it was paying six times for containers and shipping due to price increase on items shipped overseas; up to 8 per cent more for paper goods; as much as 11 per cent for plastic and resin products including trash bags and cups and 3 to 10 per cent more for apparel reported Fox Business.

A 40-foot container cost less than $2000 to transport goods from Asia to the U.S. two years ago. Today the service could cost as much as $25000 if an importer pays a premium for on-time delivery which is a luxury according to Bloomberg Businessweek.

Prices also have gone up other popular products including aluminum foil soda meat oil and coffee.

Due to a severe worldwide computer chip shortage Galanti warned that customers should expect delays and shortages on appliances and electronics including computers tablets and video games.

Galanti estimated that Costco's price inflation for its products is now in the 3.5-4.5 per cent range which represents an increase from last quarter's estimate of 2.5-3.5 per cent.

The raw materials crunch has been worsened by the latest wave of infections driven by the Delta variant of the coronavirus primarily in Southeast Asia as well as by congestion at ports in China.

The multibillion-dollar apparel business has not escaped the squeeze of supply chain problems.

During a recent conference call with analysts Nike CFO Matt Friend said the brand has seen transit time of its merchandise being transported from its factories in Asia to the US double from 40 days to 80 days because of lack of containers port congestion and labor shortages.

Friend predicted that inventory shortages will last into 2023 due to lost weeks of production and transit delays reported Yahoo! Finance.

Domestically a massive backlog of 62 ships waiting to dock at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach which handle 40 per cent of all containers arriving in the US which has further exacerbated supply chain woes.

The West Coast ports have faced traffic since August when a then record-breaking 44 container ships were stuck off the coast due to similar disruptions.

The backup at the country's busiest port complex was brought on by a combination of it being peak shipping period due to the upcoming holiday season and a pandemic-induced buying boom coupled with a labor shortage that has overwhelmed the port workforce port officials say.

The traffic-jam at the ports which serves as the main entry point for goods coming from China has even directly impacted the prices for artificial Christmas trees.

Balsam Hill an artificial tree company based in California is selling its four-and-a-half-foot tall Grand Canyon Cedar Tree for $499 this year. That is $199 more than the same tree cost in 2020 - a two-thirds increase in price in just 12 months.

Supply chain headaches are impacting other industries as well including home construction. In an article published by Bloomberg Businessweek last week RoxAnne Thomas logistics manager for the Illinois-based Gerber Plumbing Fixtures LLC described struggling to find free containers to transport bathroom equipment from China and Mexico to the US and dealing with massive delays.

Bloomberg reported that about 25 million containers are in use worldwide carrying goods aboard 6000 ships.

The world's top 10 shipping companies control 85 per cent of global freight capacity.

Thomas predicted that at this rate the issues with supply chains and shortages could last well into 2023.

To help reduce delays for ships the southern California ports are working with the Biden administration and the transportation department Long Beach mayor Robert Garcia announced on Twitter.

Meanwhile shares in Costco which beat market expectations for quarterly revenue on strong demand for fresh foods snacks household items and jewelry were up about 1 per cent after the closing bell on Thursday.

People returning to social events and outdoor activities following the rollout of vaccines has boosted demand for sporting goods and jewelry at Costco stores and helped offset some of the slowdown in sales of groceries following last year's lockdown-induced panic buying.

Costco's total revenue rose to $62.68 billion in the fourth quarter from $53.38 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $61.30 billion according to IBES data from Refinitiv.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hZGRpdGlvbi1pbnZlc3RzLTEyNS1taWxsaW9uLW1vcmUtaW4taXBvLWJvdW5kLWRlbGhpdmVyeS0xMDE2MzI1MTU4MTY4MTUuaHRtbNIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hZGRpdGlvbi1pbnZlc3RzLTEyNS1taWxsaW9uLW1vcmUtaW4taXBvLWJvdW5kLWRlbGhpdmVyeS0xMDE2MzI1MTU4MTY4MTUtYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Addition invests $125 million more in IPO-bound Delhivery,"Delhivery which is aiming for an initial public offering (IPO) has raised an additional $125 million in funding from Addition a fund floated by former Tiger Global executive Lee Fixel.

Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC which invested through its unit Gamnat Pte; Abu Dhabi-based private investment firm Chimera Investment LLC; and Baillie Gifford which invested through Pacific Horizon Investment Trust had also participated in the funding round.

“Delhivery has established a market-leading position by innovating across the logistics space and has attracted several marquee investors” Fixel said on Friday. It is well-positioned to transform the global supply chain he added.

New Delhi-based Delhivery had last raised $25 million from alternative investments firm Steadview Capital in a secondary transaction in December 2020. At that time Delhivery CEO Sahil Barua had said the company aims to go public in 12-15 months.

In July FedEx Express a subsidiary of US-based logistics major FedEx Corp invested $100 million in Delhivery. As part of the agreement FedEx Express will focus on international export and import services to and from India while Delhivery will sell FedEx Express’ international products and services in the Indian market and provide pick-up and delivery services across the country."

Out of the total 18 bidders half are new to solar manufacturing.

In the shortlist Adani Infrastructure Jindal India Solar Reliance New Energy and Shirdi Sai Electricals are the highest scorers with each of them winning 100 marks—owing to the fact they offered full extent of integration up to polysilicon manufacturing stage (50 marks) and a maximum capacity of 4 GW each (another 50 marks). USA-based thin-film module First Solar is also a strong contender with 90 marks (50 marks awarded for full integration plus 40 marks for 3 GW proposed capacity).

Also on the shortlist are Coal India Limited CubicPV Larsen and Toubro and ReNew Power which submitted bids for module fabs integrated up to ingots-wafers manufacturing from outsourced polysilicon. And Avaada Energy Acme Solar Emmvee PV Jupiter Solar Megha Engineering Premier Energies Tata Power Solar Vikram Solar and Waaree Energies as bidders for cell and module manufacturing (please see the below chart released by JMK Research).

“The bidder/manufacturer getting higher marks will get preference in the allocation of manufacturing capacity under the PLI scheme. In case of equal marks the bidder/manufacturer quoting the least total PLI amount for five years’ period followed by a higher ‘Extent of integration’ followed by higher ‘Manufacturing Capacity’ will get priority in the selection” as per the PLI bid document.

The shortlisted applicants will lodge bids based on the level of PLI funding they will require for five years after their planned factories are commissioned.

Against the Chicago Bears at the stadium the Cleveland Browns will be wearing 1946/1950 style uniforms in honor of the teams 75th anniversary and alumni weekend. Although Baker Mayfield could be seen knocking a Houston Texan to the ground with just his uninjured arm last Sunday don’t expect to see him wearing the 1946 all white facemask-less helmet. Instead the team will have on 1950 era orange helmets with a single white stripe and numbers on the side which they wore over four or five years.

At halftime Hall of Fame nominee Josh Cribbs Webseter Slaughter Bill Nelsen and D’Qwell Jackson will inducted as the Browns Legends class of 2021.

Akron based FirstEnergy is figuratively wearing criminal prison orange and black/white stripes after confessing to paying tens of millions in bribes to win passage of HB6 a billion dollar bailout for its nuclear power plants.

In 2002 the Houston Astros Enron Field was rechristened Minute Maid Park. Minute Maid is a operating unit of Coca-Cola. After first going to Enron’s bankruptcy court to try and have Enron’s naming rights voided the Astros owners expedited the process by paying to have the contract canceled. That same year they were able to recoup that cost by selling the rights to Minute Maid one of several companies seeking the naming rights.

Jeremy Pelzer reported for The Plain Dealer and Cleveland.com that two state reps from Northeast Ohio have formally asked the Cleveland Browns and Mayor Frank Jackson in a letter to return the name back to Cleveland Browns Stadium.

Noting FirstEnergy’s acknowledging paying millions in bribes Kent Smith of Euclid and Jeff Crossman of Parma wrote that it’s “unfathomable why such a community treasure like the Cleveland Browns would continue to promote a company like FirstEnergy.”

“After such a disgraceful admission; it is a repeated reminder of the fraud and corruption pereptrated on Ohioans. We do not think FirstEnergy should have the honor and privilege to have its name attached to our city our football team and certainly not our taxpayer funded stadium.”

While I’m not certain head coach Kevin Stefanski will be wearing a Paul Brown 1946 style dress hat and suit Sunday I’m certain FirstEnergy no longer deserves to have the stadium dressed with its name.

The Cleveland Browns look to be on track for another winning season one that could even end in the Super Bowl. That shouldn’t be tarnished by an association with FirstEnergy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWFjb25qb3VybmFsLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvbGlmZXN0eWxlLzIwMjEvMDkvMjUvcGhvdG9zLWZpcnN0LWVuZXJneS1ha3Jvbi1tYXJhdGhvbi1oYWxmLW1hcmF0aG9uLXRlYW0tcmVsYXkvNTg1MTQ0NjAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: The First Energy Akron Marathon Half Marathon & Team Relay,"LIFESTYLE

Then the duo opened for Chris Young at the Milwaukee Bucks arena’s first country concert and fans were seemingly more excited to hear the new Dan + Shay hits “Speechless” and “Tequila” than anything from Young’s set list.

Nearly 18 months later than planned because of the COVID-19 pandemic Dan + Shay finally headlined Fiserv Forum Friday as part of “The Arena Tour.”

They didn't get to this point in their careers by being bold like tequila. In reality moon-eyed singer-songwriters Dan Smyers and Shay Mooney are more like wine coolers — sweet refreshing barely intoxicating.

But it’s hard to deliver a strong arena show on wine-cooler energy. So Friday Dan + Shay doubled down on the drama behind their love songs buttering up the crowd and borrowing slick production elements from their pop-star contemporaries. (Their manager Scooter Braun also guides the careers for Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande.)

A band that's traditionally comfortable with mid-to-slow-tempo balladry Dan + Shay didn't even dare to incorporate tropical sonic elements to their 2018 track ""Island Time"" which made Friday's set list. But the simple straightforward arrangements ensure that the songs' pop hooks and lyrics stand out especially live.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

And there are scores of open-hearted heavy-handed lines that the near-capacity crowd devoured with glee Friday and that the duo (primary singer Mooney especially) delivered with gusto. For ""From the Ground Up"" he sang about a baby with 10 little toes that looked like Mama and about grandma and grandpa living a sweet life in the same small house for 65 years. For ""Glad You Exist"" he sang about how out of the billions of people on Earth he defied the odds and ended up with the right one.

That latter song appears on Dan + Shay's new album ""Good Things"" and it does have the band take a baby step out of their comfort zone sonically. And that made the live show more engaging in the process. ""I Should Probably Go to Bed"" the band's boldest-sounding song to date derives its power from little more than Mooney's elastic voice and Smyers' grand piano melodies.

Friday though that song took on even greater power because of a deafening singalong from the crowd. Smyers was so struck by the crowd's vocal might that he had them repeat a verse again under the glare of bright lights.

And that was the one element of becoming an arena-filling act that Dan + Shay treasured the most Friday after years of opening for other acts in Milwaukee.

A polished show helped fire up the crowd. Following a ridiculous opening hype video that showed lightning strikes flowers blooming and Smyers in silhouette with curly hair flapping in a breeze the duo appeared on a cross-shaped stage in the middle of the arena floor for their smitten Justin Bieber collaboration ""10000 Hours.""

And while most acts use the secondary stage in the middle of the crowd for a few songs Dan + Shay returned to it repeatedly singing eight of the night's 23 songs surrounded by cheering singing fans.

Each song was also accompanied by sharp video elements and the band busted out cross-shaped confetti for grand finale ""Tequila.""

Both Smyers and Mooney appeared to get emotional Friday from the audience's adoration seemingly wiping away tears pounding their chests and hugging each other. They stressed at least a dozen times that this audience was the loudest they've ever had and that this was the greatest night of their lives.

Do they say that to all the crowds? Probably. But like a good tequila (or wine cooler) Dan + Shay's Milwaukee fans couldn't get enough.

The Band Camino and Ingrid Andress open the show

Dan + Shay brought two fellow acts from Tennessee on this tour and like the duo they’re not straight-up country either.

The Band Camino isn’t country at all more aligned sonically with The 1975 and other electropop-leaning rock bands infatuated with the '80s.

But lyrically they’re trapped in a woe-is-me mindset; Jeffrey Jordan literally sang that he never gets what he wants for the set’s first song. The whininess absent sharp hooks or lyrical details that cut to the core of the misery got tedious pretty fast across a 30-minute set Friday.

That said the band played one song from their two-week-old self-titled debut album — “1 Last Cigarette” — that jettisoned the lover-did-me-wrong storylines in favor of introspective and interesting lyrics that takes stock of some self-destructive behavior.

“To the piano for more sad songs” Ingrid Andress said sarcastically and valiantly in the middle of her 20-minute set. “That’s exactly what you want on a Friday night.”

Turned out it was. A bit reminiscent of Sara Bareilles Andress generally has more at stake in her lyrics than did the male songwriters on the bill especially for her closing number “Lady Like” a sneaky bit of subversion that defies societal expectations of her gender and felt radical juxtaposed with all the other songs of the night. But based on the singalong the young female-dominant crowd clearly could relate.

The Takeaways

Dan + Shay made sure to salute the Bucks Friday with Shay Mooney sporting a Bucks jacket for the first hour Dan Smyers wearing a Bucks shirt for the last half-hour and Smyers at one point giving the floor to the crowd to lead a “Bucks in six” chant.

They weren’t the only ones in the band to make a special nod to Milwaukee with their wardrobe. Touring guitarist Justin Richards was wearing a Harley-Davidson shirt.

About an hour into the set came a momentum-halting 10-minute intermission cued up by a Siri-like voice (with a British accent) that half-jokingly encourages people to use the break to buy some merch.

Dan + Shay touched on “10000 Hours” twice during their hour-and-40-minute set. But judging by the loud singalong the second time the crowd rather enjoyed the reprise.

If you do the math 10000 hours is a little over 416 days. But to finally see Dan + Shay at the delayed show Friday fans ended up waiting 12744 hours Fiserv Forum's marketing team calculated.

After a quick off-season the NBA is set to return soon. The defending champions Milwaukee Bucks will go all guns blazing to retain their crown. However their path to glory will not be easy. Giannis Antetokounmpo and co. have a tough set of fixtures ahead of them. Right from the onset many challenging games await the champions.

Last season the men in green were aided by quality play from Giannis. Along with him the likes of Khris Middleton Jrue Holiday and Brook Lopez also made some valuable contributions. This time around their mainstays will return fresh and ready to go again. With that being said they will have to get going right from game one. Let’s take a closer look at what the Bucks‘ season ahead looks like.

Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management

Larry Robbins is a hedge fund manager and CEO of Glenview Capital Management. He is also well known for his quarterly letters to investors.

He began his career as an analyst at Gleacher and Company an M&A firm. Later Robbins spent six years running long/short strategies for Leon Cooperman at Omega Advisors.

In 2001 Robbins started Glenview Capital Management. The firm runs several hedge funds and long-only funds. The Glenview Capital Partners fund invests in equities and bonds and holds both long and short positions. The Glenview Opportunity funds invest opportunistically in equities only. In 2015 the firm launched a long-only fund to invest in healthcare stocks. Despite several losing streaks the flagship fund returned 15% annually between 2000 to 2013.

Robbins is a former ice hockey player and captained the University of Pennsylvania club team for three years. He is now the owner of the Chicago Steel of the United States Hockey League.

Robbins has built a personal fortune of $2.3 billion and often uses his vast resources to support several education-focused charities. Robbins is on the boards of the Knowledge is Power Program The Robin Hood Foundation and Teach for America.

Thematic Investing

Robbins has been described as a ‘Growth at a Reasonable Price’ (GARP) investor and as a ‘multi-strategy investor’. He’s said that he backs companies with predictable cash flows and recurring revenue streams.

Larry Robbin backs himself and often holds positions for significant periods even when those positions move against him. As a result he has earned a reputation for experiencing persistent winning and losing streaks.

When one looks at the stocks he has invested in over the years it’s clear that Robbins follows themes. Healthcare stocks have increasingly dominated his portfolio over the years. He has also invested in technology and consumer discretionary stocks and to a lesser extent utilities.

While Robbins is not an activist investor he does voice his opinions when it comes to some of his largest positions. In fact he has said he would rather be ‘suggestivist’ than activist. In this way he has been instrumental in bringing about corporate action at Tenet (NYSE: THC) and Community Health Systems (NYSE: CYH).

Robbins began building positions in healthcare stocks after President Bush signed the Medicare Modernization Act in 2004. His bets in the healthcare sector increased again with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act. Unlike many on Wall Street Robbins was a supporter of Obamacare.

Over the years he has held large positions in Tenet Healthcare Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO) Humana (NYSE: HUM) McKesson Corporation and Community Health Systems. On the whole these stocks have generated strong returns but have also contributed to losses and underperformance along the way.

In 2008 the long/short fund lost 50 percent in 2011 it lost money again and in 2015 it was down more than 18%. Robbins felt so bad about the 2015 losses that he vowed not to take any fees until he had made the money back.

The fund does tend to bounce back from these losing periods with strong returns. In 2009 it was up 82% and in 2013 it returned 84%. Robbins appeared to be back on a winning streak as his fund was up 14.8% in the first half of 2017.

Glenview Capital Management's Latest Form 13F Filing

On November 14th 2017 Larry Robbins' firm Glenview Capital Management filed their quarterly Form 13F regulatory filing. I reviewed the 13F filing to review holdings in Glenview Capital Management's large portfolio.

The hedge fund's stock portfolio totals $15.5 billion according to the latest filing. The list value of stock holdings is up 0.7% when compared to the last quarter. As a benchmark the S&P 500 was up 3.9% over the same period.

Quarter-over-Quarter Turnover (QoQ Turnover) measures the level of trading activity in a portfolio. Glenview Capital Management's QoQ Turnover for the latest quarter was 25.9% so the firm appears to trade a significant percent of its portfolio each quarter.

Glenview Capital Management's Largest Holdings

The Ideas section of finbox.io tracks top investors and trending investment themes. You can get the latest data on the holdings discussed below at the Larry Robbins page. The following table summarizes his firm's largest holdings reported in the last filing:

Glenview Capital Management Largest Holdings Ticker Name Holding ($mil) % Of Portfolio HCA HCA HEALTHCARE INC $1206.3 7.8% DWDP DOWDUPONT INC $1124.2 7.2% FMC FMC CORP $1046.8 6.7% SHPG SHIRE PLC $898.8 5.8% IQV IQVIA Holdings Inc. $848.2 5.5% ANTM ANTHEM INC $722.0 4.7% DXC DXC TECHNOLOGY CO $671.6 4.3%

The seven positions above represent 42.0% of the hedge fund's total portfolio. Four of the seven largest positions are also in the healthcare sector making up 23.8% of the portfolio. The most recent filing showed a total of 49 positions.

Glenview Capital Management's 5 Largest Purchases

I also used finbox.io to find Glenview Capital Management's largest buys last quarter. Here's the list of the biggest stock purchases determined by comparing the last two filings:

Glenview Capital Management 5 Largest Purchases Ticker Name Purchased ($mil) % Of Portfolio SHPG SHIRE PLC $634.9 5.8% ZBH ZIMMER BIOMET HL... $279.1 2.4% MCK MCKESSON CORP $235.5 2.7% CVS CVS HEALTH CORP $111.3 0.7% DNB DUN & BRADSTREET... $93.7 1.4%

Three of the hedge fund's 5 biggest stock buys in the quarter were in the healthcare sector.

Glenview Capital Management's Most Undervalued Holdings

To determine which stocks are trading below their intrinsic value aka ""fair value"" I used the finbox.io Fair Value estimates. I also wanted to blend in some indication of which stocks might be ready to make a move up soon because they're popular with Wall Street analysts.

I calculated an average using the finbox.io fair value upside and analyst upside to create a blended upside which I then used to rank the most undervalued holdings.

Here are the top 7 stocks based on my calculations:

Glenview Capital Management Most Undervalued Holdings Ticker Name Upside (finbox.io) Upside (Analyst Target) Blend Upside BKD BROOKDALE SR LIV... 63.1% 41.8% 52.5% SHPG SHIRE PLC 25.5% 45.1% 35.3% VER VEREIT INC 33.1% 23.3% 28.2% MTOR MERITOR INC 33.3% 14.9% 24.1% RLGY REALOGY HLDGS CORP 21.9% 23.8% 22.8% HCA HCA HEALTHCARE INC 43.5% 1.1% 22.3% CBS CBS CORP NEW 25.0% 17.3% 21.1%

Note that Shire plc (NasdaqGS: SHPG) is one of Larry Robbins' largest positions and one that he's most recently been adding to. This is most likely because the current share price appears to be trading a large discount to intrinsic value.

source: finbox.io

Shire is a biotechnology company focused on serving people with rare diseases and other specialized conditions worldwide. The company offers products in therapeutic areas including hematology genetic diseases neuroscience immunology internal medicine ophthalmology and oncology. The company markets its products through wholesalers distribution centers and pharmacies. Shire was founded in 1986 and is based in Dublin Ireland.

Shares of the company are down -7.6% over the last month implying that there may be a buying opportunity. The stock last traded at $147.78 as of Friday January 26th and 10 separate valuation analyses imply that there is 25.5% upside relative to its current trading price. Wall Street's price target of $213.93 is even more bullish implying +40% upside.

Steven Cohen is also a notable investor in the company. His fund currently holds a position worth $32.1 million. If you haven't heard of billionaire Steven Cohen you may already know a little about him if you've watched Showtime's hit series Billions. Investing morality aside Cohen's real-life results are undeniable. He was the third highest-earning hedge fund manager of 2012 when he made $1.4 billion. No doubt Cohen is expecting big gains from his long position in Shire.

Illustrious money manager Leon Cooperman in another notable investor that currently owns 653977 shares of SHPG which represents 4.0% of his fund's stock portfolio.

Managers with more than $100 million in qualifying assets under management are required to disclose their holdings to the SEC each quarter via 13F filings. Qualifying assets include long positions in U.S. equities and ADRs call/put options and convertible debt securities. Shorts cash positions foreign investments and other assets are not included. It is important to note that these filings are due 45 days after the quarter end date. Therefore Glenview Capital Management's holdings above represent positions held as of September 30th and not necessarily reflective of the fund's current stock holdings.

However most can agree that with thousands of stocks traded on U.S. exchanges doing thorough research on each one is nearly impossible for smaller investors. Leveraging the resources of the largest hedge funds on Wall Street can be a powerful way to narrow down the list.

As of this writing I did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities and this is not a buy or sell recommendation on any security mentioned.",,,,,,,,,,,,

“I’m deeply worried about the affordability” said Farley Saturday during a discussion as part of the Detroit Homecoming VIII events during a live-streamed interview with Mary Kramer the director of the annual event.

""Average people cannot afford these vehicles and we have a lot of work to do to make them more affordable. ... That’s the one that keeps me up at night.”

Detroit Homecoming has been an annual event since 2014 which brings notable ex-Detroiters back to the city to inspire city residents and re-engage them through their individual accomplishments and achievements.

Regarding electric vehicles Farley said Executive Chairman Bill Ford ""had a vision for this 20 years ago.""

""The (EV version of the F150) is completely sold out in Europe ... in the U.S in China” said Farley whose grandfather worked at the Rouge plant. “We have 150000 orders and the truck isn’t just fast ... it’s very fast but it can power your house for three days. I think this will really change electrification.”

Farley added that ""the first generation of electric owners don’t work small commuter economy (vehicles). ... They want Mustangs they want pickup trucks they want utility vans” said Farley. “They want the best products.”

He said a key issue is how production will impact labor concerns since it costs 30% less to manufacture the electrical vehicles. There also is an issue of battery supply and minerals such as lithium and cobalt to power them said Farley.

""We have to bring battery production here but the supply chain has to go all the way to the mines. That's where the real cost is and people in the U.S. don't want mining in their neighborhoods"" said Farley.

""So are we going to import lithium and pull cobalt from nation-states that have child labor and all sorts of corruption or all we going to get serious about mining? ... We have to solve these things and we don't have much time.""

Farley who lives in downtown Detroit said he is proud of the continued work on the Michigan Central Station which Ford Motor Co. bought in 2018.

""We have some fantastic plans and not just for innovation and mobility"" said Farley.

He said there are plans to renovate some of the Riverwalk extension and nearby. He did not go into details about it during his discussion with Kramer.

The train station had closed in 1988 and was abandoned for several decades before the automaker announced plans to buy and restore it as well as the nearby Book Depository.

Farley said the purchase and renovation project was ""Bill Ford's personal vision"" for the neglected train station.

""I think we're all kind of fed up with about what happened to the train station"" Farley said. ""Someone had to step up.""

Farley said the company is also exploring an autonomous highway that will run down Michigan Avenue through Detroit Dearborn and then ending in Ann Arbor. He did not release more details on it but said local governments will have to be on board with it.

""Autonomy is taking longer than we thought"" said Farley. ""But we still have to solve the second-order problems. Like do we have dedicated infrastructure for our autonomous vehicles? I don't think we should wait for regulators to make up their mind. We have to solve this as companies.""

Farley also spoke about his work with the faith-based Pope Francis Center to assist homeless Metro Detroiters with programs that help them with housing health care and other issues such as addiction.

Ford Motor Co.'s U.S. sales plunged by one-third in August compared with the previous year amid an industrywide slide driven by a semiconductor shortage that has dragged on since late last year and pushed new-vehicle inventories to historic lows.

While Ford's sales slump was more dramatic than that experienced by some of its competitors it was not alone. American Honda sales for example were down 15.6% year-over-year. Toyota Motor North America sales fell 2%. And Hyundai Motor America sales were off 4%.

Ford reported that its average transaction price in August hit a new record of approximately $50800 per vehicle a $9700 increase over last year.

According to production data reported by the company output improved from July to August. Amid widespread production cuts due to the chip shortage Ford's North American plants produced 125736 vehicles in July. In August that rose to 226065. The company's gross vehicle stock stood at 214500 at the end of the month.

The first edition of the study focused on drivers of 2030 in the United Kingdom which meant asking eight to nine-year-olds what they want from a car.

Ford then put the ideas together and got the company's Senior Exterior Designer Nedzad Mujcinovic to create a concept car. The result was dubbed the Ford Future Generation Concept Car and you can see it in the photo gallery.According to the study made by Ford seventy-nine percent of today's youngsters are looking forward to learning how to drive a car. Even though the United Kingdom plans to have electric vehicles the only ones sold new in 2030 the youngsters were asked if they had a preference for what will power their first car.The survey revealed that forty-nine percent want an electric vehicle. Just 17 percent want a combustion-engined vehicle out of which ten percent claimed to want a diesel while seven percent wanted a gasoline-engined car.So yes Ford has managed to get confirmation that the next generation still wants to drive cars and that almost one in four would still want a car that runs on something other than electricity.But what about features? What does the dream car of youngsters has to have? Well the most common reply noted comfortable seats with 36 percent of respondents wanting those.That makes a lot of sense as they probably heard adults complain about seats and comfort for as long as they can remember. We can also relate to the need for comfortable seating so all manufacturers should take note.Over a quarter of all respondents asked for a good sound system which also makes sense today as it will probably will in the future. Almost a quarter of the youngsters replied that they want their dream first car to have a self-driving ability which might become possible in 2030. Others requested cars that could fly vehicles that never got stuck in traffic as well as cars that could be transformed into a plane/boat/rocket.Some youngsters wanted a unicorn body shape four exhausts (we can guess their preferred fuel of the future here) a seat for their cat racing numbers (that is easily attained) as well as a cooler to keep drinks chill the ability to go anywhere TVs in the seats or even an ice cream machine.Some kids just said they dreamed of having a car with stripes a fast car one with big wheels or one that has purple black and red.Ford's Senior Exterior Designer went ahead and drew a concept vehicle that is meant to blend as many desired features as possible. Therefore we observe big wheels with black spokes a red body with silver accents that seem to allow the vehicle to fly an unconventional passenger compartment with indistinguishable features and a rather traditional front fascia with headlights air vents and the Blue Oval.The concept does not look half bad but we are surprised to see it miss out on stripes racing numbers and the color purple. It has no exhausts because it is electric but it could take the owners anywhere (with bigger ground clearance and proper tires though).The same study showed that kids view David Attenborough as the leading trailblazer for a more sustainable future. Greta Thunberg Prince Charles Swampy (Daniel Marc Hooper) and Caroline Lucas complete the top five.We are not surprised to see how today's kids view the future of transportation and it is nice to see that automakers are struggling to learn more about their hopes and expectations. With that being written we have made a mental exercise to remember what we dreamt of our first cars when we were their age.While flight was somehow out of the option TVs in the seats four exhausts a red or black exterior and going fast were on our list if we think about it. Stripes and racing numbers would have been a big plus.So a future generation of petrol heads is coming but their status as petrol heads might not be explained by the “petrol” in their description but rather by their passion for cars and their desire to drive them.We might need a new term for petrol heads once most cars will become electric as well as one for when most cars will be self-driving. Hopefully someone comes up with a term that is just as catchy as petrol head.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzUzNjAxMS9mb3JkLW1hY2hlLXJlY2FsbC13aW5kc2hpZWxkLXN1bnJvb2Yv0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly9pbnNpZGVldnMuY29tL25ld3MvNTM2MDExL2ZvcmQtbWFjaGUtcmVjYWxsLXdpbmRzaGllbGQtc3Vucm9vZi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford Recalls Over 38000 Mustang Mach-E,"Ford Mustang Mach-Es built between February 24 and June 18 2021 are affected by a quite significant recall that concerns potentially improperly bonded windshields and sunroofs.

Carlson was speaking to the former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly on Sirius XM. He made the comments in question on his show on Wednesday which averages more than 3 million viewers a night.

Claiming the Biden administration was trying “to change the racial mix of the country” Carlson said: “In political terms this policy is called ‘the great replacement’ the replacement of legacy Americans with more obedient people from far-away countries.

“They brag about it all the time but if you dare to say it’s happening they will scream at you with maximum hysteria.”

The “great replacement theory” originated on the far right. Perpetrators of recent mass shootings have cited iterations of the theory in “manifestos” attempting to justify their actions.

Carlson raised the theory in April claiming it was not racist but a matter of hardball politics. The ADL chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt called for Carlson to be fired.

Lachlan Murdoch chief executive of the Fox Corporation wrote back: “Mr Carlson decried and rejected replacement theory. As Mr Carlson himself stated … ‘White replacement theory? No no this is a voting rights question.’”

This week Greenblatt repeated his call.

“For Tucker Carlson to spread the toxic antisemitic and xenophobic ‘great replacement theory’ is a repugnant and dangerous abuse of his platform.

“If it somehow wasn’t clear enough before to the executives at Fox News that Carlson was openly embracing white nationalist talking points let last night’s episode be case and point.”

The Council on American Islamic Relations also said Carlson should be fired.

Kelly asked Carlson how he felt when “sure enough the ADL comes after you”.

“The ADL?” Carlson said laughing. “Fuck them.”

The ADL he said “was a noble organisation that had a very specific goal which was to fight antisemitism and that’s a virtuous goal. They were pretty successful over the years. Now it’s operated by a guy who’s just an apparatchik of the Democratic party.

“It’s very corrosive for someone to take the residual moral weight of an organisation that he inherited and use it for party.

“So the great replacement theory is in fact not a theory. It’s something that the Democrats brag about constantly up to and including the president.

“And in one sentence it’s this: ‘Rather than convince the current population that our policies are working and they should vote for us as a result we can’t be bothered to do that. We’re instead going to change the composition of the population and bring in people who will vote for us.’ So there isn’t actually inherently a racial component to it and it’s nothing to do with antisemitism.”

Kelly also played a clip of Joe Biden speaking in 2015 which Carlson used on Wednesday.

In the clip the then vice-president says: “An unrelenting stream of immigration non-stop non-stop. Folks like me who were Caucasian of European descent for the first time in 2017 will be in an absolute minority in the United States of America absolute minority. Fewer than 50% of the people in America from then and on will be White European stock. That’s not a bad thing. That’s as a source of our strength.”

On Wednesday Carlson said: “An unrelenting stream of immigration. But why? Well Joe Biden just said it to change the racial mix of the country … to reduce the political power of people whose ancestors lived here and dramatically increase the proportion of Americans newly arrived from the Third World … This is the language of eugenics it’s horrifying.”

Analysts have shown that the clip is edited misleadingly.

As the Washington Post pointed out Biden made the remarks as part of “about six minutes of commentary beginning with the fact that the city of Boston came together as a community after the bombing during the Boston marathon.

“‘I’m not suggesting … that I think America has all the answers here’ Biden said. ‘We just have a lot more experience. By that I mean we are a nation of immigrants. That’s who we are.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvbXVsdGltaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1iaWRlbnMtdXNlLW9mLXMtY29ycG9yYXRpb25zLWRyYXdzLXNjcnV0aW55LWJ5LXJlcHVibGljYW4td2hvLXNlZXMtaHlwb2NyaXN50gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9tdWx0aW1pbGxpb25haXJlLWJpZGVucy11c2Utb2Ytcy1jb3Jwb3JhdGlvbnMtZHJhd3Mtc2NydXRpbnktYnktcmVwdWJsaWNhbi13aG8tc2Vlcy1oeXBvY3Jpc3kuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Multimillionaire’ Biden’s use of ‘S corporations’ draws scrutiny by Republican who sees hypocrisy,"President Biden and first lady Jill Biden saved up to $500000 by routing $13 million they received in book sales and speeches in 2017 and 2018 through S corporations according to a Congressional Research Service report which drew criticism by at least one Republican.

It is not uncommon for wealthy individuals and politicians to try and preserve their income by using what some call tax loopholes but Republicans have called out what they see as hypocrisy from the president who came out in support of proposals to tax billionaires. On Friday the president told reporters ""I just think it’s about just paying your fair share for Lord’s sake.""

DEBT-LIMIT STANDOFF COULD FORCE FED TO REVISIT EMERGENCY PLAYBOOK

Rep. Jim Banks the chair of the Republican Study Committee lashed out at Biden for calling on the country’s richest to pay their ""fair share"" to help finance his $2.1 trillion infrastructure plan.

He said in 2017 ""multi-millionaire Joe Biden skirted his payroll taxes—the very taxes that fund Medicare and Obamacare. According to the criteria CRS provided to my office he owes the IRS and the American people hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes. Every American should know about Joe Biden’s hypocrisy.""

Banks said the report indicated that Biden improperly used ""S corporations"" while he and his wife raked in over $13 million on speaking fees and book sales in 2017 and 2018 but counted less than $800000 of it as a salary that could be taxed for Medicare.

The CRS report may be new but the Wall Street Journal reported on Biden’s use of the ""tax-code loophole [President] Obama tried to plug.""

GRASSLEY MCCONNELL ADAMANT REPUBLICANS WON'T HELP DEMS RAISE DEBT LIMIT: 'WHY ARE THEY COMING TO US?'

Tony Nitti an accountant at RubinBrown LLP who reviewed the returns told the paper in its 2019 report that there is ""no reason for these to be in an S corp—none other than to save on self-employment tax.""

The Biden campaign told the paper at the time that the couple’s effective federal tax rate in 2017 and 2018 exceeded 33%. The campaign said the Bidens are committed to ensure ""all Americans pay their fair share."" The White House did not immediately respond to an after-hours email Sunday night from Fox Business.

The White House earlier this week pointed to a campaign statement that said the salaries ""are reasonable and were determined in good faith considering the nature of the entities and the services they performed"" the statement said calling the use of the corporations a ""common method for taxpayers who have outside sources of income to consolidate their earnings and expenses.""

The Journal said that S-corp owners have the ability to avoid paying the 32.8% tax on their profits ""as long as they pay themselves ‘reasonable compensation’"" which of course is difficult to define.

""Understanding your privileges and how to leverage them so we can support others is a key component in being an active ally"" CVS employees were told on an online call obtained by Fox Business.

CVS LOOKING TO FILL 25000 RETAIL CLINICAL POSITIONS

""Allyship is the act of advocating for as well as supporting communities other than your own"" the instructor added. ""So being an ally means that we’re aware of our own identities as well as the intersectional identities of others. We’re recognizing and actively mitigating bias and we’re modeling inclusive leadership behaviors.""

At another point in the recording employees were told to fill out a ""personal commitment plan"" outlining ways they pledge to ""take specific action"" to ""mitigate bias"" and ""practice conscious inclusion"" in the next five days five weeks and five months.

""Making those measurable commitments is an important step to actually making sure that you are moving forward in this journey"" the instructor told employees. ""Wherever you currently are in the journey. We all have room to grow.""

Fox Business also obtained slides from the presentation which provided instructions on how to carry out ""allyship"" including ""seeking to learn about and understand the needs of marginalized people.""

CVS WORKSHOP TELLS EMPLOYEES TO HOLD EACH OTHER 'ACCOUNTABLE' FOR 'NON-INCLUSIVE' ACTS

Another slide instructs employees in leadership roles to ""source diverse talent"" and ""prioritize promoting diverse talent."" Additionally the slide said that senior directors and above ""will formally or informally mentor one diverse mentee a year.""

The audiotape comes on the heels of a report from journalist Christopher Rufo who obtained CVS Health training that told CVS employees to circle their identities — including race gender sexuality and religion — and then to reflect on their ""privilege"" during a discussion with co-workers. According to Rufo ""Examples of privilege according to a checklist included ‘celebrat[ing] Christmas’ ‘hav[ing] a name that is easy to pronounce’ ‘feel[ing] safe in your neighborhood at night’ and ‘feel[ing] confident in my leadership style.’""

Additionally Rufo’s report said that employees were told to acknowledge their ""white privilege.""

Last month Fox Business reported that CVS Health is holding a ""conscious inclusion workshop"" that aims to teach employees how to hold each other ""accountable"" for non-inclusive behaviors.

An internal email obtained by FOX Business showed David Casey SVP of Workforce Strategies and Chief Diversity Officer discussing the four-week program. The first three weeks included 20-30 minutes of self-study per week leading up to a two-hour virtual workshop in the fourth.

In the email Casey continued by outlining different skills employees will build during the workshop's fourth week. Those included learning how to ""identify unconscious bias in your day-to-day interactions and experiences"" ""demonstrate bravery by speaking up and having difficult conversations when observing non-inclusive behaviors"" and ""commit to holding yourself and your colleagues accountable to consistently embrace diversity of all kinds and take swift action against non-inclusive behaviors.""

CVS Health did not immediately respond to a request from Fox Business on the recently obtained audio but said in a statement last month that the new workshop was ""part of our nearly $600 million commitment to address racial inequality.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2dvcmVzLWd1Z2dlbmhlaW0tc3BhYy1uZWFycy1kZWFsLWNvbWJpbmUtcG9sZXN0YXLSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9nb3Jlcy1ndWdnZW5oZWltLXNwYWMtbmVhcnMtZGVhbC1jb21iaW5lLXBvbGVzdGFyLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gores Guggenheim SPAC nears deal to combine with Polestar,"Polestar is nearing a deal to go public through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company that would value the Swedish electric vehicle maker at $21 billion according to people familiar with the matter.

Polestar owned by Chinese car maker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. is in advanced talks with Gores Guggenheim Inc. GGPI 0.30% and could reach a deal by Monday the people said assuming talks don’t fall apart.

Polestar focuses on high-performance electric cars positioning itself as a rival to Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.75% and Lucid Group Inc. LCID 0.04% Zhejiang Geely is controlled by its billionaire chairman and founder Li Shufu. It owns Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. GELYY -2.25%  Volvo Car Group and several other electric-vehicle brands.

NYC TOURISTS DUPED BY ILLEGAL VANS TOUTED ON AIRBNB AS CHEAP PLACES TO ‘GLAMP’

As part of the deal Polestar whose existing investors include actor Leonardo DiCaprio will receive an additional $250 million investment some of the people said.

It would be one of the largest recent SPAC deals following a burst of activity this year and last that has ebbed somewhat. Blank-check firms raise money in initial public offerings without a business and then look for one to combine with. Once they do so they often raise additional funds in so-called PIPE deals which stands for private investment in public equity.

Gores Guggenheim sponsored by private-equity firm The Gores Group LLC and investment bank and asset manager Guggenheim Partners raised about $800 million in a March IPO. Bloomberg reported in July that it was in talks with Polestar.

Polestar has endured setbacks as it aims to capitalize on a thirst for electric-vehicle innovation including a recall last year of all of its global vehicles over faulty components. Polestar’s main production model the Polestar 2 marketed as a competitor to Tesla’s Model 3 got off to a slow start in China. It sold more than 10000 cars last year in markets around the world and expects to drastically increase that figure by 2025 with new models planned for launch in 2024 some of the people familiar with the matter said.

ELECTRIC-CAR SHIFT DRAINS FUEL TAXES IN SOME COUNTRIES

In June the company said its third model an SUV called the Polestar 3 would be assembled at a Volvo plant in South Carolina. The company’s other models have been made in China.

A handful of other high-profile electric-vehicle companies have gone public through SPAC deals  with varying degrees of success.

In July Lucid concluded a merger with a SPAC helmed by deal maker Michael Klein. The transaction gave the Saudi-backed auto maker $4.4 billion at a valuation of $24 billion.

Carlson was speaking to the former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly on Sirius XM. He made the comments in question on his show on Wednesday which averages more than 3 million viewers a night.

Claiming the Biden administration was trying “to change the racial mix of the country” Carlson said: “In political terms this policy is called ‘the great replacement’ the replacement of legacy Americans with more obedient people from far-away countries.

“They brag about it all the time but if you dare to say it’s happening they will scream at you with maximum hysteria.”

The “great replacement theory” originated on the far right. Perpetrators of recent mass shootings have cited iterations of the theory in “manifestos” attempting to justify their actions.

Carlson raised the theory in April claiming it was not racist but a matter of hardball politics. The ADL chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt called for Carlson to be fired.

Lachlan Murdoch chief executive of the Fox Corporation wrote back: “Mr Carlson decried and rejected replacement theory. As Mr Carlson himself stated … ‘White replacement theory? No no this is a voting rights question.’”

This week Greenblatt repeated his call.

“For Tucker Carlson to spread the toxic antisemitic and xenophobic ‘great replacement theory’ is a repugnant and dangerous abuse of his platform.

“If it somehow wasn’t clear enough before to the executives at Fox News that Carlson was openly embracing white nationalist talking points let last night’s episode be case and point.”

The Council on American Islamic Relations also said Carlson should be fired.

Kelly asked Carlson how he felt when “sure enough the ADL comes after you”.

“The ADL?” Carlson said laughing. “Fuck them.”

The ADL he said “was a noble organisation that had a very specific goal which was to fight antisemitism and that’s a virtuous goal. They were pretty successful over the years. Now it’s operated by a guy who’s just an apparatchik of the Democratic party.

“It’s very corrosive for someone to take the residual moral weight of an organisation that he inherited and use it for party.

“So the great replacement theory is in fact not a theory. It’s something that the Democrats brag about constantly up to and including the president.

“And in one sentence it’s this: ‘Rather than convince the current population that our policies are working and they should vote for us as a result we can’t be bothered to do that. We’re instead going to change the composition of the population and bring in people who will vote for us.’ So there isn’t actually inherently a racial component to it and it’s nothing to do with antisemitism.”

Kelly also played a clip of Joe Biden speaking in 2015 which Carlson used on Wednesday.

In the clip the then vice-president says: “An unrelenting stream of immigration non-stop non-stop. Folks like me who were Caucasian of European descent for the first time in 2017 will be in an absolute minority in the United States of America absolute minority. Fewer than 50% of the people in America from then and on will be White European stock. That’s not a bad thing. That’s as a source of our strength.”

On Wednesday Carlson said: “An unrelenting stream of immigration. But why? Well Joe Biden just said it to change the racial mix of the country … to reduce the political power of people whose ancestors lived here and dramatically increase the proportion of Americans newly arrived from the Third World … This is the language of eugenics it’s horrifying.”

Analysts have shown that the clip is edited misleadingly.

As the Washington Post pointed out Biden made the remarks as part of “about six minutes of commentary beginning with the fact that the city of Boston came together as a community after the bombing during the Boston marathon.

“‘I’m not suggesting … that I think America has all the answers here’ Biden said. ‘We just have a lot more experience. By that I mean we are a nation of immigrants. That’s who we are.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvbXVsdGltaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1iaWRlbnMtdXNlLW9mLXMtY29ycG9yYXRpb25zLWRyYXdzLXNjcnV0aW55LWJ5LXJlcHVibGljYW4td2hvLXNlZXMtaHlwb2NyaXN50gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9tdWx0aW1pbGxpb25haXJlLWJpZGVucy11c2Utb2Ytcy1jb3Jwb3JhdGlvbnMtZHJhd3Mtc2NydXRpbnktYnktcmVwdWJsaWNhbi13aG8tc2Vlcy1oeXBvY3Jpc3kuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Multimillionaire’ Biden’s use of ‘S corporations’ draws scrutiny by Republican who sees hypocrisy,"President Biden and first lady Jill Biden saved up to $500000 by routing $13 million they received in book sales and speeches in 2017 and 2018 through S corporations according to a Congressional Research Service report which drew criticism by at least one Republican.

It is not uncommon for wealthy individuals and politicians to try and preserve their income by using what some call tax loopholes but Republicans have called out what they see as hypocrisy from the president who came out in support of proposals to tax billionaires. On Friday the president told reporters ""I just think it’s about just paying your fair share for Lord’s sake.""

DEBT-LIMIT STANDOFF COULD FORCE FED TO REVISIT EMERGENCY PLAYBOOK

Rep. Jim Banks the chair of the Republican Study Committee lashed out at Biden for calling on the country’s richest to pay their ""fair share"" to help finance his $2.1 trillion infrastructure plan.

He said in 2017 ""multi-millionaire Joe Biden skirted his payroll taxes—the very taxes that fund Medicare and Obamacare. According to the criteria CRS provided to my office he owes the IRS and the American people hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes. Every American should know about Joe Biden’s hypocrisy.""

Banks said the report indicated that Biden improperly used ""S corporations"" while he and his wife raked in over $13 million on speaking fees and book sales in 2017 and 2018 but counted less than $800000 of it as a salary that could be taxed for Medicare.

The CRS report may be new but the Wall Street Journal reported on Biden’s use of the ""tax-code loophole [President] Obama tried to plug.""

GRASSLEY MCCONNELL ADAMANT REPUBLICANS WON'T HELP DEMS RAISE DEBT LIMIT: 'WHY ARE THEY COMING TO US?'

Tony Nitti an accountant at RubinBrown LLP who reviewed the returns told the paper in its 2019 report that there is ""no reason for these to be in an S corp—none other than to save on self-employment tax.""

The Biden campaign told the paper at the time that the couple’s effective federal tax rate in 2017 and 2018 exceeded 33%. The campaign said the Bidens are committed to ensure ""all Americans pay their fair share."" The White House did not immediately respond to an after-hours email Sunday night from Fox Business.

The White House earlier this week pointed to a campaign statement that said the salaries ""are reasonable and were determined in good faith considering the nature of the entities and the services they performed"" the statement said calling the use of the corporations a ""common method for taxpayers who have outside sources of income to consolidate their earnings and expenses.""

The Journal said that S-corp owners have the ability to avoid paying the 32.8% tax on their profits ""as long as they pay themselves ‘reasonable compensation’"" which of course is difficult to define.

""Understanding your privileges and how to leverage them so we can support others is a key component in being an active ally"" CVS employees were told on an online call obtained by Fox Business.

CVS LOOKING TO FILL 25000 RETAIL CLINICAL POSITIONS

""Allyship is the act of advocating for as well as supporting communities other than your own"" the instructor added. ""So being an ally means that we’re aware of our own identities as well as the intersectional identities of others. We’re recognizing and actively mitigating bias and we’re modeling inclusive leadership behaviors.""

At another point in the recording employees were told to fill out a ""personal commitment plan"" outlining ways they pledge to ""take specific action"" to ""mitigate bias"" and ""practice conscious inclusion"" in the next five days five weeks and five months.

""Making those measurable commitments is an important step to actually making sure that you are moving forward in this journey"" the instructor told employees. ""Wherever you currently are in the journey. We all have room to grow.""

Fox Business also obtained slides from the presentation which provided instructions on how to carry out ""allyship"" including ""seeking to learn about and understand the needs of marginalized people.""

CVS WORKSHOP TELLS EMPLOYEES TO HOLD EACH OTHER 'ACCOUNTABLE' FOR 'NON-INCLUSIVE' ACTS

Another slide instructs employees in leadership roles to ""source diverse talent"" and ""prioritize promoting diverse talent."" Additionally the slide said that senior directors and above ""will formally or informally mentor one diverse mentee a year.""

The audiotape comes on the heels of a report from journalist Christopher Rufo who obtained CVS Health training that told CVS employees to circle their identities — including race gender sexuality and religion — and then to reflect on their ""privilege"" during a discussion with co-workers. According to Rufo ""Examples of privilege according to a checklist included ‘celebrat[ing] Christmas’ ‘hav[ing] a name that is easy to pronounce’ ‘feel[ing] safe in your neighborhood at night’ and ‘feel[ing] confident in my leadership style.’""

Additionally Rufo’s report said that employees were told to acknowledge their ""white privilege.""

Last month Fox Business reported that CVS Health is holding a ""conscious inclusion workshop"" that aims to teach employees how to hold each other ""accountable"" for non-inclusive behaviors.

An internal email obtained by FOX Business showed David Casey SVP of Workforce Strategies and Chief Diversity Officer discussing the four-week program. The first three weeks included 20-30 minutes of self-study per week leading up to a two-hour virtual workshop in the fourth.

In the email Casey continued by outlining different skills employees will build during the workshop's fourth week. Those included learning how to ""identify unconscious bias in your day-to-day interactions and experiences"" ""demonstrate bravery by speaking up and having difficult conversations when observing non-inclusive behaviors"" and ""commit to holding yourself and your colleagues accountable to consistently embrace diversity of all kinds and take swift action against non-inclusive behaviors.""

CVS Health did not immediately respond to a request from Fox Business on the recently obtained audio but said in a statement last month that the new workshop was ""part of our nearly $600 million commitment to address racial inequality.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2dvcmVzLWd1Z2dlbmhlaW0tc3BhYy1uZWFycy1kZWFsLWNvbWJpbmUtcG9sZXN0YXLSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9nb3Jlcy1ndWdnZW5oZWltLXNwYWMtbmVhcnMtZGVhbC1jb21iaW5lLXBvbGVzdGFyLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gores Guggenheim SPAC nears deal to combine with Polestar,"Polestar is nearing a deal to go public through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company that would value the Swedish electric vehicle maker at $21 billion according to people familiar with the matter.

Polestar owned by Chinese car maker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. is in advanced talks with Gores Guggenheim Inc. GGPI 0.30% and could reach a deal by Monday the people said assuming talks don’t fall apart.

Polestar focuses on high-performance electric cars positioning itself as a rival to Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.75% and Lucid Group Inc. LCID 0.04% Zhejiang Geely is controlled by its billionaire chairman and founder Li Shufu. It owns Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. GELYY -2.25%  Volvo Car Group and several other electric-vehicle brands.

NYC TOURISTS DUPED BY ILLEGAL VANS TOUTED ON AIRBNB AS CHEAP PLACES TO ‘GLAMP’

As part of the deal Polestar whose existing investors include actor Leonardo DiCaprio will receive an additional $250 million investment some of the people said.

It would be one of the largest recent SPAC deals following a burst of activity this year and last that has ebbed somewhat. Blank-check firms raise money in initial public offerings without a business and then look for one to combine with. Once they do so they often raise additional funds in so-called PIPE deals which stands for private investment in public equity.

Gores Guggenheim sponsored by private-equity firm The Gores Group LLC and investment bank and asset manager Guggenheim Partners raised about $800 million in a March IPO. Bloomberg reported in July that it was in talks with Polestar.

Polestar has endured setbacks as it aims to capitalize on a thirst for electric-vehicle innovation including a recall last year of all of its global vehicles over faulty components. Polestar’s main production model the Polestar 2 marketed as a competitor to Tesla’s Model 3 got off to a slow start in China. It sold more than 10000 cars last year in markets around the world and expects to drastically increase that figure by 2025 with new models planned for launch in 2024 some of the people familiar with the matter said.

ELECTRIC-CAR SHIFT DRAINS FUEL TAXES IN SOME COUNTRIES

In June the company said its third model an SUV called the Polestar 3 would be assembled at a Volvo plant in South Carolina. The company’s other models have been made in China.

A handful of other high-profile electric-vehicle companies have gone public through SPAC deals  with varying degrees of success.

In July Lucid concluded a merger with a SPAC helmed by deal maker Michael Klein. The transaction gave the Saudi-backed auto maker $4.4 billion at a valuation of $24 billion.

Some smaller competitors such as Nikola Corp. Lordstown Motors Corp. and Canoo Inc. have struggled with executive turnover missed production targets and investigations from regulators since going public.

“We want to build one of the world’s most valuable companies” said Perkins who is chief executive officer. “We’re moving in the right direction but we’re not there yet.’’



Perkins also becomes Australia's second-richest woman after Gina Rinehart 67 who has a net worth of $17.9 billion derived largely from an iron-ore business.



It all began with millennial angst at user-unfriendly software.



While teaching design programs part-time in 2008 when she was at university in Perth Australia Melanie Perkins grew frustrated with the clunky desktop-based tools she was helping her students understand.



""Facebook was taking off at the time - people could jump in and use that so easily and yet design tools took years of training to learn"" Perkins recalled in a Medium post in 2018. ""I wanted to make design software simple online and collaborative.""



It was a winning formula. A funding round last week valued their graphic design company Canva at $40 billion. That gave Perkins 34 and her husband and co-founder Cliff Obrecht 35 a fortune of $5.9 billion each according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.



The latest funding round makes the Sydney-based firm the fifth-largest startup in the world according to data from research firm CB Insights and Perkins the richest self-made female billionaire under the age of 40. Among Canva's investors are Franklin Templeton and Sequoia Capital Global Equities.



'Right Direction'

Perkins and Obrecht who married earlier this year said in an interview this week that they aren't slowing down. ""We want to build one of the world's most valuable companies"" said Perkins who is chief executive officer. ""We're moving in the right direction but we're not there yet.''



Canva users have created more than 7 billion designs but Perkins wants it to become ubiquitous. That includes ultimately replacing PDF resumes with responsive web-based tools.



She and Obrecht own at least 30% of the company Perkins disclosed in a Medium post that accompanied news of the company's valuation. A former Google employee Cameron Adams is also a co-founder though the size of his stake hasn't been disclosed.



Canva is popular with bloggers students and marketers who can select templates and then customize them to make logos resumes flyers or even T-shirt designs. Its tools are used by more than 10 million students and teachers as well as companies including American Airlines Group Inc. Zoom Video Communications Inc. SkyScanner Intel Corp. Salesforce.com Inc. PayPal Holdings Inc. and Marriott International Inc. according to Perkins. Canva says that it's on track to surpass $1 billion in annualized revenue by year-end.



Tech Billionaires



The pair's new fortune makes them the 9th- and 10th-richest people in Australia according to the Bloomberg index. While the country's fortunes have long been linked to commodities industries Perkins and Obrecht join a group that's topped by fellow tech founders Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar of Atlassian a software-development company.



In her latest Medium post Perkins vowed that she and Obrecht would donate the vast majority of their Canva equity. The couple plans to direct its giving through the Canva Foundation and announced a program with nonprofit GiveDirectly that will distribute $10 million to the poor in Southern Africa.



""It has felt strange when people refer to us as billionaires as it has never felt like our money"" Perkins said in a statement. ""We've always felt that we're purely custodians of it. It's long been our intention to give the wealth away.""",,,,,,

On a 4-1 vote the Montebello Planning Commission on Tuesday Sept. 21 approved the tentative tract map and site review for the second phase of 851 condominiums. The first phase of 349 homes was approved in January 2020.

All developer Toll Brothers now needs is City Council approval of the tract map — something that should be routine — Joseph Palombi director of planning community development said by phone Wednesday Sept. 22.

The history of this controversial project has been anything but routine. The project bordered by Lincoln Avenue and Montebello and San Gabriel boulevards dates to 1990 with plans for the 1200-unit housing project first formally proposed in 1997.

Environmentalists including the Sierra Club opposed the project saying the plan was flawed questioning whether homes should be built so close to oil wells and worrying about increased traffic.

But in 2015 the council voted 4-1 to approve the project. Soon after a citizens group sued to stop it but lost in Norwalk Superior Court. A state appellate court in 2018 affirmed the lower court’s decision.

Meanwhile Freeport-McMoRan Oil and Gas sold the property to Sentinel Peak Resources in October 2016 for $742 million. Then followed a changeup in developers from Newport Beach-based Cook Hill to Toll Brothers of Fort Washington Pennsylvania.

The housing project will consist of two- three- and four-story buildings with units ranging in size from 1400 to 2900 square feet Jason Certilman director of community development for Toll Brothers said at Tuesday’s meeting. There also will be several private and public parks he added.

An 11-foot wide 1.7-mile multiuse trail also will be included.

Commissioners raised questions about the lack of bicycle lanes but only Commissioner Marlene Ramirez voted against the project.

“I felt it didn’t fully perform to the Montebello Hills Specific Plan in being bike and pedestrian friendly” Ramirez said in a Thursday telephone interview.

Certilman said the project does have bike lanes but they will be on sidewalks not the streets.

“There are areas that have expanded parkways and sidewalks” he said.

“Instead of a standard 3- or 4-foot sidewalk the area is expanded to 11 feet” Certilman said. “So instead of the bike lanes being in the street it will be behind a curb which we feel is safer.”

Another issue was the name of the project “Metro Heights at Montebello Hills.”

“Every single one of us has heard from our community and neighbors who want to know why was this name chosen?” Commission chairwoman Alexandra Briseno asked. “A lot of people don’t like that name.”

Certilman responded the name Metro was chosen in part because the project is near downtown Los Angeles and Heights because of its “beautiful view” from being in the hills.",,,,,,,,,,,,

From staying in touch to sleep tracking how to get the most out of your smartwatch

Whether you ever thought about it or not some of the biggest tech companies in the world are duking it out for a spot on your wrist. But should you actually offer it to Apple Google or Samsung? Introducing Help Desk: Technology coverage that makes tech work for you ArrowRight The answer to that will be shaped by your life your priorities and the relationship you want with the companies that make these things. For now though let’s start with the most basic truth about smartwatches: not everyone needs one. For the most part they make some things you’d normally whip out your phone for — like checking your messages controlling your music and taking quick calls — more convenient.

But there’s plenty of depth available if you need more than just the basics. Over the years smartwatches have become sophisticated tools for exercise and health tracking and they can run versions of many of your favorite apps to glance at on the go.

I wear a smartwatch every day because I like being able to glance at my (many) incoming Slack messages though I could pretty easily live without it.

Whether a smartwatch actually makes sense for you really depends on what you care about as a person. And if you already have a smartwatch how do you make the most of it? To that end we’ve put together a guide to help you figure out if one of these wrist-worn gadgets could fit into your life sorted by personal priority.

Before anything else

If you don’t already have a smartwatch there are a few things you’ll have to keep in mind. First up: compatibility.

IPhone owners can use the Apple Watch along with smartwatches like the Fitbit Sense and Garmin’s Forerunner models but are not compatible with watches that use Google’s latest version of the Wear OS software. The reverse is also true so Samsung and other Android phones aren’t compatible with the Apple Watch. (Fitbits and Garmins are a-okay though.)

The other thing to think about is privacy — after all these wearables live on your body and among other things track your personal health information. One of the best resources we’ve seen for figuring out how potentially problematic wearables can be is Mozilla’s Privacy Not Included guide but if you’re really concerned about your privacy the best bet might be to not wear a smartwatch at all.

Keeping up to date

If all you really want is to stay on top of your incoming messages and notifications then you’re in luck — that’s one thing every smartwatch out there can do. In fact you might not even have to go with a full-blown smartwatch at all since many fitness trackers (like Fitbits and Garmin’s Vivosmart series) can also alert you when someone texts or calls you.

Just beware: looking at your watch to check your new messages while talking to someone can look ruder than glancing at your phone.

That said Apple Watch and wearables that use Google’s Wear OS software are more sophisticated with how they manage notifications compared to say a basic Fitbit. Let’s say you’re a news junkie: if you have The Washington Post app installed on your smartwatch you can configure your watch to display news alerts you’d normally see on your phone. That same can be said for just about any app you use that creates notifications on your phone but be aware: that can lead to an avalanche of notifications on your wrist. Here’s how you can make sure you only get the ones you want:

For Apple Watches

Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone

Tap the “Notifications” button

Toggle notifications on or off for the apps listed under “Mirror iPhone alerts from”

For Google Wear OS watches

Open the Wear OS app on your Android phone

Scroll to the “Settings” section and tap “Notifications” then “change watch notifications”

Tap an app to allow or disable notifications

Tracking your workouts

This is another thing that nearly all smartwatches can do to some extent but exactly how they track your exercise depends on what kind of software your watch has.

Apple Watches are well-known for their three rings a quick visual indicator that lets you know how close you are to meeting your daily step exercise and stand goals. But there’s a lot more to the exercise experience than just that: using the built-in Fitness app you can tell the watch to track different kinds of workouts from long walks to weight training to Tai Chi. No matter what type of exercise you’re doing the Apple Watch will show you your current workout duration heart rate and calories burned.

On Sept. 14 Apple showed off a new smartwatch with a tougher larger screen and new software for typing messages. (Video: The Washington Post Photo: Apple/The Washington Post)

Samsung’s Galaxy Watches which only work with Android phones offer many of the same workout tracking features. But there’s a twist. Let’s say you’re in the gym lifting weights: unlike the Apple Watch which only gives you the basic stats I mentioned earlier Samsung’s watches also offer guidance on the correct form for exercises like bicep curls as well as count your reps for you.

But there’s another question at play here: if tracking exercise is your main concern do you really even need a smartwatch? That’s debatable. You can find a slew of wearables for $100 or less designed solely to count your steps monitor your heart rate and even compete with your friends — Fitbit’s new Charge 5 quickly springs to mind.

At the end of it it all boils down to the level of sophistication you’re after. If your big priority is just being generally more active you could easily get away with a cheap Fitbit. But for deeper insight into your workouts a smartwatch is a better bet. And if you’re a really serious athlete — say an avid runner or triathlete — you might want to consider a more specialized smartwatch like one of Garmin’s Forerunners.

Monitoring your health

Many companies have crammed a bevy of sophisticated sensors and features into smartwatches so they can help you keep tabs on your well-being. Here are a few you might find in your next (or first) smartwatch:

Optical heart sensor: These basically use light to measure your blood flow and are used to help show you how fast your heart is beating. (Available in all versions of the Apple Watch all versions of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch all of Garmin’s Forerunner smartwatches and Fitbit’s Versa 2 Versa 3 and Sense watches.)

Electric heart sensor: Instead of just tracking your heart rate these are used to take electrocardiograms and can help flag irregularities in your heart beat. (Available in Apple Watch Series 4-7 Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Active 2 Galaxy Watch 3 and Galaxy Watch 4 and the Fitbit Sense.)

SpO2 tracking: This feature often relies on a smartwatch’s optical heart sensor to figure out how much oxygen is in your blood. In general healthy people have oxygen saturation levels between 90 and 100 percent. If your readings are consistently lower than that consider seeing a doctor. (Available in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7 Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 and 4 and the Fitbit Sense.)

Fall detection: Nearly all smartwatches use sensors called accelerometers inside to measure movement but only a few use those sensors to tell when you’ve taken a hard fall. If a watch with this feature senses one it will give you options to contact emergency service or loved ones. That said this feature can be very hard to trigger — even when you’re specifically trying to set it off. (Available in Apple Watch Series 4 and newer and Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Active 2 Galaxy Watch 3 and Galaxy Watch 4.)

When it comes to your health though just be sure to keep one thing in mind. Smartwatches even really sophisticated ones don’t always have approval from the Food and Drug Administration for some of the health features they offer. That’s often thanks to a well-known loophole: If a smartwatch maker markets something as a “wellness” feature instead of a tool for medical diagnosis it doesn’t need the FDA to sign off on it. Blood oxygen tracking is a good example of a feature that generally doesn’t have to be cleared but all watches with electrocardiogram features in the United States have been evaluated by the FDA.

Get a better night’s sleep

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention around 70 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep problems. If you’re one of them a smartwatch might be able to help you understand why. Many popular options offer sleep tracking features that keep an eye on troublesome sleep behaviors you might not be aware of.

The Apple Watch Series 3 and newer can for example detect how long you were asleep and track your breathing throughout the night. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

Most of Garmin’s Forerunner smartwatches monitor your blood oxygen levels while sleeping and your respiration too. It’ll even attempt to measure how much time you spent in different sleep phases — light deep or REM (rapid eye movement) — in order to give you a sleep “score” in the morning plus some advice on how easy you should take it that day.

Fitbits were among the first fitness trackers out there to support sleep tracking and the company’s smartwatches — like the Fitbit Sense — continue to carry that torch. The Sense features all of the same tracking tricks that Garmin watches do but with one helpful addition: a “smart wake” mode that will wake you up to 30 minutes before your alarm if it thinks you aren’t sleeping deeply anymore.

Meanwhile Samsung’s new Galaxy Watch 4 can monitor blood oxygen and track your progression through different sleep stages like the other but it also has a sleep tracking trick we haven’t seen in a wearable before: snore detection. That might sound a little silly but it’s more helpful than you might think. If your stats say you’ve been snoring and your blood oxygen levels are unusually low you may want to see a specialist — those might be signs of a disorder like sleep apnea.

Tips for getting the best sleep data:

Make sure your watch band is as snug as it is comfortable. That helps ensure the sensors that work while you’re asleep are in a good position to take readings.

Charge your smartwatch before bed. You’re not going get any good sleep info if your watch dies before you wake up.

Turn off notifications for the night. Most Samsung smartwatches have a “Good night mode” that mutes all notifications except alarms. Apple Watch owners can set up and enable “Sleep mode” on their iPhones which also turns on Do Not Disturb. On a Fitbit smartwatch swipe your home screen to the left and tap the moon icon to enable “Night mode.” Meanwhile Garmin Forerunner owners have to turn on Do No Disturb.

Be aware of your watch’s specific foibles. For example some of the sleep features mentioned above aren’t enabled by default on Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4 so you need to turn them on manually. And Garmin says you need to be wearing its watches for two hours before sleeping to get the best data.

Staying in touch

Many common wearables — Apple Watches Samsung’s Galaxy Watches Fitbits like the Sense and Versa and more — can pull double duty as tiny speakerphones when you don’t want to pull out your smartphone. Call quality can vary depending on what kind of watch you’re wearing but it’s generally good enough for quick conversations. (Talking into your wrist can look a little silly but if Dick Tracy can pull it off so can you.)

But again proper smartwatches have an edge if you want to do more than just take phone calls. The Apple Watch has a neat built-in Walkie Talkie feature that lets you trade quick voice messages with other Apple Watch owners. (Even better you have to specifically request someone’s consent — and vice versa — before you can swap voice memos).",,,,,,,,,,,,

The price of DRAM and NAND flash are reportedly set to see a dramatic fall within the next few months offering a welcome relief for gamers and home-builders across the world.

A memo from Gartner seen by The Register believes that prices are set to crash in the second half of 2022 as hardware floods the market following the current global chip shortage.

We've put together a list of the best workstations on the market

Take a look at these best laptops for business

Here’s our collection of the best best mobile workstations

Global shortage

The memo says that by this time an ""oversupply"" of memory chips will swamp the market as manufacturers look to bounce back from the 2021 worldwide chip shortage. It notes that a “significant price reduction” is the most likely outcome of this meaning prices for chips should fall dramatically.

The news may have a knock-on effect on device manufacturers themselves with Gartner's memo appearing to urge makers of devices such as PCs and laptops to bump up their production of memory-hungry products in order to take advantage of the flood of cheap chips.

Gartner did note that overall market conditions for 2022 would be ""unusual"" suggesting further price fluctuations and changes could be the norm going forward.

The global chip shortage has been highlighted by companies throughout the technology world as one of the key impacts of the pandemic on tech as a whole. It is the result of a multitude of factors starting with the shuttering of production facilities due to health protocols coupled with the sudden rise in demand for tech gear including laptops and tablets as people around the world were forced to work and study remotely due to worldwide lockdowns.

A severe drought in Taiwan which forced the country to divert water supply from several industrial areas including a hub of semiconductor manufacturing further compounded the global shortage.

There is little consensus when it comes to assessing the extent of the problem and defining a timeline for recovery. Some say the shortage will ease up next year others say problems will persist until 2023 and beyond.

Even industry heavyweights have remained non-committal about future supplies with Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger recently noting that it will take ""another one to two years before the industry is able to completely catch up with the demand.”

While the current-generation Chevy Blazer shares a name with the beloved K5 Blazer that’s just about all it has in common its boxy body-on-frame predecessor. This has left some General Motors fans a bit miffed because while Ford has revived the Bronco name on a capable new SUV the Blazer nameplate has not been afforded quite the same level of respect.

This digital rendering looks to soften the blow to Chevy fans by giving them a rough idea of what the Chevy Blazer would look like if it had a body-on-frame platform solid rear axle and other off-road-ready parts and components.

In addition to the lifted suspension oversized tires and beadlock wheels this rendering also adds two LED light bars to the Blazer along with a bull bar rock rails and front and rear skid plates. The artist rendered a new Ford Bronco for this gallery as well which has its own custom touches like lifted suspension a hood scoop roof-mounted LED lights and a front skid plate.

The Chevy Blazer may not be suited to going too far off the beaten trail but GM still has a handful of products that appeal to true off-roading enthusiasts including the Chevy Colorado ZR2 GMC Canyon AT4 and the new 2022 Chevy Silverado ZR2. While pricy the 2023 GMC Hummer EV Pickup also promises to impress with its off-road capability with a large portion of its development happening on the infamously difficult trails in Moab Utah.

All my friends were there so why not?

It started out innocently enough as I shared photos of sunsets and my dogs with a couple dozen followers. But as Instagram became more ubiquitous and adolescence set in my experience morphed into something altogether different. I would lay in bed nightly illuminated by the blue glow of my iPhone just scrolling. The minutes — sometimes hours — would disappear as I browsed the highlight reels of everybody else’s lives. I began to idolize perfectly proportioned influencers holding my developing frame up to photoshopped ideals. My likes and my follower count became demented metrics of self-worth. Like any teen girl I had my insecurities and Instagram seemed only to exacerbate them.

As I looked around me it was obvious that the most plugged in of my friends were consistently the most anxious and insecure. It soon became clear to me that Instagram was not a force for good so in high school I resolved to reclaim my youth by limiting my time on social media.

Because I’ve experienced firsthand the toxic mixture of social media and adolescent angst I was horrified by a recent Wall Street Journal exposé that revealed Facebook which owns Instagram knows its platforms are damaging to teenage mental health. Posted to the company’s internal message boards were damning statistics like “teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression” and “we make body image worse for one in three teen girls.”

Even though Facebook leaders Sheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg knew their Instagram app was damaging youths they have done nothing to fix the problem. Getty Images

Even with this data at hand Facebook’s leadership failed to take action to mitigate its impact on the youngest generation.

The constant bombardment of “perfection” has taken a particular toll on young girls a demographic already prone to insecurity without the unprecedented pressure of the digital age. In fact 42 percent of Gen Z believes that social media degrades their self-esteem.

Meta-analyses by academics Jonathan Haidt and Jean Twenge have uncovered “associations between heavy social media use and bad mental health outcomes particularly for girls.” As smartphone sales skyrocketed major depressive episodes rose by 57 percent among adolescents. Even Facebook’s own internal research revealed that 13 percent of suicide ideation among British teens and 6 percent among American teens can be directly traced back to Instagram usage.

Instagram encourages women to push unrealistic images of themselves leading to depression among young girls. Instagram

And yet with nearly half of the app’s users below 22 years of age profits have blinded Silicon Valley to the flaws of its digital Frankensteins.

Facebook leadership demonstrated its truly sinister intent in March of this year when the company announced plans to launch an Instagram for kids foisting their technologies onto younger and younger children despite the obvious consequences.

Amidst a youth epidemic of depression self-harm and suicide there clearly is a moral imperative to stop the damaging trajectory of technology. But Big Tech has absolved itself of any responsibility.

Therefore we must resolve to take matters into our own hands.

As we come of age it turns out Gen Z isn’t entirely full of mindless zombies contorting at the will of our algorithmic overlords. In fact 61 percent of my peers say they are actively taking a break from social media and 24 percent are considering quitting entirely because of its negative impacts on their self-esteem.

Gen Z has sacrificed too many hours of our youth on the altar of Big Tech and its voracious pursuit of profit. Now despite Silicon Valley’s best efforts to keep us hooked more and more of us are seeking to reclaim our autonomy.

Life many of us know has so much more to offer.

India is moving forward

Mr. Modi said that his country’s priority was that development should be all-inclusive all-pervasive universal and one that nurtures all.

Listing insurance coverage access to quality health services and housing as areas where India has shown progress in the past years Mr. Modi went on to speak about the problem of water pollution.

“Polluted water is a problem not only for India but for the entire world and in particular for poor and developing countries.”

In order to address this challenge in India Mr. Modi said that the country is carrying out a campaign to ensure that piped clean water reaches over 170 million homes in India. For the development of any country people must have property rights to their homes and land.

To that end India was using drones to map over 600000 villages to give people digital records of their homes and lands a process that will reduce property disputes and give people increased access to credit and bank loans.

‘Come make vaccine in India’

The Prime Minister went on to say that India’s progress in the scientific and technological sectors was scalable cost effective and could benefit the world. Indeed its new COVID-19 vaccine delivery programme offered digital support to register the administration of millions of doses in a single day.

He also announced that India has developed the world’s first DNA vaccine which can be administered to anyone above the age of 12 and an mRNA vaccine that is in the final stages of development he added.

“Despite limited resources India … is completely invested in the development and manufacture of vaccines” said Mr. Modi issuing an open invitation to manufactures across the world: “Come make vaccine in India.”

Science-based progressive thinking is the way forward

The pandemic had taught the world that the global economy needs to be expanded further he continued stressing that for its part India is becoming a democratic and reliable partner for global industrial diversification. Moreover India has struck a balance between economy and ecology and is moving forward with “great speed” on its renewable energy goals.

“Science-based rational and progressive thinking must be the basis for development” said Mr. Modi explaining that India was rolling out innovative programmes in schools creating ‘start-up labs’ and in honor of the 75th anniversary of the country’s independence planning to launch 75 satellites — made by Indian students — into space.

The Prime Minister said that countries with regressive thinking “that use terrorism as a political tool must realize they create a threat for themselves as well.” In that context it was essential to ensure Afghanistan was not used to spread terrorism and that “no country takes advantage of the delicate situation there for its own selfish interests.”

A more effective United Nations

“Today all kinds of questions have been raised about the UN” Mr. Modi said. “We have seen such questions being raised related to the climate crisis. And we also saw that during COVID-19 the proxy war going on in many parts of the world terrorism and the recent Afghan crisis have further highlighted the seriousness of these questions.”

He stressed that if the United Nations is to remain relevant it will need to improve its effectiveness and enhance its reliability vital for the Organization to meet current challenges. However “with regard to the origin of COVID-19 and the ease of doing business rankings institutions of global governance have damaged the credibility they had built after decades of hard work” he noted."

Known as Speedy V20 Eco Hybrid units a total 200 of the new products have been added to Speedy’s lighting range.

Speedy’s investment includes 225 new MX Fuel Lighting Towers 200 X-Eco Lighting Towers 100 VB9+ Lighting Towers and 100 solar powered lights.

Described as “four-in-one units” the lights can run directly from the mains an internal battery a solar panel hired separately or on green HVO D+ (hydrotreated vegetable oil) fuel.

They can operate automatically in reaction to changing light levels. An external battery pack can power the towers for up to five days at 10 hours per day.

The lights are part of a £6.3m investment that also includes 225 new MX Fuel Lighting Towers 200 X-Eco Lighting Towers 100 VB9+ Lighting Towers and 100 solar powered lights to its fleet for contractors to hire across the UK.

The 825 new towers from Generac Trime and Milwaukee will help construction infrastructure engineering and events contractors to reduce carbon emissions through electric-only operation while offering users options which run on diesel HVO D+ if projects require.

Many of the towers will be used to support major rail development projects across the country with a large quantity already earmarked for HS2 delivery partners.

Andy Connor group supply chain director at Speedy said:

“The new sustainable products will enable contractors to reduce carbon footprints across their projects. Working closely with Generac on the launch of the Speedy V20 Eco Hybrid towers is an excellent example of how we’re using our intermediary position in the construction supply chain to introduce new transformative technology to the market.

“The investment represents a significant expansion of our fleet giving contractors greater access to high-performance and versatile lighting that’s capable of meeting the varied demands of live sites.”

“By calling on Speedy’s contractor relationships and industry expertise we’ve designed a new lighting tower that effectively meets both the day-to-day needs of site workers and the overarching sustainability requirements of the industry.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

A rumor on social media falsely claims a global aerospace and defense company has backed down from requiring its employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

A Facebook user shared a post Sept. 18 with this text: ""Breaking: General Dynamics Corporation cancels vaccine mandate after roughly 40% of employees decline the jab and threaten to walk out."" The post generated close to 2100 shares in less than three weeks.

Other social media users  including Carl Higbie a former U.S Navy SEAL and conservative media personality shared similar claims.

But the claim is false. General Dynamics told USA TODAY it hasn't made any announcements about vaccine mandates.

Fact check:False claim that COVID-19 vaccine ingredients and formulas have changed since rollout

USA TODAY reached out to the social media users who shared the claim for comment.

Company refutes mandate rumors

Jeff Davis head of communications at General Dynamics said the rumors circulating on social media are baseless.

""To date we have made no announcements about vaccine mandates. We are awaiting detailed guidance from the federal government about its vaccine mandate for contractors"" Davis said.

The General Dynamics website also has no announcements about vaccine mandates.

President Joe Biden signed an executive order Sept. 9 requiring most federal workers and contractors to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. The order will include exceptions for workers seeking religious or medical exemptions according to the Associated Press.

""It describes a process for how the government will develop and implement its guidance"" Davis said.

General Dynamics is one of the world's top defense contractors by sales. It manufactures tanks and other products for the U.S. military.

Leda Chong senior vice president of government programs and sales for the Savannah-based company Georgia’s largest manufacturer was sworn in by Gov. Brian Kemp at his ceremonial office Sept. 22.

Ms. Chong joined General Dynamics Gulfstream’s parent company in 2007 as director of government relations before becoming staff vice president in the same area in 2009. After that she became head of Asia for the aerospace division of General Dynamics which includes Gulfstream and Jet Aviation a service provider before taking up her current role.

A native of Hong Kong Ms. Chong speaks Chinese and graduated magna cum lauded from the University of California San Diego with degrees in applied mathematics and French literature. She served in the U.S. Navy retiring with the rank of commander before joining the company.

Gulfstream saw revenues fall by 19 percent to $6.1 billion in 2020 with orders picking up in the second half of the year according to its annual investor report. About 17 percent of its manufacturing backlog is reserved for customers in the Asia-Pacific region. The majority of Gulfstream’s orders in recent years have come from overseas with China among the leading markets though 2020 reversed that trend as 55 percent of orders originated domestically.

Mr. Kemp also announced that he had reappointed James Allgood and Douglas Hertz to the ports authority’s board.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvJUUyJTgwJTk4aHVudGVyLWtpbGxlciVFMiU4MCU5OS11bHRpbWF0ZS1zdWJtYXJpbmUtbW92aWUtb3ItZ2lhbnQtd2FzdGUtdGltZS0xOTQzNzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is 'Hunter Killer' the Ultimate Submarine Movie (Or a Giant Waste of Time)?,"Released in 2018 the film is based on the novel Firing Point an actual military thriller by George Wallace a retired Navy submarine commander and author Don Keith.

Here's What You Need to Know: Think of it as Olympus Has Fallen but on a submarine.

If you’ve been anxiously waiting for the next great brooding naval war flick where the sonar pings from a glowing control panel are all the crew (and you the viewer) have to navigate the dangers ahead then Hunter Killer will likely let you down.

But if you are looking for a fast-moving action flick with a few erroneous “oorahs” and over-the-top shootouts — on land at sea and at the bottom of the ocean — that’ll leave cringing laughing but nonetheless entertained then Hunter Killer may be more your bag.

Released in 2018 Hunter Killer is based on the novel Firing Point an actual military thriller by George Wallace a retired Navy submarine commander and author Don Keith. Directed by Donovan Marsh Hunter Killer features Gerard Butler as U.S. Navy Capt. Joe Glass alongside Gary Oldman as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Charles Donnegan and Common as Rear Adm. John Fisk. Think of it as Olympus Has Fallen but on a submarine: Both star Butler saving presidents from doomsday plots use non-stop action to drive the movie forward and they avoid long pauses and building up tension like the plague.

The two-hour action flick — and not-so-subtle U.S. Navy recruitment spot — kicks off with a submerged boom. An American submarine in Russia’s Barent Sea has gone missing — taken out by a rogue Russian vessel — but all anyone stateside knows is that it’s vanished. Naturally another sub is dispatched to find it. Enter Glass who’s recently taken command of a Virginia Class attack submarine and upon getting his orders addresses the crew in one of the films few authentic pieces of dialogue: A moto speech.

Speaking over the boat’s comms Glass reminds his sailors that unlike the other Annapolis grads in the unit as a former enlisted-man he knows the rank-and-file. He’s turned wrenches pulled late-night watches and missed birthdays. Glass knows what’s required so you better do your job or he’ll kick you out of the way and do it himself.

With that the address ends with a rousing… Oorah?

While the line has led to a lot of head scratching Butler may have been doing his best to give an in-the-know hat-tip to the submariners he sailed with while preparing for the film something he addressed during a recent press conference at the Pentagon.

“It’s become popular with the submarine community over the last five or ten years to do that” Wallace one of the authors of Firing Point told Task & Purpose. “Back in my day we didn’t say ‘oorah.’”

But Wallace said that Butler and director Marsh spent several days aboard the USS Houston while preparing for the film and heard the commander use the term.

“They picked that up to add an air of authenticity to his speech” Wallace added. “At that point [in the film] it was a moment of high tension. He was preparing his crew to go into battle and he was doing anything he could to motivate them.”

Johnson completed her ‘builders trials’ (or harbor trials as it is called in India) at the General Dynamics Bath Iron Works in Maine this week.

It will finally join service in mid-2024 after a full two-year delay. The highly troubled project saw cost overruns delays and technical problems finally leading to the watering down of many of its features.

The F-22 of warships the Zumwalt is revolutionary in many respects primarily being the world’s full stealth warship whose Radar Cross Section (RCS) is as small as a small fishing trawler. It achieves this through a combination of radar reflecting surfaces paint and electromagnetic emissions.

A High-Tech Ship

The 16000-ton ship will see finalization of her basic hull mechanical and electrical systems before heading to the Huntington Ingalls Shipbuilding in Mississippi. This is a departure from how Zumwalt and USS Michael Monsoor were completed where the complete installation and testing of the ship’s air search radar vertical launch missile cells combat system and commissioning took place at Bath.

This will make space for the ongoing modernization of the US Navy’s existing Arleigh Burke-class destroyers which are being upgraded with the Flight III version of the Aegis combat system.

Its signature Integrated Power System (IPS) generates electricity from the rotating turbines and distributes them across the ship not with mechanical linkages but electric motors.

Producing a whopping 78 megawatts it can power 10000 average American homes. It is hoped to power electricity-guzzling Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) like lasers or insanely-powerful Electromagnetic Rail Guns in the future.

Its distinct wave-piercing hull shaped in what is called a ‘tumblehome’ design makes it look like a warship straight out of a sci-fi movie. The sides slope inwards rather than the outward shape of even current warships still being launched. Its two devastating Advanced Gun System (AGS) units are capable of firing a variety of GPS-guided and rocket-assisted rounds.

#Destroyer USS #ZUMWALT DDG1000 launched an SM-2 #Standard #Missile for the first time 13 Oct. The shoot from the ship's unique Mark 57 vertical launch system took place on the Navy's test range off Point Mugu California pic.twitter.com/Ls98FH80HB — Chris Cavas (@CavasShips) October 19 2020

The 155 mm gun systems hold 304 rounds in a magazine capable of firing 10 rounds a minute. The Zumwalt was meant to introduce naval gunfire/naval artillery support – a practice that died with the retirement of the Iowa class battleships – for littoral or amphibious operations by Special Forces deployed through small boats.

Cost Overruns And Delays

But the Zumwalt program has given the US Navy and the Department of Defense (DoD) enough reasons for regret and it is not just the $4 billion price tag or the $10 billion in development costs.

For one its trademark ‘tumblehome’ hull is feared to be unstable with the possibility of tipping over if a wave hits the ship under the right sea conditions the right angle and the right speed.

The first-of-its-kind IPS has been found to have severe problems with its software causing several operational issues. The radar-evading structure – stealth no doubt – has been still been found to be vulnerable to ironically lower-frequency S-band radars.

If not an old-school radar system technologically proficient militaries with sufficiently networked assets battlefield management systems sensor fusion and data sharing can eventually find a roundabout complicated tricks to detect stealth.

Russia and China also boast advanced systems and technologies and won’t be completely vulnerable to such platforms. In November 2016 the US Navy announced it won’t spend an astronomical $800000 per round for the AGS leaving the two units deadweight. In other words its guns simply won’t have ammunition to fire!

Most astonishingly the ship lacks a Close-In Weapons System (CIWS) that can’t protect it from salvos of anti-ship missiles. Even the 57 mm Mark-110 cannons that were originally planned on the Zumwalt had only limited CIWS capability without the reliability of the 20 mm Phalanx Gatling gun or the Rolling Airframe Missile and SeaRAM point Missile Defence Systems.

The cannons were dropped from the Zumwalt’s basic design in 2014 to not add to its radar signature!

Since it does not have Aegis radar and fire control systems neither will it have capable ‘layered air defense’ systems that can fire advanced Standard Missile 2/3/6 series surface-to-air missiles that are even Anti-Satellite and Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) capable! All it has is the RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile which can’t fly longer than 30 miles.

Ironically the Zumwalt program was meant to operate in a “high-threat” environment to support land bombardment which can’t be achieved without being inherently air defense-capable. Worse even its intended radar system was downgraded to save costs where the smaller SPY-3 radar was installed without the SPY-4.

This led to SPY-3 merely being updated with new software to perform both surveillance and tracking roles.

In April this year Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday said the USN plans fielding hypersonic missiles on the Zumwalt-class destroyers “as an important move forward to turn that into a strike platform”.

This marked even the basic doctrinal orientation of the ship changing from a littoral and amphibious operations support vessel to a blue-water capable strike platform."
GIS,General Mills,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA5LzI2L2dlbmVyYWwtbWlsbHMtaW52ZXN0b3ItcHJlc2VudGF0aW9uLTMtYmlnLXRha2Vhd2F5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,General Mills' Investor Presentation: 3 Big Takeaways,"The packaged-food giant lifted its outlook after a strong start to the new fiscal year.

General Mills (GIS 0.63%) is back to growing again. Just one quarter after announcing a sales slump compared to a pantry-stocking period a year ago the cereal and snack-food giant said that revenue is now rising.

In an investor presentation this week the company described a challenging operating environment with supply bottlenecks and rising prices. But CEO Jeff Harmening and his team see faster growth and accelerating profit gains overall thanks to fundamental changes in demand and in General Mills' portfolio.

Let's look at the highlights from that shareholder report.

1. Winning in a tough environment

General Mills reported just a 2% organic sales uptick after adjusting for currency exchange-rate shifts. But the bigger picture is brighter than that one metric suggests.

Global organic revenue is rising at a 6% annual pace over the past two years thanks to a mix of rising prices and increased volumes. The company held or extended its market share in most of its core categories too including cereal and pet food.

These wins came despite some historic inflation and manufacturing challenges brought on by an understaffed supply chain. ""I'm proud of the way our team is performing in a dynamic and challenging operating environment"" Harmening said.

2. The brighter profit picture

Gross profitability declined thanks mainly to soaring input costs. General Mills offset that slump with cost cuts though so that adjusted operating margin is still higher today (at 18% of sales) than it was before the pandemic struck (17% of sales).

Investors can also see that success by following profits on a two-year track. Earnings are up 9% on that basis compared to General Mills' 6% sales growth in the period.

The pet-food business has been a big contributor here. Consumers are increasingly reaching for premium dog food and treats helping the pet segment notch a 20% annual profit increase since 2019.

3. Portfolio changes ahead

General Mills isn't done tinkering with its portfolio having just struck a deal to sell its European Yoplait business even as it added several new brands to its pet-food category.

These moves are contributing to a brighter outlook for the fiscal year that just began. Sales should now barely decline compared to 2020's surge executives said. Profits will be at the high end of their previous forecast too.

The updates add weight to management's claim that there's a new normal in the consumer packaged-foods industry with consumers prioritizing cooking and eating around the home. At the same time General Mills is positioning its portfolio to capitalize on the niches with the most attractive earnings profiles like pet food.

As a result investors might want to take a closer look at this stock which has sat out of the stock market rally in 2021. General Mills entered the pandemic period with weak operating and financial trends. However it appears to be on a faster more profitable growth path which should reward patient shareholders over the long term.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90bm9ubGluZS9uYW1lL3Jvc2FsaWUtcGVyc2NoeS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0yMjk1Nzg0NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rosalie Perschy Obituary (2021) - Palmerton PA - Times News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/tnonline/name/rosalie-perschy-obituary?id=22957844 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90bm9ubGluZS9uYW1lL3Jvc2FsaWUtcGVyc2NoeS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0yMjk1Nzg0NNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9taW5uZXNvdGEtYmFraW5nLWljb24tYmV0dHktY3JvY2tlci10dXJucy0xMDAvNjAwMTAwMzU4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Minnesota baking icon Betty Crocker turns 100,"Spoiler alert: Betty Crocker arguably the most recognized Minnesotan of the past century isn't a real person. Still Cathy Swanson Wheaton is making sure that the 100th birthday of General Mills' fictitious spokesperson is not going unnoticed.

Wheaton is executive editor of the Golden Valley-based company's cookbooks overseeing recipe development photography and manuscript writing.

For her latest project Wheaton has compiled a collector's edition of recipes into ""Betty Crocker Best 100: Favorite Recipes From America's Most Trusted Cook"" (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt $25) ranging from tried-and-true standards like banana bread and Swedish meatballs to classics-in-the-making along the lines of spiced pumpkin cupcakes and gluten-free tuna-noodle casserole.

In a recent phone conversation Wheaton discussed Betty's beginnings the vagaries of memory and the appeal of easy-to-make chicken pot pies.

Q: How did you go about narrowing what had to be a mountain of archived recipes?

A: It was daunting. I lost a lot of sleep. How am I to know what are the 100 top recipes? I ended up looking at the data that we had. Bettycrocker.com has 12 million visits each month — it's one of the largest food websites out there — and selecting the most popular recipes there was a good way to choose. We have a large and robust consumer relations department. They receive a million questions each year and I pored over their recipe requests. A lot came from the nearly 400 cookbooks that General Mills has published since Betty was born and also recipes that we've given clever new twists.

Individual Chicken Pot Pies from “Betty Crocker Best 100.”

Q: Such as?

A: Fruitcake. It got a bad rap as being a good doorstop. But there's a recipe on bettycrocker.com for fruitcake bars that take 20 minutes to prepare and people rave about them.

We never changed for change's sake. There was always a purpose. We tried to keep the essence of the recipe — we did take some favorites and made them gluten-free — but in some cases ingredients and methods have changed and improved over time. For example it didn't make sense to share the old recipe for stuffed peppers because you boiled them for 30 minutes. That's when people cooked vegetables to death. Now we stick them in the microwave with 2 tablespoons of water and they're done in three minutes.

Q: How many recipes did you consider before whittling the list down to a hundred?

A: There were hundreds easily. Every night I'd be pulling back my memories asking myself ""What did I have 30 years ago?"" and ""What did I have 20 years ago?""

Q: Memory can be tricky right?

A: We've learned that while we may have our memories our taste buds have moved on. If you taste the mac-and-cheese you remembered from your childhood you'd probably think ""This doesn't have much flavor."" We expect more flavor combinations these days which is why we updated the mac-and-cheese recipe with dry mustard and Worcestershire sauce. They enhance the cheese flavor and match today's expectations for the tongue.

Q: First on my to-do list is going to be making those single-serving chicken pot pies. Why did you include them?

A: That recipe is very much comfort food; it says ""fall"" to me. We recognize that people have busy lives. We don't want cooking to be daunting — we want people to be successful at it and to be proud to serve what they're making to their family and friends. With those pot pies it's so easy to place the crust over the top it doesn't have to form beautiful edges. People aren't looking for perfection they're looking for things that taste good and are easy to make.

Q: The Star Tribune has an annual holiday cookie recipe contest. Which one of the book's 16 cookie and bar cookie recipes would you submit for our competition?

A: The Brownie Cookies. Chocolate is always going to be a favorite. The recipe is a twist on brownies and with the pecans it delivers so much flavor and texture.

Q: You produce three or four cookbooks a year. Was this a fun project to take on?

A: Oh my gosh yes. It was so exciting when we realized a few years ago that the 100th birthday was coming up. We had to do a book. It helps consumers see that she's still relevant. She's not your grandmother's Betty Crocker. She has that history but she's still going forward and still has great ideas. She trends with the times she's not ahead of the times. Poring through old books finding original sources and seeing how recipes have touched our lives and continue to touch our lives that was a lot of fun. My blood runs Betty red and so I'm super-honored that I can keep up the traditions.

Q: We're talking about a fictitious character as if she were a living breathing person. Is that standard operating procedure in your workplace?

A: It's definitely part of the culture of General Mills. As a writer it's a little odd to talk about her in the first person as much as I did in the book. But it is about her birthday and she lives in the hearts of all of us who represent her.

Q: Can you shorthand Betty's origin story?

A: Our parent company the Washburn-Crosby Co. had a contest. A lot of the responses included cooking questions and the marketing people realized that they needed more food-related people to answer them. They decided to create a persona for all of the home economists working at the company. They chose ""Betty"" because it was popular and warm and friendly and ""Crocker"" because it was the last name of a retiring executive.

Q: It's great that the book includes reproductions of the famous eight Betty Crocker portraits. The last one was created 25 years ago. Will there ever be another one?

A: I would hope so but it's hard for me to say. I know they've toyed with the idea and about how they would represent her today. But everyone can be Betty Crocker. It's about being a maker. Your gender and your race don't matter. The whole idea behind Betty is to give you the creativity and the tools to help you make what you want to make in the kitchen.

Q: Do you do a lot of cooking at home?

A: I love to share food with family and friends. I had an Italian grandmother who made great big feasts and then watched everyone eat and enjoy and laugh. Food has such an impact on our lives it's such a connector. It's the centerpiece of our celebrations it creates memories. Why not have good food when you have those gatherings?

Under the sprawling train sheds of the National Railroad Museum you'll find over 100 years of railway history from steam engines to high-speed diesel-electrics and from classic dining cars to historic sleepers. There's a lot to see here.

One of the most notable is GM's Aerotrain a streamlined and futuristic midcentury creation that once looked like the future but has since faded into the past. Here's a look around.

Aerotrain

In 1955 General Motors wanted to shake up the passenger train industry. Sure the car side of its business was doing great but like any huge conglomerate wanting to maximize profit. So it came up with a flashy plan that leveraged multiple arms of the company to bring together something new and shiny.

And new and shiny it was. The Aerotrain looked like no other train of the era. Its streamlined locomotive looked more like GM's jet-inspired cars of the era. It looked fast and was designed to cruise at over 100mph reducing the time between major cities in some cases by hours. Remember this was before the high-speed interstate highway system. And in the air the prototype that would lead to Boeing's 707 had only just flown the year before. That made the idea of a 100mph long-distance train a huge promise.

In order to minimize design time and maximize profits GM rummaged through its corporate parts bin. Power was from a V12 engine sourced from their Electro Motive Division the cars were modified bus shells from GMC and aluminum was used throughout to save weight. The overall look was overseen by legendary automotive designer Chuck Jordan who became not only the chief designer of Cadillac in the late 1950s (think ""fins"") but later vice president of design for all of General Motors.

The result was... bad actually. Like really bad. While the train looked fantastic garnering interest among the public and railroad companies alike its performance was abysmal. The engine was woefully underpowered and despite its lighter weight the Aerotrain had trouble going up hills without assistance. The cars were unpleasantly loud and they bounced around so much on their air suspension that they were basically unusable over 60 miles per hour.

Geoffrey Morrison/CNET

All but one railroad passed on purchasing Aerotrains. The one that did -- the Chicago Rock Island and Pacific Railroad -- bought the three prototypes at a huge discount and ran them on low-speed short-distance commuter services in the Chicago suburbs. Even in this diminished role they didn't last long getting retired after eight years. One was sold for scrap one went to the National Museum of Transportation in St. Louis and one is here.

Being covered but not completely indoors the Aerotrain could use some TLC. Dust and bird droppings cover much of the exterior and the interiors of the locomotive and two cars are off limits (though not to a GoPro on a selfie stick) and unrestored. With any museum especially train museums maintenance and cleaning is an expensive and ongoing process. And given the state of the world the over past year it's hard to fault the museum for focusing efforts on the more important vehicles in its care.

Making steam

While my fascination with the Aerotrain prompted my visit the National Railroad Museum has many other historic and impressive locomotives and railcars. The Dwight D. Eisenhower is a British Class A4 high-speed behemoth one of only four still in existence that held records for decades on the the UK's East Coast Main Line. The gigantic Union Pacific ""Big Boy"" is one of the largest locomotives ever built and is in immaculate condition.

In all there's more than a century of rail history including cabooses Pullman sleepers and a plow car that's like a rolling wood cabin.

And decades later LaReau said that's still true.

In fact GM's influence extends around the globe. And its current CEO Mary Barra has promised to transform car-making with an ""all-electric zero-emissions future"" that will ""bring everyone along.""

LaReau who has been nominated for a Loeb Award and a Pulitzer Prize is holding GM to that commitment. She recently wrote about safety concerns for one of the automaker's electric cars and controversy over GM's political contributions.

In this interview LaReau also talks about writing stories personal to her and how before she started covering GM the company's announcement that Barra would become CEO was so significant it moved her to tears.

Here is an edited transcript of the interview or you can listen to it on Amazon Echo Google Assistant Apple podcasts or freep.com.

FREE PRESS: Well thank you Jamie for taking the time to interview with me today.

LAREAU: Sure.

FREE PRESS: I know you've been a business reporter for the Free Press since 2018 covering one of the biggest companies in the world General Motors. And you've also written some personal stories. And I just found out you've been a guest teaching a class at Central Michigan. Fire up Chips. So first I wanted to ask you if we could talk a little bit about covering GM?

LAREAU: Sure.

FREE PRESS: What's that like?

LAREAU: Oh it's exciting. It's never a dull moment. It's a huge company and there's always news. I'll say they're pretty easy to work with. Overall they're accessible to me as a reporter and it has been interesting. There's been a lot of levels to it a lot of layers. Mary Barra is a unique leader to cover and I enjoy it.

FREE PRESS: And for those who are listening that don't know she's the CEO of the company.

LAREAU: That's correct. She is. She's been CEO I believe since 2014 and worked for GM her whole career Her father worked for General Motors as well. So she has a long history with the company. I remember the day that she was named CEO. I was driving to work that morning and I was working for Automotive News.

I covered a different beat. I didn't cover GM. And I was coming into the office I heard the news on the radio. And I remember I mean it sounds a little cheesy but I remember crying. Because being a woman in the auto industry for so long myself covering it to have a woman break the glass ceiling and run an automaker was truly historic. And it just moved me. I was amazed that General Motors would take that step and no one else has.

FREE PRESS: Well you've kind of jumped ahead in my questions here. So I'll just ask now. She's not just the face of GM now but also the face of women in corporate America. And I think a reminder that there's really a lack of gender equality at that high level and many levels. And I was kind of wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your thoughts about that?

LAREAU: I think it's a long road that women still have to travel. I think we saw that in 2016 with the (presidential race between) Secretary of State at the time Clinton and former President Trump. In some cases I heard anecdotally people say they didn't vote for her because they didn't think a woman could be president. So there's still that attitude out there in terms of female leadership and it's something that's evolving.

I think that we've come a long way. I do think that a lot of my colleagues my male colleagues are very respectful and do offer their support and their help and respect. So that's been good. But you know when I started out I do remember having some incidents where I was seen as just the girl and given cars to test drive and told ""Well it's a little too fast for a girl."" And I thought like ""Well you know I guess that depends on how hard I want to push on the gas pedal doesn't it?""

FREE PRESS: Well going back to GM can you talk a little bit about what is the most challenging part of covering a big company like that and how you decide what to cover?

LAREAU: There's a lot of collaboration with my editors when there's news and we make decisions on what we think our readers are going to respond to. We write for more of a consumer audience. We don't write for Wall Street. We don't necessarily write for the same reader of a trade publication like Automotive News. Those are industry people. So we look at it from what would a car buyer and a consumer be interested in? What would an amateur investor be interested in if you own stock in General Motors? And we make decisions that way.

We also look at stories that are unique and enterprise and human interest. We like to explore people-oriented stories some of the stories that I've done that have gotten the biggest responses from readers have been innovative people working at General Motors doing really interesting things that have an intriguing backstory. And it's pretty much 24-seven job in some ways because it's a huge company and they have offices around the world. So news could happen at it has happened at 11 o'clock on a Friday night and I'm writing a story. It's just the nature of the beat.

FREE PRESS: You've had a lot of experience in newsrooms. You've been in newsrooms for about three decades before the Free Press you worked on automotive news like you said for about 13 years. You worked for Reuters in New York Bridge Wire service in Chicago and I think you worked for a TV station?

LAREAU: Yeah.

FREE PRESS: Can you talk a little bit about how all that experience goes into what you cover now?

LAREAU: Well we have become a multi-media outlet. We do audio. There's been times we've been asked to shoot video and shoot photos of people on Election Day. I was shooting video as I interviewed voters. So I have that experience from doing that in previous jobs. I was a radio reporter for a while. I spent six years on television and now print. It's given me a wide range of experience that I can apply to my current job. And that's been good. And you know reporting is reporting. The more you do it the better you get at it whether it be broadcast or print. And there's a lot of things you can borrow from each. With print you learn how to be a really deep investigative reporter which even if you're doing a short broadcast-type style of reporting going deep is still good because you have information. And that's what you need to convey to your audience.

FREE PRESS: Can you talk about a couple of non-GM stories that you wrote that were especially touching and resonated with readers? One I think was recent about your memories covering the 911 attacks in New York 20 years ago. And the other was about Romeo a resilient pup you adopted because you love animals.

LAREAU: Uh huh. Yep those were two. And then I also got a lot of feedback writing about my mom. And her being in a nursing home and unable to visit her for a year in person. I had to talk to her through the glass on the phone because of COVID. A lot of people wrote in about that because they had similar situations with family members that were in long-term care facilities and they also couldn't see them. So that was really appreciated by readers.

And then adopting my puppy I just wrote that because I like to write about dogs. As you know I do a lot of feature stories kind of on the side which is great about the Free Press by the way. My editor will let me write about things outside of cars if there's time because it interests me. And I love that. And so I like to write about dogs. I realized that there's the puppy pandemic as well as the COVID pandemic where people were adopting puppies. And I was one of them. Some people in our newsroom also adopted puppies. So I thought well I'm going to write this story because Romeo had this really unique background and how he came to me was kind of fateful. I thought it would be a good column to write that would also convey to people ""Hey if you're going to adopt a dog remember it is for life and there's a lot of responsibility that comes with it. And it can be challenging at times.""

And then in terms of Sept. 11 yes I was in New York. I worked for Reuters at the time and it was a very vivid memory that day. I did leave a lot out of the column just because I wanted to keep it focused on my job as a reporter and center it just on that. But there were a lot of memories of that day that will always stay with me. And you know as tragic and sad as that day was as a journalist I wouldn't have wanted to be anyplace else but there because you want to convey information and you want to do your job. And that job is to record history.

FREE PRESS: That's terrific. Thank you very much Jamie. I really appreciate it. To read all of Jamie's reports and personal reflections subscribe to the Detroit Free Press or freep.com.

Alexandra Souverneva a 30-year-old graduate of the California Institute of Technology and former Bay Area biotech employee pleaded not guilty to the felony charges against her during a Friday arraignment in the county’s Superior Court. She could face up to nine years in state prison if convicted.

Facing a crowd of angry and displaced Shasta County residents at a community meeting on Saturday night Shasta County Sheriff Michael L. Johnson said “It is difficult to grasp when disaster like this is apparently not a natural disaster. But we have a suspect.”

Deliberate ignition if proven “makes it harder for us all to grasp as a community and to deal with what we’re facing” he said.

Firefighters are making progress against the Fawn Fire as it inched closer to Shasta Lake on Saturday helped by cool temperatures increased humidity and light winds. At 8537 acres it is now 35% contained. It only grew 100 acres overnight.

Emerging from the edge of the fire on the evening of the blaze CalFire firefighters found that Souverneva was carrying a cigarette lighter in her pocket.

She may be linked to other recent fires in the state Shasta County District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett said during a press conference on Friday morning. Souverneva has declined an interview request from the Bay Area News Group.

Souverneva graduated from Palo Alto High School in 2009 and the California Institute of Technology in 2012 with degrees in chemistry and biology.

She enrolled in a Ph.D. program at the State University of New York’s College of Environmental Science and Forestry but did not complete studies. She then worked in medicinal chemistry as a research associate at the biotech companies Gilead Sciences in Foster City and Nanosyn in Santa Clara.

A former Palo Alto yoga instructor certified scuba dive master piano teacher and camp counselor she most recently tutored Bay Area students in the sciences at Palo Alto’s AJ Tutoring a respected SAT test prep business.

Souverneva’s LinkedIn profile which features a photo of a forest lists her occupation as “shaman” a religious term for a person who believes themselves connected to the transcendent world and acts as a healer and diviner. She’s registered to vote as a member of the Green Party.

But she has run into legal trouble before. In Santa Clara County court records show she faced misdemeanor charges in 2017 and criminal charges in 2015. Details were not available on Sunday.

Earlier this month Souverneva was arrested on Interstate 5 near Red Bluff and booked into the Tehama County Jail on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs and obstructing and resisting arrest. A week later she was arrested in coastal Oregon for criminal trespass which means unlawfully entering another’s enclosed or fenced-in property.

The Fawn Fire was ignited Sept. 22 in a remote canyon on property adjacent to Shasta County’s JF Shea Quarry. Earlier that day Souverneva was seen trespassing on the property by a quarry employee and asked to leave. She ignored the warning and continued walking into the hills according to a report filed by CalFire.

The quarry employee reported that she was acting strangely said Bridgett.

That evening as firefighters were battling flames she walked out of the brush and asked for water and medical help according to the CalFire report.

She said she had been hiking according to the report. Souverneva was arrested by CalFire after the discovery of CO2 cartridges and a cigarette lighter in her possession.

Because of the damage caused by the wildfire her bail has been increased to $150000 from $100000 for the felony charge of arson on forest land plus $25000 for a related misdemeanor arson during a state of emergency.

At the Friday court appearance an attorney said Souverneva had made statements to law enforcement that indicated a possible mental health crisis “or something to do with drug abuse” according to the Redding Record-Searchlight.

A preliminary hearing for Souverneva will be held on October 7.

Most of the major manufacturers conceal from the competition their games not ready for casino floors. Cashless technology falls into that category; a visitor needed an invitation from an Everi representative to enter.

The secret room wasn’t unusual. Most of the major manufacturers hide their newest products not ready for casino floors from the competition during the industry’s largest annual gathering.

Cashless technology was one of those products and a visitor needed an invite from an Everi representative to view the technology.

“We showed them this is what it looks like and this is how we view the experience” Everi Executive Vice President Darren Simmons said in a recent interview at the gaming equipment and financial technology provider’s Las Vegas headquarters. “Our customers were curious.”

The concepts displayed in secret three years ago will be front and center when the week-long G2E opens on Oct. 4 at the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Everi will no longer be alone in displaying a much wider suite of cashless gaming and digital payment products — heralding the transition of one of the final cash-dependent industries.

“Early adoption (of cashless gaming) is going to be a learning curve but customers are very interested in what is being developed” Intentional Game Technology Senior Vice President Ryan Reddy said.

In the two years since American Gaming Association CEO Bill Miller emphasized cashless gaming innovation as a priority technology endeavor for the casino industry major manufacturers have responded by developing a wider array of products that are now being slowly rolled out across the U.S.

“The conversation we were having three or four years ago was really just wrapping our heads around what it exactly all meant” Simmons said. “It’s truly e-commerce which has been around for years. Online booking online purchasing that’s e-commerce. Moving this into the gaming industry is what we have long discussed.”

Most gaming equipment providers have developed or are in the process of creating mobile wallets — smartphone apps that store payment cards and other information in a digital format.

There are several components to cashless gaming such as the backend technology used to securely transfer funds from a bank account or credit card into the wallet and then back to an account or another form to use outside that casino such as a debit card. Those funds are protected by FDIC rules and regulations.

“Everyone is working diligently to get operators and gaming regulators into the digital world faster than you would think” said Aristocrat Technologies Global Vice President Boris Amegadjie.

COVID-19 also played a role in speeding up the transition to cashless transactions as casino operators looked to reduce the use of items that could be touched by multiple patrons as health and safety operating guidelines were put into place by gaming regulators.

In the mid-2000s the casino industry buzzword of “server-based gaming” was used to describe computer systems that managed all games across a casino floor. Similarly cashless gaming and digital payment systems have to incorporate multiple games and product development by all manufacturers regardless of origin.

The gaming industry has adopted the term “omnichannel approach” to cashless technology. In addition to transferring funds the digital systems are designed to allow customers to easily wager across all platforms — in-person slot machines and table games sports betting and internet casino gaming in the four states where it is legal.

“We’re in the very early innings of the cashless rollout” said Scientific Games Executive Vice President Matt Wilson. “In three to four years more than half of the (casino) operators in the country will have some sort of omnichannel presence. We believe the future is building that digital wallet and allowing the customer to take that wallet and make transactions across all those platforms.”

Miller said eight states have adopted cashless gaming and digital payment options for commercial and tribal casinos – Nevada California Oklahoma Pennsylvania Indiana Iowa Ohio and Florida.

“We think that number will grow” he said.

Pandemic was a cashless accelerator

During his keynote address at G2E in October 2019 Miller challenged the gaming industry to expand the use of digital technology to replace cash by saying casinos shouldn’t be using the same basic payment methods used by flea markets.

Five months later as casinos across the country began closing due to COVID-19 removing the use of cash from the gaming world became an industry-wide endeavor.

The AGA released research in June 2020 showing 57 percent of casino visitors said digital or contactless payments on the casino floor are important to them because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Another 59 percent of casino customers said they were less likely to use cash in their everyday lives out of coronavirus concerns.

“The pandemic has created a lot of horrible dynamics” Miller said. “This is one of the dynamics that has been a major accelerator for a priority I had coming into this job. The health and safety of our customers and our employees coalesced into something that is really important for the industry.”

Miller said cash will always have a place in the casinos but the industry is transforming into a place that allows customers “to decide how they want to transact.”

Nevada’s importance

Cashless gaming has been active in Nevada since the state’s launch of mobile sports betting in 2010. Customers have to sign up at a casino and attach a funding account such as a credit or debit card. The 2018 Supreme Court ruling on legalizing sports betting opened the rest of the U.S. to the activity with online and mobile systems used in most of the 26 states that offer legalized sports betting.

IGT offers a cashless gaming system across several wagering channels in international markets primarily for its online lottery in Europe. Reddy said the company has processed $1 billion in payments across its different gaming businesses since 2018 with more than half of those transactions coming in the last 12 months.

Gaming equipment providers and payment processing companies met with Nevada gaming regulators last year to discuss the use of cashless wagering technology and offered advice on potential regulations. The control board and Nevada Gaming Commission approved the use of digital payments in June.

A year later the $4.3 billion Resorts World Las Vegas opened with a multi-tiered digital technology system to provide a cashless payment program for both gaming and non-gaming activities throughout the property. Five gaming technology providers created the system which also marked the first time in the state that a gambler could digitally purchase chips from a table game dealer.

Miller said the newest Strip resort has become a live showroom for the potential of cashless gaming.

“Resorts World operators said they would have been doing an unbelievable disservice if they didn’t incorporate payment modernization” Miller said. “They didn’t just build a casino. It is a modern version of a casino.”

Las Vegas-based Sightline Payments serves as the financial conduit at Resorts World moving funds from a customer’s debit card bank account PayPal account or another source into the mobile wallet.

“Consumer adoption is going well and we are continuing to work to make this a better experience for the customer” said Sightline co-CEO Joe Pappano.

He said a cashless system provides safeguards for anti-money laundering rules and the background needed for “know you customer” requirements. Customers can also set withdrawal limits on their accounts.

“Cashless gaming technology has answered many of the initial questions raised” Pappano said.

Other major gaming operators are moving forward with their own versions of cashless systems. Boyd Gaming recently completed a field trial test of a mobile wallet at the company’s Aliante Casino in North Las Vegas that began during the summer and was overseen by Nevada gaming regulators. Customers were able to make wagers through a digital payment system on the property’s slot machines using mobile devices.

Aristocrat Technologies provides the casino management system for Boyd’s casinos and developed the mobile wallet which is titled Boyd Pay. Sightline Payments processes the financial transactions.

Boyd Gaming Chief Information Officer Blake Rampmaier said the system which was created by Aristocrat Technologies and Sightline has since been expanded to slot machines at the Cannery in North Las Vegas as well as to Suncoast and Main Street Station in downtown Las Vegas. He expects the system will be live at Gold Coast and Orleans by early October.

Rampmaier said the company “quietly” approached loyal Aliante customers to try out the cashless system; the same approach is taking place at other casinos that are beginning to launch their own cashless wagering systems.

“We have had positive feedback from our customers” he said adding that Boyd would begin a marketing effort in Southern Nevada for the system over the next few months.

The company which also launched cashless wagering at its casinos in Indiana and Pennsylvania is awaiting approval from Nevada gaming regulators to begin a field trial for cashless wagering on Aliante’s table games.

Aristocrat Technologies Vice President Thomas Castleberry said Nevada “has taken a very detailed and measured approach to digital payments. Some jurisdictions are a little more aggressive than Nevada and have adopted (regulations) that allow this activity to be implemented much faster.”

Amegadjie said continual implementation at Boyd properties will spur increased use of cashless systems at other properties in Nevada.

“When operators start seeing the benefits of Boyd Pay it will drive others to the technology as well” he said.

Wilson said the mobile wallet technology developed by Scientific Games and other manufacturers still requires additional development time.

“We’re not promoting our unified wallet to players just yet” Wilson said. “We’re still trying to iron out the wrinkles. This is all still a work in progress.”

Investors take notice

Everi which also develops slot machines and offers casinos the technology for customer loyalty programs was created nearly seven years ago through the merger of a cash access provider and a traditional slot machine developer.

The company provides cashless gaming capabilities at 11 casinos in four states which is expected to increase through its partnership with Penn National Gaming. Everi’s mobile wallet interfaces with a casino management system from Las Vegas-based Acres Manufacturing.

Penn National operates 43 casinos in 20 states including M Resort in Henderson and two casinos in Jackpot Nevada near the Idaho border.

“We’re able to adapt for all jurisdictions” Simmons said.

B Riley Securities gaming analyst David Bain said in a research note last week that investors are underestimating the importance of the digital wallets for companies such as Everi. He said the financial opportunity from “the casino fintech evolution (is) now underway.”

Truist Securities gaming analyst Barry Jonas told investors in late August that Everi could become “a consistent growth story” following its deal with Penn and another agreement to provide cashless gaming at two Ohio casinos operated by Jack Entertainment.

“While it’s too early to share specific metrics around cashless Everi management did suggest higher volumes and ticket sizes for early adopters” Jonas said. “Interestingly Everi management had expected more hesitancy around the older cohort to use the mobile wallet but adoption has been greater than expected.”

At Penn National’s new casino in York roughly 100 miles west of Philadelphia Bain said the company has seen increased use of mobile wallets after managers ran a promotion offering a free smartphone to high value customers who signed up for digital wallet.

Privately held Sightline completed $240 million in funding in August on top of $100 million in funding earlier this year. Investors include Cannae Holdings the investment arm of Vegas Golden Knights owner Bill Foley.

Pappano who spent 30 years in the payment processing industry before joining Las Vegas-based Sightline in July 2020 said cashless gaming companies have an opportunity to educate an industry “that is ripe and salivating over what will be the next new revenue driver that will help in accelerating the replacement cycle from a systems perspective.”

“I think the whole industry is going to be demonstrating how they can better leverage data” Pappano said. “We have to show we can create more customer loyalty and how cashless solutions can create new revenue.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMjUvd2h5LXJldGFpbGVycy1hcmUtZW1icmFjaW5nLWJ1eS1ub3ctcGF5LWxhdGVyLWZpbmFuY2luZy1zZXJ2aWNlcy5odG1s0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjEvMDkvMjUvd2h5LXJldGFpbGVycy1hcmUtZW1icmFjaW5nLWJ1eS1ub3ctcGF5LWxhdGVyLWZpbmFuY2luZy1zZXJ2aWNlcy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Retailers bid farewell to layaway as shoppers embrace buy now pay later options,"In this article APTN-MX

Supply chains are snarled and manufacturing is constrained. For weeks headlines have been telegraphing a clear message to shoppers: This holiday season shop early. In years past early bird shoppers may have turned to layaway plans to reserve holiday gifts and pay for the purchases over time. But many retailers — including the nation's largest Walmart — have done away with or scaled back these programs. One reason is shoppers have new tools at their disposal to spread out payments. A popular option for consumers are buy now pay later plans. Retailers are big fans as well. The point-of-sale loans are easy for retailers to manage and research shows these options lead to bigger baskets and greater customer loyalty. RBC Capital Markets estimates a BNPL option increases retail conversion rates 20% to 30% and lifts the average ticket size between 30% and 50%.

Adding incremental sales

""It's all about incrementality"" said Russell Isaacson director of retail and automotive lending at Ally Lending ""getting that incremental sale or incremental consumer."" Installment payments give consumers options and convenience when it comes to managing budgets and purchasing according to Hemal Nagarsheth associate partner in Kearney's financial services practice. He said the option also increases trust between retailers and consumers leading to ""incremental sales higher average purchase sizes and higher frequency of purchase."" Buy now pay later payment plans offered by companies like Affirm  Australia-based Afterpay and Sweden's Klarna are particularly attractive to younger shoppers like the much-desired Gen Z and millennial consumer. While each plan has differences — from the number of payments to the specific terms — the key similarity is the promise of a handful of equal payments spread over a relatively short period of time with no hidden fees. Often the plans are interest-free.

Installment payments are more popular among consumers that either do not have access to credit or for a variety of reasons do not want to purchase with a credit card. The option also makes a lot of sense for shoppers who don't have the funds to cover the total purchase but will over the next several paychecks according to Ally Lending President Hans Zandhuis. The average transaction value is about $200 for a buy now pay later purchase said Zandhuis. Often the checkout value for the retailer would have been around $100 had the ability to pay later not been available he said. With it that same consumer can spend $175 to $200 with 4 monthly payments of $50. The payments are meant to align with paycheck cycles. Take apparel retailer Rue21 for example. Its key demographic is an 18- to 25-year-old female shopper who often doesn't use credit cards. With many low-priced items on its website and waning mall traffic increasing average order volume is a key priority. When the pandemic shuttered stores Rue21 had to figure out how to sell to its shoppers online without credit. Since Rue21 added Klarna as a payment option in-store and online its average order volume is 73% greater than other payment methods according to a case study Klarna published. Rue21 shoppers that transact with Klarna turn in the highest sales per customer with a 6% higher purchase frequency. As of May Klarna purchases made up more than a quarter of rue21's e-commerce sales.

Affirm boasts that its merchant clients report a 85% increase in average order value when consumers opt to use its BNPL plan over other payment methods. Affirm approves installment payments for purchase totals as high as $17500 which has proven to be very important for Peloton's expensive workout equipment and services. FT Partners an investment bank focused on the fintech space estimated 30% of Affirm's first-quarter 2021 revenue came from sales on Peloton's website. Klarna's merchant base reports a 45% increase in average order value when a shopper pays over four payments. Shoppers can also opt to pay in full in 30 days interest-free or for larger purchase get financing with monthly payments from 6 to 36 months with an annual percentage rate of between 0% and 29.9%.

New customers

Attracting a customer a retailer might not have swayed otherwise is another benefit of offering a buy now pay later options. Earlier this year Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette told investors its partnership with Klarna was helping it to attract new customers. ""We launched Klarna on the Macy's website in October [2020] and we've since scaled it across Macy's Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury both online and in stores"" he said. ""With Klarna we continue to see higher spend per visit and increased acquisition of new younger customers 45% are under 40. Our goal is to convert all of these new customers to Macy's loyal customers who return for future purchases."" Around 93% of Afterpay's gross merchandise value in the most recent fiscal year comes from repeat users of the installment payment service with the longest-tenured consumer making 30 more transactions per year.

Higher conversion

Installment payments allow the retailer to ""convert a [consumer's] wish into a sale"" according to Chris Ventry vice president at global consultant group SSA & Co. ""It eliminates the ability-to-pay roadblock"" said Ventry. ""For those using debit cards the potential for an extended interest-free payment schedule through BNPL is enticing ultimately enticing enough to drive conversion which is the primary goal of all digital commerce sites."" An analysis by Similarweb of the top 100 U.S. fashion and retail websites compared 50 merchants that offer a buy now pay later option at checkout and 50 that do not. On average sites with a BNPL option saw a conversion rate of 6% compared with 4% for those that do not. Afterpay said it increases a retailer's conversion rate and incremental sales 20% to 30% more than other payment options. The incremental revenue and increased conversion makes the incremental transaction cost the retailer pays to the fintech companies worth it too. Zandhuis said while the retailer pays an additional 2% higher transaction fee to the BNPL company compared with transaction fees a traditional credit card company charges ""the math speaks for itself. The extra revenue is higher than the cost."" Afterpay and Klarna charge merchants a 3% to 5% transaction fee Affirm declined to disclose its transaction fees. The programs also have advantages compared with traditional layaway which requires retailers to store purchased items on site while customers make installment payments over time. Increasingly retailers are using stores as mini-fulfillment centers to service online orders. In this model store space is at a premium.

Growth opportunity

Buy now pay later is the fastest growing e-commerce payment method globally with the growth of digital wallets second according to FIS Worldpay. In 2019 the $60 billion BNPL market represented 2.6% of global e-commerce excluding China. Worldpay estimates that use of the option could grow at a compound annual growth rate of 28% to reach $166 billion by 2023. At that pace it would make up about 5% of global e-commerce outside of China. Right now BNPL makes up less than 2% of North American sales according to FIS WorldPay. Coresight senior analyst John Harmon acknowledges the opportunity for retailers but does not see it as a panacea. ""I don't see BNPL as a magic solution despite its booming acceptance since it is just credit of a different sort"" Harmon said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FtZXJpY2FzL3BlcnUtcG0td2FybnMtZ2FzLXNlY3Rvci1wYXktaGlnaGVyLXRheGVzLW9yLWZhY2UtbmF0aW9uYWxpemF0aW9uLTIwMjEtMDktMjYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peru PM warns gas sector: pay higher taxes or face nationalization,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/peru-pm-warns-gas-sector-pay-higher-taxes-or-face-nationalization-2021-09-26/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FtZXJpY2FzL3BlcnUtcG0td2FybnMtZ2FzLXNlY3Rvci1wYXktaGlnaGVyLXRheGVzLW9yLWZhY2UtbmF0aW9uYWxpemF0aW9uLTIwMjEtMDktMjYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYml0Y29pbmlzdC5jb20vd2F0Y2gtamFjay1tYWxsZXJzLXNlbmQtMTAtdG8tZWwtc2FsdmFkb3ItdmlhLXR3aXR0ZXJzLWxpZ2h0bmluZy10aXBzL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vYml0Y29pbmlzdC5jb20vd2F0Y2gtamFjay1tYWxsZXJzLXNlbmQtMTAtdG8tZWwtc2FsdmFkb3ItdmlhLXR3aXR0ZXJzLWxpZ2h0bmluZy10aXBzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Watch Jack Mallers Send $10 To El Salvador Via Twitter's Lightning Tips | Bitcoinist.com,"This man Jack Mallers has a way of finding himself in the middle of historic transactions.

The person at the other end of the line then uses the money to buy coffee in a little-known independent coffee shop.

The previous time Jack Mallers found himself in the middle of a historic transaction

When Strike’s CEO sent $10 to Nigeria he described that other transaction in terms that also apply to today’s historic transaction.

“If you don’t see how huge this is think about it as Jack Mallers does. He “didn’t have to register the transfer through a financial intermediary such as Western Union request private banking details of Bernard Parah or wait days for the payment to settle.” On the other side Bernard “didn’t owe any intermediary a percentage of the transaction the payment wasn’t reversible and settled instantly.”

Bernard Parah’s Bitnob and Strike are interoperable because they both joined the Bitcoin and Lightning open monetary network. And now Twitter and its millions of users joined both of those companies and the network. This is immense.

Also the previous time Jack Mallers proclaimed “Today Strike became the best remittance option from the US to Nigeria without even trying.” This time he feels even more confident:

“Twitter’s integration with the Strike API turns Twitter into one of the best remittance experiences in the world one of the greatest global creator marketplaces in the world one of the greatest global payment experiences in the world one of the best global micropayment marketplaces in the world and allows an internet communications company to interoperate with the monetary standard for the world enabling global payments for their users.”

Boom!

The craziest thing you’ll see today? An instant free cross-border payment on @Twitter. Twitter’s integration with the Strike API turns Twitter into one of the best remittance experiences in the world. Here’s the view from my phone as I remit money to El Salvador 🥳😄 pic.twitter.com/N6Zcjiv3sy — Jack Mallers (@jackmallers) September 23 2021

The Relationship Between Twitter And Strike

On the Strike API’s official site they describe the product as:

“Connect your business to a global instant payments network. Marketplaces use Strike’s API to enable payments between buyers and sellers or fans and creators.”

When Bitcoinist announced the integration of a Bitcoin and Lightning tip feature on Twitter we said:

“Twitter made the announcement today via an official company blog post where it explained that Twitter users regularly add links in their bios so followers can help support them. Now this is built directly into Twitter. Twitter has partnered with Jack Mallers’ Strike lightning wallet on the integration. As part of the Twitter Tips launch Strike has debuted their Strike API platform to “serve marketplace and merchant businesses” like the social media company.”

And in the mentioned blog post Twitter elaborates:



“In addition to the services currently enabled through Tips people can now seamlessly tip with Bitcoin using Strike – a payments application built on the Bitcoin Lightning Network that allows people to send and receive Bitcoin. Strike offers instant and free payments globally.”

In this first iteration of Twitter’s Tip feature you need a Strike account to receive tips. That means only people in the US and in El Salvador can receive at the moment. Everybody all over the world can tip them via a Lightning Network invoice though.

Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports

Cody Bellinger has experienced the worst season of his five-year MLB career posting career lows in batting average (.159) slugging (.291) and his 43 wRC+ is second only to teammate Max Muncy among all players with at least 300 plate appearances this year.

The Dodgers knew it was going to take some time for him to find his swing and get that power back after the former Rookie of the Year underwent offseason shoulder surgery.

When Cody Bellinger came back from his injury we saw glimpses of the old Cody that included a walk-off home run at home against the Cubs and on the road he had multi-home runs games. The question facing Dodgers is whether they will consider non-tendering or trading him this off season.

“Sam and I are pretty good friends” Van Horn said. “He’s a great supporter of baseball and he knows that I love football.

“He called the other day and said ‘Man I really want you to come to the game and hang out on the sideline. I said ‘I’ll do it.’

“I think the football team is playing hard. You can tell the players believe in what they’re doing and they believe in the coaches and the coaches believe in them. I think they’ll fight you to the end.”

Van Horn who flew to the game with Arkansas Athletic Director Hunter Yurachek didn’t miss any fall practice by coming to the football game.

“We’re halfway through fall baseball” Van Horn said. “Our guys needed a weekend off. It just worked out well for me to come to the football game.”

Pittman said Van Horn canceled practice to attend the game. Van Horn and Arkansas basketball coach Eric Musselman met with Pittman on the field after the game.

""I really really appreciate both of them"" Pittman said. ""It was a special moment for me as head coach to have — I mean it's Dave Van Horn and Eric Musselman my God. It was really special for me to have both of them down there.""

Arkansas is among the few college baseball programs that generate revenue but Van Horn understands the importance of the football program bouncing back under Pittman.

The Razorbacks came into Saturday’s game ranked No. 16.

“I think it’s big for the university it’s big for our athletic department and it’s big for the state for football to have success” Van Horn said. “I think the fans just want to see the team compete hard and they’re certainly doing that under Sam.”

Saturday marked the first time Van Horn attended an Arkansas-Texas A&M football game in Arlington but last season his Razorbacks won three baseball games — beating Texas Tech Texas and TCU — in the College Baseball Showdown at Globe Life Field the Texas Rangers’ stadium near AT&T Stadium.

GLOBE Ariz — It was a diagnosis Lilly Machado could hardly believe: Non-alcoholic Cirrhosis.

Doctors tell Lilly that her liver is operating at less than 15% of normal.

“This can’t be. I’m a healthy woman. I never drink. I don’t smoke I don’t use drugs“ Machado remembered thinking after getting the bad news.

Lilly is a mother of three. She's a waitress at a Mexican restaurant in Globe and she started getting sick around three months ago.

She was losing weight feeling nauseous and throwing up. Eventually doctors were able to figure out what was wrong.

They told Lilly her liver was scarred and that she needs a liver transplant to survive.

However before she can get the life-saving surgery Lily said doctors told her she needed $50000 up front and prove she could cover the full $450000 for the cost of the procedure and medicine.

It's money Lilly doesn't have.

“At that moment I felt like my life fell apart. I was afraid of what was going to happen next. What’s going to happen to my kids?“ Lilly said.

Requiring the money up front is not unusual for transplants.

Kaiser Health has reported for years that often patients don’t get on a transplant list if they can’t afford the total cost of care.

The goal is to make sure valuable organs go to those that can afford the drugs to make a transplant successful.

However for Lilly's family they wonder if money should be a factor in who gets a potentially life-saving surgery.

""It’s not fair these are real human lives we are dealing with"" Jackie Machado Lilly's daughter said. “How are you going to ask someone to put up a half-million dollars just to save their life?”

Lilly is desperate. She said she can no longer work as her health has deteriorated in recent weeks.

“I want to live. I want to enjoy my kids. I want to see my daughter get married and have kids of their own. I want to see my son he’s a senior this year so he’s about to graduate.

I want to see him with his cap and gown making me proud. I want to see my little ones have the same chance my older kids have. And just thinking I'm not able to see that. It just breaks my heart” Machado said.

The family is not giving up. They are working to see if nonprofits will help. The family also has a GoFundMe account that has already raised more than $70000.

It's a lot of money that shows what Machado means to the Globe community.

However it is still a long way away from the total needed to potentially save her life.

“It’s been a blessing. But I need a big miracle” Machado said.

First the U.S. finally withdrew from Afghanistan ending its 20-year war and occupation. Second the Supreme Court voted 5-4 not to block a Texas law that prohibits most abortions in that state. The media were awash in stories of the Talibanization of Afghan society and the loss of women’s rights in that country. We also saw stories on the attack on women’s rights right here in the U.S.

However rather than see these incidents halfway around the world as a product of right-wing forces wanting to control women and their lives some have revived an older narrative that tries to explain white supremacy neo-Nazism and right-wing ascendancy as the product of the encounter with the colonized “other.”

Thus Thomas Friedman in a recent op-ed in The New York Times posed the question of whether U.S. intervention in the Middle East has achieved its publicly stated goal of getting the region to embrace “pluralism and the rule of law” or instead has wound up “mimicking” its “tribalism.”

Meanwhile a photoshopped image of Supreme Court justices in which the three female judges are shown wearing burqas with their faces covered appeared on social media.

This is gendered islamophobia. Retire using Muslim women in niqabs & burqas as punch lines. Name white supremacist hetropatriarcy as the root cause of the violence. Name that placing rapists and harassers on the bench is the issue. Leave Muslim women out of this. pic.twitter.com/4G60az6Tba — #CancelRent #FreePalestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸 (@DarakshanRaja) September 8 2021

The logic of the image presumably posted by someone who supports the right to abortion is that of a Talibanized Supreme Court one that has “mimicked” the Middle East or Central Asia and brought “alien values” into the heart of the United States.

This image was part of a media landscape in which the plight of Afghan women under the Taliban was once again dominant. Just like in 2001 the media suddenly discovered Afghan women. (My study with a colleague showed a dramatic increase in stories about Afghan women in the media in lead up to the U.S. invasion which served to justify it.) In a repeat of themes articulated in 2001 media pundits and political elites alike promoted the idea that decades of “progress” under U.S. occupation would be undone by the Taliban’s return to power. Once again feminism and women’s rights were weaponized to serve imperial aims. This time however it was deployed to justify a 20-year occupation and to paper over the U.S.’s defeat at the hands of the Taliban.

In reality the situation for women in Afghanistan by and large did not improve under U.S. occupation. An April 2021 National Intelligence Council report states that while “some policies” that negatively impacted Afghan women may have ended after the fall of the Taliban in the early 2000s “many continue[d] in practice even in government-controlled [i.e. U.S.-backed] areas and years of war have left millions of women maimed widowed impoverished and displaced.” The explanation for the ongoing plight of Afghan women the report suggests is Afghan “cultural norms.”

The common logic underlying Friedman’s op-ed the photoshopped Supreme Court image as well as the National Intelligence Council report is that of a “clash of civilizations.” We have on the one hand an enlightened “West” that champions women’s rights and on the other a backward and misogynistic “Muslim world.” While the Taliban are indeed a retrograde force it is important to look more deeply at the role the U.S. played in Afghanistan. Indeed the U.S.’s failure to “liberate” women is not so much the product of the backward “culture” of Afghan people but rather its choice of allies: the very same misogynistic warlords who began the attacks on women’s rights in the early 1990s.

Journalist Anand Gopal has documented the complex picture for Afghan women through his extensive interviews with women in the countryside where the vast majority of Afghans live. Far from the hapless victim the picture that emerges from his account is not only one that shows how the U.S. threw these women from the frying pan into the fire through its support for the warlords but also one that highlights the determination of women to survive and fight both U.S. occupation and Talibanization.

Imperial feminism benefits neither women in colonized spaces nor the vast majority of women right here in the imperial center.

Yet such stories that grant agency to Afghan women are in a minority. The narrative of Muslim women as oppressed victims has animated U.S. culture to such an extent that portrayals of the rescue of Brown women from Brown men is ubiquitous. This narrative which scholars have referred to as colonial or imperial feminism has a long history that goes back to the height of European colonization of much of the world in the 19th century when women’s rights were weaponized in service to empire. But imperial feminism benefits neither women in colonized spaces nor the vast majority of women right here in the imperial center.

At its core imperial feminism erases not only the agency of women in the Global South but also that of women in the U.S. Indeed the two are historically and inextricably connected.

It took women suffragists no less than a century of struggle to secure the right to vote in the U.S. against a fierce and demeaning opposition as seen in this anti-suffrage postcard from the early 20th century. However racist gerrymandering practices have sought to undo the voting power of women of color.

This was not a product of the Taliban or the colonial encounter with “backward people” but very much a product of deep-rooted sexism and racism indigenous to U.S. culture.

Similarly it took a women’s movement to win not only the right to terminate a pregnancy but also thanks largely to feminists of color the right to carry a pregnancy to term and not be forced to undergo sterilization. The Christian right has since been trying to undo women’s reproductive rights as evident in the recent Texas law not because of some external factors but due to homegrown misogyny.

To be sure the colonizer and colonized the imperial center and the periphery have always been marked by a symbiotic relationship as many scholars have argued. Ironically the forces of the right in the U.S. have more in common with the Taliban than they do with women’s rights advocates in either context.

Moreover as noted above imperial feminism also erases the agency of women in the Global South and its own role in undermining the struggle for women’s rights globally. Thus against the wishes of the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) founded in 1977 and perhaps the country’s most significant women’s rights organization the U.S. decided to invade the country.

Let us not displace the source of threat to women’s rights to external forces through a contorted racist logic.

RAWA’s founder Meena was killed in 1987 by Afghan agents of the KGB in connivance with U.S. agents particularly the misogynist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. As is now well documented in order to defeat the Soviet Union the U.S. supported groups with reactionary social goals with full knowledge of their violent and repressive tendencies. Hekmatyar of the Islamist group Hezb-e-Islami for instance received large sums of U.S. aid in the aftermath of the Soviet invasion in 1979 even though as journalist Tim Wiener notes Hekmatyar’s “followers first gained attention by throwing acid in the faces of women who refused to wear the veil.” Wiener’s CIA and State Department sources described Hekmatyar as “scary” “vicious” “a fascist” and “definite dictatorship material.” Yet they supported him in order to advance U.S. geopolitical interests.

RAWA opposed U.S. intervention right from the start and demanded that U.S./NATO forces withdraw. In a recent interview that the Afghan Women’s Mission conducted with RAWA the organization states quite clearly that over the “past 20 years one of our demands was an end to the US/NATO occupation.” They go on to add:

[E]ven better if they take their Islamic fundamentalists and technocrats with them and let our people decide their own fate. This occupation only resulted in bloodshed destruction and chaos. They turned our country into the most corrupt insecure drug-mafia and dangerous place especially for women.

However with the exception of a rare op-ed here and there mainstream discourse in the U.S. has largely failed to give voice to RAWA. If anything to the extent that we have seen images of Afghan women protesting Taliban rule in the mainstream media it is framed in ways that suggest that it was the U.S. occupation that made that possible. Again the agency of Afghan feminists and women’s rights organizations are erased and rendered invisible.

What is relatively new is the repackaging of an older narrative that seeks to cast blame on the “other” for problems in the domestic context. This thread runs through the op-ed by Friedman and the doctored image of the Supreme Court.

Today you can buy a t-shirt of Joe Biden wearing a turban and scarf with the slogan “Make the Taliban Great Again.”

The t-shirt undoubtedly produced by Donald Trump’s supporters playing on Trump’s signature slogan is designed to equate Biden with the Taliban. Recently a series of billboards with the same image appeared in Pennsylvania the work of a former senator from the state Scott Wagner.

By depicting Biden in this way the image seeks to convey the message that the U.S. has been Talibanized by Biden. Even though it was Trump who promised to end the “forever wars” and withdraw from Afghanistan the right has chosen to direct its ire at Biden. This anger is a product of various factors including support for the U.S. war on Afghanistan. However what is noteworthy here is that Biden is presented as part of the Taliban because he is dressed in this photoshopped image in a turban and scarf. Cultural racism works by depicting aspects of a religion or culture as backward as a means to create “others.” Thus Muslim women who wear hijabs bear the brunt of xenophobic violence.

This is not just a tactic of the right. The Clinton campaign in 2008 was criticized for circulating a picture of Barack Obama in a turban as a way to garner white support for Hillary Clinton by creating Obama as a racialized “other.”

However this has been taken to a whole new level with Biden being depicted as an agent of the Taliban. While there is a long history of the right claiming that Obama is a “secret Muslim” and an agent of Muslim-majority countries to represent a white person i.e. Biden as a Taliban fighter speaks to how “race” and the construction of enemies is an ever-shifting process. Significantly the “America” of white supremacy rather than be restored to its “greatness” has been defiled by people like Biden per this billboard. Biden’s ejection from whiteness marks a new phase in the evolution of the rhetoric of anti-Muslim racism.

Unfortunately this form of Islamophobia is not just the province of the right. The doctored image of the Supreme Court accepts this logic as does Friedman’s op-ed albeit in different and more subtle ways.

This sort of argument has a long lineage harking back for example to analyses of Nazism. Even such an astute critic of Nazism as Hannah Arendt in volume three of The Origins of Totalitarianism wrote that the Nazi Holocaust was due not to factors internal to European history but rather to Europeans’ encounter with those whom they colonized. According to Arun Kundnani Arendt’s “model for this process of alien corruption was Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. European colonizers confronted by the ‘savagery’ of the colonized population degenerated into ‘savages’ themselves setting the precedent for the would-be totalitarian rulers of the European ‘mob.’ Thus the origin of ‘our’ savagery lies in ‘their’ culture; Western civilization can be corrupted by the barbarism of others but does not give rise to any distinctive barbarism of its own.”

Only an anti-imperialist politics can build the kind of internationalism needed to liberate women around the globe and dismantle neoliberal imperialism.

In fact the causality has often proceeded in the opposite direction: the subjugation and dehumanization that imperial powers have inflicted on colonized peoples has been brought back home to reinforce dominant class interests in the metropole. As Aimé Césaire argued forcefully in his book Discourse on Colonialism the genocide of Jews in Europe was nothing but the application internally of what European colonial powers had been practicing externally. The two were intimately tied. European fascism even beyond Germany applied practices to white people that were “until then … reserved exclusively for the Arabs of Algeria the ‘coolies’ of India and the ‘n….s’ of Africa.” In short Césaire argued that fascism in its various manifestations was very much a product of factors internal to Europe.

W. E. B. Du Bois in The World and Africa made a similar argument asserting that: “There was no atrocity — concentration camps wholesale maiming and murder defilement of women or ghastly blasphemy of childhood — which Christian civilization or Europe had not long been practicing against colored folk in all parts of the world in the name of and for the defense of a Superior Race born to rule the world.”

It therefore behooves progressives to eschew arguments that blame the Taliban or the Middle East for the attack on women’s rights in the U.S. Let us not displace the source of threat to women’s rights to external forces through a contorted racist logic. At the end of the day women all over the world face oppression even if their oppression looks different in parts of the world and is inflected by various factors including their class position within a neoliberal order. Only an anti-imperialist politics can build the kind of internationalism needed to liberate women around the globe and dismantle neoliberal imperialism.

BTS Lorde Femi Kuti and Alok joined the call to action broadcasting from remote locations — and Fugees reunited to perform for the first time in 15 years.

The countdown clock struck zero in Paris cameras went live lights came up and the once-in-a-generation 24-hour global broadcast Global Citizen Live began with an inspiring opening ceremony.

The ceremony started off on a ring glowing bright red and a backdrop of the iconic Eiffel Tower which set the Global Citizen Live stage in Paris France — the first stop on a 24-hour tour of global events broadcast across seven continents. The crowd received a warm welcome from actress and activist Priyanka Chopra Jonas and French journalist Denis Brogniart as they took the stage to urge world leaders to join the mission to defeat poverty and defend the planet.

In front of a fully masked COVID-19-free audience the hosts in Paris teased upcoming performances from Elton John and Doja Cat and delivered messages of unity stressing the importance of climate action.

“As we all know the world today faces many challenges. A spiraling climate crisis millions on the brink of starvation and a pandemic that continues to expose the harsh inequalities of power"" said Jonas a vocal vaccine equity advocate. “But every problem has solutions and if we can just rise to them — if we dare to believe that these solutions are within our power — throughout this pandemic we have seen what we can achieve when the world works together.""

The message spread across the Atlantic Ocean as the hosts turned it over to the US where in New York City Emmy award-winning actor Billy Porter and actress Rachel Brosnahan joined forces in Central Park four hours away from welcoming 60000 fully vaccinated change-makers to the Great Lawn.

Brosnahan spoke about COVID-19 and how the pandemic exacerbated — and set back progress on — issues such as world hunger education and environmental protection.

“Global Citizen has hosted a festival here in Central Park since 2012 — last year of course there was no concert — but we are very happy to be able to gather safely for this year’s show” said NYC host Porter who's also an LGBTQ+ activist and star of Pose. “There has never been a greater need for advocacy than there is right now.”

The hosts discussed the musicians and young activists lending their voices to the NYC event before turning the broadcast over to London.

“What a spectacular show we have got here for you here in the UK tonight adding to the sheer force of this once-in-a-generation moment. We've got artists like Kylie Minogue we have got Nile Rodgers and CHIC and we've got Duran Duran” said TV personality Roman Kemp from the Sky Garden in London England.

The ceremony continued on to India where in Mumbai actor Anil Kapoor spoke about the rich musical culture of his country from the iconic archway of the Gateway of India.

“For Global Citizen Live lending their voices here in Mumbai you’ll see Tanishk Bagchi Badshah Amit Trivedi Ajay-Atul and so many more” Kapoor announced before shifting the spotlight onto Lagos.

In Lagos Nigeria at the New Afrika Shrine — a symbol of freedom and activism — lawyer and reality show host Ebuka Obi-Uchendu and actress and model Nancy Isime welcomed Global Citizen Live to Africa.

The hosts spoke in front of an audience of fully vaccinated frontline workers as their words sent cheers through the crowd.

“Across parts of Latin America Haiti Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa nearly 41 million people are on the brink of starvation. It is unacceptable. So we ask you and you and you to join us and demand action from the world’s leaders” said Isime.

The broadcast turned back to the US where in Los Angeles actor Scott Evans counted down 10 hours until the event at the Greek Theater.

“In California right now we as so many people around the world are living through the real time effect of climate change. We know that action to keep our planet's temperature increase at no more than 1.5 degrees is totally essential” said Evans. “And we are going to make a whole bunch of noise to ensure that leaders know the time to act is now.”

Evans then introduced the first performance of the night broadcast remotely from South Korea.

International K-pop sensations BTS performed their new song “Permission to Dance” from the Sungnyemun Gate in Seoul.

""This is Global Citizen Live"" said BTS. ""Welcome to South Korea!""

Alok and Mapu Huni Kuin performed from a floating set on a river in the Amazon rainforest.

""Much peace love joy and light"" said Mapu. ""With the powers and cure of the forest Huni Kuin talks to humankind! Much light in your hearts!""

Alok was also joined by Yawanawá for a showcase of Indigenous voices. Owerá (Kunumi MC) also took the stage with the Brazilian DJ.

“Together we can move the world to defend the planet and defeat poverty"" said Alok. ""I'd like to dedicate this moment to all the Global Citizens that are on the frontline fighting to stop the global warming. I'm so honored to be part of this global movement. And I know that we can change the world one action at a time.”

Lorde made a special appearance with a four piece band to sing “Solar Power” from her latest album and delivered a speech in the center of a golden sun from New York City.

“It's an honor to be here today amplifying Global Citizens deeply important messages” said Lorde. “Environmental systems change must come from our biggest businesses and our lawmakers but the movement has always belonged to the people. May we all continue to ask questions of our world. And remember the future is solar.”

In Lagos Afrobeat royalty Femi Kuti performed “Pà Pá Pà.”

“It's a great honor to be performing with Global Citizen at Lagos at the New Afrika Shrine a venue dedicated to my father Fela Anikulapo-Kuti to put a stop corruption and inequality. Tonight we are doing just that amplifying the voices of those most affected by inequity poverty and disease. Sit back let's have a great evening.”

Back in NYC Porter and Brosnahan introduced the last performance of the opening ceremony.

Legendary hip-hop trio Fugees reunited to celebrate their 25th anniversary with Global Citizen. And with their performance of “Ready or Not” Global Citizen Live a once-in-a-generation moment of global action began its 24-hour mission.

A co-founder of media company Ozy allegedly impersonated a top YouTube executive in an investor call with Goldman Sachs according to a report by The New York Times' media columnist Ben Smith published Sunday.

Ozy operates as a multi-media company which includes a website a podcast branch several newsletters and a festival.

In February four Goldman Sachs investors were slated to speak with Ozy founder Carlos Watson and Alex Piper the head of unscripted programming for YouTube Originals per the investigation by Smith.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The company was gearing up to close a $40 million investment deal with Goldman Sachs at the time and Piper was looped in to testify about Ozy's success.

However right before their Zoom meeting Piper told the investors he was having technical issues and suggested they move to a conference call instead reported Smith. During the conference call Piper spoke glowingly about Ozy and its traffic but investors noticed that his voice sounded strange and ""might have been digitally altered"" wrote the Times.

Someone from the Goldman Sachs team later reached out independently to Piper's assistant at YouTube and the ""confused"" executive told her that they had never spoken to each other before per the Times. The ""Alex Piper"" they heard on their conference call the investors realized had been an impersonator.

YouTube's security team launched an investigation. Several days later Ozy founder Watson came forward to say that the voice in the call had been Samir Rao Ozy's co-founder and chief operating officer reported the Times.

Watson said the impersonation incident was due to Rao's mental health crisis and told the NYT details of the diagnosis. (The Times did not elaborate on what the diagnosis was). He also said that Rao had taken time off from work and was back at Ozy when the Times' report was published wrote Smith.

""Samir is a valued colleague and a close friend"" said Watson. ""I'm proud that we stood by him while he struggled and we're all glad to see him now thriving again.""

Ozy's board said the incident was an ""unfortunate one-time event"" and ""fully supported the way it was handled"" according to the report.

Goldman Sachs didn't take further action after this. Google which owns YouTube had its security team look into the matter. It found that a crime may have been committed and was in contact with the FBI unnamed sources told The Times. The FBI did not independently confirm to The Times that it was investigating the incident however.

The Times report also highlighted discrepancies between Ozy's self-reported traffic reports and what independent sources said. In 2019 Ozy claimed it had 50 million monthly unique users. However public analytics numbers do not comport with that claim. For instance independent analytics company Comscore estimates that Ozy reached around 2.5 million people a month in 2018 which would mean the company had grown its traffic 20x in one year.

In response Watson told the Times that the Comscore numbers were ""incomplete"" and didn't include numbers from social media television or podcasts.

The report also cited several industry experts who cast doubt on Ozy's numbers with one Ozy ex-employee calling the company a ""Potemkin village"" — a facade that conceals a true less desirable identity.

(Full disclosure: Axel Springer which is the majority stake owner of Insider Inc. invested in Ozy in 2014.)

Ozy and Alex Piper did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment.

But when the West Midlands mayor Andy Street formally welcomed Goldman Sachs to Birmingham this month he likened its arrival to one of the summer’s big transfer moves.

“I hope this isn’t inappropriate” he said addressing a crowd of Goldman staff gathered at the city’s newly refurbished Grand Hotel. “I think you probably are the Cristiano Ronaldo moment. You’re the big one to secure.”

Street’s team courted the Wall Street bank for months after hearing in September 2019 it was looking for its first office outside London. Two years later Goldman has hired nearly 100 staff in Birmingham – mostly engineers legal accounting and HR staff – which will serve as the international headquarters for a new and still secret “global digital business” to be revealed by early 2023.

A growing number of professional service firms including banks have been looking outside London as they grow partly to cut labour property and service costs that continue to rise in the capital. Birmingham has already managed to win over HSBC’s ringfenced consumer bank which employs 4000 people locally as well as Deutsche Bank the accounting giants KPMG and PwC and BT which said this month it was expanding its presence in the UK’s second city with plans to hire another 1000 staff.

However despite having 22 universities within an hour’s commute of the city Birmingham – which is based in a region best known for manufacturing – has struggled with the chicken-and-egg issue of wanting to retain professional talent but not having enough lucrative jobs to attract skilled staff.

The UK’s hyper-centralised economy focused on London and the south-east has left it lagging behind countries such as France Germany and the US which have well-established second-tier cities that have helped to offset economic imbalances within their borders. It has made it harder for places like Birmingham to grow as quickly or attract as many businesses that might otherwise look to London first despite Boris Johnson’s “levelling up” agenda.

While Birmingham boasts more than 1.1 million residents the proportion of people working in skilled and professional services – categorised as “knowledge-intensive business services” – is about 11% compared with 24% in London according to the Centre for Cities thinktank. On that measure “Birmingham is not really performing very well at this point” Kathrin Enenkel one of the thinktank’s senior analysts said.

That has made attracting skilled professional services companies a priority for the Midlands mayor. “We’ve got to have these high-paid jobs” Street told the Guardian. And like recruiting a star footballer there are hopes Goldman’s arrival could attract other major players to Birmingham.

“We know that companies particularly those like Goldman Sachs are clustering next to each other” Enenkel said. “So it could be that the presence of Goldman Sachs will attract similar businesses and then maybe Birmingham will become more attractive for graduates who want to settle there.”

That narrative conveniently fits the government’s “levelling up” agenda with the prime minister having promised to raise the level of income in the regions given the gaping chasm on health productivity and skills between greater London and other areas of the UK. Although the government has revealed two pots of funding including a £4.8bn purse to support high street regeneration and plans to create a Treasury campus in Darlington Johnson’s team have yet to reveal any flagship policies to address the gap.

Richard Gnodde the chief executive of Goldman’s international business says the bank received no incentives from Johnson’s government when deciding where to base its new venture. “This is our decision it makes sense for us and it’s very convenient that it ties in with what the government’s trying to achieve” Gnodde said.

That did not stop Street’s team from making their pitch. Street admits that the costs between regional cities is not a strong selling point given the variation outside London is minimal. However he seems to have sold Gnodde on the untapped potential of local engineers and other digitally skilled employees coming from rival firms and local universities. The city’s airport as well as its proximity to London and the north helps even with the completion of HS2 several years away.

But like many cities across the UK the Covid crisis is still threatening Birmingham’s economic prospects. The city’s unemployment rate was last recorded at 8% according to the Office for National Statistics. That is the second-highest unemployment rate for a local authority in the UK behind Barking and Dagenham. Meanwhile Birmingham has the highest number of people on furlough in the country at 30400. That record is partly due to its size but still amounts to 7% of the local workforce which is above the UK average of 5% according to HMRC data.

With furlough set to end this week Paul Forrest a director at the West Midlands Economic Forum is calling for a re-skilling commitment to support local workers. “There’s a lot of people that aren’t going to be re-employed in say hospitality sectors but aren’t fully equipped to enter the production sector of the economy” he said. “So we need to look at some serious training schemes to offset that.”

Street agreed. “There could be more cash devolved to help us deal with the whole question of skills and qualifications which actually – I think – is the long-term determinant of whether we will level up.”

That could prove critical with the mayor claiming that there is already a “big pipeline” of financial services firms eyeing Birmingham and the broader region for their next location.

However Street is keeping his cards close to his chest. “If a company of Goldman’s calibre has examined all the options and has endorsed us that sends a message to the market about who might as well.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC1zZXJ2aWNlcy9nb2xkbWFuLXMtYmFua2VyLXVwcmlzaW5nLXdhcy1pZ25pdGVkLWJ5LXNvbi1vZi10cGctbGVhZGVyLTIwMjEwOTI1LXA1OHVwONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goldman's banker uprising was ignited by son of TPG leader,"The question has gone unanswered for months: Who were the Goldman Sachs bankers who complained so passionately about life on the lower rungs that the firm and its rivals gave raises to legions of rookies?

The bank reportedly plans to shift its Asian investment banking division into its global advisory business a move that would signal the end of the regional strategy pioneered by former CEO Tidjane Thiam.

In 2015 Thiam carved out Asia-Pacific as a dedicated business division with its own investment banking and advisory arm. The intention was to supercharge growth by offering more trading and capital markets products to its Asian billionaire client base.

There are a number of reasons why Credit Suisse is now looking to put its global investment banking business back together. Firstly it’s the next logical next step after CEO Thomas Gottstein created a global investment bank in July 2020 bringing together the former Investment Banking and Capital Markets (IBCM) and Global Markets (GM) divisions as well as Asia Pacific (APAC) markets. The markets division was the investment banking powerhouse in Asia so bringing IBCM into the fold completes this process.

The move will centralize and simplify the bank’s operations. Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio is currently undertaking root-and-branch review of the group’s operations following the losses associated with the collapse of Greensill and Archegos Capital. Horta-Osorio has already revamped and strengthened the risk management function and has hired executives including David Wildermuth from Goldman Sachs Group in July to become chief risk officer.

Change in Asia is long overdue. Thiam’s convoluted structure was both unique among big western banks and difficult to understand. Putting the investment banking and advisory operation back on a global footing will make it easier to manage and also should boost collaboration between regions.

The Asian power-base at Credit Suisse

Dismantling Thiam's structure may not be popular with everyone at Credit Suisse however. The man with the most to lose would seem to be Helman Sitohang the Indonesian group CEO for Asia Pacific who has a big power base and considerable clout.

Sitohang was promoted to run Credit Suisse's Asian business in 2015. He has been a strong advocate of Credit Suisse’s ‘One bank’ strategy using his links with the region’s billionaires to scoop lucrative underwriting and advisory mandates. Sitohang’s rainmaking credentials are widely acknowledged – he is credited with is credited with more than $200 billion in deals and capital-raising in 22 years at the Swiss bank according to Swiss website finews.

But he’s also been close to recent controversial clients of the bank and was one of Lex Greensill’s biggest advocates seeing him as an ideal client – an entrepreneur with touchpoints throughout the bank.

In 2020 the bank generated revenues of Sfr3.1bn in APAC a 4% increase on 2019 but some way short of its best ever performance of Sfr3.8bn which was delivered in 2015 the inaugural year of the new structure. Headcount has risen to 6890 from 6590 over the same period according to the bank’s annual report.

Credit Suisse doesn't provide a break-down of revenues in APAC purely derived from IBCM but has a reporting line called ‘transaction-based revenues’ which covers trading underwriting and M&A advisory. That generated Sfr1.6bn of revenues last year just over half of the total revenues generated in the region.

The bank was ranked fourth by M&A revenues in APAC in the first half of the year compared with first a year ago. In investment banking it was ranked eighth by fees from underwriting and advisory for international business in China down from second a year ago according to data from Dealogic

It's conceivable that very little will change under the new structure. Credit Suisse operates the same matrix structure in Asia Pac as it does other regions with dedicated industry and country heads overseen by regional management –Zeth Hung and Ed Low are co-heads of IBCM for the Asia Pacific region and are expected to continue in their roles. Credit Suisse has also just conducted a revamp of its investment banking line-up in the region making a raft of promotions in a move seen as the bank promoting its next generation of bankers. It is also committed to a big expansion in mainland China where it became a majority shareholder in its joint venture in June 2020 and appointed Janice Hu as CEO in July 2021.

However there will no doubt be savings to be made from stripping out operational management roles. And depending on whether the plan is approved and what is looks like CS’s investment bankers in APAC could have less latitude when it comes to backing clients if the depend on the balance sheet of the investment bank rather than that available in the region.

It remains to be seen what this will mean for pay. As part of a standalone Asia Pacific group IBCM’s bonus pool is dependent on the performance of the regional entity and will have performance criteria linked to the region. Shifting it into the global investment bank could mean bonuses could be measured by different criteria.

Overall the biggest winner from the proposed strategic revamp will be Christian Meissner the CEO of the Investment bank. With Asia added Meissner will have a bigger and more clearly-defined empire. As for Sitohang who along with Gottstein is the only surviving member of the executive board appointed by Thiam at the time of the 2015 restructuring it remains to be seen whether his role will shrink along with his responsibilities.

HAL,Halliburton,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mdXR1cmV1YWUuY29tL2VuLVVTL01haW5wYWdlL0l0ZW0vNjY3MC9tYXJpdGltZS1kaXNwdXRlLWxlYmFub25zLW9wdGlvbnMtZm9yLXJlc3BvbmRpbmctdG8taXNyYWVscy1kZWFsLXdpdGgtaGFsbGlidXJ0b27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Future Center - Lebanon's options for responding to Israel's deal with Halliburton,"US-based oilfield services group Halliburton said on September 14 that it was awarded a contract to drill as many as five wells off the coast of Israel. Halliburton which will conduct the work for London-based Energean will deliver all services including project management production enhancement and subsea services. Halliburton previously executed a four-well campaign at Energean’s Karish and Karish North gas fields offshore Israel.

A part of the Karish gas field is located in the disputed maritime border with Lebanon (See Map 1) but it is still unknown whether Halliburton’s contract includes work in the disputed area. This prompted Lebanon’s permanent representative to the UN Amal Mudallali to submit a letter to both UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Ireland's delegate to the UN Geraldine Byrne Nason the current president of the UN Security Council on the matter. Mudallali called on the UNSC to ""ensure that the drilling evaluation works are not located in a disputed area between Lebanon and Israel in order to avoid any attack on Lebanon's rights and sovereignty” and to ""prevent any future drilling in the disputed areas and to avoid steps that may pose a threat to international peace and security.""





Implications of Israel’s move

It should be noted that Israel’s swiftly moved at this time to accelerate the exploitation of natural gas resources in the disputed area with Lebanon due to the following reasons:

1- Taking advantage of Lebanon’s economic crisis:

Israel’s move is aimed at pushing Lebanon to go back to the US-mediated negotiations at a time when Lebanon is going through an economic crisis. Currently the government led by Najib Mikati is focused on overcoming the crisis.

Development of maritime oil and gas fields will allow Lebanon to achieve energy self-sufficiency and provide income from any exportable surplus. A report issued by Fransbank in July 2017 showed that there is nearly 1.7 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil and 122 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable gas in the Levant Basin of which part of each is found in Lebanon estimated at USD254 billion two times and a half the amount of Lebanon’s public debt which reached USD97 billion in late April 2021 according to data released by the central bank of Lebanon.

2- Pressuring Lebanon to return to negotiations:

Former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a visit to Lebanon in March 2019 succeeded in reviving the stalled negotiations between Israel and Lebanon. Four rounds of talks were held between the two countries from October 14 2019 to early December 2020. In October 2020 the talks resulted in an agreement between Lebanon and Israel to a framework for the talks aimed at drawing up their maritime border. The fifth and last round of talks was held in April 2021.

The fifth round of talks was supposed to discuss an area of 860 square kilometers of the Mediterranean Sea based on a map sent to the United Nations in 2011. In the map Lebanon claimed its border according to Point 23 agreed through a committee with members from Hezbollah and the Free Patriotic Movement led by President Michel Aoun. Later Lebanon said that the map was based on wrong estimates and claimed an additional area of 1430 square kilometers that includes parts of the Karish field in which a Greek company is working on behalf of Israel. Lebanon’s proposal became to be known as Line 29 (See Map 2). Israel accused Lebanon of obstructing the talks by claiming an expanded disputed area especially because that line will run through a part of Israel’s Karish field within Lebanon’s maritime border.

3- Attempting to impose a fait accompli:

Israel perceives three options for Lebanon to deal with the crisis. They are the US mediation which continues to date although the talks between Lebanon and Israel stopped on April 5 2021; seeking a settlement to the maritime dispute through an international arbitration committee; or referring the issue to the International Court of Justice which requires agreement from both Lebanon and Israel.

The attempts might well result in nothing more than a waste of time at a time when Israel is working on imposing a fait accompli by continuing drilling and production operations. This is especially so because a consortium made up of France’s Total Italy’s ENI and Russia’s Novatek has not yet started exploration in Bloc 9 on the Lebanese side of the maritime border which is several months behind schedule. The southern border of this block is the cause of dispute between Israel and Lebanon.

4- Preempting Mikati’s Moves:

Israel recognized the importance of preemption through placing pressure on the new Lebanese government whose statement provided for resumption of talks to protect Lebanon’s maritime border. The move is aimed at preventing renewed discussion of amending Decree No. 6433 which adopted Line 29 instead of Line 23 for demarcating the maritime border with Israel.

Tel Aviv categorically rejected the move. The development prompted the then-US Under Secretary for Political Affairs David Hale to visit Lebanon in April 2021 to pressure President Aoun away from approving Decree No. 6433. President Aoun gave in especially because approval of the decree would spark a constitutional crisis. That is amending the decree requires the government to hold a meeting to give its approval which then was not possible because a caretaker government was running the country. Now however the Mikati government can pass this decree.

































































Lebanon’s three options

Beirut has three options for responding to Tel Aviv’s recent agreement with Halliburton. These can be outlined as follows:

1- Engaging in US-brokered negotiations:

The United States can step in again to pressure both countries to stop mutual escalation especially because it is not clear yet whether Halliburton will work in the disputed area or not. Washington might also place pressure on both Lebanon and Israel to resume direct talks.

2- Diplomatic Escalation through the United Nations:

Such a move would not yield any results especially because there are assessments reflecting a belief that Halliburton’s drilling operations will be kept away from the disputed area (according to Line 23). Therefore submitting a complaint to the United Nations will only yield routine resolutions urging Lebanon and Israel to engage in negotiations to resolve their border dispute through peaceful means. Moreover there will be no obligation for Tel Aviv to stop foreign companies from operating close to its coastline. But even if Lebanon amends and submits Decree No. 6433 to the United Nations and proves that Halliburton is operating in a disputed area this issue will have to be settled either through US-mediated negotiations an international arbitration committee or the International Court of Justice.

3- Lebanon’s pressure on foreign companies:

Lebanon’s successive governments failed over the years to benefit from the oil and gas resources in the Mediterranean although Lebanon signed an agreement with the Total-ENI-Novatek consortium in February 2018 for oil and gas exploration in Block 9 the southern part of which lies in the contested area with Israel.

In response to Israel’s awarding of drilling contacts Speaker of Lebanon’s Parliament Nabih Berri accused the international consortium of failing to begin drilling and exploration operations so as Lebanon can benefit from its oil and gas resources and prevent Israel from imposing a fait accompli on Lebanon.

To conclude the timing of Israel’s move to renegotiate the maritime border dispute with Lebanon reflects Tel Aviv’s willingness to finalize the border demarcation with Beirut and push the United States to pressure Lebanon to sit at the negotiating table with Israel over Line 23 instead of Line 29. Moreover from an Israeli viewpoint the deterioration of Lebanon’s economy will guarantee that this goal will be achieved especially because the involved international companies operating in Lebanon have not yet launched development operations in Block 9.",,,,,,,,,,,,

By Ronni Newton

Lucas DiCesare asked Eric Hogarth to push him higher and still higher on the swing of his new backyard playscape Thursday afternoon in West Hartford.

Lucas 6 a first-grader at Braeburn Elementary School was home Thursday morning and playing with Hogarth a partner with Johnson Brunetti Retirement and Investment Specialists for a special occasion.

Hogarth and representatives from Make-A-Wish Connecticut were formally presenting him with a new backyard playscape as well as a “Polar Express” train set that would fit on his existing train tracks and a puzzle – so he could have fun when he has to play inside on rainy or snowy days.

After opening the other gifts Lucas didn’t waste any time showing Hogarth and reporters his new playscape surrounded by blue mulch. Blue is Lucas’ favorite color and after the playscape was installed his dad painted the tree house blue in time for the presentation.

Lucas and his parents Monica and Paul DiCesare moved to West Hartford from Brooklyn NY in the summer of 2020. They had started the process of coordinating a wish for Lucas when they were still in New York on the advice of their pediatrician but at that time they were considering a trip. Then COVID hit and they moved.

Hogarth said he has three young children as well including a 6-year-old daughter.

“We’ve as a company been involved with Make-A-Wish for a long time” Hogarth said. “It’s an honor to be able to do it. … I can’t think of a better thing to be able to do” he said.

It was a big adjustment to move during COVID. “Having something like a playscape allowing him to get outside more it was an important thing for us to have on the property” Paul DiCesare said.

“One of his favorite things to do when we lived in Brooklyn was go to the playground” Monica DiCesare said. While they have more space here having his own playscape gives him a chance to play with other neighborhood kids in his own yard. “He’s a very social kid” she added.

Monica DiCesare said Lucas has been through a lot emotion clearly evident in her voice as she recalled that he spent a good part of his first year in the hospital and they didn’t know if he would walk. “Fortunately he can and he loves doing active things and playing.”

Lucas’ extended his friendly and outgoing manner to Hogarth and the news media on hand at the presentation and he was very determined to have Hogarth come inside the house to help set up the train set and meet his cat – noting that he could come inside because he was wearing a mask.

“Thank you for making my wish come true” Lucas said as he presented a plaque to Hogarth and gave him a high-five.

“Kids are the best kids love life. They are just excited to have fun and play” Hogarth said.

Its closure brings new opportunity,"In 2011 a rare October nor’easter dumped more than a foot of wet heavy snow on the state and thrust a group of homeless men in work therapy onto the front lines.

A crush of people without lights or heat descended on wood yards around the state including one on Maxim Road in Hartford where recently incarcerated and unsheltered men worked splitting and stacking firewood to get acclimated to life at the Open Hearth shelter.

As supervisor David Knighton a former shelter resident who got his first job in the wood yard helped manage the chaotic scene he saw just how far he’d come since his younger days selling drugs in the same community.

“Working at Open Hearth I’ve been in situations now where I feel like I’m a help. I’m helping in this world” Knighton said last week as he reflected on the permanent closure of the wood yard after more than 50 years on Maxim Road and a total of 136 years in the city.

An original program of the Open Hearth which was founded in 1884 the wood yard was shut down last year to prevent the spread of the coronavirus among staff and shelter residents.

The nonprofit decided this year to end the work therapy program for good in order to focus resources on its Working Man’s Center which provides a range of health education and employment services including counseling substance abuse recovery and job search training to current and former shelter residents.

With the wood yard shuttered the Working Man’s Center didn’t skip a beat. It continued helping residents secure identification documents prepare resumes and pursue certifications in high-demand job skills like food safety and forklift operation.

And if the there was one bright spot to be found in the pandemic it was an increased demand for workers. Employers who previously wouldn’t consider applicants with criminal records or bad credit were suddenly hiring men through the Open Hearth.

While the health crisis is finally waning Open Hearth Executive Director Marilyn Rossetti says it didn’t make financial sense to reopen such an expensive operation as the wood yard which required the nonprofit to carry high levels of insurance coverage.

Firewood sales barely supported the program which was essentially a relic from a time when charitable organizations in most major cities including New Haven Philadelphia and Boston offered temporary work to homeless laborers in exchange for lodging and meals.

“You could say the wood yard was a vestige of the Victorian era when the (Open Hearth) started in a church basement and people were growing their own vegetables” said social worker Stephen Haynes the program director of the Working Man’s Center.

It also required Rossetti a Democrat on Hartford’s city council to maintain a working knowledge of all things timber from the laws of transporting wood over state lines to the names of tree-destroying pests like the Asian long-horned beetle and Emerald ash borer.

A 2011 photo shows from left Robert Pressey Kenneth Lambert and Jeff Butler load cut and cured firewood into a truck at Open Hearth’s wood yard in Hartford.

Rossetti thought of the time she could be spending on fundraising and developing programs and the time the staff could be spending on case management and more modern employment efforts. The wood yard once a powerful tool for fostering pride and work ethic had to go she said.

“Times change and if you don’t change with the times you get left behind” Rossetti said. “Employment is such a big part of what we do so let’s do it in a way that’s more efficient more timely. It doesn’t mean hard work isn’t still important and instilled but we’re doing it in a way that works.”

Residents still gain on-the-job experience through Open Hearth Works a social enterprise started in 2016 to provide work crews for maintenance cleaning snow removal and other jobs.

On Tuesday Knighton oversaw an Open Hearth Works team cleaning up the old Fuller Brush Co. factory complex in Hartford’s North End.

David Knighton of Open Hearth Works clears debris from behind the former Fuller Brush Co. building in Hartford. Knighton a former shelter resident at Open Hearth who got his start in the now-shuttered wood-yard work therapy program now oversees crews of current and former shelter residents through Open Hearth Works which provides workers for maintenance cleaning and other jobs.

While it’s a nonprofit Open Hearth Works helps raise revenue for the shelter and its programs while meeting the organization’s mission: providing transitional jobs to men with felony records limited experience and bad work history. The first job helps them get a second ideally somewhere they can build a career.

To give residents the best chance of success Open Hearth restricts them from job searching for up to a month during which staff help sort out complex barriers to employment — like acquiring birth certificates from Puerto Rico — and start to address issues of substance abuse and mental illness.

But the philosophy is still the same as in those 19th century wood yards work rooms and laundries: placing purpose above profit.

An 1893 report on the “International Congress of Charities Correction and Philanthropy” described the belief that working could “become the open doors to new lives of self-respect and self-support.”

That was true in Hartford for Knighton who was assigned to the wood yard program upon his release from prison after serving about 18 years.

He appreciated working outside using tools and learning to operate the wood processor and forklift. The daily routine and responsibilities were stabilizing. He spent a year living at Open Hearth but even after he completed the wood yard program and got a job at Dunkin’ Donuts he kept visiting the place where he got his start.

A December 2000 photo shows Choice Muhamed pound a last stick into a tight fitting bundle of kindling at the Open Hearth firewood yard. At the time the yard was selling about 1100 cords of wood each year through a combination of drive-up sales and home delivery.

When there was an opening for a driver Knighton jumped at the chance to return to the yard as an employee.

It was a place of camaraderie and mentorship from Abdul-Shahid Muhammad Ansari the former shelter director who spent years overseeing the firewood operation. Ansari who died in May 2020 held his crew to high moral standards which Knighton says he still lives by.

“I try to do right because he was the one that seen the most in me when I probably wasn’t seeing it in myself” he said.

Knighton a father of four eventually became the wood yard supervisor. When the program was shut down last year he began supervising the nonprofit’s associate counselors. He is also a case manager and the director of operations for Open Hearth Works and he shows up to the shelter early most days in case a resident needs someone to talk to over breakfast.

In another year Knighton’s time in prison will be surpassed by his career with Open Hearth “working with guys like myself showing them that change is possible.”

He’s not sad to see the wood yard go either. While the program gave him his start the jobs he oversees through Open Hearth Works do the same for shelter residents. But these jobs can provide something in addition to pride: a paycheck.

“While the wood yard was great at the time we’re moving forward” he said. “We can help the men help themselves.”

The sold-out event was a major success for the artists who played it as well as for the organization it benefits.

Founded in 1985 the longest-running live concert benefit was missing one of its founders this year as Neil Young opted to skip the Hartford show due to Covid concerns. Young’s presence was felt however as several artists covered his music. Micah Nelson’s band Particle Kid did a nice take on “After the Gold Rush” and Margo Price sporting a Neil Young t-shirt rocked through the classic “Homegrown” with help from Micah and Lukas Nelson.

Additional highlights were everywhere. Newcomer Alison Russell played an inspiring set centered around the theme of how she overcame the odds and escaped childhood abuse. Margo Price made a clear statement covering Leslie Gore’s “You Don’t Own Me” Ian Mellencamp and his band covered a sweet version of “Shallow” and Lukas Nelson and the Promise of the Real tore through a set of rock and roll undoubtedly inspired by Young who the band backed on previous tours.

Among the more recognized artists Bettye Lavette played a soulful set of mostly covers re-imagining songs like Ringo Starr’s “It Don’t Come Easy” Dylan’s “Things Have Changed” and The Beatles’ “Blackbird.” Nathanial Rateliff and the Night Sweats shook things up with favorites like “S.O.B.” and “Hey Mama.” And John Mellencamp worked through a crowd-pleasing set of hits including “Small Town” “Rain on the Scarecrow” and his closer “Pink Houses.”

Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds went acoustic re-interpreting some of their classics included “Bartender” “Save Me” and “Ants Marching.” The closing act was the legendary Willie Nelson who at age 88 played a longer set than anyone else at the Festival! Accompanied by his sons Micah and Lukas Nelson worked through numerous classics including “You Were Always on My Mind” “On the Road Again” and “Georgia On My Mind.” Quite a treat for those present.

That's according to the job description attached to several listings for new roles. The studio just referred to as ""New Raleigh-Durham Studio"" will be making a G.I. Joe game as its first project.

The job ads call it a ""AAA 3rd Person Action/Adventure game"" as well as confirming it will be multi-platform. Qualifications mentioned in the listings for four roles (technical director art director lead game designer and lead animator) ask for experience with the Unreal engine as well as knowledge of broad videogame elements like ""progression"" and ""exploration mechanics"".

A third-person action game seems like a decent fit for G.I. Joe though I think it would be perfect for a turn-based tactics game where you take over Cobra Island with a squad of specialists who unlike XCOM grunts all have established skills and personalities—wait I think I just invented Jagged Alliance.

During a Hasbro investor event earlier this year Wizards of the Coast president Chris Cocks talked about ""leveraging some perennial Hasbro favorites with an eye towards developing them digitally"" saying ""We will bring these brands to digital life and develop experiences that resonate with the lifestyle gamer in ways that are new fresh and provocative.""

They’re back big time. Three of the big four banks are back – while Wells Fargo keeps getting slapped on the wrist – after all four were out of it last year due to pandemic-rated financial restrictions. Intel fell out of it. But the rest of Big Tech is in and Apple bigger than ever. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway after rightfully dissing share buybacks for years has become one of the largest share buyback queens. And Charter Communications has jumped into it massively.

The top 10 companies – ranked by their cumulative buybacks over the past five years – bought back more of their shares than ever in Q2: $85 billion according to S&P Dow Jones Indices this week accounting for 43% of the total share buybacks by all S&P 500 companies. Since 2014 these 10 companies bought back $1.13 trillion of their own shares.

The two surges in the chart below – first after the corporate tax cuts in 2017 and second after Q2 2020 – quadrupled the quarterly rate of share buybacks for these 10 companies from around $20 billion a quarter in the four years through 2017 to $85 billion in Q2 (data via YCharts.com):

Top 10 Companies Share Buybacks in Billion $ Q2 2021 12 months 5-year total 1 Apple [AAPL] 25.6 89.7 334.1 2 Alphabet [GOOG] 12.8 40.0 87.7 3 Facebook [FB] 8.4 19.2 51.1 4 Oracle [ORCL] 8.0 21.6 93.8 5 Microsoft [MSFT] 7.2 27.4 92.4 6 JPMorgan [JPM] 6.2 11.0 81.5 7 Berkshire Hathaway [BRK.A] 6.0 30.5 43.5 8 BofA [BAC] 4.2 8.1 78.5 9 Charter Comm. [CHTR] 3.5 14.9 42.8 10 Union Pacific [UNP] 3.1 5.2 28.1

Rounding out the top 20 are in that order: Lowe’s Home Depot Morgan Stanley P&G Citigroup Walmart HCA Healthcare Visa Chubb and Mastercard. Wells Fargo and Intel which used to be in the Top 10 have fallen off the list entirely.

In total 294 of the S&P 500 companies reported buybacks in Q2 of at least $5 million down from 335 companies in Q1 2021. But the top 10 did the lion’s share of buying.

Combined they bought back $199 billion of their own shares in Q2 the fourth largest amount ever behind the records in the three quarters through Q1 2019 following the corporate tax cuts (blue columns in the chart below).

Since the beginning of 2012 the S&P 500 companies have bought back nearly $5.5 trillion of their own shares with the top 10 share buyback queens accounting for 25% of it.

But in recent years this has gotten a lot more top heavy. In Q2 2021 the top 10 accounted for 43%.

But without the Top 10 share buyback queens the share buybacks by the remaining 284 companies amounted to only $114 billion (red line) roughly flat with Q1 and below most quarters in prior years – that’s how top-heavy this scheme has become:

Even today as crazy as this sounds the $5.5 trillion that the S&P 500 companies incinerated on buying back their own shares is a lot of money. They could have been invested in expansion projects in the US and in labor in the US rather than in cheap labor overseas and in training or god forbid the companies could have tried to somewhat less aggressively dodge US income taxes and pay a little more given that the US government deficit has been horrendous for years and has become more horrendous with the corporate tax cut of 2017 and has become a lot more horrendous starting in March 2020

Along with share buybacks comes the corporate debt and it has ballooned as many companies borrowed heavily to fund the share buybacks.

Nonfinancial corporate debt (bonds and loans outstanding owed by companies other than lenders) spiked in the first half of 2020 and in Q2 reached a new record of $11.2 trillion having soared by 73% over the past eight years. The $5.5 trillion incinerated on share buybacks played a large role in creating this debt:

The primary purpose of share buybacks is to undo the dilution of their EPS metric that occurs due to massive executive stock-based compensation packages. These share buybacks hide the cost of stock-based compensation on EPS; and many of those share buybacks are funded with debt but debt doesn’t impact EPS.

In terms of actually lowering the share count: Only 5.4% of the companies that did share buybacks reduced their share count by at least 4% year-over-year according to S&P. This 5.4% share was down from a 17.8% share a year ago and from the 28.2% share in Q1 2016.

Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management

Larry Robbins is a hedge fund manager and CEO of Glenview Capital Management. He is also well known for his quarterly letters to investors.

He began his career as an analyst at Gleacher and Company an M&A firm. Later Robbins spent six years running long/short strategies for Leon Cooperman at Omega Advisors.

In 2001 Robbins started Glenview Capital Management. The firm runs several hedge funds and long-only funds. The Glenview Capital Partners fund invests in equities and bonds and holds both long and short positions. The Glenview Opportunity funds invest opportunistically in equities only. In 2015 the firm launched a long-only fund to invest in healthcare stocks. Despite several losing streaks the flagship fund returned 15% annually between 2000 to 2013.

Robbins is a former ice hockey player and captained the University of Pennsylvania club team for three years. He is now the owner of the Chicago Steel of the United States Hockey League.

Robbins has built a personal fortune of $2.3 billion and often uses his vast resources to support several education-focused charities. Robbins is on the boards of the Knowledge is Power Program The Robin Hood Foundation and Teach for America.

Thematic Investing

Robbins has been described as a ‘Growth at a Reasonable Price’ (GARP) investor and as a ‘multi-strategy investor’. He’s said that he backs companies with predictable cash flows and recurring revenue streams.

Larry Robbin backs himself and often holds positions for significant periods even when those positions move against him. As a result he has earned a reputation for experiencing persistent winning and losing streaks.

When one looks at the stocks he has invested in over the years it’s clear that Robbins follows themes. Healthcare stocks have increasingly dominated his portfolio over the years. He has also invested in technology and consumer discretionary stocks and to a lesser extent utilities.

While Robbins is not an activist investor he does voice his opinions when it comes to some of his largest positions. In fact he has said he would rather be ‘suggestivist’ than activist. In this way he has been instrumental in bringing about corporate action at Tenet (NYSE: THC) and Community Health Systems (NYSE: CYH).

Robbins began building positions in healthcare stocks after President Bush signed the Medicare Modernization Act in 2004. His bets in the healthcare sector increased again with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act. Unlike many on Wall Street Robbins was a supporter of Obamacare.

Over the years he has held large positions in Tenet Healthcare Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO) Humana (NYSE: HUM) McKesson Corporation and Community Health Systems. On the whole these stocks have generated strong returns but have also contributed to losses and underperformance along the way.

In 2008 the long/short fund lost 50 percent in 2011 it lost money again and in 2015 it was down more than 18%. Robbins felt so bad about the 2015 losses that he vowed not to take any fees until he had made the money back.

The fund does tend to bounce back from these losing periods with strong returns. In 2009 it was up 82% and in 2013 it returned 84%. Robbins appeared to be back on a winning streak as his fund was up 14.8% in the first half of 2017.

Glenview Capital Management's Latest Form 13F Filing

On November 14th 2017 Larry Robbins' firm Glenview Capital Management filed their quarterly Form 13F regulatory filing. I reviewed the 13F filing to review holdings in Glenview Capital Management's large portfolio.

The hedge fund's stock portfolio totals $15.5 billion according to the latest filing. The list value of stock holdings is up 0.7% when compared to the last quarter. As a benchmark the S&P 500 was up 3.9% over the same period.

Quarter-over-Quarter Turnover (QoQ Turnover) measures the level of trading activity in a portfolio. Glenview Capital Management's QoQ Turnover for the latest quarter was 25.9% so the firm appears to trade a significant percent of its portfolio each quarter.

Glenview Capital Management's Largest Holdings

The Ideas section of finbox.io tracks top investors and trending investment themes. You can get the latest data on the holdings discussed below at the Larry Robbins page. The following table summarizes his firm's largest holdings reported in the last filing:

Glenview Capital Management Largest Holdings Ticker Name Holding ($mil) % Of Portfolio HCA HCA HEALTHCARE INC $1206.3 7.8% DWDP DOWDUPONT INC $1124.2 7.2% FMC FMC CORP $1046.8 6.7% SHPG SHIRE PLC $898.8 5.8% IQV IQVIA Holdings Inc. $848.2 5.5% ANTM ANTHEM INC $722.0 4.7% DXC DXC TECHNOLOGY CO $671.6 4.3%

The seven positions above represent 42.0% of the hedge fund's total portfolio. Four of the seven largest positions are also in the healthcare sector making up 23.8% of the portfolio. The most recent filing showed a total of 49 positions.

Glenview Capital Management's 5 Largest Purchases

I also used finbox.io to find Glenview Capital Management's largest buys last quarter. Here's the list of the biggest stock purchases determined by comparing the last two filings:

Glenview Capital Management 5 Largest Purchases Ticker Name Purchased ($mil) % Of Portfolio SHPG SHIRE PLC $634.9 5.8% ZBH ZIMMER BIOMET HL... $279.1 2.4% MCK MCKESSON CORP $235.5 2.7% CVS CVS HEALTH CORP $111.3 0.7% DNB DUN & BRADSTREET... $93.7 1.4%

Three of the hedge fund's 5 biggest stock buys in the quarter were in the healthcare sector.

Glenview Capital Management's Most Undervalued Holdings

To determine which stocks are trading below their intrinsic value aka ""fair value"" I used the finbox.io Fair Value estimates. I also wanted to blend in some indication of which stocks might be ready to make a move up soon because they're popular with Wall Street analysts.

I calculated an average using the finbox.io fair value upside and analyst upside to create a blended upside which I then used to rank the most undervalued holdings.

Here are the top 7 stocks based on my calculations:

Glenview Capital Management Most Undervalued Holdings Ticker Name Upside (finbox.io) Upside (Analyst Target) Blend Upside BKD BROOKDALE SR LIV... 63.1% 41.8% 52.5% SHPG SHIRE PLC 25.5% 45.1% 35.3% VER VEREIT INC 33.1% 23.3% 28.2% MTOR MERITOR INC 33.3% 14.9% 24.1% RLGY REALOGY HLDGS CORP 21.9% 23.8% 22.8% HCA HCA HEALTHCARE INC 43.5% 1.1% 22.3% CBS CBS CORP NEW 25.0% 17.3% 21.1%

Note that Shire plc (NasdaqGS: SHPG) is one of Larry Robbins' largest positions and one that he's most recently been adding to. This is most likely because the current share price appears to be trading a large discount to intrinsic value.

source: finbox.io

Shire is a biotechnology company focused on serving people with rare diseases and other specialized conditions worldwide. The company offers products in therapeutic areas including hematology genetic diseases neuroscience immunology internal medicine ophthalmology and oncology. The company markets its products through wholesalers distribution centers and pharmacies. Shire was founded in 1986 and is based in Dublin Ireland.

Shares of the company are down -7.6% over the last month implying that there may be a buying opportunity. The stock last traded at $147.78 as of Friday January 26th and 10 separate valuation analyses imply that there is 25.5% upside relative to its current trading price. Wall Street's price target of $213.93 is even more bullish implying +40% upside.

Steven Cohen is also a notable investor in the company. His fund currently holds a position worth $32.1 million. If you haven't heard of billionaire Steven Cohen you may already know a little about him if you've watched Showtime's hit series Billions. Investing morality aside Cohen's real-life results are undeniable. He was the third highest-earning hedge fund manager of 2012 when he made $1.4 billion. No doubt Cohen is expecting big gains from his long position in Shire.

Illustrious money manager Leon Cooperman in another notable investor that currently owns 653977 shares of SHPG which represents 4.0% of his fund's stock portfolio.

Managers with more than $100 million in qualifying assets under management are required to disclose their holdings to the SEC each quarter via 13F filings. Qualifying assets include long positions in U.S. equities and ADRs call/put options and convertible debt securities. Shorts cash positions foreign investments and other assets are not included. It is important to note that these filings are due 45 days after the quarter end date. Therefore Glenview Capital Management's holdings above represent positions held as of September 30th and not necessarily reflective of the fund's current stock holdings.

However most can agree that with thousands of stocks traded on U.S. exchanges doing thorough research on each one is nearly impossible for smaller investors. Leveraging the resources of the largest hedge funds on Wall Street can be a powerful way to narrow down the list.

As of this writing I did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities and this is not a buy or sell recommendation on any security mentioned.",,,,,,,,,

Hershey 71 credits a few different factors to his longevity: the support of wife Shelley and his two daughters Kaehla and Leah and more abstractly his love of color and enduring sense of wonder.

“I think one of the things that’s really key to my whole situation is that I’ve been able to continue to have wonder and joy in my work” says Hershey of Manheim Township. “I’ve always had a delight in making things.”

To celebrate his four decades of making art Hershey has released a book titled “Paintings: 2006-2021.” The book includes dozens of stunning high-quality images of Hershey’s paintings from the past 15 years; shots of Hershey at work in his studio; images of Hershey’s notebooks detailing his creative process; an inventive and enlightening essay by Jonathan Frederick Walz curator of American art at the Columbus Museum in Columbus Georgia; and a glowing note from Willow Street-based collector Barbara Moss who owns about 20 pieces of Hershey’s work.

“What really draws me to Jerry’s paintings is the tremendous energy they generate through the combination of color and line and light” says Moss 64. “To wake up to that energy every morning is an enormously energizing experience.”

Taken as a whole the 15-year span of collected works featured in “Paintings: 2006-2021” functions almost as a single work. In the same way that almost any segment of a single Hershey painting develops slowly and logically yet surprisingly into the next segment one painting from the book transitions to the next.

“I don’t start an idea (for a series) unless I think I can work on it for years” Hershey says. “I almost never finish a big painting in less than a month. So I know that when I start it it’s a real time commitment.”

‘Simple complexity’

Hershey takes an orderly approach to his work which he calls “painterly minimalism.” First he develops and employs a set of highly systematic methods specifying color schemes inside of set patterns and grids and then allows intuition to come into play.

“I think about a lot of things when I’m making work and then I try not to think about a lot of things” Hershey says. “I use this term ‘simple complexity’ ... and the idea is that at a glance to the viewer who doesn’t really want to invest time looking the paintings might look very simple but to somebody that cares to look there’s obviously an awful lot going on.”

To the casual viewer Hershey’s work with his penchant for colorful patterns and use of gradients might resemble autostereogram images – commonly known as “magic eye” pictures – and in some sense they do work that way. Don’t expect a hidden 3D image of a Tyrannosaurus rex riding a skateboard to suddenly appear but the paintings will reward the viewer who gazes deeply at them relaxes and invites their enigmatic almost telepathic messages to slowly reveal themselves. The rich colors and ever-changing patterns speak in a language beyond words.

In this way Hershey’s abstractions are ultra-realistic – like how the seemingly simple but actually infinitely complex colors and patterns occurring naturally in Lancaster County fields just exist and are beyond some underlying meaning. The juxtaposing colors and morphing patterns in Hershey’s work seem to say that life is simply meant to be experienced not over-analyzed and any meaning to be found is something deeply personal.

All of this isn’t to say that the paintings don’t contain references to Hershey’s lived experience; they do. But what they mean to Hershey isn’t totally necessary to the viewer’s appreciation and understanding of the work; it’s just another layer.

“My sense of that is that a painting should speak for itself” Hershey says. “It’s either a good painting or not. When you look at it it should be compelling enough to make you cross the room and look at it more closely. There should be surprises and elements that are revealed at every stage of viewing.”

Take Hershey’s “Tribute” series of paintings for example. Without context a viewer can appreciate the interaction of warm and cool tones the gradients that rise to a climatic flash and descend and the interlocking double helix-like patterns that create a tight-knit cohesive web extending over the birch plywood surface with its still-visible grain. Then the viewer learns these paintings were made to honor Hershey’s late father – a Boy Scout leader and consummate woodworker.

“When you find out that the painting references the guy’s father and it has to do with Boy Scout imagery that should be the icing on the cake” Hershey says.

Color fields

“Paintings: 2006-2021” culminates with Hershey’s most recent works: the “Fields” series.

“I’m really excited about the work that I’m doing” Hershey says. “The paintings I’ve been doing particularly since the pandemic are the best paintings that I’ve ever done.”

The “Fields” series condenses Hershey’s entire lived experience from his friends and family to his previous artist endeavors and his surroundings into these images. Hershey nods to his early work the influence of the pioneers of the mid-20th century art movement known as color field painting as well as the influence of the late Lancaster County-based abstract painter and friend Warren Rohrer.

“Of all the people that I’ve met Warren Rohrer is the shining example of what an artist and person can be” Hershey says. “His work is so beautiful but he was such a good guy too. He grew up in a very conservative Mennonite family. Everybody in his family either became a minister or a farmer and he combined spirituality and his love of the land in his work.”

The series also visually references the sublime beauty of Lancaster County landscapes and the highly patterned Amish quilts.

“What’s going on naturally or through the cultivation of the land is so beautiful that it’s difficult not to show up in your work one way or another” Hershey says.

The works in the “Fields” series are as Hershey notes in the introduction to “Paintings: 2006-2021” a return to the kind of nonreferential paintings he was making in the early 1970s.

“There is no underlying meaning or narrative in this work.” Hershey writes in the book. “Only color and mark making choices within prescribed processes or systems exploring painterly language and multiple reads.”

Light in darkness

The most recent paintings in the “Fields” series were created in 2020-21 and a couple even directly reference the COVID-19 pandemic and other recent events.

“Fields # 14 (2020: a portrait)” features a series of horizontal black and blue bands on top of an underpainting featuring a graduation of yellow to red bands. And some of the brighter colors bleed through the darker elements of the painting. The painting is meant to reference the Black Lives Matter movement and as Hershey explains in a video on his website the two colors he most associates with 2020: black and blue.

Another painting from the series “Fields # 11 (despite the pandemic)” features an intricate blending of brightly colored hand-drawn brushstrokes over a subtle gridlike structure.

These paintings employ a signature feature of Hershey’s work: optimism in the face of darkness.

One of Hershey’s favorite paintings an earlier work from 2008 titled “Mist” accomplishes this particularly well. “Mist” which is a part of the Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health collection (and a nod to the Jackson Pollock painting “Lavender Mist”) references a literal brush with death that Hershey experienced during a foggy bike ride one morning when he was nearly hit by a car. (The car brushed his jacket he says.) The title could also be a playful pun on “missed.” None of that story is necessarily evident in the painting but the spirit of it does somehow seep through.

“It’s about how fragile our existence really is” Hershey says. “So that painting has to do with the fog and the mist of that morning and then on the right side of it the colors become a lot brighter so there’s a sense of optimism. My paintings have a lot of optimism.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGV3Ym9vbS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8yNi9oZXJzaGV5cy1kZWJ1dHMtbmV3LXJlZXNlcy1wZWFudXQtYnJpdHRsZS1mbGF2b3JlZC1jdXBzLWFzLXBhcnQtb2YtMjAyMS1ob2xpZGF5LWNhbmR5LWxpbmV1cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hershey’s Debuts New Reese's Peanut Brittle Flavored Cups As Part Of 2021 Holiday Candy Lineup,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.chewboom.com/2021/09/26/hersheys-debuts-new-reeses-peanut-brittle-flavored-cups-as-part-of-2021-holiday-candy-lineup/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGV3Ym9vbS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8yNi9oZXJzaGV5cy1kZWJ1dHMtbmV3LXJlZXNlcy1wZWFudXQtYnJpdHRsZS1mbGF2b3JlZC1jdXBzLWFzLXBhcnQtb2YtMjAyMS1ob2xpZGF5LWNhbmR5LWxpbmV1cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbm5saXZlLmNvbS9nYWxsZXJpZXMvMldRS1lOSFJFWkRaVk1WREJNTU8zM1dDTVkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Palmyra defeats Milton Hershey 35-14 in high school football - pennlive.com,"40 / 42

Local and state dignitaries and representatives from Hilton will break ground Saturday on the five-story hotel at a ceremony that has already reached its maximum capacity of 75 guests. Among the speakers will be Marcus Frisco Tru by Hilton Franchisee and CEO of Matticus Hospitality Group Inc.

The franchise was first created in 2016 by Hilton as a way to provide upscale lodging at affordable prices said Frisco.

Although there is a Courtyard by Marriott hotel across Vineyard Avenue in Financial Plaza Frisco said he does not believe his hotel will struggle to fill its 88 rooms. Tru by Hilton appeals to younger customers not drawn to other hotel chains.

“It has a great feel for today’s traveler” Frisco said. “If you see it you’ll see that it is definitely not as conforming as most hotels have been historically.”

Frisco said the hotel combines the retail and hospitality industries. Located in the shopping center with Food 4 Less the hotel will sit next to a gym grocery store and a gas station. The hotel itself will have a roof top lounge and a pool.

The nearby Esplanade center offers a number of stores and restaurants. Also a hotel shuttle will transport guests back and forth from The Collection across the 101 Freeway.

Oxnard Councilman Gabe Teran who represents District 2 where the hotel will be located said the hotel could attract more visitors to the city especially during festivals events and the summer when the Dallas Cowboys are in town at their training camp.

“I’m always happy to see economic development happening in our city” Teran said. “Whether it's in my district or another district it’s all for the benefit of Oxnard.”

Directly behind the future site of the hotel is a Union Pacific Railroad Company track. Frisco said insulated windows and walls will cancel the noise from any train traffic. The railway company has also agreed to designate the area as a quiet area or a No Blow Zone according to Frisco.

Scott Kolwitz Oxnard planning and environmental services manager said Frisco had to apply for a special-use permit to build the hotel within a shopping center. The permit was reviewed and approved by both the city’s Planning Commission and Oxnard City Council.

The new hotel will be built over on an existing 9120 square-foot pad; however the hotel will have a combined square footage of 41422 across all five of its stories according to Planning Commission documents.

The ground breaking ceremony will kick off at 11 a.m. Saturday next to the Gold’s Gym on Esplanade Drive.

While the Hotels.com Rewards program may not have much of a wow factor it certainly thrives -- and I suspect it attracts thousands of customers -- with its simplicity. Book 10 nights through the website or app (you must be logged in to your account) and you'll earn one free night with a value equivalent to the average cost of your 10 paid nights (excluding taxes and fees).

This means you're looking at a roughly 10% return on your hotel stays which is better than what you'd get as a non-elite traveler booking with most major hotel chains.

You can earn a free night with 10 one-night stays a single booking of 10 nights or any combination leading to 10 nights. Once you reach 10 nights you'll have a free night which you can apply at checkout. You can earn multiple free nights by continuing to book with Hotels.com though. In particular you'll earn a free night for every 10 paid nights.

The free-night value will never cover taxes and fees though. So you'll still be on the hook for those even if your free-night average value is higher than the cost of the night you're covering. If you want to use your free night for a hotel that's more expensive than the value of your free night you can use it and pay the difference in cost. This added flexibility makes it easy to redeem your free night.

If you have multiple free nights in your account you can redeem more than one free night on a multinight booking. For instance if you have four free nights and a six-night booking you can use all four and pay for two nights.

Caveats to earning and redeeming free nights

Because no rewards program could ever be caveat-free here are some things you need to know about earning and redeeming Hotels.com free nights:

You can't redeem multiple free nights to cover a single expensive night. You must redeem one free night per night of your stay.

You won't earn a night credit toward a free night on select bookings including if you:

Cancel your booking.

Don't check in at the property.

Book through an affiliate Hotels.com site.

Book before you join Hotels.com Rewards.

Book a package that includes a hotel.

Book using select discount coupons vouchers or codes.

Book through group travel services.

You'll earn a night credit toward 10 nights if you pay with a Hotels.com gift card which you can find discounted at a variety of online retailers.

Additionally note that Hotels.com typically charges a $5 redemption fee per reward night when you book through its website. However if you book your free night through the Hotels.com app or have the Hotels.com® Rewards Visa® Credit Card (rates & fees) you won't need to pay the redemption fee.

Elite status

There are two levels of status with Hotels.com: Silver and Gold. You'll reach Silver status after collecting 10 stamps in a membership year (based on the date you join the program) and earn Gold status after collecting 30 stamps in a membership year.

As a Hotels.com Rewards Silver member you'll receive:

Priority customer service when calling in for assistance.

Price Guarantee Plus offers price matches and a refund of the difference if you find the same hotel stay at a better price prior to check-in.

Silver exclusives at select VIP Access properties. Keep an eye out for the gift box icon when booking to see what rewards are available to you.

Hotels.com Rewards Gold members receive all Silver benefits plus complimentary room upgrades and guaranteed two-hour late checkout and early check-in (subject to availability) at VIP Access properties.

When to use Hotels.com

(Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy)

What's nice about Hotels.com Rewards is the ability to use free nights at properties that typically offer no avenue for getting free stays besides using fixed-value award points or cash-rewards earnings. Four Seasons properties on-property Disney resorts boutique hotels and ski resorts are all on Hotels.com. With no blackout dates you can use your free-night credit toward any of these properties.

It's best to use Hotels.com when looking at remote destinations boutique hotels and unique properties. Likewise Hotels.com can be an excellent option if you know you have a one-off stay at a chain you'll never (or rarely) utilize again.

However suppose you're going to stay regularly at large hotel chains like Hilton Hyatt and Marriott. In that case I believe it's still best to book directly with those properties and earn hotel elite status benefits and points. And if you're looking to book a luxury property it could be best to utilize a Virtuoso agent or book through Amex Fine Hotels + Resorts.

Quadruple dip for extra rewards

(Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy)

One solid reason to consider using Hotels.com as your main booking engine is the ability to massively stack different discounts and bonus rewards to turbocharge your earnings. Let's take a look at how this might work:

Buy discounted Hotels.com gift cards with a credit card. There are plenty of avenues to do this. In addition to the savings from the discounted gift card you'll earn points on your credit card. Use a card with strong returns on everyday spending as discounted gift card sites rarely count toward any bonus category. Click through an online shopping portal. By clicking through an online shopping portal before booking you can earn points miles or cash back on your stay. I recommend using an online shopping portal aggregator to find the best portal for your purchase. Hotels.com Rewards: Book your hotel while signed in to your Hotels.com Rewards account and you'll earn about 10% of the cost of that night back toward a future free night.

After this quadruple dip you may see about a 20% return. That's a pretty impressive haul especially given the tremendous flexibility you have in booking Hotels.com stays and redeeming your free-night awards.

Bottom line

If you book enough big-box chain hotels to earn elite status and a significant amount of hotel points Hotels.com might not make sense. After all for bookings made with online travel agencies like Hotels.com you typically won't earn hotel points or elite credit and the properties don't have to honor your elite status. I also find upgrades to be less generous and room assignment poor when booking through online travel agencies compared to booking direct.

However if you're looking for a unique or luxury property and aren't already loyal to one of the major hotel chains the ability to earn a 20% return can make a lot of financial sense.

But the company also has an interest in helping the look of schools of higher learning.

Recently the company awarded a $40000 grant to Bethune-Cookman University to be used to help beautify the historic campus.

""Retool Your School"" is a Home Depot program that assists colleges and universities by completing campus improvement projects nationwide.

“This year Home Depot is pledging $1 million for 30 universities or colleges” said Michael Lottering store manager for the Daytona Beach Home Depot store. “So during this year they expanded the Retool Your School grant between $20000 to $70000 per school. Bethune-Cookman was one of the schools that won. They were granted $40000. They can buy products from Home Depot to beautify the outside area.”

Bethune-Cookman was selected by students alumni and advocates to receive the grant.

The program has provided more than 140 sustainable campus improvement grants to 87% of the nation’s HBCUs since it was established in 2009.

B-CU student body president and senior Leonte Tukes said students jumped at the chance to help out with the project.

“We had about 30 students come out and help” said Tukes 21. “It means so much to us. We just had concrete tables in the beginning that were really old. So we replaced them. This is going to bring a lot of vibrancy and newness to the campus for this new era that we're in.”

Tukes said in addition to the picnic tables there will be umbrellas attached to the picnic tables light fixtures and some spirit banners that'll be on each pole around the campus.

“It means the world to us to know that we can see the funding come in and that we're able to actually help beautify our campus” said 19-year-old student Donneisha McFadden. “We got whoever we could to come out and help. A lot of students were in class. But we do have a nice amount of students representing different organizations and different classes that came out to help.”

McFadden said the new picnic tables will definitely be utilized.

“We are going to come out more” she said. “The quad is the heart of our university. We take pride in it. We’re going to come out more and enjoy it. We are so grateful to Home Depot.”

""The students were given the privilege of deciding how to use the grant money"" said Hiram Powell interim president of BC-U via email last week. ""They chose a beatification project for the Quad (the primary outdoor hangout for students). The students enjoyed working with the Home Depot staff and are proud of their new accommodations.""

Powell said there will be some additional campus upgrades in the near future.

""In partnership with SODEXO the university's food service and physical plant services provider the university is pursuing ongoing upgrades including exterior painting of campus buildings a $2000000 upgrade to the main HVAC system improved landscaping and technology upgrades.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vc3R0aG9tYXNzb3VyY2UuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvMjAyMS8wOS8yNS9zdXNwZWN0LXBsZWFkcy1ub3QtZ3VpbHR5LWluLWhvbWUtZGVwb3Qtc2xheWluZy1zZWVrcy1iYWlsLXJlZHVjdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Suspect Pleads Not Guilty in Home Depot Slaying Seeks Bail Reduction,"Justin Matthews pleaded not guilty on Friday to first-degree murder and 10 other counts in the Sept. 4 shooting death of Keoner Baron as she waited for a ride following her shift at Home Depot on St. Thomas.

During his arraignment in V.I. Superior Court Matthews 23 appeared virtually from his jail cell where he has been held on $1 million bail since his arrest on Sept. 5.

His attorney sought Thursday to have the bail reduced to $100000.

“The Magistrate Court’s order in this matter is tantamount to a denial of bond. Even with a reduction to $100000 the defendant’s bond would be substantial that he’d likely be unable to post it” Territorial Public Defender Samuel Joseph wrote in a motion for bail reduction that was opposed by the Attorney General’s Office.

Joseph said Matthews would reside with a third-party custodian – his grandmother – in Estate Contant and would be subject to strict house arrest with electronic GPS monitoring 24 hours a day seven days a week.

Judge Denise Francois did not rule on the motion Friday. The court did agree to Matthews’ request for a speedy trial and scheduled jury selection to begin Feb. 14.

Along with first-degree murder/domestic violence Matthews is charged with second-degree murder domestic violence four counts of unauthorized use of a firearm first-degree assault domestic violence third-degree assault domestic violence unauthorized possession of a firearm unauthorized possession of firearm ammunition and reckless endangerment in the first degree.

According to an affidavit by V.I. Police Detective Shenika Simon that was filed as part of the court record officers responding to a 911 call at 4:10 p.m. Sept. 4 found Baron 20 lying unresponsive in the Home Depot parking lot with multiple gunshot wounds. She was taken to Roy Lester Schneider Medical Center where she died of her injuries. Simon said officers collected 11 9mm shell casings at the scene.

Two witnesses said they were driving in the area when they saw a man in a black mask walk toward a woman sitting under a tree in the parking lot and shoot her multiple times according to the affidavit. They said the man then ran from the parking lot and drove off in a gray Hyundai with a license plate ending in 570.

A third witness who was in the Home Depot parking lot described a similar scene according to the affidavit.

A review of Home Depot surveillance video showed a silver vehicle approach Baron in the parking lot and stop. “She appeared to be having a conversation with the individual inside of the vehicle and then she walked off and walked towards the area where she was shot” Simon said.

“The individual inside the vehicle rolled up the window and drove in the direction where Ms. Baron was sitting. The vehicle was in the area for about five minutes before traversing Southward in the Home Depot parking lot and heading in an Eastern direction (left turn) towards Donoe roadway” Simon said.

“I observed that at about 1710 hours an unknown individual attired in a black shirt stone-washed short jeans pants ran in the direction where Ms. Baron was seated. The individual approached Ms. Baron and fired a shot at her and she raised her hands and she fell on the ground. The individual continued to fire several more shots at Ms. Baron. The individual ran back towards the area he came from towards the roadway.”

Detective V. Carr heard the 911 call and vehicle description and realizing he knew the car and its owner traveled to Matthews’ residence in Estate Contant and took him to the Criminal Investigation Bureau for questioning said Simon.

Matthews at first told police that his vehicle was stolen at gunpoint as he stopped on the side of the road in the Donoe area to remove a bucket from the trunk and that he reported it in a call to 911 according to the affidavit.

After further investigation revealed no such call had been made Matthews was brought back to the police station the following day and admitted to shooting Baron after they got into an argument over her speaking to another man the affidavit said.

The investigation revealed that Matthews and Baron had been dating for about two years and she had broken off the relationship three days before she was killed the affidavit stated.

Matthews was free on an unsecured $2000 bond on charges of stalking and disturbance of the peace/threats in an unrelated case from June 20 2020 when the Home Depot shooting occurred according to court documents. A pre-trial conference in that case is scheduled for Oct. 6 in Superior Court on St. Thomas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbW9ucm9lc3VuLmNvbS93aWZmbGUtYmFsbC1mdW4tZGF5LWEtcGl0Y2hlZC1iYXR0bGUtYWdhaW5zdC1odW5nZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wiffle Ball Fun Day a pitched battle against hunger,"MONROE CT — Pitchers threw high heat curve balls and an assortment of other pitches to batters wielding power at the plate during the Monroe Food Pantry’s 2021 Wiffle Ball tournament at Wolfe Park Saturday.

ANC GETS DEWALT TOOL BRAND VISIBILITY ON THE SIDELINES DURING FOOTBALL

Team benches are the newest piece of sponsorship inventory at college football stadiums as Power Five schools and their media rights holders search for creative ways to generate revenue at those facilities. ANC which is part of Learfield brokered a three-year deal with Stanley Black & Decker to place the DeWalt tool brand on team benches produced by Dragon Seats a Learfield partner supplying the structures for 25 schools.

Financial terms were not disclosed. Participants span the Atlantic Coast Conference Big Ten Big 12 Pac-12 and Mountain West. John Obropta ANC’s vice president of advertising sales was principally involved in the agreement. Obropta said expectations are moderate for brand exposure on television considering the benches are typically hidden by players sitting on them and standing in front of them along the sidelines. The Ohio State-Minnesota game Sept. 2 at Huntington Bank Stadium marked the launch of the DeWalt program followed by about a half-dozen games on the first full Saturday of the college football season.

Eric Smallwood president of Apex Marketing Group a firm that tracks media exposure for brands across sports and entertainment followed DeWalt coverage for a few games over the Labor Day weekend including the Sept. 3 Michigan State-Northwestern game. Smallwood estimated that the projected value for a school participating in the ANC/DeWalt program runs more than $185000 over the course of the season depending on the number of home games which can range from five to seven for the respective institutions. “I looked at games that didn’t have it and games that did have it” he said. “Where it comes into play is toward the end of the game if the quarterback is sitting on the bench and a coach is talking to him.”

Another instance occurred when the camera focused on the head coach and players behind him were dispersed in a manner in which the DeWalt brand was visible to the viewer Smallwood said. During the early stages of the season the small posts sticking up from the benches that carry the DeWalt brand provide a bonus for the schools he said. They’re helmet warmers and mostly used in the cold weather months. For now they’re uncovered exposing the sponsor’s logo. Smallwood said that without knowing the parameters of the ANC/DeWalt deal key variables to determine value extend to which network is broadcasting the game and whether DeWalt is reaching a national audience on a Saturday night on ABC compared with the Big Ten Network.

“When I did the projection I based it on a blend of factors” he said. For Stanley Black & Decker and DeWalt “it’s an ownable concept which is the thing they love” Obropta said. Obropta has been with ANC for 20 years. In 2015 Learfield acquired a controlling interest in ANC which is well known for producing customized software systems for videoboards at big league and college venues. or ANC television-visible signage has been a specialty and that’s where its relationship with Stanley Black & Decker started Obropta said. The company’s brands have been displayed on digital signs behind home plate at Major League Baseball stadiums. Over the past five years Stanley Black & Decker has grown tremendously acquiring Craftsman from Sears in 2017.

In August it bought the remaining 80% of MTD Holdings a private manufacturer of outdoor power equipment tied to the Cub Cadet and Troy-Bilt brands. “The genesis of our relationship is delivering TV-visible signage for whatever brand they’re trying to pump up” Obropta said. “The DeWalt brand sits squarely at the forefront with retailers. Everybody’s doing pretty well with Lowe’s and Home Depot selling their products.”

To keep the DeWalt line top of mind among college football fans Stanley Black & Decker came to ANC and Obropta searching for a bigger advertising platform. The firm did not previously have a presence in college football. Obropta circled back with Learfield which through its merger with IMG College in 2018 holds the multimedia rights to dozens of Power Five institutions. Learfield on its own had put together a program for college football with Dragon Seats “the Cadillac of player benches” with ventilation systems to keep players cool when it’s hot and warm them when it’s cold Obropta said. At the time Learfield was seeking a bench sponsor for activation he said. DeWalt filled that role. Stanley Black & Decker initially asked ANC to come up with inventory to match the success of the Allstate field goal nets and the State Farm basket stanchion pads in college basketball and the NBA a deal that Obropta worked on several years ago. The Allstate nets were already off limits. ANC had to find a different piece of inventory that was standard at college football stadiums across the country. The team benches stood out as a uniform feature at all those venues.

“They loved it and it was an overwhelming journey of tweaking the list to come up with 25 schools that were going to comply with the DeWalt branding” Obropta said. “We kept it in the ballpark in terms of potential budget the schools and conferences … to get the home and away matchups that we wanted.” Schools were also sticklers for displaying their team logos. In that respect all benches have a consistent look with the exception of school colors and mascot marks. Under terms of the deal the minimum is four benches a school but many are requesting twice that number which gives DeWalt “more real estate” on the sidelines Obropta said.

Some schools have talked about bringing the benches for their road games he said. In addition to the benches Stanley Black & Decker receives game day hospitality with a pregame tailgate party at all 25 schools to entertain employees and their top customers among the dealers selling their products. The sponsor also gets game tickets in a suite or other premium space inside the stadium Obropta said. LED ribbon board displays and a coordinated social media campaign are also part of the agreement. ANC holds the right to expand the DeWalt program to more schools.

“They’re going to own Saturday with the live game broadcasts and highlights” he said. “The more teams involved the better it’s going to be and the more robust it will look.” As the branded bench program evolves the NFL could potentially provide ANC with a future opportunity. “TV-visible signs locally are not approved in the NFL” Obropta said. “We’ve been trying to get field-level LED (signs) into the NFL for five years now. When the NFL decides to do that it will have to go through them. It’s something that could happen.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL2hvdXN0b24tZ2l2ZXMvYXJ0aWNsZS9UZXhhcy1SYW1wLVByb2plY3QtcmVtb3Zlcy1iYXJyaWVycy1mb3ItdGhvc2UtMTY0ODAwNjUucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Ramp Project removes barriers for those with mobility issues,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.houstonchronicle.com/houston-gives/article/Texas-Ramp-Project-removes-barriers-for-those-16480065.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL2hvdXN0b24tZ2l2ZXMvYXJ0aWNsZS9UZXhhcy1SYW1wLVByb2plY3QtcmVtb3Zlcy1iYXJyaWVycy1mb3ItdGhvc2UtMTY0ODAwNjUucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Global Citizen Live represents a call to action to end extreme poverty and build momentum ahead of the G20 Summit in October and UN Climate Conference COP26 in November.

The campaign calls on world leaders businesses and philanthropists to urgently commit resources to: meet the $15-20 billion funding shortfall of the $100 billion promised annually to the most vulnerable countries confronting climate change; businesses to help curb emissions through joining the Race to Zero campaign and pledging 1 billion additional trees by 2022 in support of the 1t.org ambition to conserve restore and grow 1 trillion trees this decade; $6 billion to provide food to 41 million people facing famine; 2 billion COVID-19 vaccines to be redistributed to low-income countries by early 2022; and for Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna to share mRNA technology with the WHO-backed Africa mRNA vaccine hub.

More than US$1.1 billion 157 million trees and over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines were announced during Global Citizen Live thanks to partnerships between government philanthropy non-governmental organizations and the private sector.

Global Citizen Live featured a remarkable lineup of world leaders advocates and artists supporting the campaign and its mission to end extreme poverty. Across seven continents tens of thousands of Global Citizens were in attendance over 24 hours as millions streamed the live broadcast event globally.

As a result of the hard work of many partner organizations the Global Citizen Live campaign announced:

157 million trees including 77 million trees by 2022; and more than US$300M to defend the planet

“Quite rightly future generations will hold us responsible. So join me and with one loud and united global voice call on the biggest greenhouse gas emitters — the G20 group of nations — to make much bolder commitments to cut emissions"" COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma told the audience during the New York event. “Call on the richest countries to make good on their promise of money to support developing countries deal with the impacts of climate change and call on world leaders to deliver an outcome at Glasgow we can all be proud of.”

Over US$800 million to defeat poverty and address hunger crises.

“Shame on us. At the height of COVID-19 the billionaires’ average net worth increase per day was $5 billion. And yet I am begging to feed the poor! Shame on us ... If we do not act today millions will starve nations will destabilize and millions will migrate by necessity"" said World Food Programme Executive Director David Beasley. ""If we are struggling today with a population of over 7 billion what do you expect will happen when there are over 10 billion people on earth by 2050? And by 2050 due to climate change we anticipate over 1 billion people to be displaced around the world! Wake up New York. Wake up Planet Earth.""

Over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines for those most in need.

“We have what we need to vaccinate the world. But the experts told us here’s what’s getting in the way: They said many countries are ready to produce vaccines at home. Yet they aren’t allowed to because ultra-wealthy pharmaceutical companies are not sharing the recipes to make them. These countries have the means ability and the workers to start manufacturing. All they are waiting for is the vaccine intellectual property to be transferred over” said Prince Harry The Duke of Sussex during the New York show.

“Every single person on this planet has a fundamental right to get this vaccine. That’s the point — yet that’s not happening. While in this country (and many others) you can go almost anywhere and get vaccinated billions around the world cannot. This year the world is expected to produce enough doses to meet the target of vaccinating 70% of people in every single country. But it is wrong that so much of the vaccine supply has only gone to just 10 wealthy nations so far and not everyone else” said Meghan The Duchess of Sussex.

Announcements were made by the European Commission the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) Belgium Colombia Croatia the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) France Germany Ireland Luxembourg the Netherlands Norway Spain United States UNESCO the Green Climate Fund and the Paris Peace Forum.

Global Citizen Live also saw announcements from the US states of Hawaii and Washington; the Brazilian states of Amapá Amazonas Ceará Piauí Pará and Paraíba; the City of Paris France; the municipality of Asker Norway; and 43 cities in Maharashtra State India.

In the lead up to Global Citizen Live Global Citizen called on action takers to demand that the world's wealthiest nations redistribute 1 billion vaccine doses urgently this year and 1 billion more by early 2022; support the proposal to waive intellectual property rights on the production of COVID-19 vaccines and other medical tools backed by over 100 countries; and call on Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna to share mRNA technology with a new WHO-backed mRNA technology transfer hub based in South Africa.

Global Citizen also called on countries around the world to reduce fair share national emissions to prevent more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming and for developed nations to deliver on their promise to provide $100 billion annually to address the climate needs of developing countries. G7 nations and billionaires were also called on by Global Citizen and its partners to end the hunger crisis by contributing at least $6 billion for the urgent provision of millions of meals for 41 million people on the brink of famine.

Global Citizen Live represents an ongoing campaign led by citizens around the world to take action to urge governments corporations and philanthropists to make urgent change in line with the United Nations’ Global Goals and the Global Citizen Recovery Plan for the World.

“Global Citizen Live is not a celebration but an urgent call to action” said Mick Sheldrick co-founder and Chief Policy and Government Affairs Officer at Global Citizen. “We’re campaigning hard to get the world on track to end extreme poverty calling on world leaders to step-up at the G20 and COP26 summits. Global Citizen Live is the beginning of a month-long countdown!”

Global Citizen Live highlighted the efforts and announcements of 67 governments six philanthropic foundations and 40 corporate partners alongside global advocates and campaigners. Among millions of Global Citizens stood key global leaders partners and advocates at the forefront of Global Citizen’s mission to end extreme poverty: UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed Executive Director of the World Food Programme David Beasley CEO of Namati Vivek Maru Rotary President-elect Jennifer Jones Global Goals Champion and Advocate Eddie Ndopu President of the Ford Foundation Darren Walker President of the Paris Peace Forum Steering Committee Trisha Shetty Hip Hop Caucus President and CEO Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr. UN Next Generation fellow Valeria Colunga advocate Eunice Akoth and more.

“A Global Citizen is aware of the fact that we all share one planet one health one common destiny — and that every one of us matters” said Ursula von der Leyen president of the European Commission in support of the campaign. “Everyone can make a difference by working together finding global solutions to global problems with unity cooperation and solidarity.”

As leaders step up to curb emissions combat climate change and defend the planet at Global Citizen Live more ambition is needed ahead of the COP26 Climate Summit.

Global Citizen and its Race to Zero partners worked to secure commitments from many of the world’s largest companies and cities to develop verified science-based targets to reach net zero emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.

Corporate partners and cities signed up to the Race to Zero initiative a science-based campaign to drive climate targets in line with the Paris Agreement. Global Citizen Live saw 13 companies valued at $1.3 trillion in market capital join the Race to Zero initiative. New signers include five Fortune 100 companies the largest consumer goods company in the world the largest tool maker in the world and the largest hotel group in the world.

Private sector organizations that officially signed on to the Race to Zero as a part of the Global Citizen Live campaign include: Akamai Technologies American Express BD (Becton Dickinson and Company) Boston Scientific Corporation Cisco Delta Air Lines DocuSign IHG Hotels and Resorts Marriott International Inc. P&G Stanley Black & Decker and Starbucks who have each signed on to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5 and Citi which joined the Race to Zero via the Net Zero Banking Alliance.

Global Citizen also worked with existing Race to Zero members to join the campaign’s Climate Coalition aimed at encouraging peers vendors and partners to sign on to the Race to Zero ahead of COP26. Climate Coalition members include Amazon Bayer AG Boston Consulting Group Capgemini Dentsu International DocuSign HP Inc. Intuit Lendlease P&G RELX Salesforce Schneider Electric Uber Unilever Walmart Inc. and Zurich Insurance Group.

""Urgent and widespread climate action is vital to unlock the pace and scale of decarbonization required by science. Every nation company and individual must play their part. This innovative collaboration with Global Citizen has delivered additional major US businesses to our campaign for the world's most ambitious climate leaders. With just one month until the milestone climate conference COP26 we are now calling on more companies worldwide to join Business Ambition for 1.5 degrees Celsius and play their role in delivering bold climate action to halve global emissions by 2030"" said Tom Dowdall Science Based Targets Initiative Campaign Lead.

While Global Citizen has been in contact with hundreds of companies to sign on to Race to Zero many of the world’s largest companies and top emitters failed to respond to Global Citizen’s outreach after several attempts. These companies must step up to sign on to control their emissions and protect the planet now not later. Global Citizens will continue to campaign and call on these companies to join Race to Zero by COP26 in November this year.

Global Citizen also worked with American Forests and 1t.org to ensure a sustainable climate and a nature-positive planet by conserving restoring and growing trees supporting the global movement to save and restore 1 trillion trees by 2030. A total of 157 million trees will be protected and restored by 2030 including 77 million by the end of 2022.

Global Citizen Live received support from 12 members of the United States Congress calling for legislative measures to meet the goal of 100 million trees being protected conserved and planted in cities across America by 2030 including: Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12) Rep.

Mayors governors and sub-national representatives also showed their support from around the world including: Lene Conradi Mayor of Asker Kommune Norway; Hilary Franz Commissioner of Public Lands Washington; David Ige Governor Hawaii; Anne Hidalgo Mayor Paris; and the Brazilian governors of Amapá (Waldez Góes) Amazonas (Wilson Miranda Lima) Ceará (Camilo Santana) Pará (Helder Barbalho) Paraíba (João Azevêdo) and Piauí (Wellington Dias).

""The protection of the wild is a major task of our generation. Global Citizens have called on leaders to take decisive steps in the right direction. We commend the Brazilian governors of Amapá Amazonas Ceará Pará Paraiba and Piauí for their commitments to environmental protection and strong climate actions"" said Rodrigo Medeiros of Re:Wild.

Governors made announcements from across Brazil including six states from the Amazon at the front lines of climate change. The Brazilian states announced plans to reduce emissions increase the number of protected areas and create state-wide climate mitigation and adaptation plans.

This weekend’s announcements build on earlier commitments over the last 18 months as part of the Trillion Trees Campaign. Global Citizen Live celebrates the global 1t.org community for its commitment to conserve restore and grow trees including the following organizations with existing 1t.org pledges contributing to the trillion tree ambition by 2030: Amazon Aspiration AstraZeneca Clif Bar & Company HP Inc. Iberdrola Jonas Philanthropies Trees for Climate Health Initiative Nestlé Pottery Barn SAP SE tentree Travelers Unilever UPS and VMWare.

“It is inspiring to see the world’s largest companies governments and individuals of all ages unite to make ambitious commitments to protect and restore our planet. 1t.org’s collaboration with Global Citizen Live to scale investments in our trees and forests will be an integral part of the solution in tackling pressing ecological and societal challenges” said Nicole Schwab Co-Head of Nature-Based Solutions at the World Economic Forum. “Global Citizen Live shows that collective action at a global scale is possible.”

Leaders make commitments toward $100 billion climate promise but at least $15 billion shortfall remains ahead of COP26.

During UNGA leaders made commitments in support of honoring their promise to provide vulnerable countries with $100 billion annually to respond to climate change. During his UNGA address President Joe Biden announced that the US will increase its climate aid commitment to $11.4 billion by 2024. Despite being a step in the right direction this is still far less than what is contributed by the EU according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute. The G20 must keep their promise to provide an additional $100 billion annually to protect vulnerable nations from climate change. We have five weeks in order to meet this promise.

""The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how strongly the health of one person depends on the behaviour of the other. We need decisive action and solidarity both on individual and societal levels to leave the COVID-19 pandemic behind us. Today at Global Citizen Live I join Global Citizen's calls for more vaccine equity and a stronger commitment to an encompassing solution of the pandemic that is sensitive to the capacities and needs of different countries. I thank all Global Citizens for advocating and strongly supporting the work of WHO “ said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Director-General of World Health Organization.

During the Global Citizen Live campaign Italy committed to substantially increase its climate financing in the run-up to COP 26. Global Citizen will hold them accountable to this commitment.

From New York The Green Climate Fund supporting developing countries to reduce emissions and build resilience announced they would be accelerating the delivery of over $1.2 billion in the coming months.

Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez during his UNGA address and in response to a tweet from Coldplay announced €30 million for the Adaptation Fund an international fund that finances projects and programs aimed at helping developing countries to adapt to the harmful effects of climate change albeit much more is needed for Spain to meet its fair share.

Meanwhile both Denmark and Norway affirmed their commitments to significantly increase their climate financing commitments said Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen declaring:

“Denmark will contribute 1% of the collective target of $100 billion. And 60% of our climate aid will help developing countries adapt to climate change. If we can — G20 can! Let’s send a message to the G20 that cannot be misunderstood: Do not come empty-handed to Glasgow” said Frederiksen.

Global Citizen believes that Austria Australia Portugal Spain and Italy should also increase their contributions toward meeting the $100 billion pledge. We are grateful to ODI and Sarah Colenbrander for their analysis and support through the Global Citizen Live campaign. Global Citizen is urging US citizens to contact their local member of congress. The United States must live up to its promise.

Global Citizen Live calls code red for Congress and urges the United States Congress to pass most consequential climate legislation in US history.

Over 60 million COVID-19 vaccines pledged at Global Citizen Live in a step toward vaccine equity but too little too late as huge gap remains.

Inequitable vaccine distribution has left millions of vulnerable communities unprotected and reversed decades of progress against other infectious diseases and the broader Global Goals for Sustainable Development. To end this pandemic we must make the COVID-19 vaccines available to all everywhere. Global Citizen Live is grateful for its partnership with the ACT Accelerator the Pandemic Action Network the ONE Campaign and others in the collective effort to address vaccine inequity and injustice.

Extraordinary action is needed in the fight against COVID-19 and world leaders are uniquely positioned to enable a global recovery by ensuring everyone has access to life-saving vaccines tests and treatments. On Sept. 22 US President Biden convened world leaders to commit to vaccinate at least 70% of people in every country by this time next year to break the chain of transmission and end the pandemic. But more than promises are needed; without action the virus and its mutations will continue to threaten us all and undermine the global economy.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield took to the Global Citizen Live stage to reiterate the call for everyone to have access to COVID-19 vaccines especially vulnerable refugees whose circumstances have been further impacted by the pandemic. Global Citizen welcomes US leadership to galvanize efforts to vaccinate at least 70% of people in all countries by September 2022 but hopes to see this promise met by comprehensive action from the US. This includes sharing all excess and unused doses in hand or on order for 2021 as soon as possible providing funding and support to help lower income countries get doses from tarmac and into arms and critically by actively promoting an intellectual property waiver at the World Trade Organization and pushing pharma companies to share mRNA vaccine technology with Africa and other lower-income regions.

This is why we join Global Citizen Live to commit to increase our vaccine donations to COVAX by 7.5 million and pledge financial support of €2 million for UNITAID as well as €30M for the Adaptation Fund to support the fight against climate change” said Pedro Sánchez Prime Minister of Spain.

Lima-Hamilton locomotives were built out of Lima the youngest and smallest of the Big Three steam builders. The Ohio manufacturer was synonymous with steam at its best and it upheld the steam standard to the bitter end. Even as legions of diesels were rolling off the erecting floors of competitors Lima Locomotive Works was espousing the advantages of modern steam power from its hometown of Lima Ohio.

Lima’s devotion to steam cost it dearly. While competitors’ books bulged with diesel orders Lima went hungry as steam orders dwindled. Being careful not to concede defeat or publicly compromise its steam loyalty Lima merged with the General Machinery Corp. of Hamilton Ohio to form the Lima-Hamilton Corp. on October 1 1947. Having spurned a postwar proposal to produce diesel locomotives for Fairbanks-Morse Lima was neither shopping for a diesel-building partner nor looking to head to the altar. Rather the L-H marriage was instigated by General Machinery which was in search of a market for its Hamilton diesels as well as a gas turbine already under development.

Although Lima had built a few diminutive gas-mechanical locomotives in the 1920s and ’30s the company had virtually no experience with diesels. Meanwhile General Machinery’s 4-cycle Hamilton diesel had been introduced in 1936 and seen use in marine industrial and stationary applications. Hamilton diesels also had been employed in experimental locomotives built by Davenport and Plymouth and to repower distillate and gas-electric motor cars.

As steam production at Lima plummeted engineers at the Hamilton Ohio plant worked to design an engine based on the proven Hamilton 68SA. In 1948 diamond-shaped Lima builder’s plates appended with the words “Lima-Hamilton Corporation” were affixed to just 36 steam locomotives. In 1949 Lima had just two orders on the books both for 2-8-4 Berkshires (10 for Louisville & Nashville 22 for Nickel Plate Road).

Beginning of Lima-Hamilton

The Berks weren’t the only locomotives taking shape at Lima however. In spring 1949 a single diesel switcher with an 8-cylinder Hamilton T89SA engine and Westinghouse electrical gear was nearing completion. Finished on May 12 1949 Lima’s first diesel 1000 h.p. demonstrator No. 1000 wore solid black paint with simple “Lima-Hamilton” lettering on its hood.

Ironically just one day later Nickel Plate 2-8-4 779 was fired up for final inspection. Overshadowed by the formal unveiling of Lima’s first diesel the 2-8-4 left the plant with little notice. It would be Lima’s last steam locomotive.

Lima 1000 the first of five 1000 h.p. switcher demos ventured into a diesel-hungry world. The newest model on the market was attracting interest and orders. Armco Steel 708 the first diesel Lima sold was delivered June 27 1949. Two days later Lima shipped its first common-carrier diesel as NKP 305 followed demo 1000 out the gates.

By April 1950 Lima had built 38 1000 h.p. switchers including 4 for NKP 6 for New York Central and 10 each for Erie and B&O. Toledo Peoria & Western bought a single new switcher plus demos 1000 and 1004 while Armco took demo 1001 and a second new unit.

In fall 1949 Lima added a 750 h.p. switcher to its lineup. Housed in the same carbody as its 1000 h.p. big brother it was powered by a 6-cylinder engine and like all Lima diesels outfitted with Westinghouse electrical equipment. Only six were built all for Cincinnati Union Terminal between November 1949 and June 1951.

Lima-Hamilton locomotives: models

Less than a year after building its first diesel Lima expanded its catalog with a new line of 10 models in April 1950. Lima never assigned formal model designations to its diesels referring to them simply by horsepower rating and configuration. Based on the 6- and 8-cylinder Hamilton engines the new line ranged from 800 and 1200 h.p. switchers to a 1200 h.p. road-switcher and double-engine center-cab transfer locomotives available in 1600 and 2400 h.p. C-C or A1A-A1A versions.

Although only 4 of the 10 models were ever built Lima gained momentum through 1950 and early ’51. Switcher sales were reasonably brisk with repeat orders from B&O Erie Nickel Plate NYC (under the auspices of subsidiary Chicago River & Indiana) and Armco Steel. Lima broke new ground with orders from Rock Island the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis New Haven and Wabash which augmented the purchase of 10 new 1200 h.p. switchers by acquiring demos 1002 and 1003.

Road-switcher sales were limited to 16 steam-generator-equipped 1200 h.p. versions for NYC and Pennsy purchased the only 22 Lima center-cab transfer locomotives. Rated at 2500 h.p. they rode on two three-motor trucks.

Merger with Baldwin

While gruff-sounding Hamilton diesels talked it up on the Lima test track company officials were engaged in quiet conversation with their counterparts at Baldwin. Shock waves rolled through the Lima works as news of a merger of Lima-Hamilton and Baldwin Locomotive Works was formally announced. On November 30 1950 they became the Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp.

Baldwin wanted Lima not for its locomotive business but for its non-rail product lines. With competition in the locomotive market heating up and demand cooling Baldwin was looking to diversify and Lima’s crane and shovel division and other industrial concerns were just the ticket. On the eve of construction of the Interstate highway system BLH planned to drop Lima’s locomotive line and expand its shovel and crane production.

On September 11 1951 Lima employees lined up for a formal portrait with Pennsylvania Railroad transfer diesel 5683 the final locomotive built at the Lima works. Not three years after the completion of its first diesel locomotive Lima’s 174th would be its last. The last of the Big Three steam builders to enter the diesel market was the first to leave.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vaGFpdGlhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzI1L2hvdy1oYWl0aXMtdHJhc2gtZnVlbHMtYS1nbG9iYWwtdGVjaC1naWFudC1sb2NhbC1qb2JzLWZvci1mYW1pbGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Haiti's trash fuels a global tech giant local jobs for families,"When First Mile started working in Haiti the country was still reeling from the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. Hundreds of thousands of people were living in tent communities sprawled across the capital and the country’s spacious national landmarks.

At the time First Mile — which helps global brands source materials from responsible supply chains in Haiti Honduras and Taiwan — worked with a few recyclers in the country. One was Edouard Carrié a young Haitian who at the time ran Environmental Cleaning Solutions S.A. a recycling company known as ECSSA.

A 2010 earthquake survivor Carrié had been inspired to embark on an ambitious journey to get Haitians to start thinking about trash and recycling more seriously.

He turned out to be the perfect partner for First Mile.

“Post earthquake our founder went down to Haiti to see what he could do to help and realized after many conversations with local Haitians what they needed were jobs not handouts” said Kelsey Halling head of partnerships for First Mile.

“We looked to the abundance of trash all over the roads as a source of assets to see what we could do about it and if we could create jobs out of this problem.”

To that end First Mile partnered with Carrié to understand more about individual collectors and their needs. For both the goal was cleaning up Haiti’s streets while protecting the environment and creating income opportunities for locals.

Through Carrié’s work with First Mile he was introduced to HP the American manufacturer of software and computer services and LaVergne a Montreal-based recycling company. He would eventually work in tandem with them on their recycling efforts in Haiti.

“The vast number of trash and plastic ending up in the oceans is a worldwide problem” said Carrié who is now managing director of LaVergne Haiti. “It has the possibility to impact a significant part of our lives and we at LaVergne are doing our part to change that.”

About 15 million metric tons of plastic enters the ocean each year according to a report by the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information. The plastic is blamed for “choking marine mammals invading the guts of fish and seabirds and posing unknown risks to the animals and people who eat them.”

“The plastics that have been put in the ocean since we began disposing of plastics in the oceans in the 1950s much of that is still there” said oceanographer Sylvia Earle during a Washington Post forum about climate change.

Earle president and chairman of Mission Blue an organization she founded to promote ocean conservation added that plastics are so durable that even when they do break down they still maintain their integrity as microplastics and nanoplastics.

“One of the situations we’re facing here in Haiti is that a majority of our trash ends up in the ocean” Carrié said in an interview back in January. He was surrounded by mounds of plastic bottles neatly organized in massive tarp bags as he walked around the recycling plant in Croix des Bouquets. The plastic bottles were separated by color with signs hanging above them labeled ‘PET Clear PET Green PET Mixed.’

“Geographically Haiti is surrounded by mountains” Carrié said. “So when it rains as you can imagine there’s a vast amount of trash and plastic materials ending up in the ocean.”

Seeing beyond the trash to opportunities for Haiti

In certain parts of Port-au-Prince the streets overflow with so much trash that pedestrians and drivers often find themselves navigating around trash as they make their way across the city. In many places roadside cooks and street vendors litter the sidewalks of public marketplaces with the entrails of recently killed poultry and the skins of freshly-peeled vegetables.

It’s common for passersby to casually toss plastic bottles and other remnants from their day onto the streets simply because public garbage bins are hard to come across in the capital teeming with 2 million people. The resulting putrid smells especially when the humidity is at its highest buzzing insects and potential contamination are another story.

You see among the litany of political social and economic problems facing Haiti trash pickup isn’t high on the priority list of issues to address. To put it mildly.

In many municipalities across the country waste is managed on an individual basis without any government involvement. Virtually all garbage is disposed of in illegal dumps — such as canals rivers and the like or burned in the streets contributing to pollution and emission of greenhouse gases.

Carrié and the teams at First Mile and HP however took on the mission of doing their part to address Haiti’s trash problem and prevent plastic from entering the ocean. They also aimed to produce a finished product and create economic opportunities for local Haitians.

They worked together to increase demand for plastics from international companies by formalizing what had been a largely informal industry.

They worked together to increase demand for plastics from international companies by formalizing what had been a largely informal industry.

“We knew that if we could bring in demand from global clients like HP we could create jobs for struggling people and focus on social impact programming within the informal collections space” said Halling.

In 2016 HP teamed up with Thread International the First Mile Coalition Timberland Team Tassy and ACOP a Canada-based recycling trade group to embark on a three-year recycling project. The initiative which was part of the Clinton Global Initiative’s Commitment to Action plan would allow HP to purchase recycled plastic made with raw materials collected at the Truitier landfill in Port-au-Prince.

Truitier Landfill: Boon or bust for families?

The Truitier landfill is home to some 2000 people 300 of them children who live and work there alongside their parents in the landfill collecting and selling plastics. HP purchases plastic from 1100 Truitier residents who each earn 250 – 350 Haitian Gourdes (HG) roughly $2.50 to $3.50 per day. To put into context a loaf of bread in Haiti is about 80 HG.

The earnings may come as a shock to some. After all the disparity is part of a long standing debate among business leaders about low-cost labor and sourcing in supply chains and the ethics surrounding the practice. It’s an issue that First Mile and HP have not run away from however and are tackling by providing services and resources to supplement the collectors income.

As part of their efforts to give back to the community HP provides a scholarship to every child under 15 while older teens receive remedial education and soft-skills training. The children also receive mentoring food stipends and health care.

“We provide so many additional holistic programming and wraparound services because on $2.50 – $3.50 a day there’s still a lot of essential needs that aren’t going to be covered by that” Halling said.

Vivien Luk executive director of Work a nonprofit working in Port-au-Prince to help families out of poverty partners with First Mile to develop and implement their wraparound services in Truitier.

“It’s going to take time to get [the collectors] to a living income status or even a part time living income status. In the meantime we’ve removed some of the essential costs in their lives to help them with that” Luk said.

“Things like open access to medical care is provided to all of our collectors so that they don’t have to worry about not being able to afford care when they need it. Scholarships for the children are provided so that it can take that piece off as well” she added.

The education program which costs $350 per year per child covers the full cost of tuition and “everything that’s required for them to be successful in school” she said. “So uniforms to transportation to school to school supplies to breakfast lunch and dinner so they have the proper nutrition to to study in class.”

HP and First Mile and their education program has cut instances of child labor in the landfiil by 75 percent while their program has diverted 2.4 million pounds of ocean-bound plastics or 85 million plastic bottles since 2016. In 2020 HP received recycled content validations from UL verifying they indeed sourced materials from recycled ocean-bound plastic.

UL a U.S.-based company “helps companies demonstrate safety enhance sustainability strengthen security deliver quality manage risk and achieve regulatory compliance” according to the company’s website. HP worked with the organization to audit suppliers to determine safe labor practices and risk mitigation for the recycled material collector in Haiti.

In between earthquakes the work goes on

The most recent earthquake to hit Haiti left all of the collectors First Mile works with without homes and access to basic necessities. However within a week of the 7.2 magnitude earthquake hitting Haiti’s southern region First Mile and HP were able to locate 95% of their network and provide essential services including access to food clean water medical attention and housing.

While Haiti’s persistent political and social environment coupled with ongoing natural disaster have deterred many companies from operating in Haiti First Mile and HP are doubling down on their commitment to the country and the collectors they’re working with in Port-au-Prince.

“This isn’t the time to pause on any of our work” Luk said. “Removing plastic out of landfills and the oceans and diverting them from those areas is key to this effort. However it’s not just environmental. Environmental justice requires social justice to be in place. We have to have both of those elements to work hand in hand for us to be able to divert as much waste out of the environment as possible.”

However unlike Microsoft’s offering the HP tablet comes with a unique trick up its sleeve. And as you can tell from the title it is the 13MP rear camera that flips out to become a webcam for higher-quality videos and selfies.

So before moving on to the price and availability of the new HP tablet let’s take a quick look at its key specs and features.

HP 11-inch Tablet with Flip Camera: Key Specs and Features

Starting with the design the upcoming tablet from HP comes with a traditional tablet-like design and boasts an 11-inch IPS LCD panel with a 2160 x 1440p resolution. It works as a standalone device thanks to the touch-supported display or with a dedicated keyboard accessory. Moreover users can use it in both landscape and portrait orientation.

Under the hood the HP tablet packs an Intel Pentium Silver N6000 processor coupled with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of NVMe storage. The device comes with a MicroSD slot for storage expansion. There is also a 32.2Wh battery inside that charges using the USB-C port onboard. Furthermore the USB-C port also supports other accessories that users can connect with the device.

Coming to its USP the device features a 13MP rear camera that doubles as a webcam and a selfie snapper. For this HP took a page out of Asus’ notebook and integrated a flip camera similar to the camera module on the Zenfone 7 series that launched earlier last year. However HP says that the flip-out camera on its upcoming tablet is a first for tablet devices and we cannot disagree.

Other than this the device comes with a side-mounted fingerprint sensor for biometric authentication support for Bluetooth 5.0 and Wi-Fi 6 for faster speeds over wireless networks. Plus the HP tablet also supports the HP Tilt Pen and will run the Windows 11 in S Mode out-of-the-box.

Price and Availability

Now turning to the price and availability HP plans to launch this 11-inch tablet with a flip camera sometime in December this year. The company will sell the standalone device at $499 (~Rs 36789) and will charge $599 (~Rs 44250) for the tablet + keyboard combo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3N0ZWNoLmNvLnphL25ld3MvaGFyZHdhcmUvNTIwODY0L3RoaXMtcGMtYnJhbmQtZG9taW5hdGVzLXRoZS1tYXJrZXQtaW4tc291dGgtYWZyaWNhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This PC brand dominates the market in South Africa,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://businesstech.co.za/news/hardware/520864/this-pc-brand-dominates-the-market-in-south-africa/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3N0ZWNoLmNvLnphL25ld3MvaGFyZHdhcmUvNTIwODY0L3RoaXMtcGMtYnJhbmQtZG9taW5hdGVzLXRoZS1tYXJrZXQtaW4tc291dGgtYWZyaWNhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Los orígenes del planeta y el poblamiento del globo motivan al debate y la confrontación de ideas. Un grupo de investigadores en Nuevo México Estados Unidos encontró valiosos hallazgos de evidencia humana en América miles de años antes de lo pensado.

Huellas fosilizadas descubiertas en esa región del oeste de ese país indican que los primeros humanos caminaban por América del Norte hace unos 23.000 años. Unos 7.000 años antes de lo que se creía.

Las huellas se encontraron en el lecho de un lago seco en el Parque Nacional White Sands y fueron descubiertas en 2009 por un administrador del parque. Los científicos del Servicio Geológico analizaron las semillas pegadas en las huellas para determinar su edad aproximada. Las fechas varían en edad y confirman la presencia humana durante al menos dos milenios y las huellas más antiguas datan de hace unos 23.000 años

La mayoría de los científicos cree que la migración antigua se produjo a través de un puente terrestre ahora sumergido que conectaba Asia con Alaska. Con base en diversas pruebas incluidas herramientas de piedra huesos fósiles y análisis genéticos. Mientras tanto otros investigadores han ofrecido una variedad de fechas posibles para la llegada de los humanos a las Américas. Desde hace 13.000 hasta 26.000 años o más.

Petit a petit. 😌



Ce qui n'est pas dit par @franceinfo C'est qu'il y a 23000 ans la planète était totalement noire de monde noir 😂

Ya 100000 encore plus pour les premiers navigateurs.

Démerder vous maintenant avec ça white sands.#WhiteSands pic.twitter.com/9NbXXetkHP September 24 2021

Kathleen Springer del Servicio Geológico de EE UU se refirió a los hallazgos. «Nuestras fechas en las semillas están muy agrupadas y mantienen el orden estratigráfico por encima y por debajo de múltiples horizontes de huella. Este fue un resultado notable». Esto corresponde a la altura del último ciclo glacial durante algo conocido como el Último Máximo Glacial.

La evidencia humana en América una larga huella

Estos investigadores se dedicaron a estudiar las huellas que dan la evidencia humana en América. Huellas que cuentan una historia interesante de cómo era la vida en ese momento. Principalmente las de adolescentes y niños que fueron las encontradas a decir por el tamaño de las pisadas.

También huellas de mamut perezosos terrestres gigantes lobos terribles y aves están presentes en el sitio. “Es importante porque todos los caminos que hemos encontrado allí muestran una interacción de humanos en el paisaje junto con animales extintos como mamuts y perezosos gigantes. Podemos ver la coexistencia entre humanos y animales en el sitio como un todo. Y al poder fechar con precisión estas huellas estamos construyendo una imagen más amplia del paisaje» dijo Sally Reynolds académica en Paleoecología de Homínidos en la Universidad de Bournemouth.

El estudio actual proporciona una línea de base más sólida para cuando los humanos definitivamente estaban en América del Norte aunque podrían haber llegado incluso antes dicen los autores. Las huellas fósiles son una evidencia más indiscutible y directa que los «artefactos culturales huesos modificados u otros fósiles más convencionales» escribieron.

#IMPRESIONANTE | 🌎 Hallan huellas humanas a las orillas de un lago en el parque nacional #WhiteSands en Nuevo México que generan controversia y dudas sobre cuándo se pobló #America.



👉🏼 https://t.co/KgwNO85rzy pic.twitter.com/6egYHljnPS — @EstadoActual (@EstadoActual1) September 24 2021

Antes se pensaba que los humanos ingresaron a América mucho más tarde después del derretimiento de las capas de hielo de América del Norte lo que abrió las rutas de migración. Sin embargo las huellas muestran una migración más temprana de humanos a las Américas.

“Ha habido mucho debate durante muchos años sobre el primer poblamiento de las Américas con varios sitios tempranos identificados. Pocos arqueólogos ven evidencia confiable de sitios con más de 16.000 años. Las pistas de White Sands proporcionan una fecha mucho más temprana» comentó Vance Holliday de la Universidad de Arizona.

La guinda del pastel

Dan Odess del Servicio de Parques Nacionales comentó sobre la evidencia humana en América. “White Sands proporciona la primera evidencia inequívoca de la presencia humana en las Américas durante el Último Máximo Glacial. No todos los sitios arqueológicos contienen evidencia tan inequívoca».

Las #pisadas fósiles encontradas en la orilla de un antiguo lecho de lago en el Parque Nacional #WhiteSands de Nuevo México datan de hace 23.000 años lo que las convierte en las más antiguas jamás encontradas en #America del Norte. https://t.co/fQHHUp0ZoW — Mystery Planet (@MysteryPlanet) September 24 2021

Entretanto Matthew Bennett de la Universidad de Bournemouth quien ayudó a dirigir el estudio dijo: “Las huellas dejadas en White Sands dan una imagen de lo que estaba sucediendo. Adolescentes interactuando con niños más pequeños y adultos. Podemos pensar en nuestros antepasados ​​como bastante funcionales cazando y sobreviviendo. Pero lo que vemos aquí también es una actividad de juego y de diferentes edades que se unen. Una verdadera visión de estas primeras personas «.

La arqueología tradicional se basa en el descubrimiento de huesos y herramientas pero a menudo puede ser difícil de interpretar. Las huellas humanas proporcionan evidencia inequívoca de presencia y también de comportamiento. El profesor Bennett señaló que «la guinda del pastel aquí es que podemos fechar estos rastros con precisión utilizando lechos de semillas de zanja».

¿Nadie en China ha visto El planeta de los simios?

O tal vez sí. “El desarrollo de la biotecnología en China va en una dirección verdaderamente macabra” escribe Brandon Weichert de The Weichert Report en un artículo publicado en el sitio web American Greatness.

En una sociedad comunista con una ambición desenfrenada los investigadores persiguen una ciencia extraña. ¿Qué ocurre cuando se mezclan ADN de cerdo y de mono? Los experimentadores chinos pueden decírtelo. ¿Y qué hay de cultivar órganos similares a los humanos en animales? Sí también lo han hecho.

Además es posible que Beijing ya esté diseñando “super soldados”. “La inteligencia estadounidense muestra que China ha realizado pruebas en humanos con miembros del Ejército Popular de Liberación con la esperanza de desarrollar soldados con capacidades biológicamente mejoradas” escribió el entonces Director de Inteligencia Nacional John Ratcliffe en un artículo de opinión del Wall Street Journal del 3 de diciembre titulado “China es la amenaza número 1 para la seguridad nacional”.

No está claro hasta dónde han llegado los investigadores militares chinos. Sin embargo abogan por el uso de la herramienta de edición genética CRISPR para mejorar las capacidades humanas y la Comisión Militar Central del Partido Comunista está “apoyando la investigación en la mejora del rendimiento humano y la biotecnología de “nuevo concepto”.”

El Ejército Popular de Liberación se ha volcado en la edición genética de seres humanos. Como informan los destacados analistas Elsa Kania y Wilson VornDick hay “sorprendentes paralelismos en los temas repetidos por una serie de académicos y científicos del EPL de instituciones influyentes”.

Todos estos movimientos chinos están destinados a obtener el “dominio biológico”. “No hay” como señaló Ratcliffe “ningún límite ético en la búsqueda de poder de Beijing”.

Está claro que el Partido Comunista no solo piensa en los soldados. Un investigador chino es también la primera -y hasta ahora única- persona en editar genéticamente embriones humanos que produjeron nacimientos vivos.

He Jiankui mientras se encontraba en la Universidad de Ciencia y Tecnología del Sur en Shenzhen utilizó la herramienta CRISPR-Cas9 para eliminar el gen CCR5 para dar a las gemelas nacidas a finales de 2018 inmunidad al VIH pero quizás también para mejorar la inteligencia. El experimento evocó el programa de eugenesia del Tercer Reich para crear una “raza superior”.

China está en proceso de crear al “comunista perfecto” dijo Weichert también autor de Winning Space a Gatestone. “China está dirigida por un régimen que cree en la perfectibilidad de la humanidad y con la llegada de la investigación genética y biotecnológica moderna los planificadores centrales de China tienen ahora el propio genoma humano para perfeccionarlo según su agenda política”.

Los científicos chinos ya están en el camino del “dopaje genético” para hacer que las futuras generaciones sean más inteligentes e innovadoras que las de los países que se niegan a adoptar estos controvertidos métodos. “Lo que se está presenciando en China” ha escrito Weichert “es la convergencia de la tecnología avanzada con las biociencias de vanguardia capaz de alterar fundamentalmente toda la vida en este planeta según los caprichos de un régimen nominalmente comunista”.

He de Shenzhen tras el revuelo internacional causado por las noticias sobre su peligroso y poco ético trabajo fue multado y encarcelado por “llevar a cabo ilegalmente la edición genética de embriones humanos” pero en el estado de vigilancia casi total del Partido Comunista es evidente que contaba con el respaldo del Estado para sus experimentos.

Sus esfuerzos no son aislados. El equipo de noticias de la revista Nature informó en abril de 2015 que investigadores chinos de la Universidad Sun Yat-sen de Guangzhou en otro experimento pionero en el mundo editaron embriones humanos “no viables” con CRISPR-Cas9. “Una fuente china familiarizada con los desarrollos en el campo dijo que al menos cuatro grupos en China están persiguiendo la edición de genes en embriones humanos” afirmó el sitio web de la revista.

La acusación de Beijing contra He por tanto parece un intento de enfriar el furor y evitar que la comunidad científica internacional siga investigando las actividades de China.

Desgraciadamente los avances de China en la edición genética de embriones humanos para obtener super soldados está persuadiendo a otros de que deben hacer lo mismo. Pronto por ejemplo habrá “Le Terminator”. El gobierno francés acaba de dar el visto bueno a los soldados aumentados. “Tenemos que ser claros no todo el mundo tiene los mismos escrúpulos que nosotros y tenemos que prepararnos para ese futuro” declaró la ministra francesa de las Fuerzas Armadas Florence Parly.

Michael Clarke del Kings College de Londres declaró al tabloide británico The Sun que ahora existe una competencia biológica alimentada por China. ¿Tendremos pronto como ha bautizado la Sociedad Internacional de Ética Militar una raza de “homo robocopus”?

Si lo hacemos China no será la única culpable. “Lo más preocupante de estos esfuerzos es que China ha conseguido acceso a CRISPR y a la investigación genética y biotecnológica avanzada gracias a su relación con Estados Unidos y otras naciones occidentales avanzadas” dijo Weichert a Gatestone este mes. “Los laboratorios de investigación los inversores en biotecnología y los científicos estadounidenses se han esforzado por investigar y hacer negocios en el incipiente ámbito de la biotecnología en China explícitamente porque las normas éticas para la investigación en este delicado tema son muy bajas”.

“Esto resultará ser una amenaza estratégica a largo plazo para Estados Unidos que pocos en Washington en Wall Street o en Silicon Valley comprenden” dice Weichert refiriéndose a la rápida militarización de la biotecnología por parte de China.

El régimen chino no tiene ética ni decencia no se rige por la ley y no tiene sentido de la moderación. Sin embargo dispone de la tecnología necesaria para poner en marcha toda una nueva especie de seres humanos genéticamente mejorados y de paso de ganso.

La “Biblioteca humana” es un proyecto destinado a fomentar la comprensión y ayudar a la gente a desafiar sus prejuicios dijo su creadora Ronni Abergel quien creo la “biblioteca viviente” en el año 2000 durante el festival de música de Roskilde.

Posteriormente formó una organización sin ánimo de lucro y desde entonces el concepto ha llegado a más de 70 países de todo el mundo. Esta no es una librería con una selección amplia con diversos títulos sino que es un concepto completamente diferente.

Los usuarios pueden escuchar durante 30 minutos a cada persona. | Foto: AFP.

Para su creadora “una lectura es realmente una conversación” y explica por qué:

“En la mayoría de los casos las conversaciones fluyen con soltura y facilidad y suelen celebrarse en un entorno tranquilo como una biblioteca municipal”.

“La ‘Biblioteca Humana’ es un espacio seguro donde podemos explorar la diversidad. Aprender sobre las formas en que somos diferentes los unos de los otros y relacionarnos con personas que normalmente nunca conoceríamos y desafiar así nuestros prejuicios inconscientes” explica Abergel.

De acuerdo con su creadora a través de su iniciativa busca ayudar a la gente a ser “menos aprensiva más abierta más comprensiva y a aceptar su derecho a ser diferente”.

“Manejamos un espacio de aprendizaje neutral donde hay una oportunidad para que te involucres aprendas sobre ti mismo y otros grupos”.

¿Cómo funciona la biblioteca humana?

En la “Biblioteca Humana” la gente puede “pedir prestada” a una persona para que le cuente sobre sus historias y experiencias personales.

Así los usuarios pueden escuchar durante 30 minutos cómo es ser refugiado homosexual musulmán o discapacitado auditivo o preguntarle lo que quiera ya sea individualmente o en un pequeño grupo.

¿Qué libros tienen en la “Biblioteca humana” de Dinamarca?

Actualmente la “Biblioteca humana” cuenta con ocho “libros” que los curiosos pueden consultar para un domingo de otoño en Copenhague.

Uno de ellos es “Iben” de 46 años y quien es víctima de abusos sexuales y tiene problemas de salud mental.

En el caso de “Iben” las personas que lo “piden prestado” pueden elegir entre tres de sus “libros” orales:

Víctima de abusos sexuales

Vivir con un trastorno límite de la personalidad

Vivir con trastorno de estrés postraumático grave

Otro de los “libros humanos” disponibles es “Anders Fransen” de 36 años y quien padece ceguera y discapacidad auditiva.

Todos ellos se han situado en los 900 metros que separan la punta del Fangar con la playa de Lo Goleró. Las personas que han participado con embarcaciones kayaks o bien con las plataformas pesqueras se han ubicado en las zonas más profundas mientras que el resto lo han hecho en aquellos puntos donde el agua les llegaba hasta las rodillas. En la acción que se ha alargado durante más de una hora los participantes han llamado lemas como 'Lo delta diu prou' para denunciar que este paraje natural está «agonizando».

«Estamos perdiendo una media de entre cinco y diez metros de línea de costa al año eso significa que en un periodo muy breve podemos llegar a perder buena parte del delta la zona del Fangar es la más alta del delta lo cual significa que una vez el agua haya pasado la regresión será mucho más rápida» ha explicado Jordi Bartomeu portavoz del Movimiento de lucha por el delta del Ebro.

Por este motivo el activista ha reclamado la gestión de las arenas con planes de dragado. «La solución no es expropiar y echar atrás la línea de costa sino proteger el actual porque ahora tenemos el problema en las playas pero más adelante lo tendremos en las casas y en las tierras» ha manifestado.

En la acción también ha participado la Federación de Productores de Moluscos del delta del Ebro (Fepromodel). Uno de sus trabajadores Carles Fernández ha lamentado que la producción de moluscos y ostras se ha visto reducida por el cierre de la bahía. «Cada vez hay menos renovación de agua y se genera menos fitoplancton; también tenemos más mortalidad de entonces que hace que lo tengamos que traer de fuera los costes y las pérdidas acababan afectando los bolsillos de los productores» ha subrayado Fernández.

Y en este sentido ha apuntado que nuevos temporales como los del Gloria o del Filomena serán muy perjudiciales. «Cuando viene una catástrofe como estas se acelera mucho más el cierre y estamos con el corazón en un puño porque además vemos que la administración no hace nada» ha denunciado Fernández.

Los alcaldes de la Ametlla de Mar de Deltebre o de Sant Jaume d'Enveja entre otras autoridades locales también han formado parte de la cadena humana. El alcalde de l'Ampolla Paco Arasa ha celebrado la movilización ciudadana pero ha exigido una solución definitiva para esta problemática en los gobiernos catalán y español. «No sabemos cuándo se empezarán a aplicar las acciones del Plan del Delta de ahora hasta enero es época de temporales y nos preocupa muchísimo que no se haya hecho nada en el caso del Prat del Llobregat se han encendido las alarmas y aquí todavía no ha habido ninguna solución» se ha quejado Arasa.

La protesta ha acabado con la lectura de un manifiesto y con la actuación de la cantautora ebrense Montse Castellà."

This is one of those venues that very much sums up summer in Chicago where you get to enjoy live music with a beer in hand situated right on the lakefront where you can take in the beautiful cityscape as the sun sets behind it. This was the last show of 2021 to take place here and with Chicago’s weather you’ll understand why. The moment it was announced that Fall was here the temperatures started to take a dip and the final show was being threatened with some windy and stormy weather. Luckily the rain mostly stayed away so the fans got to enjoy the show in its entirety albeit a little windier than usual.

The night of Motor City rock began with original KISS guitarist Ace Frehley. The set was made up of songs primarily from his days with KISS such as “Detroit Rock City” “Deuce” and “Rocket Ride.” The Spaceman was greeted with cheers from the crowd as he performed his signature smoking guitar move during his guitar solo section.

The stage lights swaying in the wind added to the eerie haunted castle two-tier stage setup vibe. There was no messing around as the guitar-heavy band burst out onto the stage with the opening song “Feed My Frankenstein.” If ever there was a perfect way to start a set this was it! One by one we saw Glen Sobel take to his drum kit with fellow bandmates Nita Strauss Tommy Henriksen Ryan Roxie and Chuck Garric each taking to their positions striking a pose and letting rip. Just a few moments laterjoined them on stage as he was welcomed by cheers from the excited crowd. Many members of the audience had left their seats and flocked to the front railing to get as close as they could to the action.

The shock rocker is known for his show theatrics and it wasn’t long before the mighty Frankenstein’s monster came out to terrorize them as performed the first song of the evening. That wasn’t the last we saw of Frankenstein’s monster as he made a reappearance later in the set trying once again to take on Alice Cooper.

Whilst the theatrics makeup and various characters are such a prevalent part of any Alice Cooper show and let’s face it it’s a huge part of the attraction to these shows it doesn’t take away from the abundance of talent and musicianship present. Nita Strauss Tommy Henriksen and Ryan Roxie complement each other perfectly. Chuck Garric and Glen Sobel provide the strong heartbeat of the band. While each band member is always given their time to shine during these shows it feels like the current lineup is a well-oiled machine now and they were more front and center than usual. Not that we’re complaining.

If Alice Cooper was to take to an empty stage by himself you couldn’t help but be entertained. But add the showmanship the characters the musicianship of the band and the stage show there was always something (if not several things at one time) to grab your attention by the goolies and keep you entertained from beginning to end.

The show was technically in support of Cooper’s latest release Detroit Stories but they actually only performed two songs from that album. Much to the crowd’s delight the staple classics “Poison” “I’m Eighteen” “No More Mr. Nice Guy” and “Billion Dollar Babies” were ever-present.

As sad as we are that this show seemingly marked the end of summer we’re glad to have gone out with a bang rather than a whimper. As the crowd filtered out from the pavilion and the rain began to come down it didn’t matter. We’d had our show and nothing was going to spoil that.

The loss snapped Minnesota’s streak of 21 straight non-conference wins the longest streak in the country entering Saturday’s game. The Gophers’ previous non-conference loss had been Sept. 3 2015 against TCU.

It also marked Minnesota’s first loss to a non-Power 5 conference opponent since losing to North Dakota State on Sept. 24 2011.

“Give Bowling Green a lot of credit” said Gophers head coach P.J. Fleck. “I know how excited they are and they deserve it and they earned it. We did not deserve to win that football game whatsoever.”

Bowling Green came to Minneapolis as 31-point underdogs but used a strong defensive effort to slow down the Golden Gopher offense. Minnesota's fans booed their team at numerous points in the game while Falcons players jumped on the field in celebration after the upset was complete.

“I couldn't be more happy for a group of kids that have really been through a lot” said Bowling Green head coach Scott Loeffler. “We've got the 24-hour rule. We're going to celebrate for 24 hours and then we're going to get back to the office.""

The Gophers (2-2) had the ball with a chance to take the lead late in the fourth quarter after Bowling Green failed to fall on a muffed punt by Minnesota’s Trey Potts. But one play after recovering the fumble quarterback Tanner Morgan lofted a deep interception into the hands of Devin Taylor with 2:13 remaining. Morgan threw another pick with 17 seconds remaining.

The Gophers’ passing game struggled all day against the Falcons. Morgan was just 5-of-13 for 59 yards.

“I have to play way better” said Morgan who was also sacked four times Saturday.

McDonald scored on runs of one and three yards. He was 19-of-35 for 170 yards through the air.

Minnesota’s lone touchdown came on a 19-yard scramble by backup quarterback Cole Kramer.

Bowling Green team had lost two of its first three games and few people gave the Falcons a chance in this one especially after an impressive 30-0 win for Minnesota last weekend against Colorado.

But the Falcons never trailed by more than three and took advantage of the Gophers' mistakes: Minnesota was stuffed on a 4th-and-1 attempt that led to a Bowling Green touchdown. Morgan lost a fumble after an 18-yard run. And a roughing the kicker penalty on a Bowling Green punt in the fourth quarter gave the Falcons new life.

After Morgan's struggles Saturday Fleck was asked if there was any chance Minnesota would make a switch at quarterback.

“That hadn't even crossed my mind at all” Fleck said.

Next weekend the Gophers are on the road to face Purdue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlYXJmaWVsZC5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS92ZW51ZXNub3ctYXJ0aWNsZS1uZXctYWR2ZXJ0aXNpbmctb3Bwb3J0dW5pdHktcmlkZXMtdGhlLWJlbmNoLWluLWNvbGxlZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,VenuesNow Article - New Advertising Opportunity Rides The Bench In College,"VenuesNow: Posted by Don Muret | | Branding & Sponsorships

ANC GETS DEWALT TOOL BRAND VISIBILITY ON THE SIDELINES DURING FOOTBALL

Team benches are the newest piece of sponsorship inventory at college football stadiums as Power Five schools and their media rights holders search for creative ways to generate revenue at those facilities. ANC which is part of Learfield brokered a three-year deal with Stanley Black & Decker to place the DeWalt tool brand on team benches produced by Dragon Seats a Learfield partner supplying the structures for 25 schools.

Financial terms were not disclosed. Participants span the Atlantic Coast Conference Big Ten Big 12 Pac-12 and Mountain West. John Obropta ANC’s vice president of advertising sales was principally involved in the agreement. Obropta said expectations are moderate for brand exposure on television considering the benches are typically hidden by players sitting on them and standing in front of them along the sidelines. The Ohio State-Minnesota game Sept. 2 at Huntington Bank Stadium marked the launch of the DeWalt program followed by about a half-dozen games on the first full Saturday of the college football season.

Eric Smallwood president of Apex Marketing Group a firm that tracks media exposure for brands across sports and entertainment followed DeWalt coverage for a few games over the Labor Day weekend including the Sept. 3 Michigan State-Northwestern game. Smallwood estimated that the projected value for a school participating in the ANC/DeWalt program runs more than $185000 over the course of the season depending on the number of home games which can range from five to seven for the respective institutions. “I looked at games that didn’t have it and games that did have it” he said. “Where it comes into play is toward the end of the game if the quarterback is sitting on the bench and a coach is talking to him.”

Another instance occurred when the camera focused on the head coach and players behind him were dispersed in a manner in which the DeWalt brand was visible to the viewer Smallwood said. During the early stages of the season the small posts sticking up from the benches that carry the DeWalt brand provide a bonus for the schools he said. They’re helmet warmers and mostly used in the cold weather months. For now they’re uncovered exposing the sponsor’s logo. Smallwood said that without knowing the parameters of the ANC/DeWalt deal key variables to determine value extend to which network is broadcasting the game and whether DeWalt is reaching a national audience on a Saturday night on ABC compared with the Big Ten Network.

“When I did the projection I based it on a blend of factors” he said. For Stanley Black & Decker and DeWalt “it’s an ownable concept which is the thing they love” Obropta said. Obropta has been with ANC for 20 years. In 2015 Learfield acquired a controlling interest in ANC which is well known for producing customized software systems for videoboards at big league and college venues. or ANC television-visible signage has been a specialty and that’s where its relationship with Stanley Black & Decker started Obropta said. The company’s brands have been displayed on digital signs behind home plate at Major League Baseball stadiums. Over the past five years Stanley Black & Decker has grown tremendously acquiring Craftsman from Sears in 2017.

In August it bought the remaining 80% of MTD Holdings a private manufacturer of outdoor power equipment tied to the Cub Cadet and Troy-Bilt brands. “The genesis of our relationship is delivering TV-visible signage for whatever brand they’re trying to pump up” Obropta said. “The DeWalt brand sits squarely at the forefront with retailers. Everybody’s doing pretty well with Lowe’s and Home Depot selling their products.”

To keep the DeWalt line top of mind among college football fans Stanley Black & Decker came to ANC and Obropta searching for a bigger advertising platform. The firm did not previously have a presence in college football. Obropta circled back with Learfield which through its merger with IMG College in 2018 holds the multimedia rights to dozens of Power Five institutions. Learfield on its own had put together a program for college football with Dragon Seats “the Cadillac of player benches” with ventilation systems to keep players cool when it’s hot and warm them when it’s cold Obropta said. At the time Learfield was seeking a bench sponsor for activation he said. DeWalt filled that role. Stanley Black & Decker initially asked ANC to come up with inventory to match the success of the Allstate field goal nets and the State Farm basket stanchion pads in college basketball and the NBA a deal that Obropta worked on several years ago. The Allstate nets were already off limits. ANC had to find a different piece of inventory that was standard at college football stadiums across the country. The team benches stood out as a uniform feature at all those venues.

“They loved it and it was an overwhelming journey of tweaking the list to come up with 25 schools that were going to comply with the DeWalt branding” Obropta said. “We kept it in the ballpark in terms of potential budget the schools and conferences … to get the home and away matchups that we wanted.” Schools were also sticklers for displaying their team logos. In that respect all benches have a consistent look with the exception of school colors and mascot marks. Under terms of the deal the minimum is four benches a school but many are requesting twice that number which gives DeWalt “more real estate” on the sidelines Obropta said.

Some schools have talked about bringing the benches for their road games he said. In addition to the benches Stanley Black & Decker receives game day hospitality with a pregame tailgate party at all 25 schools to entertain employees and their top customers among the dealers selling their products. The sponsor also gets game tickets in a suite or other premium space inside the stadium Obropta said. LED ribbon board displays and a coordinated social media campaign are also part of the agreement. ANC holds the right to expand the DeWalt program to more schools.

“They’re going to own Saturday with the live game broadcasts and highlights” he said. “The more teams involved the better it’s going to be and the more robust it will look.” As the branded bench program evolves the NFL could potentially provide ANC with a future opportunity. “TV-visible signs locally are not approved in the NFL” Obropta said. “We’ve been trying to get field-level LED (signs) into the NFL for five years now. When the NFL decides to do that it will have to go through them. It’s something that could happen.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZ29waGVyc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvOS8yNS9mb290YmFsbC1nb3BoZXJzLWZhbGwtb24taG9tZWNvbWluZy10by1ib3dsaW5nLWdyZWVuLTE0LTEw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gophers Fall on Homecoming to Bowling Green 14-10,,,,

He got to take part in a 10 week programme at Cranfield University at the Defence Academy of the UK (Shrivenham Campus).

His fellowship experience was funded by the UK Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office. There he got to understand the policy and legislative approaches in cybersecurity.

This along with its implications for national security commercial opportunity crime prevention and the right to privacy were topics that Appaiah got to expand his knowledge on.

Hi all I’m Lahar (@cricketsnob); a Chevening Cyber Security Fellow. Today I’ll take you on #CheveningTours @CranfieldUni with these great people to see what the fellowship is about.

Below we speak to this corporate lawyer and Chevening Fellow from India about his experience in the UK and his advice for international students:

Tell us a bit about yourself and your career as a corporate lawyer.

I work as a corporate lawyer with IBM in India which means I spend a lot of time at work on privacy and data protection. I also handle a broad set of responsibilities: corporate matters mergers acquisitions disputes and litigation and labour and employment.

Yesterday #Chevening Cyber Security Fellows were welcomed to the UK @foreignoffice to present their final papers to an audience of industry specialists foreign office staff and their colleagues. Congrats to our fellows on their great achievements during their time in the UK. pic.twitter.com/GgF87NltMA — Chevening Awards🇬🇧 (@CheveningFCDO) May 31 2019

I’m a graduate of India’s premier law college: the National Law School of India University and have previously worked with Infosys Technologies.

I’ve been fortunate to do many fascinating things through work but one experience that stands out was a one-month assignment in Ecuador South America.

I was there as a member of IBM’s Service Corps where I worked with a local think tank on data driven solutions for local governments.

What made you then apply for the Chevening Cyber Security Fellowship? Walk us through the application and experience in the UK.

The first thing I noticed was that this was not just a technical course in cybersecurity rather the focus was on cybersecurity policy and governance. As a privacy lawyer in the tech sector this was a unique opportunity to connect with key stakeholders in India as well as the UK.

I also had the chance to gain insights into a topic that is gaining momentum for the near future. The application process was quite comprehensive.

I had to clearly state my reasons for applying and give insights into what I could contribute to the course. I was also asked to explain what I hoped to gain from the fellowship and I would leverage it once I returned to India.

How do you use the knowledge and skills gained in your fellowship in your current job?

During the fellowship we had to don several hats which I would have not gotten to wear as a corporate lawyer. These helped me gain a nuanced understanding of the perspectives of various stakeholders in any cybersecurity matter.

It also taught me that as in life there are often no absolute answers but a question of balancing various factors.

What were the practical learning elements in your course? Do you get to apply the theories you gained during your fellowship experience now?

We had several practical exercises — some of which were great fun — such as dismantling a computer and putting it back again. We also got to understand forensic evidence.



Besides this we also had several field visits including one to Scotland Yard and one to Oxford University.

What do you wish you had learned more during the programme?

There were a few other Chevening Fellowships that happened at the same time and a few topics with the potential for overlap. I’d have loved to have a few joint sessions with the other fields (science and technology financial services and journalism).

What advice do you have for international prospective applicants for a Chevening Fellowship?

One suggestion for prospective applicants: do not just put down your professional achievements but think about how you fit into the larger industry and subject-matter ecosystem. Also think about how you can contribute your expertise to the fellowship.

Nancy Austin of Salt Lake City Utah passed away September 25 2021. She was born January 10 1937 daughter to Edith and George Elliott sister to Tom Elliott and granddaughter of George Albert Smith. Her fondest memories were sitting on the stand with her grandfather during the General Conference.

She was raised in Salt Lake City and graduated from East High and later and later graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in Education. Throughout this time her closest friends were Artelle and CloAnn relationships that lasted her entire life.

She married her missionary in the Salt Lake Temple that she waited for who came from Pasadena California named Robert DeMott Austin. Upon his graduation from BYU they moved to Berkeley California while he obtained his MBA. After graduating he took a position with IBM and they moved to San Jose and started their family. Nancy began her teaching career in earnest in San Jose and she taught for many years.

A highlight for her was the three years living in Paris while her husband was there on assignment for IBM. When that time was done they moved back to California where she returned to her teaching career.

After retiring Nancy moved to North Carolina in 1998 and loved being there for 23 years with her son and daughter-in-law. There she loved being the live-in grandmother to her two grandsons. She especially loved the association of her lady friends at church.

Nancy was a righteous mother who cared deeply for her family and many friends in her life. She had a huge heart and was loved by many.

She is survived by her son and daughter Mark Austin and Jodi Austin. The loves of her life were her grandchildren Drew Jared Cole Jose Jr. Anna and her great granddaughter Amiah.

A special thank you to Hospice Melissa (her nurse angel) and Chancellor Gardens during her final days for their kindness and support.

One study found one in five American workers performed their jobs from home pre-pandemic while 71% of American workers now do their jobs remotely all or almost all of the time.

Although some jobs still require in-person attendance roles like writing editing and even sales have proven to be easily accomplished from a distance. If you have or are currently pursuing a computer science degree you are in an ideal position to live your dream of working from home.

Computer Science and Remote Work

Although remote work is only a recognizable term for most as of the past year and a half computer science and IT positions were some of the first remote roles. Companies wishing to expand their IT teams while saving resources employed computer science professionals for distance work.

The term ‘telecommuting’ was coined during the 1970s OPEC crisis and offered as an alternative to traditional office scheduling to account for scarce fossil fuel resources. In the 1983 IBM experimented with remote work and by the late 80s 2000 company employees were working from home. The early 90s innovations in WiFi only accelerated the expansion of work from home careers. Now entire companies are launching as remote-only entities.

Remote Work Income

The computer science field is a rapidly expanding sector. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts computer science and information technology (IT) will grow 11% by 2029 a faster rate than most industries. Although one might think remote positions may offer less lucrative salaries working from home can in fact yield incomes similar to traditional in-office work.

Computer software engineers can earn a median of $85000 per year to start while computer scientists programmers and system administrators can earn around $57000 annually. According to the Census Bureau of the households with annual incomes of $200000 or more 71% transitioned to at-home work in 2020. This statistic is more than double that of households that made $50000 and $74999 in the same period.

Remote Computer Science Positions

There are various intriguing and rewarding computer science remote jobs for which you can apply. Here are a few:

Cloud Solutions Architect - A cloud solutions architect can work remotely to develop cloud computing strategies supervise application creation and operate within a cloud atmosphere. These professionals are generally expected to have experience with a wide spectrum of programming languages.

Drawbacks of Working from Home

As mentioned before remote computer science is a field in which you do not need to take a salary cut. In fact a large quantity of high-earners switched indefinitely to remote work during the pandemic.

The setup costs for establishing an at-home work system are fairly reasonable and just about every task can be performed with a laptop. As far as office materials are concerned these are usually marginal. Some companies offer their employees yearly office supply stipends to accommodate remote work formats.

One key drawback to consider when choosing a remote work path is the absence of in-person social interaction common in an office. Although some specialists may find this factor desirable others may miss the comradery and collaboration often derived from in-person meetings. Consider carefully whether or not you would prefer face-to-face interaction or digital correspondence.

Another notable challenge for some is the lack of structure of the remote work format. To successfully complete assignments at home it’s vital to establish sensible scheduling and workflow rules. It’s perhaps even more important to follow them. Planning and executing structured workflows is crucial to ensuring at-home work is completed on time and thoroughly.

Is Remote Work Possible with a Computer Science Degree?

Overall it is entirely possible to pursue a rewarding computer science career while working remotely.

Remote IT occupations continue to expand and computer science roles are some of the most flexible.

To begin your remote work journey start by taking a careful glance at your resume. Think about possible remote experience in your past. Make sure to highlight this expertise as ‘virtual’ or ‘remote’ to ensure your desired employer understands you have remote experience.

Start researching positions on job boards like Working Nomads and We Work Remotely. These specific platforms specialize in providing users with remote work listings. You can either search by a company for which you’d like to work or the general occupation for which you’d like to apply. Either way starting to seek ideal positions will help you understand contemporary role requirements and adjust to position yourself to score your dream remote job.

Working From Home is in Your Reach

From all of the lessons the pandemic has taught us one thing is certainly clear: remote work is here to stay. Available positions in the computer science field are only expanding so grab your laptop and start seeking your desired job today. Start by visiting and browsing remote job boards to understand requirements your dream job requires and what next steps you need to take to put yourself in the best position in the eyes of your future possible employer."

Nelson Peltz is an investor businessman and founding partner of Trian Fund Management.

Get Our Activist Investing Case Study! Get The Full Activist Investing Study In PDF

He started his career as a delivery driver for his grandfather’s food distribution business A. Peltz and Sons. Ultimately he and his brother ended up running the company acquiring other companies and listing it as Flagstaff Corp.

Peltz and CFO Peter May left the company in 1983 and bought Triangle Industries which manufactured vending machines. They used the company to make a series of acquisitions before selling the company to Pechiney SA in 1988.

Peltz and May’s next company was Triarc Cos which they used to make opportunistic acquisitions of companies that found themselves in trouble. In 1997 Triarc bought Snapple from Quaker Oats and in 2000 sold it to Cadbury Schweppes - this turnaround play was eventually featured as a case study at Harvard Business School.

Peltz May and Edward Garden founded Trian Fund Management in 2005 to focus on activist investing. The company now called Trian Partners manages $12 billion.

As a result of his activist investing Peltz has found himself on the board of numerous corporations over the years. He is currently Chairman of Wendy’s Company (NasdaqGS: WEN) and serves on the boards of Legg Mason (NYSE: LM) Proctor and Gamble (NYSE: PG) Ingersoll Rand (NYSE:IR) and Mondelez International (NasdaqGS: MDLZ).

Peltz has built a personal fortune of $1.68 billion during his career. In 2013 Forbes magazine listed him as one of the top 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers for the year. The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) has also recognized Peltz as one of the most influential people in corporate governance.

The Old School Activist Investor

Nelson Peltz would be best described as an activist investor. His style of investing has as much to do with operational issues as it does with traditional investment factors like valuation.

Unlike many other investors Peltz rose through the ranks of an industrial company. No doubt he uses this experience when restructuring troubled companies. The first business he ran was in the food distribution and wholesaling industry and the second was an industrial manufacturing business. Since then Peltz has never strayed from these two industries preferring to stick to what he knows (i.e. circle of competence).

Trian only invests in companies if Peltz believes he can gain a seat on the board and make fundamental changes to the structure of the company and the way it is run.

Over the years Trian has invested in Heinz Cadbury Kraft Foods Wendy’s DuPont PepsiCo and Family Dollar. Most of these investments were made with the intention of also bringing about structural or leadership changes at the companies.

Peltz’s first high-profile turnaround success was Snapple. The Quaker Oats Company had bought it for $1.7 billion but ran into cash flow difficulties. Peltz then managed to buy the company for $300 million in 1997 return it to profitability and then sell it to Cadbury Schweppes for $1.45 billion in 2000.

In 2008 Trian used its holding in Triarc Cos to acquire Wendy’s. Triarc already owned Arby’s restaurants and the two chains were merged. Arby’s was later sold to Roark Capital Group leaving Trian in control of Wendy’s. Peltz often uses one company to acquire a larger company before spinning off the smaller business.

Peltz’s strategies often rely heavily on changing the makeup of the board of a company. Sometimes these attempts are successful but just as often they fail.

In 2013 Trian bought a $1.2 billion stake in Du Pont and began pushing for four new board members to be appointed. Though the bid was unsuccessful it did eventually result in the CEO resigning and the company embarking on a cost-cutting plan.

In 2017 Trian bought a significant stake in Proctor and Gamble and pushed for Peltz to be appointed to the board. There was significant initial push back but he ultimately gained a seat on the board in December prompting speculation that the company may eventually split into two.

Trian Fund Management's Latest Form 13F Filing

On November 14th 2017 Nelson Peltz's firm Trian Fund Management filed their quarterly Form 13F regulatory filing. I reviewed the 13F filing to review holdings in Trian Fund Management's 8 stock portfolio.

Trian Fund Management's stock portfolio totals $13.0 billion according to the latest filing. The list value of stock holdings is down -2.1% when compared to the last quarter. As a benchmark the S&P 500 was up 3.9% over the same period.

Quarter-over-Quarter Turnover (QoQ Turnover) measures the level of trading activity in a portfolio. Trian Fund Management's QoQ Turnover for the latest quarter was 9.8% so the firm likely has high conviction in these holdings as indicated by the low turnover ratio.

Trian Fund Management's Stock Holdings

The Ideas section of finbox.io tracks top investors and trending investment themes. You can get the latest data on the holdings discussed below at the Nelson Peltz page. The following table summarizes his firm's entire stock holdings reported in the last filing:

Trian Fund Management Largest Holdings Ticker Name Holding ($mil) % Of Portfolio PG Procter and Gamble $3448.9 26.6% SYY Sysco Corp. $2400.4 18.5% MDLZ Mondelez Intl Inc. $1728.2 13.3% GE General Electric Co. $1713.2 13.2% BK Bank of New York Mellon $1186.3 9.1% PNR Pentair PLC $1033.1 8.0% DWDP DowDuPont Inc. $867.2 6.7% WEN Wendys Co. $606.2 4.7%

Although Trian Fund Management does not take a large number of positions the firm makes huge bets on the positions it does take. The average value from each of the eight positions is a sizeable $1.6 billion!

Managers with more than $100 million in qualifying assets under management are required to disclose their holdings to the SEC each quarter via 13F filings. Qualifying assets include long positions in U.S. equities and ADRs call/put options and convertible debt securities. Shorts cash positions foreign investments and other assets are not included. It is important to note that these filings are due 45 days after the quarter end date. Therefore Trian Fund Management's holdings above represent positions held as of September 30th and not necessarily reflective of the fund's current stock holdings.

However most can agree that with thousands of stocks traded on U.S. exchanges doing thorough research on each one is nearly impossible for smaller investors. Leveraging the resources of the largest hedge funds on Wall Street can be a powerful way to narrow down the list.

As of this writing I did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities and this is not a buy or sell recommendation on any security mentioned.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier this month Intel engineers posted their initial Linux kernel enablement around x86 User Interrupts with this feature premiering with Xeon ""Sapphire Rapids"" CPUs. As implied by the name the User Interrupt functionality allows for interrupts to bypass the kernel for more efficient low-latency low-utilization interrupts being received by other user-space tasks. Intel talked more about User Interrupts this week at LPC2021.Sohil Mehta of Intel presented at Linux Plumbers Conference on their recently-posted kernel patches for enabling x86 User Interrupts. User Interrupts for delivering events directly to user-space should be a big win for improving Linux inter-process communication and I/O events. The patches currently out are focused on user-to-user IPC while coming soon will be patches for User Interrupts support for going from kernel-to-user followed by allowing User Interrupts sent from other devices directly to user-space.

User Interrupts along with other features like AMX have me very excited for Sapphire Rapids next year. As noted earlier this month and reiterated during this presentation User Interrupts can be up to 9x faster for lower IPC communication latency with Sapphire Rapids.Those wanting to learn more about this exciting Intel addition coming to their next-generation Xeon Scalable processors and pending kernel support can see the presentation below along with this slide deck",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vYW1kLW9yLWludGVsLXdoeS1vbmx5LXR3by1jaG9pY2VzLWNwdXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD or Intel?

According to VideoCardz the top-end Intel Alder Lake i9-12900K just beat the AMD Ryzen 9 5950X again this time on the built-in benchmark for CPU-Z.

A leaked screenshot of the CPU-Z benchmark score was uploaded to the Chinese site Bilibili.

Here is the alleged screenshot:

As you can see there the upcoming Intel Core i9-12900K scored 825 points in single core.

This score might not sound that much but it's actually outclassing literally everything in the current database which has the two 5th gen Ryzen 9 SKUs from AMD as its top dogs behind the 11th gen i9-11900K.

The Intel Alder Lake flagship's most common competitor the AMD Ryzen 9 5950X actually sits in 3rd place with a single core score of 647 trailing the Ryzen 9 5900X by a single point.

As for the 11th gen chip that's the current top scorer it only managed 682 points.

Intel still hasn't announced new details about their upcoming 12th gen lineup aside from its expected release date: Nov. 19 2021.

Whatever is known about it however is that it's going to support DDR5 and DDR4 memory will be on the so-called Intel 7 process (aka 10nm Enhanced SuperFin) and will be on the LGA 1700 socket reported PCGamer.

Intel Beatdown

This newest leaked benchmark is just one in a series that has shown the flagship Intel Alder Lake CPU handily beat any competition from AMD these past few weeks.

Earlier there was news that the 12900K handily beat the 5950X in a multi-core Geekbench test.

Tom's Hardware reported that Team Blue's top dog scored 17299 points while the 5950X only managed 12257.

Next leaked Cinebench scores reported on by VideoCardz showed the Intel chip once again handing the Ryzen 9 competitor a beating; allegedly scoring over 2000 points on a single core test in Cinebench R23.

The leaker however suspiciously covered the multi-core score for the CPU.

Finally the first gaming workload for the i9-12900K: the RTS game ""Ashes of the Singularity"" which had it average 146.6 FPS at 1440p high settings with an RTX 3080 and 64GB of RAM.

The 5950X could only muster 104.6 FPS.

Reclaiming Lost Honor?

Judging from these benchmarks Intel isn't playing around. They likely recognized that they've been basically the laughingstock of the tech world for the past four years which has been largely dominated by AMD Ryzen.

To be competitive once more they knew that they'd have to change a lot of things. And so Intel Alder Lake was born: a new hybrid CPU architecture based on ARM tech which promises excellent single and multi-core scores across a wide range of workloads.

But of course these are leaked benchmarks. There's no way to know if the numbers presented are accurate until Intel officially launches Alder Lake later this year.

So take everything with a pinch of salt.

These special-purpose acquisition companies are often called “blank-check companies” because they have no real business other than hunting for privately owned businesses to buy. They do that armed with cash provided by investors who bought into the SPAC’s initial public offering.

SPACs exploded in popularity last year and the furor reached a fever pitch early in 2021 when they were raising an average of $6 billion every week. They offered companies like DraftKings SoFi and 23andMe a quicker way to get their shares on a stock exchange: by merging with a SPAC and taking its place on the market rather than going through a traditional IPO. And SPACs offered investors a way to get into those exciting potentially high-growth companies.

The industry got so hot that to distinguish themselves SPACs began touting their celebrity investors and advisers such as baseball’s Alex Rodriguez and music’s Sammy Hagar. It got wild enough that the Securities and Exchange Commission put out a warning in March for investors not to invest in a SPAC “just because someone famous sponsors or invests in it or says it is a good investment.”

Since the spring though the industry’s momentum has dropped sharply. Patience may be key for investors hoping to find bargains in the SPAC world now a sharp turnaround from the day-to-day frenzy that characterized them early this year.

Worries about increased regulatory scrutiny and periods of rising interest rates helped cool off high-growth areas of the market. SPACs also drew fire from critics who said they were examples of a dangerous bubble inflating across the stock market as investors chased the next hot thing.

As a result only seven SPACs had IPOs last month raising just $1.3 billion. That’s down from February’s 146 which raised $45.8 billion according to FactSet.

Not only are fewer SPACs going public through with IPOs the ones already in the market and still hunting for targets have seen their share prices drop. Many are trading below $10. That’s a key threshold because the cash that SPACs raise in their IPOs sits in trust accounts earning interest. If the SPAC can’t find a company to buy within the timeframe detailed in its IPO that cash gets returned to investors which often is just a little less than $10 per share.

More than 90% of active SPACs were recently trading below their par value according to Goldman Sachs.

That means the typical SPAC still looking for a target recently was offering a 2.7% return if an investor bought it and simply waited until redemption the Goldman Sachs strategists say. Of course that could mean a wait of 17 months for the typical SPAC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbGFzdHdvcmRvbnNwb3J0cy5jb20vcHJvd3Jlc3RsaW5nLzIwMjEvMDkvMjUvaWNlLXJpYmJvbi1uYWdveWEtcmliYm9uLWlpaS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nagoya Ribbon III Presented by Ice Ribbon (9/26/21) - Full Card,"Ice Ribbon returns to Nagoya for the aptly named event Nagoya Ribbon III. Taking place on September 26 this show features a six-match card including an International Ribbon Tag Team Championship defense against some interesting opponents.

Nagoya Ribbon III Full Card

Ram Kaicho and Maika Ozaki vs Ibuki Hoshi and Yappy

Coming off their unsuccessful tag title challenge Ram Kaicho and Maika Ozaki look to get some more experience as a tag team as they take on Yappy and Ibuki Hoshi. Kaicho and Ozaki make a great team that differs from what Ozaki and Maya Yukihi brought showcasing fun tag moves. Hoshi recently lost out on the ICExInfinity Championship. However she proved herself as the next young talent in her chop exchange with Tsukasa Fujimoto. This is a great opener for this light show and it seems like RxE will get the win.

Totoro Satsuki vs Miku Aono

One of two singles matches on this card features Miku Aono making her return to Ice Ribbon. Since Actwres girl’Z and Ice Ribbon formed a partnership Aono has been featured quite frequently on Ice Ribbon. She had a failed attempt at the International Ribbon tag team titles with Nao Ishikawa. However Aono looks to get another singles victory under her belt. Her opponent Totoro Satsuki challenged for the IW-19 Championship. Other than this Satsuki hasn’t done much so this might be the best time for Aono to get another victory over someone in Ice Ribbon.

Hamuko Hoshi and Rina Yamashita vs Saori Anou and Suzu Suzuki

Saori Anou and Suzu Suzuki are the newest team in Ice Ribbon and have already made quite an impact by racking up wins and showing great chemistry. However at Nagoya Ribbon III they face Rina Yamashita and Hamuko Hoshi. Yamashita defeated Suzuki in an incredibly brutal deathmatch to defend her FantastICE Championship. Whenever they get into the ring together it’s a hard-hitting affair. This could go either way but if Anou and Suzuki get another win they could very well challenge for the tag team titles next.

Mochi Miyagi and Tsukasa Fujimoto vs Tsukushi Haruka and Thekla

At the last Ice Ribbon show after Tsukasa Fujimoto successfully defended her ICExInfinity title against Ibuki Hoshi Tsukushi Haruka came out and dropkicked her demanding a title match; this tag team bout serves as a primer for that. The four women in this match are amazing in their own ways whether they’re underrated in the eyes of fans or not. With that said all eyes will be on Fujimoto and Haruka because of how much history they have together. This is certainly going to be one of the stand-out matches of this card and it’s almost too close to call.

Akane Fujita vs Yuuki Mashiro

The Gacha Kingdom members square off in the semi-main event of the show. When Yuuki Mashiro faced the legend Aja Kong she put her gacha title on the line and subsequently lost it in minutes. This didn’t last long as Akane Fujita and Rina Yamashita stole it back for their leader. Despite all the wacky chaos that Mashiro seems to get up to when she’s alongside Fujita and Yamashita she’s putting the pieces together to be quite a solid wrestler. Mashiro might be a bit too early into her career to get a pinfall victory against one of the more protected members of the roster but these two teammates will have a great match together.

International Ribbon Tag Team Championship: Azure Revolution (Maya Yukihi and Risa Sera) vs “RebelxEnemy” (Maika Ozawa (Onryo) and Maya Yukipe (Konaka))

For fans that don’t keep up with the company 666 that Ram Kaicho frequents RebelxEnemy have been feuding with “RebelxEnemy” which happens to be Onryo Konaka Taro Yamada and Hamuko Hoshi dressed as each of the members. Although Maya Yuhiki and Risa Sera are serious professionals Yukihi has cracked up laughing at Konaka dressed up as her which should make for something different from what usually happens in Ice Ribbon. On their quest to have the most tag title defenses in history this is a fun relaxed match to get another defense in after their hard-fought battle against the actual RebelxEnemy members.

The movie based on a true story follows the life of Chris Gardner a salesman and single father. While Gardner manages to provide for his family on his sales job at one point he decides to take an unpaid internship as a stockbroker in a large firm. Taking the internship leads him to become homeless but he persists in the cut-throat world of the stock market before finally making a cut and landing a job at the firm – where he then literally goes from rags to riches.

This is one portrayal of the stockbroker. As a humble head down honest worker that believes in the American dream and works hard to come out of their life’s circumstances. The other significant representation of the stockbroker in pop culture was the 2013 movie The Wolf of Wall Street. Far from the emotional roller-coaster that was The Pursuit of Happyness this movie saw Leonardo DiCaprio star as a cocaine fuelled high-stakes Wall Street stockbroker that has perfected the art of the hard sale engages in pump-and-dump schemes regularly with glee and ends up being put in the slammer by the FBI and the SEC.

Both of these representations are vastly different but they do tell us one thing – the stockbroker is a bonafide character of the capitalist story. Much like the 9-5 banker heading to work in the morning in a hat and a long-coat briefcase hanging at his side or the door-to-door salesman or the entrepreneur (or startup founder these days) the stockbroker is a symbol. They are a symbol not just of the accumulation of wealth the fragility of the system and the capitalist lifestyle – they are also elusive figures that can make big money through their profession both for themselves and for their clients.

What is a stockbroker? They are financial professionals who execute orders in the market on behalf of clients. Most stockbrokers work for a brokerage firm and handle transactions for a number of individual and institutional customers. Stockbrokers are often paid on a commission basis although compensation methods vary by employer. Brokerage firms and broker-dealer companies are also sometimes referred to generically as stockbrokers.

The function of the stockbroker is two-fold. The first thing they do is that they actually do the technical work of executing trades that their clients want them to make. That means they are making entries coordinating trades and pushing buttons on a computer. The second function is more abstract and also more dicey. Advice. Brokers can give you advice on what stocks you should invest in and which ones you should avoid. The first function anyone can learn and do the second is an analytical gift and brokers can be highly sought after because of their skill and ability to make the right calls for their clients. This is often how they end up making a lot of money.

Now the PSX is not exactly the New York Stock Exchange. There is a vast difference between the worlds of 11 Wall Street New York and Stock Exchange Building Stock Exchange Road Karachi. However one of the telling sights of the PSX is still that brokers are everywhere and you need them to maneuver your way around the floor. Even if you are savvy and don’t need anyone giving you advice you will still need them to execute trades for you. This is the role and nature of the stockbroker in Pakistan’s stock market.

How it works in Pakistan

If you want to buy or sell shares as a retail investor you should know that most of it is done through exchanges like the Pakistan Stock Exchange. An exchange is essentially a marketplace for shares where buyers and sellers meet and decide on a trading price. If you’ve seen movies about stock market trading you’ve probably seen scenes where there are traders yelling across a physical trading floor. As charming as the idea of spittle landing in your eyes as your eardrums face a cacophony of large angry frustrated men shouting is in this day and age most trades are carried out virtually through a network of computers.

Once shares are issued in a primary market through an IPO (we’ve explained those already) they can then be listed on the stock market which is a secondary market. A secondary market is essentially one where investors trade second hand or already issued securities. You no longer deal with the issuing company here. Companies only really offer shares in their stock through IPOs. When this happens the general public can go crazy and make bids for the shares. However once those shares have been sold they are the property of the person that has bought them. To sell those shares or trade them the owner of the share goes to the PSX which is where other buyers find them and deals can be made. It is essentially a marketplaces where buyers and sellers come to trade – the modern day equivalent of a grand bazaar.

However there is a problem. Say you have a share that you want to sell or are going to the PSX to look for companies to invest in. Once you get there you don’t simply walk up to a stall or a booth and ask the price. The exchange is simply a place where buyers and sellers meet and since shares are not tangible objects that can be handed around. Because of this you need a middleman to actually carry out the deal and execute it – pushing buttons essentially.

These middlemen are called stock brokers. A stock broker is an agent or firm that charges a fee or commission for carrying through buy and sell orders for investors. A brokerage firm acts as a middleman connecting buyers and sellers in order to facilitate transactions. There are essentially two types of brokers. Institutional brokers have large companies as their clients and trade on their behalf. They usually have investment banking divisions and help with IPOs as well. These brokers also had advisory and brokerage facilities. Personal stock brokers offer investment banking advisory and brokerage to small businesses and individual investors. When we say advisory we mean research and assessment of the index companies and sectors. Essentially you have large firms with sharp top of their batch brokers that also serve as advisors and execute complicated transactions that might not be easily done or understood by the average broker. These are major trades and buyouts with multiple beneficiaries.

Do I need a broker?

Yes. People like you and me can’t just walk into a stock exchange to trade shares the same way we can’t walk into the SBP to get a loan. In order to carry out a trade you need someone that is a member of the stock exchange namely a broker. Brokers buy and sell shares for themselves to make money and also on behalf of their clients. Every broker needs to be registered with the SECP and follow the required regulations.

So let’s say you have a share in company X. It isn’t a liquid share with little free float and little demand. When your broker puts up a sell order on your behalf it is visible by all the brokers on their computer screens. If someone wants to buy the given quantity at your price then the transaction is carried out. Each time you buy or sell shares a broker will charge a flat rate or % commission. Stock broker costs depend on the extent of services you avail from them. An alternative to this is to get yourself registered as a broker but that requires fulfilling the SECP requirements.

So how do you get a broker exactly? You can’t just walk up to them and hope they’ll tell you what to do. First things first is to round up your documents. You’re going to need a copy of your CNIC current salary slip a copy of a utility bill your bank statement a CNIC for a close relative and a cheque with the money you’re going to invest.

Nowadays most brokers are allowing online account opening. The extent however is limited and the process is not so great. However before you open up an account define your objectives. What type of trading do you plan on undertaking and how you want to carry out investments. Shortlist brokers and services. Sometimes brokers provide advisory if you have a bigger account. Choose a broker that fits your needs. Open an account with a brokerage firm and also a CDC sub account and a CDC investor account. Deposit the money and then begin your investment journey."

Photo: IC

China on Sunday released its first white paper specifically on the population dynamics of its Xinjiang region and by citing data from the seven national censuses the white paper showed that the population of ethnic minorities in the region has grown fast in both size and quality with the Uygur population having increased from 3.61 million in 1953 to 11.62 million in 2020 refuting the West's ""genocide"" accusation with undeniable facts.Titled ""Xinjiang Population Dynamics and Data"" it is the first white paper released by the State Council Information Office since 2015 that specifically displays demographic development in Xinjiang for the past seven decades. It is also the 10th white paper released by the office on Xinjiang - previous ones covered human rights achievements vocational training and education centers employment and anti-terrorism measures.

Xinjiang Population Dynamics and Data

The white paper contains six parts - population growth in Xinjiang the latest demographics of the region demographic changes in the Uygur population factors contributing to Xinjiang's demographic development the prospects of the regional population and falsehoods fabricated by anti-China forces.The white paper was released against the backdrop of anti-China forces' hyping Xinjiang topics in recent years in an attempt to nail China for the crime of ""genocide"". The white paper uses solid data and scientific demographic analysis to refute their claims Li Jianxin a demographer from Peking University who participated in the drafting of the white paper told the Global Times.Data from the white paper showed that the population of Xinjiang particularly that of its ethnic minorities has grown fast in both size and quality and life expectancy has seen a substantial increase. According to preliminary data from the seventh national census in 2020 the total population of Xinjiang was 25.85 million among which the Han ethnic group numbered 10.92 million and ethnic minorities 14.93 million. The population of ethnic groups in Xinjiang increased from 4.45 million in 1953 to 14.93 million in 2020.The Uygur population grew at a compound annual growth rate of 1.67 percent during the first two decades in the 21st century which was much higher than that of the country's ethnic minority population which stood at 0.83 percent. The Uygur population grew from 3.61 million in 1953 to more than 11.62 million in 2020. Uygurs accounted for 83.74 percent of the population in the four prefectures in southern Xinjiang.Previously some anti-China forces and scholars for example German ""scholar"" Adrian Zenz cited the natural growth rate data on Uygurs from 2017 to 2018 which showed a decline to say that China is ""suppressing"" the birth rates of ethnic groups.These anti-China scholars who have no professional demographic knowledge are racking their brains to seek ""evidence"" for their guilty presumption against China. The demographic situation in Xinjiang like other places in China and the world has seen a shift in the trend from high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates and many factors contributed to the changes Li said.One important reason is the social and economic development in Xinjiang which can be seen from local residents' education levels especially for females. Li noted that he found in field surveys in southern Xinjiang that previously girls around 15 years old would graduate from middle school and get married then give birth to their first second and third children. But in recent years with the increase of education among females few girls aged 15-19 got married or gave birth.Data from the white paper echoed Li's remarks. It noted that in Xinjiang the average years of education for people aged 15 and above rose from 9.27 in 2010 to 10.11 in 2020 0.2 years higher than the national average of 9.91 and ranking 10th across China. Compared with 2010 the number of people with a university education rose from 10613 to 16536 per 100000 persons.The change of fertility patterns is the result of development in the fields of education and health the implementation of laws and de-radicalization. It fits the trend of demographic development and has nothing related to ""genocide"" said Li.Xinjiang's measures on anti-terrorism and de-radicalization also help liberate local women with more of them coming out to work and earn money.With the development of industries in the region for example in textiles and apparel more jobs are offered to women. The wider their horizons become the more they would decide whether or when to have children an expert on the economy from Xinjiang University of Finance & Economics who also joined in drafting the white paper and asked for anonymity told the Global Times.The expert noted that this phenomenon fits the laws of economic development. The West which experienced similar development patterns but now uses the changes of fertility to attack China is very ridiculous.""They are not protecting the human rights of ethnic groups in Xinjiang on the contrary their sanctions on Xinjiang's cotton and other products hurt the livelihoods of local residents - they are violating Xinjiang residents' human rights!"" said the expert.Different from previous white papers on Xinjiang the white paper directly refuted some lies by anti-China forces for example on ""forced labor"" ""mandatory sterilization"" and ""cultural genocide.""The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948 provides a clear definition of genocide - acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group. A country can only be convicted of genocide by a competent international judicial institution with proper jurisdiction in strict accordance with the requirements and procedures stipulated by the relevant conventions and international law.However the Chinese government protects the rights of the Uygurs and all other ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang in accordance with the law. This fact stands in sharp contrast to the fabrications by anti-China forces. There has been no forced labor sterilization or cultural genocide in Xinjiang said the white paper.The Chinese government will continue to promote unity harmony and cultural progress and strive for a prosperous and eco-friendly Xinjiang and the region's march toward modernization will not be stopped by any force and its future is bright and secure read the white paper.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zdGFuZm9yZC5lZHUvcHJlc3Mvdmlldy80MTE5NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stanford-led research reveals potential of an overlooked climate change solution,"September 26 2021 Stanford-led research reveals potential of an overlooked climate change solution Analyses lay out a blueprint for speeding development of atmospheric removal and modeling how the approach could improve human health and have an outsized effect on reducing future peak temperatures. By Rob Jordan

Earlier this month President Biden urged other countries to join the U.S. and European Union in a commitment to slashing methane emissions. Two new Stanford-led studies could help pave the way by laying out a blueprint for coordinating research on methane removal technologies and modeling how the approach could have an outsized effect on reducing future peak temperatures. Graph shows globally averaged monthly mean atmospheric methane abundance determined from marine surface sites since 1983. (Image credit: NOAA) The analyses published Sept. 27 in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A reveal that removing about three years-worth of human-caused emissions of the potent greenhouse gas would reduce global surface temperatures by approximately 0.21 degrees Celsius while reducing ozone levels enough to prevent roughly 50000 premature deaths annually. The findings open the door to direct comparisons with carbon dioxide removal – an approach that has received significantly more research and investment – and could help shape national and international climate policy in the future. “The time is ripe to invest in methane removal technologies” said Rob Jackson lead author on the new research agenda paper and senior author on the modeling study. Jackson is the Michelle and Kevin Douglas Provostial Professor of Energy and Environment in Stanford’s School of Earth Energy & Environmental Sciences. The case for methane removal The relative concentration of methane has grown more than twice as fast as that of carbon dioxide since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Removing methane from the atmosphere could reduce temperatures even faster than carbon dioxide removal alone because methane is 81 times more potent in terms of warming the climate over the first 20 years after its release and about 27 times more potent over a century. Methane removal also improves air quality by decreasing the concentration of tropospheric ozone exposure to which causes an estimated one million premature deaths annually worldwide due to respiratory illnesses. Unlike carbon dioxide the bulk of methane emissions are human-driven. Primary culprits include agricultural sources such as livestock which emit methane in their breath and manure and rice fields which emit methane when flooded. Waste disposal and fossil fuel extraction also contribute substantial emissions. Natural sources of methane including soil microbes in wetlands account for the remaining 40 percent of global methane emissions. They further complicate the picture because some of them such as thawing permafrost are projected to increase as the planet warms. While development of methane removal technologies will not be easy the potential financial rewards are big. If market prices for carbon offsets rise to $100 or more per ton this century as predicted by most relevant assessment models each ton of methane removed from the atmosphere could then be worth more than $2700. Envisioning methane removal’s impacts The modeling study uses a new model developed by the United Kingdom’s national weather service (known as the UK Met Office) to examine methane removal’s potential impacts while accounting for its shorter lifetime than carbon dioxide – a key factor because some of the methane removed would have disappeared anyway. The researchers created a set of scenarios by varying either the amount removed or the timing of removal to generalize their results over a wide range of realistic future emissions pathways. Under a high emissions scenario the analysis showed that a 40 percent reduction in global methane emissions by 2050 would lead to a temperature reduction of approximately 0.4 degrees Celsius by 2050. Under a low emissions scenario where temperature peaks during the 21st century methane removal of the same magnitude could reduce the peak temperature by up to 1 degree Celsius. “This new model allows us to better understand how methane removal alters warming on the global scale and air quality on the human scale” said modeling study lead author and research agenda coauthor Sam Abernethy a PhD student in applied physics who works in Jackson’s lab. From research to development The path to achieving these climate and air quality improvements remains unclear. To bring it into focus the research agenda paper compares and contrasts aspects of carbon dioxide and methane removal describes a range of technologies for methane removal and outlines a framework for coordinating and accelerating its scale-up. The framework would help facilitate more accurate analysis of methane removal factors ranging from location-specific simulations to potential interactions with other climate change mitigation approaches. Methane is challenging to capture from air because its concentration is so low but burgeoning technologies – such as a class of crystalline materials called zeolites capable of soaking up the gas – hold the promise of a solution according to the researchers. They argue for increased research into these technologies’ cost efficiency scaling and energy requirements potential social barriers to deployment co-benefits and possible negative by-products. “Carbon dioxide removal has received billions of dollars of investments with dozens of companies formed” said Jackson. “We need similar commitments for methane removal.” To read all stories about Stanford science subscribe to the biweekly Stanford Science Digest.

A follow-up to 2015's ""Hell You Talmabout"" the protest song — created with the African American Policy Forum and 15 activists — was released ahead of International Daughter's Day as a way to honor Black women killed by police violence. The powerful 17-minute track includes the names of 61 Black women girls and femmes to ""bring more awareness to what has not been covered"" per Monáe herself.



""[The song] allows their families an opportunity to be able to hear people sharing their stories about their daughters as the human beings they were and as the daughters they were"" she told People

""Each of us is a daughter and we came together on a human to human level sister to sister level to honor these names"" Monáe continued later adding that the song is meant to ""uplift their names in this song is taking a piece of American history and taking a piece of what has happened so that history won't repeat itself again.""

Not only that but African American Policy Forum co-founder Dr. Kimberlé Crenshaw noted that there's a ""silence that surrounds the killing of Black women is what we have just witnessed"" before pointing out that few people know the names of the Black women killed by police versus Black men like George Floyd and Eric Garner.

""So what are we going to do to reverse it?"" she said. ""The saying her name was the creation of that cacophony of sound. We needed to not only say their names but explode the sound barrier by saying the names that had been erased for so long.""

Either way the stock has gleaming future prospects.

If you can predict which stocks are going to be the titans of industry of tomorrow you'll have a massive leg up on building your portfolio's long-term value. And if your idea of the world of tomorrow is similar to mine it's packed with futuristic technology like medical robots. In other words today's leading robotic surgery companies could be very smart long-term investments.

Right now the robotic surgery pioneer Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 0.32%) has a market cap of around $123 billion making it the largest of its kind. In the future it could be even more massive -- but could it ever be worth $1 trillion reaching the likes of Amazon Alphabet and Microsoft?

Surgical robotics won't go out of style

To reach a market cap of $1 trillion Intuitive would need to grow by more than 720%. That's a huge distance to go between now and 2035 but with more than a decade to get there it might be possible so let's investigate the business to evaluate its prospects.

The central pillar of Intuitive Surgical's business is the da Vinci robotic surgical suite which is essentially a group of mechanical arms with different keyhole surgery tools and instruments attached at the end. Surgeons control the arms from a station in the operating room -- once they've been trained with the company's curriculum.

The da Vinci system has been around since its first approval for general laparoscopic surgery in 2000. Over time its capabilities have expanded considerably and surgeons now use it for a large variety of applications from bariatrics to oncology. The company constantly develops new hardware and software tools to enable more complicated procedures and more and more operations are performed with the da Vinci each year.

But Intuitive doesn't depend solely on sales of new da Vinci units to power shareholder returns. The majority of its revenue comes from recurring sales of robotic surgical tools accessories software subscriptions and maintenance contracts. It's a razor and blade model which is attractive to investors.

So each new robotics suite that's sold includes a long tail of revenue that's a much larger contributor to the top line over time. That means as long as the company keeps selling and installing fresh da Vinci suites its regular income will increase for years to come. And after more than 20 years on the market it's safe to say that the era of robotic surgery isn't just a fad.

But do the numbers add up?

Given Intuitive Surgical's strength in innovation and its highly reliable mode of growth we can make a simple financial projection to explore whether it could reach a market cap of $1 trillion by 2035.

First let's look at how it grew its top line over the past decade. From 2010 through the end of 2020 Intuitive grew its annual revenue from $1.4 billion to $4.3 billion. That works out to be a compound annual growth rate of 11.9% which isn't half bad for an established company.

Over the last 12 months it brought in $5.1 billion which I'll use as the starting point to build the projection. Assuming that its revenue continues to grow by at least 11.9% per year by the start of 2035 Intuitive could be making as much as $22.3 billion per year. If the stock maintains its current trailing price-to-sales ratio of nearly 24 that'd leave it with a market cap of around $530.7 billion which we arrive at by multiplying its revenue by the P/S multiple.

So at its current rate of change it's hard to imagine the company being worth anywhere near $1 trillion even with the benefit of more than a decade to grow.

But if the company manages to boost its revenue a bit faster and maintain it at a rate of just over 17% per year there's a chance it could reach a value of $1 trillion by 2035.

Trillion or not Intuitive is still worth owning

Nonetheless it's hard to believe that a business of Intuitive's size could accelerate its growth rate dramatically without launching numerous new products or otherwise implementing major expansion initiatives.

On the bright side even if it probably won't get to $1 trillion Intuitive Surgical will likely make its shareholders significantly richer in the coming years. Merely growing at its historical rate over the last decade will lead to its market cap multiplying by several times meaning that people who invest in the stock now will probably make out like bandits.",,,,,,,,,,,,

While Sony and ZEEL have made no comment we have the strange spectacle of InGovern a proxy advisor apparently speaking for Invesco in a series of tweets soon after the merger plan was conveyed to stock exchanges. InGovern’s tweet said: “Sony comes in as a white knight for ZEE. Nothing wrong in 2 companies proposing a merger as CEOs can initiate merger discussions and then approach shareholders for vote. Invesco did not have alternate plan and hence it would be surprising if it is not supportive of this merger.” This raises serious questions. If Invesco had no alternate plan what had it hoped to achieve in destabilising the company by seeking the sacking of the Punit Goenka and two other independent directors (Ashok Kurien and Manish Chokhani who voluntarily resigned before the meeting)?

The timing and speed of the deal is extremely curious. Did Invesco know about Sony’s interest in ZEEL? Was its action only aimed at pushing the management to the wall and forcing them to accept the merger deal? More importantly shouldn’t muscle-flexing by large institutional investors be based on a clear plan? This point is also made by JN Gupta former executive director and founder of Stakeholders Empowerment Services (SAS). When I asked him about the merger “How do I know that the next set of people the shareholder activist is appointing is going to be better than the present set? You have to give me a cogent argument. Just because you say there are governance issues I don’t know if that is the case.” Given the two situations—Invesco’s proposal to throw out Mr Goenka and the Sony deal—he would go with the merger since it provides a clear roadmap for the company.

InGovern’s tweet says “As a Fund Invesco would be interested in financial returns and clean governance. With Sony as a majority shareholder and a likely reconstituted Board the merged entity would be the best solution Invesco could have hoped for. Punit Goenka's capabilities as MD of a leading media company was not questioned. Invesco was unhappy about the governance of Zee due to the group company issues. So Punit Goenka as the proposed MD of the merger entity should not be a concern.”

This seems rather ingenious. Seeking the removal of Punit Goenka and two ‘independent’ directors is hardly a vote of confidence for his abilities. Moreover problems with the “governance of Zee because of group company issues” remain unresolved since he continues to be the MD. Indeed Sony as the majority stakeholder will have its own directors; but given the group’s political clout this is such an unprecedented situation that one has to wonder about what makes the proxy advisor confident about future developments. Remember we don't know what had irked Invesco in terms of influence of group entities or why it wanted two independent directors to be removed.

InGovern in another tweet goes on to say “Also Invesco could well just withdraw its EGM call” and further “(S)o probably for the first time in India we are seeing activism where a Fund triggered an action which is pushing the company into a merger. Shareholder Activism in Corporate India has come of age.”

Actually it is premature to celebrate this as ‘shareholder activism’. Many shareholders large and small are confused—even while they are happy with the outcome and especially the 32% surge in the ZEEL price and predictions about it suddenly turning into a ‘super blue-chip’. It is also strange that the news of Punit Goenka’s ouster caused the stock to surge 40% and his continuation as MD in the merged entity is also being welcomed equally. Doesn’t this contradictory narrative seem to be deliberately orchestrated?

Although ZEEL’s capital structure and the controversial machinations of its founder Subhash Chandra have few parallels in corporate India shareholders have many questions. Was Invesco’s game plan just to push ZEEL into a merger? Those who have tracked the capital market for the past three decades see a lot of perplexing connections between three people who are close to each other – Manish Chokhani exiting the board; Rakesh Jhunjhunwala investing 1% in the company a day before the merger announcement; and Vallabh Bhansali making a rare TV appearance to call ZEEL-Sony a future blue-chip. Unfortunately unless the regulator digs up something using its vast powers and tech resources these questions may never be answered.

One market-watcher who calls it a jigsaw puzzle asks why have large investors ignored the fact that ZEEL’s promoters are an exception in India having cut their stake to under 4% in order to bring in funds and pare the outstanding debt of over Rs11000 crore? The counter to this is that ZEEL was not only profitable but the group’s enormous political clout is entirely derived from the media empire. It is also a moot question whether Mr Goenka will remain MD over the long term or this is just a face-saver for him with multiple benefits on both sides.

There are speculative media reports that there may be no open offer to retail shareholders since the ZEEL-Sony deal is a merger and not a ‘takeover’. Decisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on what triggers an open offer have been capricious in the past; so it will be interesting to watch what transpires. Will Mr Goenka’s continuance be used to claim there is no change in management control which would trigger an open offer? Can SEBI ignore the fact that Sony as a majority shareholder will have effective control? Meanwhile the face-saver in ZEEL may also help the group ward off action shareholders had threatened to take in group entities such as Zee Learn and DishTV.

Role of Proxy Advisors

A curious aspect of the ZEEL-Sony situation is the aggressive role of proxy advisors as is evident from the series of tweets by InGovern on what Invesco would do. I have emailed Invesco for clarity and this article will be updated when we hear from them.

about emails of Amit Tandon MD of another proxy firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS). “Zee Media has details of the emails between Amit Tandon and a few investors which clearly raises suspicion whether IiAS and Amit Tandon are conspiring against the Essel Group?” says the article. It also questions whether this strategy will extend to other entities of the Zee group. Just before the merger with Sony was announced an article in zeebiz.com which is part of the Zee media group had raised ‘questions’ about emails of Amit Tandon MD of another proxy firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS). “Zee Media has details of the emails between Amit Tandon and a few investors which clearly raises suspicion whether IiAS and Amit Tandon are conspiring against the Essel Group?” says the article. It also questions whether this strategy will extend to other entities of the Zee group.

Meanwhile IiAS has said the ZEEL-Sony deal will be good for the industry and shareholders. It expects Sony to ‘control the purse strings’ and bring in a new chief financial officer for the merged entity. And that “Punit Goenka will be reporting to a different board—a majority of which will be nominated by Sony” reducing the “risks of related-party transactions and governance failures.”

While shareholder activism is a good thing and proxy advisors have played an important role it would be worrying if their role extends beyond helping large institutional investors fulfil their fiduciary duties and taking the right stand on corporate resolutions that need shareholder approval.

When asked JN Gupta says “We as a firm will never speak at the prodding of any company or investor. Also we will only go by published information we have no friendship with anyone. Our approach will be to take a stand only when we know specific facts.”

As of now no one seems to know all the facts of this deal; but the quick turn of events which were initially welcomed are now raising a lot of questions.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Wongel Estifanos was visiting Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park located atop Iron Mountain in Glenwood Springs with her family on Sept. 5 when she went on the Haunted Mine Drop ride a free-fall drop down a pitch-black shaft.

After reviewing video surveillance and operating manuals investigators with the Colorado Division of Oil and Public Safety determined that when Wongel got on the ride she sat in a previously unoccupied seat on top of two already-locked seatbelts and that ""multiple operator errors"" and ""inadequate training"" contributed to the fatal accident according to a report released Friday.

The girl was only holding the tail of one seatbelt across her lap but when checking her seat a ride operator ""did not notice that the seatbelts were not positioned across her lap"" according to the report.

The ride's control panel alerted the operator to an error with one of the seatbelts on Wongel's seat indicating that that seatbelt had not been properly unlocked after the previous ride cycle according to the report. The operator returned ""multiple times"" to check the seatbelt and buckle it to no avail but ""did not believe the error because they were convinced the restraint had been cycled"" the report stated.

Wongel Estifanos is seen here in an undated file photo. Estifanos Family

A second ride operator then unlocked the seatbelts using a manual switch clearing the error on the ride's control system ""without unloading passengers to determine what the issue was"" the report stated. This decision did not resolve the problem -- that Wongel was not wearing the seatbelts -- and demonstrated that the operator ""did not have a complete understanding"" of the control system's safety indicators according to the report.

The second operator also checked the girl's seatbelts but ""did not notice that neither of the seatbelts were positioned across her lap"" according to the report.

With no error on the control panel the second operator was then able to dispatch the ride.

""Because Ms. Estifanos was not restrained in the seat she became separated from her seat and fell to the bottom of the [Haunted Mine Drop] shaft resulting in her death"" the report stated.

Operators were not formally trained to unbuckle all seatbelts following each ride though it was common practice and one that the first operator performed ""inconsistently"" on earlier rides according to the report.

The operators are supposed to buckle the seatbelts for each of the ride's six passengers and confirm the restraints are over their laps per the manufacturer's operating manual as ""passengers cannot be expected to know or correctly execute the safety procedures for this ride"" the report stated. Both operators failed to follow these procedures according to the report.

The report also determined that the operators' training ""did not appear to emphasize the inherent risks of the ride"" and that the manufacturer's operating manual ""does not instruct operators on how to properly address errors.""

The Haunted Mine Drop is currently closed and future plans for the ride are ""undetermined"" the amusement park said.

""Safety is and always has been our top priority"" Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park founder Steve Beckley said in a statement following the release of the report. ""Since opening our first ride just over 15 years ago Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park has delivered more than 10 million safe and enjoyable rides.""

""We have been working closely with the Colorado Division of Oil and Public Safety and independent safety experts to review this incident"" he continued noting that the amusement park will review the report ""carefully for recommendations.""

""More than anything we want the Estifanos family to know how deeply sorry we are for their loss and how committed we are to making sure it never happens again"" he added.

In a statement to Denver ABC affiliate KMGH Dan Caplis an attorney for the Estifanos family said that Wongel's parents had received the report and called on people who have ""experienced problems"" with the Haunted Mine Drop to come forward.

""Wongel's parents are determined to do everything in their power to make sure that no one ever dies this way again"" said Caplis who told the station he intends to file a lawsuit against the park on behalf of the family.

Robert Jacobs

Sicklerville - Robert Joseph Jacobs died peacefully at home on September 24 2021 in Sicklerville NJ. He was 80 years of age.

Robert was born on August 111941 in Camden NJ to his parents Constance and Joseph Jacobs. He graduated from Camden Catholic High School in Camden NJ in 1959 where he was a varsity athlete in football basketball and baseball. A trained draftsman he began his career at RCA in Camden but his interests and intellectual curiosity eventually led him to a long and rewarding career in data processing and analysis for a number of firms. In 1962 Bob married his wife Marianne (née Szczepankiewicz) who predeceased him in 2018 after enjoying a happy and loving 56-year marriage.

Bob was involved with a number of civic activities in Winslow Township and was a highly engaged founding member of the St. John Neumann R.C. church in Sicklerville where he participated on various parish committees.

Bob was the devoted father of Robert Jacobs Jr. (Rosanne) of South Amboy NJ; Michael Jacobs (Kimberly) of Berlin NJ; Joseph Jacobs of Chesilhurst NJ and Kathleen Missigman also of Berlin. Dear brother of Christina Jacobs and Joseph Jacobs (Kay). Proud grandfather of Justine Rylee David and Amanda and a loving uncle to many nieces nephews and their children.

Relatives and friends are invited to attend his viewing on Tuesday morning September 28 10AM to 11AM at the St. Simon Stock Parish Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Church 178 White Horse Pike Berlin NJ 08009.

Instead the Mets are left with a disturbing statistic that has helped define this season in ruin: zero pitches thrown in the major leagues between the two right-handers since the All-Star break.

That could change this week with both pitchers possibly making cameos for the Mets but too little too late for a team headed home for the winter.

DeGrom who last pitched on July 7 has progressed to throwing side sessions over the last week and will face hitters in live batting practice before potentially returning to the roster for an abbreviated outing that would attempt to serve the purpose of quelling concerns about his right elbow heading to the offseason.

Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard Robert Sabo; N.Y. Post: Charles Wenzelberg

Syndergaard who is approaching the two-year anniversary of his last major league appearance on Sept. 29 2019 threw one scoreless inning for Triple-A Syracuse on Saturday and could be rejoining the Mets this week as an opener or reliever his rehab from Tommy John surgery finally complete.

Neither fireballer will help the Mets this season but there is 2022 to consider. DeGrom will be entering the opt-out year of his contract and Syndergaard is a free agent whose potential can’t be overlooked when formulating a rotation plan.

“[DeGrom] is the best pitcher of our generation so my expectation for him is to go out and make 32 to 34 starts or however it works out and be his dominant self” pitching coach Jeremy Hefner said.

In 15 starts this season the two-time Cy Young award winner has pitched to a 1.08 ERA and 0.554 WHIP. But it’s also a season in which deGrom’s physical ailments became a storyline even before his placement on the injured list immediately following the All-Star break.

Syndergaard was initially expected back by mid-June but that time table changed weeks ahead of his projected return because of elbow discomfort. His rehab in late-August was delayed when he tested positive for COVID-19. The Mets will have to decide whether to extend Syndergaard a qualifying offer (a potentially costly option at around $20 million for one season) or try to sign him for less.

“He loves New York” Hefner said. “This is where he grew up. Obviously he was in Toronto but he’s pitched for this organization for six years. He loves the city he loves the Mets. I really enjoy working with him.”

The third piece of that equation is Marcus Stroman an impending free agent who became more important to the Mets with deGrom and Syndergaard sidelined. Stroman has pitched to a 3.00 ERA this season over 174 innings.

“He’s a tough guy to replace what he can do with the ball the energy he brings to our group” Hefner said. “If we choose to go a different route those are all things we have to consider and replace.”

Carlos Carrasco and Taijuan Walker are the veteran starting pitchers under contract for next season and the Mets have potential depth pieces in Tylor Megill and David Peterson. The free-agent market this offseason will include names such as Robbie Ray Max Scherzer and Kevin Gausman.

“The potential to have five veteran quality upper-echelon starters and I don’t know what we’re going to do in free agency and all that stuff will shake itself out” Hefner said. “But there is that potential with Noah and Stro and Jake and Cookie and then you put Petey and Tylor and those types of guys back in the mix our depth really shows itself again and that is the thing I am most excited about.

“With Steve [Cohen owner] now and the ability to go out and get guys whether it be Stro or Noah or however we decide to go about it there is the opportunity to add which is also exciting.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkLmNvbS9uYXRhbGllb2dhbmVzeWFuL2thaWEtZ2VyYmVyLWphY29iLWVsb3JkaS1yZWQtY2FycGV0LWRlYnV00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kaia Gerber And Jacob Elordi Red Carpet Debut,"Earlier this year in May Kaia opened up about their relationship in a candid interview with Vogue saying ""Being able to be with someone I trust where we don't want anything from each other having a safe steady relationship like that has really opened my eyes to the possibilities of love and what it feels like to love without conditions.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9lYXN0YmF5dGltZXMvbmFtZS9lbGxlbi1tb250YWd1ZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xODQ0MTM4MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ellen Montague Obituary (2021) - Walnut Creek CA - East Bay Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/eastbaytimes/name/ellen-montague-obituary?id=18441380 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9lYXN0YmF5dGltZXMvbmFtZS9lbGxlbi1tb250YWd1ZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xODQ0MTM4MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The old-time image of an anarchist that has long been fixed in popular imagination is of a guy with wild hair and a deranged smile holding a circular bomb with a lit fuse. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman looked nothing like that. Photographs of them from more than a century ago show them to be quite proper and well dressed; they could have been any elegant couple decked out for a stroll along Fifth Avenue.

But Berkman and the better-known Goldman onetime lovers born in the Russian Empire were indeed anarchists believing in a society without leaders one rooted in an egalitarian spirit free of the top-down organization that has defined governance for oh only forever. Sure many anarchists were unruly: In their heyday roughly from 1880 to 1920 they went around blowing things up employing the dynamite invented by a Swedish gent Alfred Nobel whose name now graces the world’s most coveted peace prize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3QtZ2F6ZXR0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy9vYml0dWFyaWVzLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvai1hbGFuLWplcnJ5LWpvaG5zb24tb2JpdHVhcnktcGl0dHNidXJnaC9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjQwNTEyMDA5MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary: J.

Down the stretch of that season he really showed his potential — culminating in a game-starring performance off the bench in a Play-In victory against the Miami Heat. Over the summer came an opportunity for Johnson to take the next step —starting power forward John Collins was traded and the starting power forward spot was up for grabs. In fact it was Johnson’s development in the season was a contributing reason that helped prompt the Hawks’ front office to make the Collins trade in the first place.

“Really the progression of Jalen especially defensively in the last season really gave us a lot hope this year where it’s like ‘OK can you put him into the more 4-lineups whether he’s starting or not and add in some of those elements defensively as well as his playmaking ability’” said GM Landry Fields at last season’s media day. “We’re excited for his growth this year.”

Johnson went head-to-head with Saddiq Bey for the starting role Bey initially won out but combined with two losses to start the season and strong performances from Johnson off the bench prompted Hawks head coach Quin Snyder to insert Johnson into the starting lineup. When the two were healthy it soon became a non-conversation as to who it should be that starts in the lineup: Jalen Johnson was an emerging star within the Atlanta Hawks.

In a larger role now as a starter Johnson’s improved game was unleashed. From his driving and how he attacks the rim:

To his athleticism to put pressure on the rim or finish with authority:

(Who could forget this play the opening play in Los Angeles where Johnson crushed Austin Reaves?):

His improved jumpshot:

His playmaking:

And his rebounding where he can grab the board and lead the attack or find an outlet pass:

Not to mention his impact defensively whether it was as an on-ball defender or as a rebounder:

You could spend quite a bit of time watching Jalen Johnson highlight compilations: he had an impact in almost every facet of the game. In the end Johnson averaged 16 points per game on 51% shooting 35% from three 73% from the line on 2.6 attempts 8.7 rebounds 3.6 assists and 1.2 steals in 33 minutes per game.

The team grew more and more confident about Johnson’s abilities and trusted him more and more as the season progressed.

“Whether you want to call it playmaking or facilitating I think he’s getting more and more comfortable — and our team is getting more comfortable — with him having the ball in his hands” said Snyder of Johnson after a game against the OKC Thunder. “Whether it’s transition or in situations tonight where they were coming to double-team and impact our guards. He’s capable of making plays and making plays for other people as well. You’ve seen him do that in practice settings but I think his comfort and his confidence doing those things in a game against a good team that’s something that’s unique to him with his size and athleticism.”

This confidence came on both ends of the floor.

“He’s a very versatile defender” said De’Andre Hunter of Johnson after an impressive defensive showing against the Los Angeles Lakers. “He can guard one through four even sometimes the five. He’s always in the passing lanes he’s athletic he blocks shots. Having someone like that next to you gives you confidence to be a better defender and also gives the team confidence to defend better.”

In a season which was fraught with disappointment for the Atlanta Hawks Jalen Johnson was by far the brightest most encouraging spot in the 2023-24 season. With his play Johnson solidified himself in the eyes of many as one of the players who would be worth holding onto and building around. He was the one Hawk that the team could trust on an almost nightly basis on both ends of the floor.

Johnson set multiple career-highs throughout the season his high-mark coming in two 28 point showing against the Thunder in January and the Pistons in April. Johnson also recorded his first triple-double in that same Detroit game.

I wrote at various points this season that Jalen Johnson was quickly becoming the most important (not to be confused with ‘best’ player) player for the Hawks because of his ability and his value to do so many different things the Hawks really need: rebounding defending versatility. He was described by Snyder during the season as a ‘Swiss army knife’ and it’s an accurate analogy. It was almost concerning how quickly the Hawks became so reliant on him in his first season starting and when he was absent the Hawks could never make up what they missed in Johnson through one rotation player — which speaks to Johnson’s quality and versatility.

Without Johnson the Hawks’ rebounding in particular really suffered as well as their defense and defensive options with Johnson only second to Clint Capela in defensive win shares for the Hawks. Sadly the Hawks almost had to become as used to not having Johnson as they did having him in the lineup.

Johnson played 56 games this season with two injuries in particular sidelining him for prolonged periods of time: a wrist injury in a November game against the Wizards which ruled him out for just over a month. Johnson had various problems with his ankles which also saw him miss game time but a decisive ankle injury occurred during the Hawks’ run-in a double-overtime loss to the Miami Heat on April 9th one from which Johnson did not return from as the Hawks’ season ended in the Play-In game in Chicago. Had he not missed as much time Johnson would have been a very strong contender for Most Improved Player: his improvement this season was among the biggest jumps in the NBA.

These injuries slightly marred what was a hugely impressive season from Johnson who has strengthened his position heading into contract extension discussions when the Hawks and Johnson can agree on an extension later this year as Johnson enters his fourth season.

At the end of it all during the Hawks’ exit interviews Snyder outlined in detail Johnson’s season his growth and his path going forward in his development.

“Do you want one thing? I can give you a lot on Jalen!” quipped Snyder during the Hawks’ exit interviews. “I think he had a terrific year. He was a guy that dealt with some things he couldn’t control as far as a couple of ankle injuries and when he got upended in Washington when he broke his wrist. One of the things he did last year is he really worked he worked on certain things which were areas where he really wanted to get better. I anticipate him doing that again this summer. As Jalen moves forward in his career I think he’s someone — because of his mindset — that we’ll see continue to improve.

“Last year there was focus on his skill work as handling his passing his shooting and there was also focus on his health his body and his and the health performance side. I think we saw strides with both of those even when he did sprain his ankle how he handled the treatment and how he got himself back. Obviously the biggest thing I think for him because of his feel for the game he has so many different situations where he has to read what the best option is and you’re not always going to have a clear this is the best option.

“There’s a continuum there is this is a high percentage shot this is a higher percentage shot you know there there are so many things that go into it this is a good pass this is a better pass. When you have someone that’s able to make plays like that there’s a layer of the game that unfolds that that you have to prepare yourself mentally and physically to be able to make all those decisions in a really efficient way. I think he’ll continue to get more and more efficient and play better and better defense.”

Johnson himself didn’t quite elaborate as much as Snyder but throws down a different gauntlet for himself for the summer ahead.

“Everybody thinks it was a good year I think it can be better” said Johnson during the exit interviews. “That’s my mindset heading into the summer.”

An ominous warning indeed; what heights can Jalen Johnson reach? Off the evidence of this season they could be lofty heights indeed...",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1sYnRyYWRlcnVtb3JzLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L25sLWVhc3Qtbm90ZXMtbHV6YXJkby1vcnRpei1qb2huc29uLW5hdGlvbmFscy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NL East Notes: Luzardo Ortiz Johnson Nationals,"Jesus Luzardo was reinstated from the Marlins’ 15-day injured list today with right-hander Eli Villalobos optioned to Triple-A in the corresponding move. Luzardo struggled to a 6.58 ERA over his first five starts and 26 innings before a mild left flexor strain (initially diagnosed as elbow tightness) sent him to the IL so the three-week layoff between starts can hopefully set as a refresh of a tough season to date for the 26-year-old. The returns of Luzardo and Braxton Garrett this weekend will help the injury-riddled Marlins rotation though Edward Cabrera has now also gone down with a shoulder impingement.

Beyond the immediate help that Luzardo will bring to Miami’s pitching staff today’s start figures to reignite the trade rumors that have swirled around the left-hander for months. If Luzardo recaptures his 2021-22 form he would be a very hot commodity at the trade deadline as he is arbitration-controlled through the 2026 season. The Luis Arraez trade has already signaled that the Marlins are in sell mode but while the team pulled the trigger early on that deal Luzardo’s suitors will want to see a larger sample size of healthy and productive starts before moving what would have to be a very substantial trade package to pry him away from Miami.

PCOS is a condition in which the ovaries produce an overabundance of androgens male sex hormones that are typically present in women in small amounts. A polycystic ovarian syndrome is characterized by the development of many small cysts (fluid-filled sacs) in the ovaries. Some women with this condition on the other hand do not generate cysts whereas others who do not have the disease do.

The most primary symptoms of PCOS are as follows:-

Periods that are missed irregular or extremely mild

ovaries with a lot of cysts or large ovaries

Body hair that is excessive especially on the chest stomach and back (hirsutism)

Weight increase particularly around the stomach (abdomen)

Acne or oily skin

Hair thinning or male-pattern baldness

Infertility

Excess skin on the neck or armpits in little bits (skin tags)

Dark or thick skin patches can be found on the back of the neck under the armpits and beneath the breasts.

Through the campaign Reliance has put on the effort to generate awareness about the condition and early symptoms like acne weight gain and hair loss might persuade women to believe they are experiencing normal skin hair and weight issues delaying diagnosis.

Reliance General Insurance Business Limited is an Indian private insurance company that is entirely owned by Reliance Capital and is part of the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group.

On September 23 2021 at 4 p.m. a live awareness presentation was broadcast on Facebook. The goal of the show was to shed light on the topic of PCOS as well as help identify and treat the disease. A T O M wants to change that by encouraging women to talk about it because it isn’t a life-threatening condition.

a t o m’s national creative head and strategy head Yash Kulshresth and Ruma Singhal remarked “The film and the other body of creatives urged women to join the free consultation with a doctor on Facebook live on 23rd September. In addition to this the campaign will also have media content that debunks myths and also has a set of offline activations to raise awareness. Our research made us realize that there isn’t enough understanding about this which inspired us to create awareness about this topic. We want to change that by encouraging women to talk about it even if it isn’t a life-threatening condition.”

The account has no fees or minimum monthly deposit but there are restrictions on the 1% cashback offering.

Users will not get cashback on big-ticket purchases such as a car or on money spent gambling.

When customers spend money they can round up purchases to the nearest £1 using a setting that can be switched on and off with the app. This pot then earns interest at 5%.

Unusually the account comes with a numberless debit card with the details stored behind a secure login on the app. This means a new card number can be generated straight away if it is reported lost.

Laura Suter the head of personal finance at AJ Bell said it could be a winner. “First impressions are that this new account will blow the competition out of the water with an attractive cashback deal and a market-beating interest rate on its savings feature” she said.

“Assuming the cashback is uncapped the rate means that if someone spends £500 a month on their debit card they’ll get £5 back.”

Suter said there would be drawbacks for the account for some customers because it does not have any bank branches all the help and customer support is online or on the phone and it must be run from an app.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdWsuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9qcG1vcmdhbi1sYXVuY2hlcy1jaGFzZS11ay0xLTA1MDAwMDk0MS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JPMorgan launches Chase in UK: 1% cashback and 5% savings rate behind aggressive push for customers,"JPMorgan’s new Chase app (JPMorgan)

JPMorgan today announced an aggressive move into Britain’s retail banking market with best-in-class cash back and savings offerings aimed at luring customers from established rivals.

Chase JPMorgan’s new digital bank officially launches in the UK today. The bank will offer customers 1% cashback on debit card spending for the first year. The offer covers everyday expenditure including groceries travel meals entertainment fashion homewares and electronics. The deal could see the bank hand tens or even hundreds of pounds back to customers who use Chase as their main current account.

Chase customers will also be able to round-up card purchases to the nearest pound and have the spare cash automatically deposited in a savings account offering 5% annual interest for the first 12 months. Overseas foreign exchange spending is fee free and offers market leading exchange rates.

“The product is very very competitive” Sanoke Viswanathan the executive in charge of the launch told the Standard.

The customer giveaways represent a significant opening salvo from JPMorgan in the already crowded British retail banking market. Viswanathan said JPMorgan had spent hundreds of millions building the new digital business and would spend tens of millions on its launch.

“This is a big strategic effort for the bank” he told the Standard. “We’ve been working on this for a few years. It’s a big deal for us. This is a bank that’s going to be here for a long time.”

Other features at launch include the ability to set up multiple accounts and switch between them on one debit card. Debit cards will be made from recycled plastic and won’t feature account numbers on the front which the bank says is a security feature.

Chase will go head-to-head with High Street giants Barclays Lloyds HSBC and NatWest as well as digital startups including Monzo Starling and Revolut. The new bank will also compete with JPMorgan’s arch Wall Street rival Goldman Sachs which offers retail savings accounts in the UK under the Marcus brand.

Viswanathan said JPMorgan was attracted to the UK because of the high level of consumer adoption of digital banking the strong regulatory regime and the “terrific pool of talent” for fintech in the UK. He said London would form the global headquarters for Chase with further international expansion expected in future.

JPMorgan has 600 people working on Chase in the UK and Viswanathan said it was likely to hire many more in its first year. The company has set up a customer service center in Edinburgh that it will scale up as the bank acquires customers.

Chase will initially offer current accounts but plans to expand to savings investments lending and pensions products. JPMorgan acquired digital wealth manager Nutmeg earlier this year and plans to integrate its services into Chase.

Viswanathan said the bank was not looking at any other acquisitions at the moment but added: “I wouldn’t rule it out.”

Disaster relief payments issued to about 50 of the 176000 educators who received checks were affected by the JPMorgan Chase error according to a statement from the Florida Department of Education. Officials said they're working to fix the problem.

“We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused and are working to correct it including refunding any fees incurred by the recipients as a result” JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Allison Tobin Reed said in an email.

State Sen. Jason Pizzo D-Miami brought attention to the error Friday morning when he tweeted a photo of a teacher's return item notice that was received after trying to deposit the check.

Funded by federal COVID-19 relief money the bonus payments to teachers principals and first responders received bipartisan support in the Florida Legislature this past spring. But some criticized Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis for hiring a private company to print and mail the checks along with a letter signed by the governor instead of sending money to local school districts to distribute.

Pizzo tweeted later Friday “Teaching moment: The individual political benefit in spending $3.6 million to print and send thousands of checks with your name on it is outweighed by the more efficient and fiscally responsible option of direct deposit.”

There is much buzz amongst global investors recently about two possible debt defaults though they are of different proportions in their would-be impact on global equity markets. One is the US federal government's rivers of borrowed money running dry and in urgent need of replenishing. The other is a major Chinese property developer which has run into financial trouble because the company veered off the road by squandering too much on making electric cars and sponsoring a football club.As US federal debt default looms US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is facing her biggest test in her eight-month tenure to convince reluctant Republican lawmakers to agree to raise the US' national debt limit which is currently set at $28.5 trillion. The stakes are high because if Yellen's effort fails the US financial system will collapse.Yellen has called Republican leaders to convey the economic danger which lays ahead bluntly warning that the Treasury Department's ability to stave off default is limited and the failure to lift the debt cap by late October would be ""catastrophic"" for the country and the world.Six former US treasury secretaries last week sent a letter to top US lawmakers warning them a default would roil financial markets and blunt economic growth. According to US media reports Yellen last week also warned the nation's largest banks and financial institutions about the very real risk of a default. She has spoken to chief executives of JPMorgan Chase Bank of America BlackRock and Goldman Sachs briefing them the likely disastrous impact a federal default will produce.To make things worse both Democrats and Republicans in the US are at each other's throats now over US President Joe Biden's new $3.5 trillion spending bill which proposes heavy tax raises on rich families and corporations and has met fierce opposition from Republican lawmakers. Whether they will compromise on the debt limit by making a last-minute deal with the White House to reduce Biden's giant spending plan remains to be seen.Market analysts say if the US government defaults on its colossal debt a financial system crisis of a magnitude larger than the 2008-09 debacle could occur which is estimated to lead to an evaporation of $15 trillion in wealth and loss of 6 million jobs in the US. The capital market is now on tenterhooks facing a potential financial time bomb.Last week the US' major media outlets also focused their reportage on a possible default of a leading real estate developer in South China but by all metrics it is a risk of much smaller scale. The case is being closely watched by China's financial authorities and will never be allowed to develop into a systemic risk.With regard to the privately-run property developer Evergrande many fear the knock-on effects of the company's imminent difficulty to pay back principals and interests of borrowed money including corporate bonds and bank loans. But even if the city of Shenzhen with its deep pockets where the company is headquartered refuses to bail out Evergrande one bankrupt company can hardly impact the stability of China's financial system and the risks linked to this possibility have been widely overblown by a hyperventilating media.Executives at Evergrande are launching a last-ditch rescue effort trying to sell the company's electric car subsidiary and other assets in China and abroad including the Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club. It is also selling its housing projects scattered in dozens of Chinese cities at a discount to speed up its cash flow. Whether the company is able to stave off a debt default remains unknown.Evergrande said on Wednesday that it would make an interest payment on an onshore bonds due Thursday but the company didn't say whether it had plans to make a $83 million coupon payment due on its US dollar bonds within a month.The city government of Shenzhen or the central government in Beijing has not rushed to bail out Evergande most likely in the belief that the company itself is to blame for the predicament - too much leverage and squandering of borrowed funds ploughed into auto making and other fringe businesses and budgeting largesse. Authorities probably want the case to serve notice to investors at home and abroad that they need to do their due diligence and enforce accountability on debtors.However the central government is almost certain not to tolerate a possible bankruptcy of Evergrande to spill over to draw down the broader Chinese economy as the central bank has done numerous pressure tests since the 2008 global financial crisis which was caused by the sub-prime housing debts in the US. Last year the central bank required property developers to bring down their debt levels below certain thresholds before they are able to borrow more money from financial institutions. And many Chinese commercial banks have ascertained their exposure to Evergrande is restricted.So debt-beleaguered Evergrande is unlikely to produce a firestorm and disrupt China's financial system. In addition both the government and the central bank have plenty of policy tools including easing overall monetary policy to tide over Evergande if it goes under. But of course the last resort is to bail it out and restructure the company as China has done with other troubled corporations like HNA Huarong and Baoshang Bank.The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn"

Loop a two-year-old company that collects and sanitises reusable containers has said it’s expanding after successful trials at groceries in France and Japan. Kroger and Walgreens in the United States Tesco in the United Kingdom and Woolworths in Australia are among the chains partnering with Loop to sell household staples in reusable packages. McDonald’s Burger King and Tim Hortons have also signed on.

In all Loop says 191 stores and restaurants worldwide will be selling products in reusable packages by the first quarter of 2022 up from just a dozen stores in Paris at the end of 2020.

Grocery stores will have a special Loop area where manufacturers – from independent brands to big players like Nestlé – have packaged pantry items household cleaners and other products in reusable containers. More than 150 manufacturers will be participating worldwide by early next year selling 375 products.

Customers pay a deposit ranging from US15 cents for a bottle of Coca-Cola to US$10 for a stainless steel container of Clorox wipes in addition to the price of their item. When customers are finished with the container they can return it to the store and get their deposit refunded through Loop’s app. Loop collects the containers cleans them and returns them to manufacturers to be refilled.

Fast-food outlets – including a handful of Burger Kings in New York Tim Hortons in Toronto and McDonald’s in the UK – will also distribute and collect reusable coffee cups and sandwich holders made from sturdy plastic.

Reusable packaging is well developed in other industries like automotive said Cimberly Weir an outreach coordinator and instructor at Michigan State University’s School of Packaging. But to her knowledge Loop is the first to try this with consumer products.

“We are the ones who are responsible for actually getting that product returned” she said. “So it’s putting a lot more pressure on everyday citizens to do their part.”

While Loop’s approach is unique it’s one of many ongoing efforts to eliminate packaging waste. Lego said last year it would remove plastic packaging from its play sets. Coca-Cola PepsiCo and Keurig Dr Pepper have invested millions to improve the recycling and processing of their plastic bottles. Amazon encourages customers to get their items shipped in fewer boxes; the company says it has eliminated one million tons of packaging since 2015.

Loop a division of New Jersey-based recycling company TerraCycle is actually an old idea says TerraCycle founder and CEO Tom Szaky. Before the 1950s products were made to last but they’ve gotten thinner and cheaper in the decades since he said.

“We’re hitting the apex of that now and people are fed up with that trend” Szaky said. “There’s a huge attraction to the idea of higher quality and materials.”

That’s true for Chris Critchett 66 who was browsing the Loop aisle in a Tesco store in Milton Keynes England earlier this week.

“I think lemonade bottles used to be like that when I was younger so I think it’s quite a good idea” Critchett said. “It’s just trying to get people to actually do it so they work it into their shopping system.”

Szaky said the company sees around 80 per cent of the packaging returned within 60 days of purchase. In some cases he said consumers may just be keeping the packaging and reusing it themselves.

DEDICATED CLEANING FACILITY

Szaky said every country in which Loop operates has a dedicated cleaning facility as well as smaller facilities where packaging can be stored before cleaning. He recognises that transporting all that material has an environmental impact but he says reusing a container dozens of times is still less harmful than repeatedly extracting material from the earth to make new packaging.

Loop gets its funding from the fees it charges to its corporate partners. It’s not yet making a profit Szaky said but expects to within two years.

Keith Daley chief impact officer at Kroger the largest US grocer said his company signed on with Loop to help meet a multi-year commitment to reduce waste. In October Kroger will launch a six-month Loop pilot at 25 Fred Meyer stores in the Portland Oregon area. Dedicated Loop aisles will display 20 separate items including some of Kroger’s own products. Loop ambassadors will explain the programme to customers.

“We fundamentally believe that this is one of those potentially game-changing ideas” Daley said.

Loop had hoped to be in 1000 stores and restaurants by this time but the pandemic slowed its progress. Still Szaky said demand for Loop remained even as stores shut down other waste-saving measures like communal bins for pantry staples.

Weir said a major turning point for the packaging industry came in 2006 when Walmart announced it would start grading suppliers on the sustainability of their packaging.

Interest in sustainability has only grown since then Weir said. She sees it at Michigan State’s packaging school the nation’s largest where nearly all of the 600 students cite the environment as a reason they’re in the programme.

Matt Casale the environment campaign director of the US Public Interest Research Group PIRG agrees that bringing reusable packaging into the mainstream is important. But he also wishes society would think more deeply about all the stuff that is made packaged and shipped.

PIRG backs laws like one that recently passed in Maine which charges manufacturers who create packaging a fee that is used to boost recycling. It also supports state bans on single-use plastic bags and polystyrene food containers which have passed in Colorado and several other states.

“That’s going to be our 21st-century challenge rethinking the way we do everything to make it make sense on a very small planet with a lot of people living on it” Casale said.

You shouldn't sell cigarettes to children. But if you primarily sell cigarettes you should try expanding your portfolio to include mac and cheese. That's what Altria Group which was once known as Marlboro cigarette company Philip Morris did between 1988 and 2007.

As The Motley Fool reports Altria actually bought General Foods in 1985 because rival cigarette maker Reynold's American had acquired Nabisco. Then having acquired some food business experience they decided to invest further in the market and bought Kraft three years later. This arrangement continued into the 2000s when Altria began to sell some shares before spinning off the company in its entirety in 2007. During their relationship nothing overtly shady seems to have occurred other than the fact that both companies sell products that can be detrimental to public health.

In an interview with NPR Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld explained that the split would allow Kraft to pursue opportunities that being a subsidiary had blocked off. In no way was this a move against the possibility that Kraft would end up losing money to pay off various tobacco lawsuits on the behalf of Altria Group. Nor did the spin off seem to indicate that Kraft would pursue healthier options because as Irene Rosenfeld put it ""...nobody is willing to trade off the great taste of the food that they're eating for the benefit of having some other nutritional properties..."" The only reason then that Kraft is less shady now is because it is no longer covered in tobacco smoke.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8yNS91cy9oZWluei1uZXcta2V0Y2h1cC1yb2xsZXItdHJuZC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFDaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMS8wOS8yNS91cy9oZWluei1uZXcta2V0Y2h1cC1yb2xsZXItdHJuZA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Heinz releases gadget to put the squeeze on ketchup packets,"CNN —

Kraft Heinz has just rolled out a new product that the condiment company says is the “biggest innovation in sauce since the packet itself.”

Earlier this month the world’s largest producer of ketchup announced the Packet Roller a ketchup bottle-shaped gadget that allows users to squeeze the most out of a condiment packet.

“Do not click ‘purchase’ unless you are prepared to change everything about the way you sauce” the Heinz Packet Roller website says. The roller goes for $5.70.

The roller is pocket-sized can be added to a keychain and features a packet corner cutter.

This announcement could be part of the fast-tracked “future-focused culinary and packaging innovations” that Steve Cornell president of Kraft Heinz’s US grocery business unit hinted at earlier this year amid a shortage of ketchup packets.

A surge in takeout and delivery food orders during the pandemic led to a scarcity of ketchup packets.

Sunday it was his turn.

Shackelford stood before Central Church in Collierville with a message of refuge.

He had gone to the scene of the deadly shooting at the Kroger grocery store a couple miles from the church on Thursday not long after he'd turned in notes for what he thought he was going to preach about Sunday. The Kroger isn't far from his house a familiar drive that his family makes weekly.

Easily he said they could have been inside the store when the shooter opened fire Thursday afternoon injuring 10 employees and five customers before dying of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

One of the people he shot has died. Six remain in the area trauma center though none were in critical condition as of Sunday morning.

""The town of Collierville experienced the greatest tragedy that's ever happened in the city"" Shackelford told his congregation repeating an early descriptor given by the town's police chief and recent church visitor Dale Lane. ""There was a mass shooting.""

Collierville:'This is not a normal night in Collierville' and high school football can't fix that | Giannotto

Collierville Kroger shooting:Shooting victims improve none remain in critical condition Sunday

Central Church with a large membership in Collierville describes itself as a non-denominational evangelical church. About 81% of Tennesseans are Christian according to a 2014 Pew Research Center study and 52% of Tennesseans identify as ""Evangelical Protestant."" More than half of all people in the state attend religious services weekly and 70% pray daily.

Shackelford pointed the 150-some people at the 11 a.m. service the second of the morning and those watching online to the Psalm one he remembered pastors using in the wake of Sept. 11.

""If you are shaking in a shaky world"" Shackelford said ""you need an unshakable God.""

The metaphor borrowed from what Shackelford witnessed in the Kroger parking lot Thursday afternoon. That was a ""John 11 moment"" he said a time to weep for the victims and witness rather than preach to them. And as Shackelford spoke to people at the Kroger he told the congregation photos and headlines of the news broadcast in the center of three large screens at the altar their hands were shaking.

That the church's pastor of two years didn't run from the shooting but to it is admirable and has impressed upon new pastor of evangelism Greg Sukert what it means to serve and love the city.

As Sukert spoke to Kroger employees who'd been inside during the shooting he noticed their trembling hands and tear-filled eyes but was struck by a resounding prayer request: ""Pray that we can sleep.""

Those who didn't immediately run outside hid in freezers and hunkered down in locked offices. One worker was rescued from the roof.

As Shackelford praised the response of what he described as ""200 to 300"" first responders he was met with applause from the audience. Lane the police chief he reminded them had just recently been honored and prayed for during last Sunday's sermon.

""I realized 'Oh my goodness' as we were standing there watching (Lane) order people around and send people in different directions"" Shackelford said. ""That's what we were praying for church.""

How to help:Funds set up for Collierville Kroger shooting victims and families

Olivia King:Collierville Kroger shooting victim identified by friends

Shackelford implored the congregation to think of their own metaphorical ""hiding place.""

People hide in money other people in ""plenty of time"" things that ""ultimately fail us"" Shackelford said.

""The problem is we have such poor hiding places"" he said. ""And the question is for all of us where can we hide? And that's the question you've got to be able to answer when you talk to people.""

That he explained was where Psalm 46 came in.

God the passage says is a person's refuge and strength ""an ever-present help in trouble."" ""Be still and know that I am God"" says Psalm 46:10.

""This was such a comfort and a refuge"" 74-year-old Marla Nitsch said after the service.

Nitsch a self-described follower of Jesus who helps with guest services at the church had been at a dollar store Thursday across the street from the back of the Kroger where several people fled the shooter. One woman who had been shot made her way across the street to the dollar store and was let inside.

Nitsch said the store was locked down for a couple hours.

Harrogate and District Green Party statement on Labcorp and animal testing: The animal testing laboratory has long cast a shadow over Harrogate. With progressive testing methods available and developing all the time the last thing our local MP should be doing is encouraging an expansion of animal testing. The European Parliament has voted to stop laboratory experiments on animals and replace them with modern science; the UK could easily do the same and push itself to the forefront of research and development without animal testing. Instead our local MP wants to keep us in the past by encouraging an increase in animal testing rather than working to change the industry. We would ask residents to write to Andrew Jones and urge him to rethink supporting increasing animal testing. Instead we want him to encourage the business and the UK to switch to modern human-biology-based techniques.",,,,,,,,,,,,

C2IMERA which stands for Command and Control Incident Management Emergency Response Application is an application focused on reporting planning force generation emergency management and command and control monitoring and execution. The capability is developed by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center’s Detachment 12 also known as Kessel Run which is a software development and acquisitions unit.



The C2IMERA team with their industry partners from Leidos who execute software development of the application were able to understand the rapidly-changing requirements and iterate on the application in real time in order to meet real world operational needs during the evacuation operation.



“The safe transit of more than 124000 Americans and U.S. personnel allies and partners and Afghans at special risk from Kabul in the last two weeks of August was an extraordinary effort professionally carried out by (Air Mobility Command) and (U.S. Air Forces Central) coalition and joint force Airmen” said Lt. Gen. Greg Guillot Ninth Air Force (AFCENT) commander. “Kessel Run’s C2IMERA application served as a reliable adaptable tool as we planned and executed this complex historic operation.”



Kessel Run was able to update the C2IMERA software in a four-day period; enabling real-time theater-wide awareness of key logistics and NEO support information. This provided aggregated views of base level data for decision making and understanding of the operational environment. These abilities were delivered to AFCENT and encompassed more than 650 new user accounts.



“Prior to the capability request AFCENT and their installations were relying on typical manual processes like Excel spreadsheets — which works in many cases — but is inefficient and does not provide ability for distributed access data aggregation or visualization capabilities” said Capt. Maurice Morrell program manager for the C2IMERA team with Kessel Run. “Kessel Run’s C2IMERA team was able to modernize and update the software for theater and installation systems providing an effective tactical to operational C2 bridge as the operation was happening in real time.”



During this period an AFCENT location had an incident that affected a base's local flying operations. The Combined Air and Space Operations Center used C2IMERA and further showcased its use beyond the NEO by being able to receive automated alerts of the local incident and response.



“The AFCENT Crisis Action Team was able to coordinate aircraft diversion in near real-time without traditional manual reporting processes saving untold time in response and man hours” Morrell said.



The event transpired within the same month Gen. Mark D. Kelly commander of Air Combat Command directed Kessel Run’s C2IMERA be used across all ACC’s installations.



C2IMERA is used in more than 40 Air Force installations with another 20 installations scheduled to onboard the capability before the end of the year. It is a wing command and control or C2 capability used to provide an integrated composite picture of installation resources.



The application uses a common operating picture and dashboarding capabilities as communication tools which consolidates and shares information for leaders and boasts a plethora of features to provide C2 capabilities. These tools are customizable and optimized based on the individual needs of the installation and also focus on updating and communicating data in real time to give commanders a constant picture of their installations environment assets and personnel.



That information is also viewable to whatever Air Force major command oversees the installation thereby enabling it to view detailed aspects of each of its installations in real time.



“Kessel Run’s products are operational and impacting our warfighters abilities today” said Col. Brian Beachkofski Kessel Run commander. “Using DevSecOps (development security operations) we were able to iterate on C2IMERA in real time to meet the operational needs of a user. This showcases just how fast we can deliver software solutions warfighters love.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZGJ1bGwuY29tL2NsLWVzL2NhbGwtb2YtZHV0eS13YXJ6b25lLXJlYmlydGgtaXNsYW5kLWd1aWEtbWVqb3Jlcy11YmljYWNpb25lc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guía Call of Duty Warzone Rebirth Island: Las mejores ubicaciones,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ndWF0ZW1hbGEuY29tL25vdGljaWFzL3ZpZGEvZ3VpbGxlcm1vLWRpYXotaW52ZXN0aWdhZG9yLWd1YXRlbWFsdGVjby1tYXMtbGVpZG9zLW5pdmVsLWludGVybmFjaW9uYWwtcmVzZWFyY2hnYXRlLmh0bWzSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ3VhdGVtYWxhLmNvbS9ub3RpY2lhcy92aWRhL2d1aWxsZXJtby1kaWF6LWludmVzdGlnYWRvci1ndWF0ZW1hbHRlY28tbWFzLWxlaWRvcy1uaXZlbC1pbnRlcm5hY2lvbmFsLXJlc2VhcmNoZ2F0ZS5odG1sP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guillermo Díaz el investigador guatemalteco de los más leídos a nivel internacional en ResearchGate,"Descripción de la foto para personas con discapacidad visual: Hombre con lentes y toga con colores naranja sonríe para la foto.

Rating: About this rating True

The legendary musical group Fugees announced on Sept. 21 2021 that they would be doing their first world tour in 25 years to commemorate the release of ""The Score"" the trio's 1996 classic album.

According to the tour promoter Live Nation Lauryn Hill Wyclef Jean and Pras Michel will reunite for charitable causes:

""Fugees charitable fund will partner with Global Citizen to work on philanthropic initiatives around the tour.""

Tickets go on sale Sept. 24 2021 with current shows scheduled for U.S. cities such as Oakland Inglewood Chicago New York and Miami.

In a statement included in Live Nation's news release Fugees vocalist Lauryn Hill said of the tour:

The Fugees have a complex but impactful history. I wasn’t even aware the 25th anniversary had arrived until someone brought it to my attention. I decided to honor this significant project its anniversary and the fans who appreciated the music by creating a peaceful platform where we could unite perform the music we loved and set an example of reconciliation for the world.

With tracks like ""Ready or Not"" and ""Killing Me Softly"" Live Nation described ""The Score"" as ""one of the best-selling and most significant music albums of all time."" The seven-time platinum album has sold more than 22 million copies as of this writing and won two Grammy awards. It is regularly included in various publications' lists of the best albums.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3RlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMjYvbG9uZG9ucy1kaWNlLXJhaXNlcy0xMjJtLWF0LWEtNDAwbS12YWx1YXRpb24tZm9yLWl0cy1pbnRlbGxpZ2VudC1ldmVudC1kaXNjb3ZlcnktYW5kLWJvb2tpbmctcGxhdGZvcm0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,London's Dice raises $122M at a $400M valuation for its intelligent event discovery and booking platform,"COVID-19 really put the kibosh on live events in the last 18 months but in the world of tech it also meant that live event startups that found a way to survive and grow throughout the period got a lot of attention. In the latest development Dice — a London company that has built a platform to help people discover and attend live events that might be of interest to them — has raised $122 million a funding round that sources tell us values the company at $400 million.

SoftBank Vision Fund 2 is leading the round a Series C with iPod “father” and Nest co-founder Tony Fadell (by way of Future Shape) Blisce French entrepreneur Xavier Niel Mirabaud Cassius and Evolution — all previous backers — also participating. (Previous investors in the company also include DeepMind co-founders Mustafa Suleyman and Demis Hassabis notable given the company’s early focus on data science and recommendation algorithms.) Prior to this round Dice had raised around $45 million according to PitchBook estimates.

Dice focuses these days mostly on live music and in the peak of the pandemic as everyone was locked down it rejigged its business model to focus on livestreaming: now with some 6400 livestreamed events and thousands more in-person events under its belt to appeal to a wider audience with a wider range of needs it is expanding around a multimodal strategy providing options to discover and attend/buy tickets to both streamed and in-person live events.

The new funds will be going toward expanding Dice’s geographic footprint with a special focus on the U.S. since this is where Dice’s business seems to be growing the fastest at the moment as cities and consumers gradually come out of pandemic hibernation to spend time together again in some cases at a frenetic pace. Phil Hutcheon Dice’s CEO and co-founder said that in New York alone over 1 million people used Dice to find and attend events in the single month of August.

(Sidenote on investors and founders: Hutcheon co-founded Dice in 2014 with Ustwo the agency that also spawned Monument Valley helped incubate Tray.io and has worked on number of other creative projects alongside its digital agency business: I’ve confirmed that Ustwo which hadn’t had an operational role in Dice in years has also sold its shares in the startup in this round.)

Giants like Ticketmaster Live Nation StubHub and Eventbrite dominate the landscape for ticketing for events but Hutcheon contends that these and other legacy platforms are too static and not fit for the modern age and specifically modern demands.

They are expensive both for event organizers and attendees to use and they have been slow to address both some of the more damaging parts of the event industry such as ticket touting and counterfeiting; and some of the more promising aspects of it such as providing better insights to event organizers based on all the data that can been gleaned from the average event browser and consumer.

“The world has been opaque around live performance but it’s now 2021” Hutcheon said in an interview. “The answer to shift it all is transparency. [Legacy ticket companies] make it all much more complicated than it should be.”

Dice’s answer has been to focus on three areas Hutcheon said. First is making ticketing easy and secure for users and venues. Second is discovery: making sure people who are interested in a particular performance are given reliable recommendations of other events they might like in locations that are realistic for them to visit. And third is community. In Dice’s case this originally (and still) means finding like-minded people on the site as well as visiting Dice and knowing what your friends or people like you might be interested to see. Now on top of this is a wider mandate for community Hutcheon said.

“We didn’t think about it in the beginning but loneliness has been a big issue” he said noting that one-third of 17-21-year-olds a sweet consumer spot for the company have reported loneliness during the pandemic. “Getting out to see culture brings people together.”

Dice took a very tech approach to addressing all of this. First it focused on building a network of venues and promoters with which it works very closely on ticketing — currently there are over 3600 of them covering not just music venues and promoters but also theaters and their ecosystems. Alongside this it has built a data set of its own created around those who visit the site and shop for events which in turn is used to help build and recommend events to “lookalike” visitors to Dice.

Then the tech stack that this sits on is focused around digital mobile-based ticketing to prevent reselling and counterfeiting and provide a legal way to resell tickets where the venue can refund a purchase and resell itself over Dice. It continually provides analytics to venues artists and promoters so that they can better understand how and where they are seeing demand for specific gigs and artists when to consider larger or smaller venues and more.

All of this helps Dice stand out in what is otherwise a pretty crowded market that has on top of that been toiling through dicey times. And just like Hopin and its huge boost due to virtual events it’s helped Dice attract investors.

“The concert business is a tangled mess of archaic tools and taxing ‘industry standards’ where artists are paid last. Venues shell out for marketing and are beholden to ticket conglomerates. Fans have to hunt for shows and regularly buy overpriced tickets from secondary markets or scalpers. This doesn’t make sense!” said Fadell in a statement. “DICE reengineers the entire live industry not just a part of it: Venues are connected to fans and artists. Artists get transparency access and control. Fans easily discover local shows and global livestreams and buy scalper-safe tickets with a single click.”

All this was neither quick nor easy to build and scale. Dice now active in dozens of cities has been deliberate about those city launches: It chooses a place to build relationships with multiple venues so that as Hutcheon described it a rich picture of a city’s music (and other) events can be sketched out and filled in — and subsequently feed the recommendations for more events. The recommendations are a lucrative part of its business with discovery driving more than 40% of tickets sold on Dice.

Hutcheon believes that Dice’s recommendation algorithms “are a huge advantage” but so is its selectivity. “We’re pretty careful about what gets onto Dice. The big question for us was how do you scale curation? Our solution has been to partner with the best organizations and venues and great bookers or artists.”

Pointedly Dice doesn’t tap social graph data from other platforms which partly meant that Dice took some 3.5 years to get its own platform off the ground.

Building its own dataset Hutcheon said “was seen as stupid at the beginning. ‘You could get there so much faster if you used Facebook’s Open Graph’ people told us. But now it’s seen as smart for a couple of reasons: it gives us more control but it’s also pro-privacy. If a site visitor doesn’t want recommendations and only wants to see what is popular then that’s fine too.”

Dice doesn’t tap social data from other platforms but it does leverage them to bring more audience to its service: it counts Spotify among its partners in that regard.

The next stages for Dice will be about not just expanding to more cities and netting in more live in-person events — provided pandemic R-numbers being controllable — but also to continue innovating on the livestreaming side. There is a lot of room for improvement there.

“We were seeing artists on Instagram doing pretty amateurish lame performances so we simply appealed to artists by saying: Get paid and do this properly” Hutcheon said. The focus so far has been not just on any performance but trying to create iconic and distinctive ones: Think Nick Cave playing in London’s Alexandra Palace.

“The fact that people were buying tickets in advance for livestreams made me realize that people needing things to look forward to” he added. He still thinks that will continue even as venue doors reopen. Dice’s live events data shows that for in-person events where tickets are purchased on its platform about 80%-85% of all tickets were sold to people living in major cities close to the event. But when it came to virtual livestreams only 39% came from major cities: “Older consumers or younger kids who couldn’t have gone to see Nick Cave in Ally Pally.”

Now they can and that kind of “special” stream that isn’t a replication of anything a ticket buyer could see in person will be what Dice focuses on ahead. “This why we built the livestreaming stack. The future is hybrid broadcasting” said Hutcheon.

“We believe DICE’s technology has the capacity to transform the future of live entertainment” said Yanni Pipilis managing partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers in a statement. “Alongside the flexibility and security of seamless ticketing the platform connects fans artists and venues in a completely new way … We are excited to partner with DICE to help create remarkable event experiences for fans all over the world.”

""We've been missing live music especially here in Australia"" she says down the line.





""The idea of having a 24-hour broadcast that's all about a positive force for change - count me in!""

Produced by international advocacy body Global Citizen Sunday's event has been created for broadcast viewing on myriad networks and platforms to call for coordinated action on vaccine equity extreme poverty and climate change.





The organisation's global board members include senior executives from Cisco Live Nation Entertainment TED and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.





The seven-strong Australian board includes former Democrats senator Natasha Stott Despoja.





Timed to coincide with the UN General Assembly next month's G20 and the COP 26 UN Climate Change Conference in November the organisation is calling on Australia to commit to reducing domestic emissions by 74 per cent by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050.





Global Citizen is also urging the government to set new science-based targets in line with the Paris Agreement to avoid a greater than 1.5C rise in temperatures.

Finally the organisation wants Australia to donate further COVID-19 vaccines and funding to its regional neighbours to ensure equitable access.





Co-hosted by Hugh Jackman in London and his wife Deborra-Lee Furness in New York Global Citizen Live will include performances by Kylie Minogue in London and Keith Urban in Las Vegas. Cathy Freeman and Celeste Barber will also make appearances.





Goodrem will be the only artist performing from Australia.





Not only that but given the strict COVID-safe protocols in her hometown of Sydney she'll be pretty much on her own at the piano outside the eastern sails of a certain well-known building.





""We're in lockdown and there are so many restrictions but I am going to give it my absolute heart and soul and fly the Australian flag from the iconic Sydney Opera House"" she says.





""Every country has had their path out of this and this is where we are and I accept that as a performer"" she says.





""I would love to be with a live crowd but you can see crowds if you watch the concert in some of the other cities.""





Although she'd prefer to keep the set list a surprise Goodrem will perform The Power from her recent sixth studio album Bridge Over Troubled Dreams along with three other tracks on Sunday at 9pm. Cyndi Lauper and Jon Batiste perform at Global Citizen Live in Central Park in New York. Source: AAP ""This has been all about going back to where it started for me creatively which is the piano"" she says.





Goodrem 36 successfully fought Hodgkin's lymphoma early in her career and is a long-time advocate for a range of cancer-related and other charities including the Kinghorn Cancer Centre of which she has been patron since 2009.





She is similarly inspired by how easy Global Citizen makes it for people to get involved in a cause that is meaningful to them.





""You can go on their website and see all the different ways you might find your passion whether it's saving the planet defeating poverty or vaccine equity"" she says. ""It's about finding what hits your heart.""





Goodrem has been hitting listeners right in the heart ever since her breakout debut album Innocent Eyes in 2003 which has sold 4.5 million copies around the world.





She has since released a further five studio albums four of which have gone to No.1 and bagged 12 ARIAs in the process.

""Music has always been about healing for me and I know how it can change the energy in any room"" she says. ""It is an equaliser.""





Although she's performing Goodrem is as enthusiastic as any fan girl when it comes to who else is on the bill not least because she's worked with a few of them.





""I was fortunate to tour and sing with Andrea Bocelli who will be appearing from Tuscany"" she says.





""The incredible Ricky Martin who's in Las Vegas is a dear friend and I've also duetted with him. And of course I've worked with Keith Urban on The Voice.""





Given one of the tracks on her new album is titled Dear Elton she's not about to miss seeing her idol perform in Paris either alongside the likes of Ed Sheeran and the Black Eyed Peas.





""I have so much love and admiration for Sir Elton the master of the piano"" she exclaims.





""So there really is an amazing community of artists involved and I am so grateful to be part of such an incredible moment.""

OSHA construction standards specify training for ladder safety while the general industry standards do not.

Inspections of ladders supervision of employees and using a risk assessment to determine whether a ladder is the best equipment for the job are among the safety measures employers should use.

While analyzing more than 350 NIOSH fatality reports involving ladders Seth Patterson found a major theme: inadequate training.

“If the employers had effective ladder training that could have prevented most of these incidents from happening” said Patterson an environmental health and safety engineer at Lockheed Martin.

One possible reason for the lack of employee training is that ladders are relatively simple to use compared with other more complex equipment such as aerial lifts according to Mike Kassman director of OSHA and Disaster Response Training at CPWR – The Center for Construction Research and Training.

Despite continuing advances in ladder-related safety equipment such as outriggers to maintain side-to-side stability training remains important.

In the construction industry for example more than 70 workers are killed as a result of a fall from a ladder each year and 4000-plus suffer lost-time injuries according to a 2018 CPWR hazard alert.

In Patterson’s research half of the fatalities (88 of 175) resulted from a fall. In five more instances the victim was shocked and then fell. Forty-two other victims were electrocuted while on or holding onto a ladder for someone else. The remaining 40 fatalities were from a variety of causes including 15 in which the victim was on a ladder in a confined space when overcome and 12 others in which the ladder and/or user was struck by something.

Ladders earned a spot on OSHA’s annual “Top 10” list of most-cited violations in 2005 and has been on the list ever since. Employers can help prevent ladder-related injuries by providing supervision and determining whether a ladder is the appropriate equipment for the job which is a common practice among employers in the commercial construction industry according CPWR experts. Instead of using ladders these employers often have lifts or scaffolds because they have the space and budget for them.

However ladders aren’t likely to be going away anytime soon in industries such as residential construction – in part experts say because they’re inexpensive and portable.

Training

Ladder safety was discussed during an episode of “On the Safe Side” Safety+Health’s podcast.

Under OSHA regulation 1926.1060 employers are required to provide ladder safety training to workers via a “competent person” covering subjects such as fall hazards and weight capacity. The agency’s general industry regulations don’t specify ladder training but the agency in 1910.30(a)(3)(i) does say that each employer must educate employees on fall hazards in “the work area.”

The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health also known as Cal/OSHA goes a step further and requires that “supervisors of employees who routinely use ladders shall also be trained in ladder safety.”

The American Ladder Institute has four ladder safety training videos on its website covering mobile ladders single and extension ladders articulated ladders and stepladders. The organization also has a webpage detailing basic ladder safety.

One major topic covered is maintaining three points of contact while climbing. Spencer Schwegler former director (retired) of OSHA and disaster response training at CPWR as well as a retired union painter pointed out that although OSHA doesn’t “spell out” a requirement for three points of contact it’s implied in 1926.1053(b)(20-22).

What’s considered three points of contact? OSHA and ALI agree that it can mean two hands and one foot or two feet and one hand. A knee or elbow isn’t considered a point of contact Schwegler added.

“Early in my career I deluded myself thinking my knee was a point of contact so I could carry more tools and paint up the ladder” Schwegler told Safety+Health.

OSHA rule 1926.1053(b)(22) states that employees on a ladder should not carry an object or any load that could cause them to lose their balance or fall. Instead they should plan ahead on how they’re going to get their tools or other objects to their work area.

ALI recommends using “towlines a tool belt or an assistant to convey materials so that the climber’s hands are free when climbing.” The CPWR hazard alert emphasizes: “Do not carry tools and materials while climbing. Use a rope to haul or hoist materials to the upper level.”

The organization’s experts stress not to use a ladder horizontally or as a plank not to stand on the top two steps of a stepladder and that employers and workers should make sure the height of the ladder is right for the job. ALI says workers should keep the center of their belt buckle or stomach between the ladder side rails while working. Don’t lean or overreach as that could make a ladder tip sideways.

On 24 September 2021 the last of eight C-130 H-model Hercules transport aircraft departed Louisville Air National Guard Base (KY).

With the last legacy C-130H serial number 91-1233 having departed Louisville the 165th Airlift Squadron/123rd Airlift Wing prepares to convert to the C-130J Super Hercules.

Facing a new future the 165th AS/123rd AW is slated to begin receiving the C-130J Super Hercules at Louisville in November 2021. In the meantime most of the departing H-models which the Kentucky Air Guard had flown since 1992 are being transferred to Delaware Air National Guard's 142nd Airlift Squadron/166th Airlift Wing based at New Castle Air National Guard Base (DE).

As for legacy Hercules with tail number 11233; before it was added to the Delaware ANG inventory the C-130H logged 9967 hours of flight time all over the world supporting every kind of mission from humanitarian airlift to combat resupply operations.

In the spring of 2019 the Pentagon accused China of using “cyber theft” and other methods to bolster its military.

China’s efforts to build a world class military certainly have not come just from domestic research and development (R&D) efforts but rather from stealing from foreign powers. Even Russia has expressed frustration that China has so brazenly “borrowed” technological innovations as Beijing rolls out ever more advanced military hardware.

This is evident in the J-20 “Mighty Dragon” fighter which was almost certainly based on stolen designs from the United State Air Force’s Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. As Business Insider had previously reported the appearance and profile of the aircraft is far from the only similarities between the two fifth-generation fighters.

It would be a tremendous coincidence that the J-20’s development began in earnest only after the F-22 was unveiled yet some of the technology on the Chinese fighter has been described as looking “awfully similar” to systems on the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. It would be suspicious enough if the Chinese fighter merely resembled the F-22 but the fact that its sensor system is so close in design to the Lockheed Martin Electro-Optical Targeting System found on the Lightning II surely suggests that espionage played some role in the Mighty Dragon’s development.

This isn’t just speculation either.

In fact in 2007 Lockheed Martin had found that Chinese hackers had been stealing technical documents related to the F-35 program while a similar theft occurred when hackers working for Beijing breached a network of an Australian F-35 sub-contractor the Asia Times reported. Based on those breaches it seems likely that the Chinese had acquired crucial information and technological data that has been utilized in production of the J-20.

Despite the fact that China gained valuable insight from the west which certainly aided in the development of its advanced aircraft—it has also kept its cards close to the chest revealing little details about the capability of the fifth-generation fighter. It is believed the J-20 is capable of reaching a maximum speed close to Mach 2 (1535 mph) and has a ceiling of around 60000 feet along with a range of about 700 miles—but other key information is sparse.

The Chinese jet is also believed to be able to carry at least four long-range air-to-air missiles in its large internal weapons bay while it also has two lateral bays that can hold a single short-range missile. It has also been further reported that that the J-20 could have additional external hardpoints for an additional four missiles—so it seems it could be a Mighty Dragon indeed and a well-armed one at that.

At present the J-20 hasn’t been produced in large numbers but China has been a nation that has shown that it has patience to build up slowly. It is clearly playing a long game as it works to reach its goal of having a world class military. Moreover it also is evident that stolen technology is playing a role in those efforts.

And while the dragon may be a symbol of China its actual Mighty Dragon appears to be born of western innovation!

The additional Adirs as the aircraft are referred to in Israel touched down at Nevatim airbase on September 26 to join the air force’s “Lions of the South” Squadron.

The 116th (“Lions of the South”) Squadron started operating the F-35A in August 2020 after approximately half a year after after it was stood as the Israeli Air Force’s second Adir squadron.

Israel’s now 30-strong fleet also includes a special test aircraft which will allow the country to test the integration of certain indigenous technologies into the F-35 before they are rolled out for the rest of fleet. Israel is the only country in the F-35 program that has been allowed to make changes to the aircraft that include indigenous electronic warfare systems sensors and countermeasures.

Israel declared operational capability for the fifth-generation fighter in 2017 and is said to have used the aircraft in a number of combat operations. The country is expected to be second-largest international F-35 operator with 50 units on order and options for additional 25 to 50 aircraft. As it currently stands the largest F-35 operator outside the US will be Japan with 150 units on order.

As of September 2021 the F-35 program with Lockheed Martin at the helm delivered more than 690 aircraft to 14 services worldwide. Eight countries have achieved initial operational capability with the type and have amassed 430000 flight hours to date according to a Lockheed Martin fact file."

Lowe a University of Utah football player was tragically shot and killed early Sunday morning at a house party in Sugar House.

His mom Donna Sterns tells FOX 13 that Lowe is survived by his three brothers and one sister. He was a triplet.

Sterns says Lowe was never a problem child and describes him as a ""good kid"" who wanted nothing more than to please his mom.

""I was told by the detective that he did not do anything wrong that he was not in any criminal activity. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time” she said.

Sterns flew in from Mesquite Texas on Sunday to group with coaches of the team.

The family now has created a GoFundMe to support a memorial service.

“He worked so hard to get to Utah"" Sterns said. ""He always talked about 'Mama when I get there and I make it I’m gonna buy you this big ol’ house.'”

Neighbor and lifelong Ute fan Elmira Sperling woke up to the tragic news.

""You don’t hear these stories up in Sugar House so I was extremely surprised” she said.

Sperling remembers when fans mourned the loss of Ty Jordan. Jordan was a good friend of Lowe and tragically died from an accidental gunshot wound.

“Horribly ironic that he would also be shot as well” said Sperling.

Lowe took on wearing Jordan's number 22 this season as a tribute to his friend. Now many including Sperling are calling for #22 to be retired as a way to honor these two late players.

“Retiring it hanging it up would be an honorable thing to do. I respected Aaron Lowe taking on the number because he was a childhood friend but I don't really think anyone else could fill those shoes” Sperling said.

Investigators believe several witnesses who were at the party may have videos or photos that will help solve the case.

University of Utah sophomore and football defensive back Aaron Lowe was shot and killed early Sunday morning during a house party.

For the second time in less than a year the Utah football program is mourning the loss of one of its own.

The two Utes players that have died during that time shared a deep special connection.

Sophomore defensive back Aaron Lowe 21 was shot and killed early Sunday morning according to Salt Lake police and another person was seriously injured.

Lowe’s close friend running back Ty Jordan died from an accidental shooting last Christmas night.

It’s a devastating and unfathomable turn of events for the program that is still healing after Jordan’s death.

During the offseason Lowe announced he was changing his uniform number from No. 2 to No. 22 as a tribute to Jordan.

The school established a scholarship in Jordan’s name and before the season kicked off Lowe was named the first recipient of the Ty Jordan Memorial Scholarship by Utah’s Leadership Council.

Lowe and Jordan were high school teammates at West Mesquite High School in Mesquite Texas.

“Ty made everyone around him better” Lowe said when he received the scholarship. “He made me better. My friendship with Ty means a lot because he was always pushing me to be my best. He never let me settle for less. I want to make sure his legacy lives on through me.”

While Jordan impacted Lowe Lowe impacted Jordan as well. Lowe played an instrumental role in bringing Jordan to Utah in the fall of 2020. When Jordan de-committed from the University of Texas Lowe encouraged Jordan to find a home with the Utes. And he did.

As a freshman last fall in just five games Jordan earned Pac-12 Offensive Freshman of the Year honors averaging 119.4 yards rushing per game.

Lowe’s on-field impact at Utah wasn’t as visible. He arrived on campus in 2019 and played in 11 games as a true freshman saw time in all five games in 2020 mostly on special teams and he played in the Utes’ first four games of 2021 including Saturday’s win over Washington State at Rice-Eccles Stadium.

At the end of the third quarter the school held “a moment of loudness” in honor of Jordan just as it did in the season-opener against Weber State on Sept. 2. As Jordan’s highlights from last season played on the big screens at the stadium fans cheered for Jordan.

Hours after the game Saturday as news of Lowe’s passing spread his teammates conveyed their shock grief and love on social media.

“Why do the good have to die young?” wrote linebacker Devin Lloyd on Twitter. “Love you brother. Rest in paradise.”

“God bless A Lowe’s soul” wrote center Nick Ford. “Can’t keep losing brothers left and right.”

“Rest in Peace My (brother)!” wrote defensive lineman Xavier Carlton. “You will forever be in my heart.”

“Rest In Peace A Lowe” wrote quarterback Cam Rising. “Love you brother.”

Utah coach Kyle Whittingham and athletic director Mark Harlan both issued statements about Lowe.

“We are devastated to hear about the passing of Aaron Lowe. Our thoughts and prayers are with Aaron’s family and friends along with the other individual who was harmed in this tragic incident” Whittingham said. “Aaron was a great teammate friend brother and son and was loved by anyone who crossed paths with him. He will be deeply missed.”

“We are devastated by the loss of Aaron Lowe earlier this morning. Aaron was a terrific young man a leader on our football team and a rock of resiliency and courage” Harlan said. “Our prayers are with Aaron’s family friends teammates and all who knew and loved him. We also express our deepest concern for the other individual who has been hospitalized as a result of this tragic incident. We have been in communication with Aaron’s family and we are providing support to them as well as to the student-athletes coaches and staff in all of our athletics programs and our focus will remain on them.”

Before the season Lowe said he wanted to represent and honor Jordan’s legacy.

“Since the day I met him I knew he would be a good person” Lowe said. “And it was because people always looked up to him. People always wanted to be around him. It was his personality that influenced me. I had someone in him — someone who came from where I came from. It is because of him that I changed to No. 22. The impact you left on me and all of your friends that will be something we will never forget.”

When the school announced the creation of the Ty Jordan Memorial Scholarship it said it “will be awarded to a student-athlete in the football program who exemplifies the inspiring qualities that Jordan displayed through his work ethic positivity and perseverance through adversity.”

According to his teammates and coaches Lowe embodied the spirit of those attributes.

This month the celebrated singer-songwriter marks the 20th anniversary of his album ""The Convincer"" with a bravura rerelease. When it originally entered the soundscape the critically acclaimed LP had everything going for it but timing. ""The Convincer"" dropped on Tuesday September 11 2001.

The original release may have been overshadowed by international tragedy but for Lowe ""The Convincer"" has aged particularly well. That's saying a lot for the musician who has proven time and again to be his own worst critic. As he told me in a recent conversation ""I really don't think I'm much good at all because it's all always in the ear of the beholder.""

In a career that has produced the solo hit ""Cruel to Be Kind"" and as a mega-anthem for Elvis Costello ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace Love and Understanding"" he has seen his share of success. But when it comes to his own work Lowe keeps returning to ""The Convincer."" He even goes so far as to allow that it's his ""favorite record.""

This is a remarkable admission from the same artist who told me ""I'm always disappointed with what I do. It's never good enough. And I judge each record I've made on the degree to which it has failed."" By Lowe's highly critical standard then ""The Convincer"" succeeds admirably because to his mind ""it's not bad"" which makes it ""the best record I've ever made.""

Admitting he ""has painted a bit of a bleak picture"" of the record-making process Nick Lowe-style the musician attributes the sonic returns of ""The Convincer"" to the painstaking experience of its original production. He fondly recalls developing the record in advance with co-producer Neil Brockbank and fellow musician Bobby Irwin ""cheerleaders"" who previewed the songs over convivial bowls of pasta.

By that point Lowe had already slaved over the compositions working away until he was able to ""strip away everything about me"" — all ""my little tricks and conceits"" — until the song has been whittled down so much that he feels ""like I'm singing a cover song."" Only then when he has excoriated all of the ""flim-flam"" and removed the ""fat off of the bones"" does he believe that the song is once and truly written.

""That's when I like my stuff"" he said ""when I feel like it's something that somebody else has written and that I've had nothing to do with it.""

When it came to the studio Lowe was backed by a superb band for ""The Convincer"" with Geraint Watkins on the keys Steve Donnelly on lead guitar and Robert Treherne on drums. For Lowe the studio is about capturing the moment.

""What I was trying to do was more akin to making a jazz record"" said Lowe about capturing the best performance in the heat of the moment. ""That's when it turns into a pop record then you can put as many overdubs and backing vocals and everything but the essence of the thing was alive.""

With the rerelease of ""The Convincer"" the results speak for themselves. From the opening swagger of ""Homewrecker"" and cool optimism of ""Let's Stay in and Make Love"" Lowe's vocals shimmer with a smooth confidence. The album is well-served by a trio of bonus tracks including a rip-roaring cover of ""Mama Said"" and ""A Different Kind of Blue"" Lowe's revealing take about his creative mindset.

With albums like ""The Convincer"" Lowe found himself feeling ""excited again"" as if he were in the face of ""something we hadn't heard before. Everything's been done in pop music"" he observes but ""I always want to do something that creates a brand new sound"" even if he may invariably fall short. In songwriting Lowe reminds us ""it's the cross you have to bear.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1sYi5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRoYW5pZWwtbG93ZS1sb29raW5nLXRvLWltcHJvdmUtb24tc3dpbmctaW4tb2Zmc2Vhc29u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nathaniel Lowe looking to improve on swing in offseason,“I would like to be better with higher velocity” Lowe said. “It goes back to preparation.

Salt Lake City police said the 21-year-old Lowe was killed just after midnight a few hours after the Utes beat Washington State 24-13. A second victim in the shooting a woman is in critical condition and police are searching for a suspect.

“We are devastated to hear about the passing of Aaron Lowe” Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Aaron’s family and friends along with the other individual who was harmed in this tragic incident. Aaron was a great teammate friend brother and son and was loved by anyone who crossed paths with him. He will be deeply missed.”

Lowe was a high school teammate of Jordan’s in Mesquite Texas and switched his jersey from No. 2 to 22 to honor his friend after the 19-year-old died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen on Christmas night 2020.

Last month Lowe was named the first recipient of the Ty Jordan Memorial Scholarship voted on by the team.

“Ty made everyone around him better” Lowe said after receiving the honor in August. “He made me better. My friendship with Ty means a lot because he was always pushing me to be my best. He never let me settle for less. I want to make sure his legacy lives on through me.”

The Utes credited Lowe for persuading Jordan to play at Utah after decommitting from the school. Jordan was named the Pac-12 freshman of the year and led all freshmen nationally in rushing yards per game before he was killed.

Lowe appeared in 16 combined games on special teams his first two seasons and played in all four games this season.

“We are devastated by the loss of Aaron Lowe earlier this morning” Utah athletic director Mark Harland said in a statement. “Aaron was a terrific young man a leader on our football team and a rock of resiliency and courage. Our prayers are with Aaron’s family friends teammates and all who knew and loved him. We also express our deepest concern for the other individual who has been hospitalized as a result of this tragic incident.”

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox also tweeted his condolences to Lowe’s family."

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvdHJ1bXAtaXJzLWNoaWNhZ28tYXVkaXQtMDAxNTc0ODDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump may face a $100M-plus tax bill if he loses IRS audit fight over Chicago tower according to report,"Trump’s presidential campaign provided a statement in son Eric Trump’s name saying the IRS inquiry “was settled years ago only to be brought back to life once my father ran for office. We are confident in our position.”

The tax records cited by the report indicate that Trump twice deducted losses on the Trump International Hotel and Tower which opened in 2009 near the banks of the Chicago River that cuts through that city’s downtown.

The report said Trump initially reported losses of $658 million in his 2008 filings under the premise that the property fit the IRS definition of being “worthless” because condominium sales were disappointing and retail space went unfilled amid a deep U.S. recession.

But in 2010 the published report said Trump transferred the ownership of the property to a different holding company that he also controlled using the move to save money on taxes by reporting an additional $168 million in losses over the next decade on the same property.

The report did not have any updates on the status of the IRS inquiry since December 2022 but said Trump could owe more than $100 million including penalties if he were to lose the audit battle.

Trump meanwhile is appealing a New York judge’s ruling from February after a civil trial that Trump his company and top executives lied about his wealth on financial statements conning bankers and insurers who did business with him. In early April Trump posted a $175 million bond halting collection of the more than $454 million he owes from the judgment and preventing the state from seizing his assets to satisfy the debt while he appeals.

Democrat President Joe Biden has said that Trump largely owes his fortune to an inheritance from his father rather than through his own financial acumen. Biden has gone after Trump for not wanting to pay taxes while his administration has increased IRS funding in order to increase audits of the ultra-wealthy and improve compliance with the federal tax code.

The Trump campaign opposes the additional funding that Biden and Democrats provided to the IRS. At campaign rallies Trump has said the United States would be destroyed as a country unless his 2017 tax cuts that are largely set to expire after 2025 are extended.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Magical' $1.8M treehouse-like home in the Oakland Hills for sale,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/magical-treehouse-like-home-oakland-hills-19451043.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvYm94LW9mZmljZS1raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtMTIzNTkxMTExOC_SAVlodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L2JveC1vZmZpY2Uta2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLTEyMzU5MTExMTgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Still Reigning With $52M-$55M Opening – Saturday Box Office Update,"SATURDAY AM: For those hooked on a theory last weekend that star power no longer works in opening films their concerns are further underscored this weekend as a bunch of no-name apes are driving 20th Century Studios/Disney’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes to what might be the biggest B.O. opening this May of $52M-$55M. This is all fueled by PLFs and Imax screens which are delivering 44% of the weekend’s till. Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak exits showed that 43% of the moviegoers bought tickets because they love the franchise natch.

We’ll see if a Cannes Premiere this week can lift Furiosa past its current $40M-$50M projection but word of mouth is excellent out of early screenings for the George Miller directed Mad Max: Fury Road prequel. Unlike Disney with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny last Cannes a movie that wasn’t ready for primetime Warners is truly in pole position here to blast Furiosa off.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes posted a very good Friday of $22.2M thanks to late night business which isn’t that far from the first Friday results of Tim Burton’s 2001 version ($24.6M) and ahead of Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M) and pennies lighter than War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M). However the Wes Ball directed version of the 56-year old franchise gets a B Cinemascore and 3 1/2 stars/77% on Screen Engine/Comscore’s PostTrak so hopefully these apes don’t lose their muscle. On a whole 85% of the CinemaScore audience gave Kingdom an A or a B. That’s one of the lowest grades for an Apes movie in the millennium down there with Burton’s which got a B-. Rotten Tomatoes’ audience score has eased to 79%. Still good on Disney for getting this movie opened their first try with the franchise post 20th Century Fox. Despite the audience exits there’s confidence at Disney for the sequel to arrive at the higher end of its projections due to its better-than-expected Friday.

Social media monitor RelishMix detected mixed to positive word of mouth before Kingdom‘s opening. That said on the bright side: “Fans anticipating the sequel seem excited primarily because of one thing — sheer love for the past three films. ‘This looks freaking incredible. I gotta rewatch all the previous ones before this comes out. These movies are so cool.’ The quality of the past films is driving immense interest in this one” ‘This is one of the best franchises ever made. Every movie was awesome. A near-perfect trilogy. I was not expecting a fourth installment but man this looks great!’ Whatever direction the Apes franchise goes next it looks like fans will follow.”

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes saw 64% men turnout with 18-34 year olds repping 57% of the audience with the 25-34 year old segment being the biggest demo at close to a third. Solid diversity demos in 35% Caucasian 27% Latino and Hispanic 22% Black and 9% Asian. Those moviegoers going bananas for this sequel were in the South South Central and West. AMC Burbank is currently the highest grossing theater in the nation with $67K.

The social media universe for Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes stands at 331.6M followers across TikTok Facebook X YouTube and Instagram. Compared to other action sci-fi comps Kingdom‘s smu runs 24% above genre norms but below recent pics such as Dune: Part Two (575.7M) and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (508.8M) and even Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (393M).

Ryan Gosling in ‘The Fall Guy’ Universal Pictures

Universal’s second weekend of Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt’s Fall Guy is eyeing $14.4M -48% a very good hold. The second weekend is better than Lost City‘s -51% but a little lighter as that Sandra Bullock-Channing Tatum film posted $14.7M. The pic’s slither out of the gate had more to do with the marketplace and the insider type of movie that it was and less about stars — it was Gosling’s third highest opening of his career. Some were even put off by the mixed genres. “It’s a problem when you’re pushing a romantic comedy and a majority of men show up” sniped one rival studio source.

Elsewhere there’s Briarcliff Entertainment’s comedy satire Not Another Church Movie booked at 1108 theaters which had no P&A spend and is resulting in $120K Friday and a $300K 3-day. Critics didn’t think it was funny at 17% on RT nor did moviegoers at 44%. Johnny Mack wrote and directed the movie which stars Mickey Rouke as the Devil Jamie Foxx as God and Kevin Daniels as Taylor Pharry.

Overall weekend stands at $93.8M which is 27% ahead of last weekend but 7% off from the same frame in May a year ago when the second weekend of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 delivered $62M.

UPDATED AFTER EXCLUSIVE: 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes filed $6.6M in previews per Disney. As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Hands down tonight it’s the best preview cash for a Ball movie beating all of his Maze Runner titles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWFsY29sbS1hdy1jYW5jZWxlZC0xMDBtLW5lb20tY29udHJhY3QtaHVtYW4tcmlnaHRzLWFidXNlLXNhdWRpLTIwMjQtNdIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbWFsY29sbS1hdy1jYW5jZWxlZC0xMDBtLW5lb20tY29udHJhY3QtaHVtYW4tcmlnaHRzLWFidXNlLXNhdWRpLTIwMjQtNT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CEO canceled $100M Neom contract after Saudis bulldozed villages,"The site of NEOM in Tabuk Province Saudi Arabia. NEOM

Malcolm Aw said he pulled out of a Neom contract because of alleged Saudi human rights abuses.

The CEO of Solar Water told BI that he had planned to build solar desalination plants.

Human rights campaigners say tribe members are being forcibly evicted to make way for the megacity.

A green energy founder pulled out of a $100 million Neom contract after he realized that the Saudis were bulldozing villages to make way for the megacity.

Malcolm Aw the CEO and founder of Solar Water told Business Insider that he initially got involved with Neom to help realize its ambitions as a pioneering green energy ""eco-city.""

Neom is the centerpiece of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 project to diversify the Saudi economy away from fossil fuels and transform it into a luxury tourism destination and innovation hub.

However Aw said he was so appalled at reports of human rights abuses that he canceled the Neom contract in 2022 despite having already built some of his desalination plants there.

""They just they bulldoze their way right through villages and everything which is just unbelievable"" said Aw.

Aw spoke to BI after BBC News reported that an exiled Saudi colonel said Saudi Arabia authorized the use of lethal force to clear the way for its Neom desert megacity.

Col Rabih Alenezi said he was ordered to evict people living on the land to make way for a part of the project called The Line . The area was mostly populated by the Huwaitat tribe.

The BBC said it was not able to independently verify Alenezi's comments about lethal force.

However satellite images analyzed by the BBC showed three villages including schools and hospitals were destroyed to make way for Neom.

One of the villagers Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti was later reportedly killed by Saudi authorities said the UN.

""What it tried to do is turn the whole province into Dubai or Qatar or something but in doing so they are clearing the people who have been there for years out of the area"" said Aw.

""These people could be such a contribution to this whole development. You know the villages have all been removed.""







Aw who is a descendant of Tiger Balm founder Aw Boon Haw told BI that he had initially been drawn to work on the Neom project because of its commitment to green energy and ecology.

Aw's company uses solar energy for desalination while most desalination plants burn fossil fuels and have been found to pollute oceans. Neom had offered Aw's company Solar Water $100m for exclusive rights to use his technology.

Neom's planners say they want to be an""eco-city"" with the signature project ""The Line"" — a vertical mirrored skyscraper cutting through the desert — running on 100% renewable energy and 95% of the land preserved for nature. They claim to be committed to ""respecting existing communities and cultural heritage within our region.""

But Aw believes the promises are not being fulfilled and planners are performing a U-turn on their original vision for the city.

""What they're doing is not ethical and what they're doing is they're creating an exclusivity to house wealthy people in a wealthy touristic area. But that wasn't the original idea. The idea was to develop a green scenario"" he said.

""The whole idea we came in is to make the place green and for the people the local people the indigenous who have been there for ages for yonks to be able to share into development"" said Aw. ""But then they change course. Suddenly they are totally different from what we expect to do and in doing so they have done a lot of damage.""

Neom declined to comment on Aw's claims. The Saudi embassy in the UK did not respond to a request for comment.

Saudi Arabia has been trying to quell public criticism about its Vision 2030 plans .

Last year BI reported that the crackdown extended to those criticizing the evictions on social media with Fatima al-Shawarbi sentenced to 30 years in prison for speaking out.

The project has been beset by problems in recent months with costs spiraling to an estimated $1 trillion and key projects delayed or cut back. In April Bloomberg reported that Saudi officials were reducing the number of people expected to be living in Neom from around one million to 300000 by 2030. The report also said the length of The Line could be cut from around 100 miles to one mile.

Aw urged planners to stand by their original ethical and ecological vision.

""You know we have the technology to solve the [green energy] problem that people are complaining about today. Absolutely. Absolutely. But there's just not the vision or the ethical commitment"" he said."

50 had acquired the rights to the story of the Black Mafia Family the notorious Detroit-based drug trafficking and money laundering organization which operated in 11 states and reaped more than $270 million in profits and he wanted Flenory — the son of BMF kingpin Demetrius 'Big Meech' Flenory — to play his father in the series.

""He saw something in me before I could see it before anyone else in the world could see it"" says the young Flenory who was headed to study business at UNLV before 50 came calling.

Now he's starring in ""BMF"" the crime saga where he assumes the role of his father. The show's eight-episode first season — which traces the rise of the elder Meech and his brother Terry 'Southwest T' Flenory in the streets of Detroit in the 1980s — premieres at 9 p.m. Sunday on Starz.

In addition to Flenory ""BMF"" stars familiar faces Steve Harris (""The Practice"") Russell Hornsby (""The Hate U Give"") Wood Harris (""The Wire"") and Detroit rapper Kash Doll and features cameos from Snoop Dogg (who plays a pastor) and Eminem (who makes an appearance as Richard ""White Boy Rick"" Wershe Jr.). Relative newcomer Da'Vinchi plays the role of Terry Flenory and the series unfolds as a period crime saga that is both dramatic and darkly humorous.

Taking on the role of his father was enlightening for Lil Meech and offered a history lesson in more ways than one.

""We were filming in the 1980s era in Detroit — this is 20 years before I was born — and fashion was different music was different everything was different. So it was fun and it was eye-opening"" says Flenory on the phone from Atlanta earlier this week.

""It also helped me learn more about my dad"" he says. ""Being his child being able to live through his childhood at 15- 16-years-old he lived a totally different life than me. I went to private school and he had to drop out of high school because he was too embarrassed to go to school with holes in his shoes because he grew up so poor. So it was crazy putting myself in his shoes and living through him for that period in time and actually being able to walk the same footsteps he walked.""

Shooting took place from January to April of this year under tight COVID protocols. Atlanta mostly stands in for the Motor City although production was able to squeeze in about five days of shooting in Detroit which was essential for showrunner and Detroit native Randy Huggins.

""I really wanted to shoot in my hometown but I wasn't able to shoot the entire thing in the city so the biggest thing was making sure we could shoot as much as we could there"" says Huggins who has also worked on ""Criminal Minds"" ""Prime Suspect"" and ""Power"" the latter of which put him in the orbit of 50 Cent who called on him to helm ""BMF.""

Huggins a former elementary school teacher before transitioning to the entertainment industry was proud to be able to shoot in high profile areas such as Hart Plaza and Belle Isle as well as some parts of the city he had yet to explore.

""I had never been to the part of southwest Detroit where they were at and that's weird because I think I've been on every street in Detroit"" says Huggins. ""But when they took me over there where Ecorse River Rouge and Detroit all meet I was like 'Oh my God I have never been over here in my life.'""

Researching and building the show meant having a lot of conversations with Big Meech who is currently serving a 30-year sentence in an Oregon prison. (His sentence was reduced earlier this year and he's on track to be released in 2028.)

""We talked as much as we could and those phone calls are only like 10 minutes at a time"" says Huggins. ""And then I went to see him like three or four times and we built up a trust between us.""

The specific details of the time period were important to Meech — ""if there's lyrics in the music it's not real because the music we were listening to was all beat-driven"" Huggins was told — as well as to Huggins who grew up in the same era in the city as the Flenory brothers.

And those details in the series are rich from conversations at Coney Islands to visible cans of Faygo pop to shots and mentions of Cobo Arena Boblo Island the Uniroyal Tire Marathon's oil refinery and the now defunct Club Taboo. Characters watch ""The Scene"" on television and greet each other by saying ""whatupdoe."" The series feels like Detroit.

Shooting in the city connected Flenory who grew up in Miami to his family history.

""We filmed at my grandmother's house that my dad and uncle grew up in and I got to walk the same steps that my father and uncle got to walk"" says Flenory who was born in 2000. ""My grandmother was actually on set watching us and everything hit so close to home for her that she couldn't stop crying.""

There was also the immense pressure of portraying his father on screen. Flenory — who attended acting classes for two years five days a week two times a day to learn his craft — spoke with his father every day during shooting and he sees ""BMF"" as a chance to shed light on the story of his dad beyond the headlines.

""I really just wanted to do it right you know?"" says Flenory who despite being hand-picked by 50 still had to audition for the role. ""He wanted to show the world the real him. People don't understand the real Big Meech they don't know who he really is. They only know what they hear they only know the glamorized lifestyle of the cars the money the fame. They don't know how he started off poor and wasn't able to pay for anything. The choices he made back then are what shaped him and molded him into the person he is today. So people get a chance to see the origin story.""

Lil Meech says his father has yet to see the series. ""He'll be watching on Sunday"" he says — likely as will a lot of other Detroiters.

He’s a graduate of Homer High School and currently works as a refinery operator for Marathon Petroleum. He has two kids one who is school-aged and described the previous school year as a “disservice” to students.

Miller said during an interview at the Clarion offices on Sept. 23 that he is running for a seat on the school board to ensure the seat is filled with someone who represents the area. He said that he understands the difficult situation the school board was in during the 2020-2021 school year because of the COVID-19 pandemic but that student learning was lost because of mitigation protocols.

“They were put in a bad position” Miller said. “That’s not generally what people sign up for school board — to do health mandates. I think they way overshot on the safe side and way undershot on the teaching kids.”

Miller said he doesn’t agree with the implementation of universal indoor masking at some district schools and that whether or not a student wears a mask should be up to their parents. He also described weekly antigen testing discontinued earlier this school year as “way over the top.”

“I do think a lot of current COVID mitigations are feel-good political posturing and I think that’s going to cascade into a lot of things for the district” Miller said.

He added that while he thinks school board members are working to bring together people on both sides of divisive issues it isn’t their place to do so. Even though responsibility for the district’s COVID-19 mitigation plan shifted from the board to Superintendent Clayton Holland this year Miller said he doesn’t think the board’s “public image” has changed.

He described himself as fiscally conservative in his candidate statement and said he approves of the district’s use of federal COVID-19 relief funds for the overhaul of schools’ HVAC systems but that he’d like to see future funds used for one-time projects instead of those that may require upkeep and therefore a longer financial commitment.

“I don’t really think it should go to fund programs as much as one-time purchase items” Miller said of relief funding.

Similarly Miller said he doesn’t think the district should put school maintenance projects out to bond but rather explore more state or federal funding opportunities. The Kenai Peninsula Borough has tried to negotiate down its financial contribution to the construction of a new school in Kachemak-Selo toward which the state has committed $10 million. The borough’s $5 million match was defeated by voters when put out to bond.

“Those are things that the district needs to plan ahead and budget for not just wait until it’s an expense and then charge the taxpayers more” Miller said. “Already the majority of our property taxes here go to the school district and as far as districts in the nation go it’s a very well-funded district.”

Ultimately Miller said his priority was making sure the vacancy was filled by someone who represents Sterling and Funny River residents.

“I’m just a concerned father and there was a vacancy that needed to be filled” Miller said. “We wanted to make sure we got like-minded people that actually represent the area in there.”

The municipal election is on Oct. 5.

Achieving these new targets will require partnering with Marriott's dedicated associates across disciplines along with the company's valued hotel owners and franchisees. Over time initiatives may include increased use of renewable energy building electrification to maximize renewable electricity continued modifications to design standards so buildings are more efficient and the installation of automation systems and energy efficiency upgrades (for example smart thermostats). In addition to the company's goal to provide further visibility to the carbon footprint and environmental impact of their travel with Marriott guests and customers will see enhanced focus on existing sustainability efforts such as solid waste and food waste reduction and natural capital restoration with the opportunity to participate in activities such as reforestation as well as coral and mangrove plantings.

In support of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) this announcement aligns with the company's sustainability and social impact platform Serve 360: Doing Good in Every Direction which guides Marriott's commitment to help take on the world's most pressing social environmental and economic issues delivering value for associates customers owners the environment and communities around the world. It also builds on Marriott's long-standing history of embedding sustainability throughout its business strategy operations and value chain. Starting with the company's core value to Serve Our World and its first-generation environmental impact reduction goals to its latest series of waste reduction initiatives Marriott is promoting the sustainable development of the communities in which it operates as well as the resiliency and longevity of the business.

Marriott's sustainability strategy is driven by a wide range of initiatives to reduce environmental impacts through the construction and operation of sustainable hotels and responsible sourcing while protecting and restoring the ecosystems on which life depends. Recent initiatives include:

· The reduction of single-use plastics including replacing tiny single-use toiletry bottles of shampoo conditioner and bath gel in guestroom showers with larger pump-topped bottles. When fully implemented across the globe in 2022 the company's expanded toiletry program is expected to prevent about 500 million tiny bottles annually from going to landfills.

· The roll-out of an internal food waste prevention and reduction educational campaign designed to support Marriott's goal to reduce food waste by 50%.

· The launch of a publicly available responsible sourcing guide to help Marriott's supplier community join its sustainability journey on the path to responsibly sourcing 95% of the company's top ten priority categories.

· The development of a certifications database to help properties operate more responsibly and work towards the goal of 100% of the portfolio receiving a third-party sustainability certification.

· Planting more than 415000 trees over the last several years including through the company's work as a founding member of the Evergreen Alliance a select group of Arbor Day Foundation partners and collaborators committed to advancing trees and forests as natural solutions for corporate sustainability and citizenship goals.

· Innovative ecosystem restoration and carbon sequestration projects such as working with The Ocean Foundation to remove and repurpose sargassum seaweed which has had devastating impacts on the environment.

If you're planning a big trip overseas one important item to sort out is how you'll pay for purchases. You might figure you can just bring your credit cards along and use them as you would in the United States.

You can do that -- and in fact a credit card is a smart way to pay since you don't need to carry much cash. But there are some problems and additional expenses you can run into if you aren't prepared.

1. Some credit cards charge foreign transaction fees so bring one that doesn't

A foreign transaction fee is a fee for purchases made with international merchants. The standard amount is 3%. With a card that charges that much you'd pay an extra $30 on top of every $1000 in spending abroad.

Featured offer: save money while you pay off debt with one of these top-rated balance transfer credit cards

Fortunately there are plenty of credit cards with no foreign transaction fees. Travel rewards credit cards generally don't charge them and even some cash back cards don't have this type of fee.

Before you travel outside the country check if your credit cards have foreign transaction fees. If you don't have a card without this fee it's worth applying for one to save money.

2. You may need to notify your credit card issuer you're traveling

Some credit card issuers allow cardholders to set up travel alerts to let the card issuer know where you're going. That way when you start making purchases in another country they don't look like potential credit card fraud and get blocked.

Several major card issuers including Chase and American Express have phased out travel alerts in recent years. You might find that you don't need to create a travel alert with your credit card. However there are still many card issuers that use travel alerts. It's best to check in case yours does.

3. Visa and Mastercard are the most widely accepted card networks

There are four credit card payment networks: Visa Mastercard Discover and American Express. You can see which network a credit card belongs to by looking at the logo on the bottom-right corner of the card. In the United States all four networks are widely accepted. Most merchants that accept credit cards accept cards from all networks. That isn't always true overseas.

In terms of international acceptance Visa and Mastercard are the best credit cards to have. Discover and American Express are working on wider acceptance abroad but they're lagging behind.

4. Don't let the merchant convert the transaction to dollars

Some businesses abroad ask if you want to pay in the local currency or U.S. dollars. If you choose dollars the merchant uses a feature called dynamic currency conversion to change the currency of the transaction.

This may seem convenient and help you keep track of expenses but it's a bad deal. The merchant gets an exchange rate that's favorable to them. As the customer you get the short end of the stick and you may also get charged a fee for using the service.

It's always better to pay in the local currency. You get a much better exchange rate by letting your credit card issuer handle the currency conversion.

5. Many international merchants don't accept credit cards

Credit card acceptance is the norm in the United States but it varies in other places. In general big businesses usually accept credit cards. And in major cities credit card acceptance tends to be high among merchants of all sizes. In small and mid-sized cities it can be hit or miss. You may find that many businesses only accept cash and their own country's debit cards.

Carry some of the local currency with you just in case you need it. It's also a good idea to check online regarding credit card acceptance in the country you're visiting.

No one wants to have a credit card get declined on vacation or to come home to a bill full of extra fees. Now that you know more about using credit cards overseas you can navigate your international trip without surprise issues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YXJwcmVzcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIxLzA5LzI1L2FyZWEtcm91bmR1cC1qZW5uaWUtZGV2b2UtcGVyZm9ybS1jb3JuZXJzdG9uZS81ODQzNTMzMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Area roundup: Jennie DeVoe to perform at Cornerstone,"FROM NEWS REPORTS

(Source: Getty)

Australia’s largest bank has simplified and reduced merchant fees for small businesses struggling to recover from the pandemic in a move that will allow Aussies to save an estimated $7 million.

The Commonwealth Bank has introduced a 1.1 per cent and 1.5 per cent flat rate for all in-store card payments and online transactions respectively regardless of whether it’s a debit credit or Amex card.

These rates will automatically apply to CBA small business customers who have turnover of $250000 or less from October onwards.

The big four bank will also automate least-cost routing which is when the merchant chooses the cheapest payment network to process the transaction.

Rather than having the merchant select and manage which network (eftpos Visa or Mastercard) costs the least CBA will “centrally route” these transactions to automatically choose the cheapest option for them.

Commonwealth Bank’s James Fowle said the move comes after “overwhelming feedback” from its small business customers.

“They want simple competitive pricing without the hassle. They want the benefit from least cost routing without having to manage the routing themselves” Fowle said.

Additionally the bank is waiving three months’ worth of merchant fees for small business hit hardest by COVID-19 lockdowns.

“From next week we’ll be letting more than 50000 customers know we are automatically waiving their standard merchant fees for three months from September through to November” Fowle said.

“This translates into approximately $7 million back into their pockets leading up to Christmas.”

The announcement attracted praise from Australia’s small business advocate group with Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman (ASBFEO) Bruce Billson congratulating CBA for listening to the feedback.

Story continues

“This is a terrific early Christmas present” Billson said.

“The use of cashless transactions particularly tap-and-go payments has dramatically increased due to COVID-19 and it is vital to ensure that all small businesses are being offered the lowest cost options from their service provider or financial institution.”

Businesses already struggling to recover from the crippling impacts of the pandemic can’t afford the burden of higher payments Billson added.

“The cost of these higher and hidden charges across the economy is many millions of dollars – money that could be better put to work to grow business and employment prospects.”

The lower fees will automatically apply for eligible CBA small businesses meaning they don’t need to do anything to get the lower fees.

It's the third Ryder Cup win for the Americans this century (3-7) and the second in as many tries on home soil.

The U.S. took an 11-5 lead into Sunday singles its largest such advantage entering the final session at the Ryder Cup since 1975. After the Americans won three of the first four singles points Collin Morikawa tied Viktor Hovland in his match to guarantee a half point for the Americans that would get them to 14.5 points for the win.

""It means so much. ... To clinch this and bring the cup back to home soil it feels so good"" Morikawa said after his round. ""... The guys pulled through. We didn't let up and looking at the leaderboard hopefully we can keep going and hit the 18.5 or get past that. ... I don't think this is just a win. It's a dominant win. Everyone showed up. All 12 of us when we're called upon we show up.""

The 18.5 to which Morikawa is referring was the modern Ryder Cup scoring record achieved by the U.S. in 1981 and Europe in 2004 and 2006. The 19 total points scored by the Americans is the most for either side in the Ryder Cup since the rest of Europe joined Great Britain and Ireland at the event in 1979. It's also the most points scored in any Ryder Cup since 1975 (21-11).

""This is the greatest team of all-time right here"" U.S. captain Steve Stricker said.

""I never won a major"" he said later with tears in his eyes. ""This is my major right here.""

The Americans won the singles competition 7-3-2 after being favored in 11 of 12 matches to start the day. All 12 U.S. golfers won at least one match in foursomes or four-ball before singles competition on Sunday.

Dustin Johnson began the day undefeated on the event for the U.S. and became the first top-ranked American to finish a Ryder Cup with a perfect 5-0-0 mark after he defeated Paul Casey 1UP. He's just the fifth ever to reach the 5-0-0 mark period joining Gardner Dickinson and Arnold Palmer (1967) Larry Nelson (1979) and Francesco Molinari (2018).

Rory McIlroy won the first singles point Sunday for Europe defeating Xander Schauffele 3&2 but the U.S. immediately responded with a 4&2 victory for Patrick Cantlay over Shane Lowry. Next the Americans took down Europe's top two performers in the Ryder Cup as Scottie Scheffler beat Jon Rahm 4&3 and Bryson DeChambeau topped Sergio Garcia 3&2.

After Morikawa's trophy-clinching tie Brooks Koepka and Justin Thomas continued the U.S. scoring with respective wins over Bernd Wiesberger (2&1) and Tyrrell Hatton (4&3). On either side of Johnson's victory Europe got just its second and third points of the day with Ian Poulter finishing 3&2 over Tony Finau and Lee Westwood beating Harris English 1UP. Jordan Spieth and Tommy Fleetwood then tied before Daniel Berger beat Matt Fitzpatrick 1UP to make history in the final match.

""Speechless. These guys all came together. They had a mission this week"" Stricker said. ""Brooks and Bryson wanted to play together. That's how much they all came together. This is a new era for USA golf.""

The United States entered as heavy favorites for the biennial trophy led 6-2 after Day 1 and extended its advantage on Day 2. The U.S. won each of the first three sessions 3-1 before splitting the fourth session 2-2 with Europe. With the singles wins on Sunday it's the first time in modern history that the Americans went through a Ryder Cup without losing a single session.

A fed-up New Yorker tore down lurid subway advertisements for the dating app OK Cupid.

“All of this is gross. For kids to be looking at this is that OK??” she said in viral videos posted to Twitter on Wednesday.

The woman walked up and down the D train car ripping the ads down — while ranting about COVID-19 and communism — as silent masked straphangers looked on.

It’s not clear just when the video was recorded. The colorful ads began to appear on subway trains over the summer.

“Nicely done” another woman told her. “That’s what bravery looks like. Say ‘No’ to propaganda.”

The provocative ads target “non-monogamists” monogamists “pansexuals” potheads “bears” fetishists and just about every other group.

One aimed at “submissives” features women trampling an epicene man who reaches out to grab one’s foot.

4 The ads display overtly sexual themes within them. OKCupid/Instagram

Another directed toward “introverts” shows two people of indeterminate sex one kneeling before the other in a pose suggestive of oral sex.

There’s also a threesome and one up-close image of two tongues slithering into one.

“If fondling your partner while she sits on what appears to be a quiche is your thing by all means go for it. I would just prefer not to have to spend half an hour sitting in the room where you’re doing it” one beleaguered commuter who declined to give his name griped to The Post.

“Ok Cupid’s ads make me into a nonconsensual participant in the sex lives of strangers twice a day every day. It just skeeves me out.”

Netizens slammed the campaign online.

“You realize kids ride the subway in NYC right? imagine having to explain ‘pansexual’ ‘S&M’ or ‘submissive’ to a curious impressionable child who is too young to understand those concepts properly?” one tweeted at the company which did not respond.

4 Ok Cupid’s chief marketing officer Melissa Hobley said “many” have contacted the company to praise the ad campaign. OKCupid/Instagram

“Insane to me that okcupid a dating app company has put up a bunch of ads in the nyc subway that seem like they’re marketed at 5 year olds” another said.

A rep for the MTA Eugene Resnick told The Post: “The MTA is subject to the First Amendment which limits the restrictions that may be placed on which ads to accept. There is a review process for subway advertisements the OK Cupid ads went through that process and were determined not to violate MTA guidelines.”

However the supposedly content-neutral agency has in the past rejected pro-life spots.

4 The ads were approved by the MTA before appearing on subways a rep said. OKCupid/Instagram

With regard to the vandalism video Resnick said: “Customers are free to express their disdain with subway advertisements but they are not permitted to destroy them. Riders who violate that basic principle are subject to prosecution.”

The agency refused to say how much it made from the ad campaign.

Ok Cupid’s chief marketing officer Melissa Hobley said “many” have contacted the company to praise the ad campaign. “A much smaller few have had shockingly vitriolic reactions to it; but these reactions only serve to make it even more clear that we must continue to champion people who are historically underrepresented. Whether you’re a non-binary person an environmentalist a vaccine advocate or all of the above you deserve to find what you’re looking for on OkCupid” she said.

4 The ads have been slammed online by some people. OKCupid/Instagram

Past ad spots for the data-hoovering company have included posters saying: “IT’S OK TO CHOOSE MR. RIGHT BASED ON HOW FAR LEFT HE LEANS” and “IT’S OK TO CHOOSE TO ONLY DATE SOMEONE WHO’S PRO CHOICE.”

The promiscuity-promoting app also recently turned out a pro-choice “profile badge.”

After Texas’s “heartbeat bill” went into effect early this month Ok Cupid’s parent company Match Group — which also owns Tinder — said it would pay for Texas-based employees to get out-of-state abortions according to Bloomberg.

CEO Shar Dubey told employees then that the company generally avoids political stands “unless it is relevant to our business.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL2dvbGYvbmV3cy8yMDIxLXJ5ZGVyLWN1cC1yZXN1bHRzLXNheS1oZWxsby10by10aGUtdS1zLWdvbGYtZHJlYW0tdGVhbS13aGljaC1haW1zLXRvLWRvbWluYXRlLWZvci15ZWFycy10by1jb21lL9IBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL2dvbGYvbmV3cy8yMDIxLXJ5ZGVyLWN1cC1yZXN1bHRzLXNheS1oZWxsby10by10aGUtdS1zLWdvbGYtZHJlYW0tdGVhbS13aGljaC1haW1zLXRvLWRvbWluYXRlLWZvci15ZWFycy10by1jb21lL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Ryder Cup results: Say hello to the U.S. golf dream team which aims to dominate for years to come,"SHEBOYGAN Wis. -- When did the Ryder Cup end? Ask 20 people and get 20 different answers to that question. The United States routed Europe 19-9 at Whistling Straits on Sunday in the 43rd playing of this event. Patrick Cantlay said after his singles match that he woke up and told the team he wanted to get to 20 points. The Americans fell short but they still won by the biggest margin since in this event's modern era since 1979.

Sunday's finish seemed inevitable all day so when did it end for you?

Perhaps it was as early as Friday afternoon when the United States took a 6-2 lead after Day 1. It certainly felt over then.

Perhaps Saturday morning when the U.S. tacked on three more points including one when Jordan Spieth raised his putter to the sky as an eagle dropped on the 16th hole that helped put away his Euro opponents.

It could have been when Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger chugged beers on the first tee before the fourth session or when Scottie Scheffler chest bumped Bryson DeChambeau late on Saturday en route to the Americans' 11th point of the week.

Maybe it was when DeChambeau got up and down from 354 yards at the first hole against Sergio Garcia on Sunday and beat Garcia's birdie with an eagle.

Maybe you're conservative and didn't believe it was truly over until Collin Morikawa hit an iron from 221 yards on the 17th to 3 feet to win that hole guarantee a half point against Viktor Hovland and return the trophy to the U.S.

Maybe you didn't think the Ryder Cup is over until Dustin Johnson popped the first champagne bottle which happened as quickly as humanly possible following the U.S. destruction.

Whatever the case wherever you land the second your Ryder Cup ended something new began for a much-critiqued oft-maligned U.S. side.

There has been a lot of angst (much of it from me!) over the last few decades about United States team golf specifically when it comes to the Ryder Cup. There have been teammates thrown under buses captains run over by players and ultimately a very c-suite-sounding task force founded to try and turn the tide on this biennial event.

It worked until it didn't when everything fell apart at the 2018 Ryder Cup in Paris. Even coming into this week there were myriad questions about Brooks Koepka's buy-in DeChambeau's focus whether those two could be in the same team room and whether captain Steve Stricker had lost control of the team room before anyone had ever congregated.

Seven days later Stricker was on a podium in the middle of a field next to Lake Michigan yelling into a microphone that this U.S. team was the best golf team of all time.

It's not a crazy sentiment.

Not all dream teams end like this though. The Patriots lost to the Giants in the Super Bowl. The Cavs beat the Warriors in the NBA Finals. The Braves took several years to win a World Series. Sometimes operating from out in front when it comes to talent is extraordinarily difficult but this U.S. team made it look simple.

There are four primary reasons this U.S. team both became the best golf team ever and transformed expectations at future Ryder Cups.

A captain they trusted

In the post-event press conference Stricker was asked if he would be interested in being the captain in Rome in 2023. He deferred but every player on the team hooted hollered or nodded that they wanted to play for him again.

""100%"" said Dustin Johnson who became the first top-ranked American and just the fifth player all time with a perfect 5-0-0 mark at the Ryder Cup.

""That's a yes from us"" added Spieth who along with D.J. and Koepka is the only U.S. player on this team to win multiple Ryder Cups.

They went out of their way to talk about how well Stricker managed both them and the entire week with an emphasis on the lack of extracurriculars throughout.

The U.S. team is not as impassioned by the history nor the hysteria surrounding this event as the Europeans. That stuff seems to really ignite the Euros and it seems to exhaust the Americans. So they didn't make any hype videos and didn't bring in any motivational speakers. It was a business trip.

""It felt like a player-friendly environment"" said Spieth. ""As Steve mentioned on stage there were no big speeches. It was 'Hey you guys took care of business today go get your rest take care of business tomorrow.' He knew this team was playing phenomenal golf coming into this event and put us in position to stay out of the way ... I don't want to take away from what the captains did. They did a lot of work setting this up ahead of time and then kind of taking the back seat and guys really took over. And we made a lot more putts than they did and there were a lot more roars.""

A lack of black holes

Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson are two of the 10 greatest golfers of all time and neither they nor you need me to list their credentials nor their bonafides when it comes to this sport. However having mega-personas like them is not always the best thing on a team of 12. They can become black holes likely unintentionally so in weeks like this. Guys worship them so it can be sometimes difficult to feel like equal parts of the same organization.

It's not coincidental that the first Ryder Cup in nearly three decades that neither played was the one that felt not just like a generational shift but also a complete transformation in the dynamic of the team. It felt as if all 12 players had equitable buy-in instead of it being disproportionately distributed.

(Not having Patrick Reed a different kind of black hole there was probably meaningful as well.)

It helps that nearly everyone on the team grew up together. That was a theme throughout the week. Spieth mentioned it and it engendered a sense of similar ownership in this week that is necessary for the trust you need in one another at the Ryder Cup.

""It's a different group of guys"" said Koepka after his singles match on Sunday. ""It's a lot more fun than in years past.""

Shortly after Koepka said this he was standing on the green with all the Americans who had already finished up their matches with just a handful left on the course. Drink in hand he turned toward the steep path leading up toward the clubhouse and hollered at his fiancee ""Jena! Jena hey we're going to watch Boog [Daniel Berger] if you want to come."" He and his teammates took off back up the 18th hole to see the end of Berger's match.

That's a small action and certainly not abnormal at team events like this but it somehow seemed more authentic than in the past. It especially carried weight because it came from one of the guys who seemed the least bought in coming to Whistling Straits.

A complete buy-in

This is linked to the above. This generation of players -- the U.S. had eight in their 20s and six in their first Ryder Cup -- has feelings about the Ryder Cup that may not have existed before. That sometimes results in shotgunning beers on the first tee before the event is over but there are some guys on this squad who seem to embrace this week differently than players have in the past.

""I think the most important thing for the U.S. team is a lot of young guys that are great players have bought into the Ryder Cup"" said Rory McIlroy who went 1-3-0 for the Europeans. ""I think that was probably missing in previous generations. But guys like Justin Thomas Jordan Spieth you know the sort of heartbeat of that U.S. team they really bought into the team aspect of Ryder Cups Presidents Cups. And having guys like that on the team yeah they are going to be formidable opposition from now until I'm probably not playing Ryder Cups whenever that is in hopefully 20 years' time.""

A ton of overwhelming talent (with a plan)

There's a big difference between being the most talented team ever and the best team ever. We already knew this was the most talented team coming into the week playing on a golf course perfectly suited to its strengths. It became the best team because Stricker managed that talent perfectly. Everybody knew their partners. If they deviated from their original plan it was only minutely.

The Americans rode their best thoroughbred in D.J. to that record-setting 5-0-0 mark and everyone else played a role. Tony Finau and DeChambeau came off the bench to play four-ball in the afternoon. Spieth Thomas Cantlay Morikawa and Xander Schauffele all sat when necessary. Scheffler went out on Sunday and lit up the best player on the planet (and of the week) 4UP and never trailed a hole. The Americans were favored in 11 of the 12 singles matches.

They've had immense talent before just not this far down the roster.

This is the problem for the European side which got caught between generations this year. Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood combined to go 2-4-0 and their succession plan is unclear. The Americans? You just watched the succession plan.

The United States was up 11-5 on Saturday night and craved the record for the biggest blowout in modern history which it also got on Sunday.

Only four players on the U.S. side are older than 30 and Spieth made it clear that while this may have been the end of this particular Ryder Cup it's just the beginning of what the U.S. certainly hopes is a mirror of the great European generation they closed the curtain on this week.

""We needed to win this one and I think it was a massive stepping stone for this team"" said Spieth. ""The group that we have here that have really known each other since almost back to grade school to continue to try to work hard to be on these teams to go over there. It's one thing to win it over here and it is a lot easier to do so and it is harder to win over there. If we play like we did this week the score will look the same over there in a couple years and that's what we're here for.""

""This is a start to new generation"" added DeChambeau. ""I think we are going to be doing some incredible things moving forward.""

That plays well on Sunday evening after a historic Ryder Cup. It feels different on a Friday morning in Rome when it feels like half of Italy is chanting Rory's name and the fairway is skinnier than Chesson Hadley. Still there are reasons to believe.

It's foolish to declare the ushering in of a new era based on scores alone. The U.S. has won in routs on its own soil before and yet it has failed to back it up in Europe for the last three decades. However among this century's Ryder Cup wins for the U.S. this one felt extremely different.

Surely things did not go perfectly behind the scenes all week but this year's press conference felt less like a team of 12 individuals that was mashed together for the sake of this massive event that happens so infrequently and more like a group of 12 individuals that will remain a shadow team as they play on their own in the lead up to Rome.

Maybe that's because of the six rookies or the eight players in their 20s or no Tiger and Phil or Stricker's galvanization or Spieth and J.T.'s leadership or more buy-in or any number of other factors. Maybe it's a bit of everything. That will be tested though and it will be tested both next year at the Presidents Cup but even more so in two years at the Ryder Cup in Rome.

But it won't be tested simply based on whether they win for the first time on European soil since 1993 or lose another one to Rory Rahm and Co. No it will be tested in that team presser shortly after that competition.

Win or lose the Europeans have always been gracious emotional and wonderful in the wake of this event. They were again this year. They delight in victory and they shine maybe even brighter in defeat. They don't sell one another out or destroy their captain. Instead they talk about how this week is the greatest week.

""Like honestly to be able to share the team room with these boys to be able to play for [Padraig Harrington] it's just been so special"" said Shane Lowry this week. ""I said to the lads last night 'I'm having the time of my life and we're six points behind. What's it going to be like when we're leading?'""

That's the litmus test for a new American era.

A generational change means you get a war in Rome that might end in a U.S. victory but that definitely ends with a unified group. That's always been the point with these proud European teams. It's the part I'm not sure the Americans have ever fully understood. The Euros have been so good for so long not because they win every single time but because they maintain belief and trust even when they do not.

The U.S. seemed to capture that this week perhaps more than it ever has before. It is also combining that trust with a 1992 U.S. Olympic basketball team-level of talent.

The result is that they have a real team -- an all-time team -- now with the potential for true long-term stability.

That portends the big question as the champagne flows into Lake Michigan on a late September evening and Rome feels so close and so far at the same time: Will they keep it?

Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtbmV3cy8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM5MzYvc3RlZWxlcnMtc2lnbi1yb29raWVzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtY29udHJhY3QtdGVybXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers officially sign rookies Mason McCormick Logan Lee,"The Pittsburgh Steelers officially signed two members of their 2024 NFL Draft class Friday including fourth-round guard Mason McCormick and sixth-round DL Logan Lee. The news comes on the same day of the start of rookie minicamp taking place between Friday May 10 and Sunday May 12. Financial terms of their contracts were not disclosed.

McCormick in particular could be in a position to earn some significant playing time in the 2024 season with several question marks remaining regarding the current configuration of players on the offensive line. Should McCormick have a successful offseason he could be in the mix to compete with starting right guard James Daniels. Daniels is in the final year of his contract with the Steelers with a 2024 cap hit of just under $11.2 million. By trading or releasing Daniels the Steelers can save $8.25 million against the salary cap in 2024.

Related Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024

Though McCormick might afford the Steelers the flexibility to make that decision on the roster It would still be a surprise to see them do so especially given the fact that they’ve got two other rookies presumably starting on the offensive line this year including OT Troy Fautanu and C Zach Frazier.

The Steelers have 43 players on their 2024 Rookie Minicamp Roster with 12 of them being rookies in this class including five undrafted free agents who received contracts. That leaves five drafted rookies remaining with whom the team will need to finalize a deal ahead of training camp including first-round OT Troy Fautanu second-round center Zach Frazier third-rounders WR Roman Wilson and LB Payton Wilson as well as sixth-round DB Ryan Watts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9tYXNvbi1tY2Nvcm1pY2stcnVzc2VsbC13aWxzb24tY2FsbGVkLW1lLWFzLXNvb24tYXMtaS1nb3QtZHJhZnRlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mason McCormick: Russell Wilson Called Me 'As Soon As I Got Drafted',"To hammer home the point one more time Russell Wilson is embracing all of his new teammates especially the ones tasked with protecting the quarterback. As he did for Troy Fautanu and several other Pittsburgh Steelers newcomers Wilson made a quick phone call to fourth-round pick Mason McCormick welcoming him to the team.

“Russell Wilson Facetimed me as soon as I got drafted” McCormick said via Erie’s JET24 News. “That was pretty cool. A lot of the vets have reached out.”

Wilson did the same or at least attempted to with Troy Fautanu who missed his initial call on his flight to Pittsburgh. The two eventually got in touch. Wilson was clearly plugged into the Steelers’ selections even on the third day of the draft rookies that aren’t always expected to make an immediate impact. McCormick was the team’s fourth-round selection and third offensive lineman selected. Primarily a guard throughout his college career he’s tabbed to begin the year as a backup behind starters Isaac Seumalo James Daniels and veteran swingman Nate Herbig.

Still offensive line depth can quickly be tested in the league. All it would take is an interior injury or two to press Mason McCormick into action to protect someone like Wilson. While he has the challenge of coming from the FCS level McCormick’s size and elite experience of nearly 60 starts will help him make the transition to the NFL level.

With one of the youngest offenses in football last year the Steelers are looking for leadership. It’s one reason why they pursued Wilson in the offseason and why he’s the front-runner to start the year ahead of Justin Fields. At 35 years old with a Super Bowl ring Wilson is regarded as a hard-worker who wants to lead and rally the group.

Beyond leadership the unit needs to be more productive an offense that’s flailed and sputtered three seasons running. Talent and skill will be the main reasons why Pittsburgh succeeds or fails but having a tight-knit team where everyone is included from starting quarterback to fourth-round guard is often a hidden factor in how to maximize a group."

To advertise the creations of the latest successful candidates Helsinki animation and illustration studio Piñata showcased its design skills producing three beautiful animations. Using a combination of techniques the team wanted to see how far they could push mixing different styles.

""The film combines 2D animated effects 3D elements some compositing magic and particle simulation"" says Piñata animator Mikko Vormala. ""The challenge was to blend all techniques seamlessly together."" And in our opinion they've managed just that.

This fresh somewhat abstract approach is an unusual choice for McDonald's. But it's one that we'd definitely like to see much more of in the future. For more inspiration see our selection of the best animations from the past 20 years.

Crisp & Green



Entrepreneur Steele Smiley aims to build America's first plant-based burger chain Stalk & Spade.

Along with his other fast-casual restaurant Crisp & Green Smiley is tapping into a healthy eating market dominated by millennials and Gen Z.

He spoke with Insider about how the pandemic has shifted people's mindset toward wellness.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Steele Smiley will be the first to tell you he runs his life like he's in the military.

That involves 20 workouts a week three times a day: Running in the morning a yoga or boxing class during the day and lifting weights at night.

Since that doesn't seem to satisfy all his energy Smiley also juggles two Minnesota-based fast-casual restaurants. In 2016 he opened Stalk & Spade which serves up salads grain bowls smoothies and free workout classes. Five years later (in the midst of the pandemic) he launched Crisp & Green with a plant-based-only menu. He's expanded both brands in the south and Midwest bucking conventional health hubs like LA and NYC in favor of an edge in less competitive markets.

""We intend to become the first franchisable plant-based burger chain in the country"" Smiley told Insider billing it as the plant-based version of McDonald's.

It's a bold statement but the 43-year-old serial entrepreneur has 20 years in the fitness industry under his belt. While he declined to share revenue numbers analytics verified by Insider showed that Crisp & Green digital orders increased from 9% of its total orders in January 2020 to more than 70% in April when the pandemic hit where they've stayed ever since.

Stalk & Spade launched in May.

Stalk & Spade



In 2021 alone Crisp & Green expanded from five states to 12 with several locations in the Sun Belt an area seeing explosive growth before and during the pandemic. Smiley said the chain is nearing 100 stores in 14 states with new locations opening every 6.8 days.

Overall however the restaurant scene has been struggling. Last August before widespread vaccination the fast casual space was down 12% according to figures from foodservice data platform Technomic. While consumer spending in restaurants rose this year compared to last recovery hasn't yet snapped back to pre-pandemic traffic levels. Restaurants are still contending with issues like labor shortages and shorter hours.

Still the wellness economy is worth $1.5 trillion according to McKinsey and Smiley is betting he can tap into that especially since the pandemic has prompted many people to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Plant-based diets which nearly 10 million Americans follow are gaining traction. The market is growing expected to exceed $74 billion by 2021.

""The next evolution of healthy eating is plant-based eating"" Smiley said. ""Within a decade people will choose the plant-based alternatives of the traditional meat they eat today.""

Move over Sweetgreen

Smiley had just $765 in his bank account when he kicked off his career in 2004 with his boutique studio STEELE Fitness. In 2013 he had just landed a major partnership with Under Armour when he sold his business to international wellness company Lift Brands Global. He joined the parent company as a senior executive.

He launched Crisp & Green in November 2016 which he juggled while working for Lift Brands for five months before going full-time. ""I would work during the day at my first big business and at night I would put on a Crisp & Green t-shirt and work at my restaurant"" Smiley said.

Smiley said he'd always wanted to launch multiple businesses in multiple industries. Evolving his career from fitness to healthy eating was only a natural next step.







""The opportunity that I felt was staring me in the face was food"" he said. ""In fitness I taught people that the hour you work out can only be so impactful. The other 23 hours of a day you can help people understand how to make the right food choices.""

Crisp & Green offers free fitness classes in addition to its salad and smoothie menu.

Crisp & Green



Those who perhaps best understood this pre-pandemic were young healthy women whom Steele would often see walking through Crisp & Green's doors.

His brands certainly have Gen Z and millennial written all over them. The two generations helped grow the global healthy eating and nutrition economy to $704 billion and are leading the way in plant-based eating. Millennials dubbed ""the wellness generation"" are especially more health-conscious and more willing to spend on healthy food and fitness than their parents.

For them investing in green juices and $30 spin classes is a discreet status symbol a way to convey they care about their health and have the money to do it properly.

Smiley made sure Crisp & Green checked all the boxes for this demographic: healthy digitally accessible deliverable and Instagrammable. ""It made people say I want to live a more aspirational life"" he said.

A post shared by C&G • Healthy & Scratch-Made! (@crispandgreen)

It's this combination that Smiley believes enabled the restaurant to gain steam during the pandemic which in turn led to his confidence in launching another venture.

""I figured why stop with just one that was working?"" he said. And so Stalk & Spade was born.

The plant-based way of the future

After his pandemic success Smiley said he saw an opportunity to prepare for a post-vaccine economic reopening by giving Americans what he thought they'd need after a health-related recession and a social recession: healthier food and an opportunity to get out of the house.

But he recognized that bringing yet another concept into the increasingly saturated wellness sector – especially during a pandemic that saw a declining footprint in the fast casual industry – meant that he'd be facing a tough road. He knew he needed to look toward the future – and what he saw were plants.

A post shared by STALK & SPADE (@stalkandspade)

He said he and his team worked on building Stalk & Spade's plant-based menu from scratch until taste testers couldn't discern the difference between a real burger and a plant-based one.

The pandemic pushed healthy eating 10 years into the future he said. It dramatically expanded his demographic from mostly young adults to nearly everyone.

When asked who his clientele is now Smiley said with a laugh ""humans."" After all ""everyone wants to live a better life.""

Nutrition has taken on new importance per a McKinsey survey as people now want food that will help them accomplish wellness goals while tasting good. Millennials and Gen Z are even more willing to invest in health and wellness post-pandemic with 60% believing that taking care of one's health will be the pandemic's most important societal change.

With a modern minimalist design even Stalk & Spade's interior is Instagrammable.

Stalk & Spade



The mental shift has sparked the rise of a high-performance lifestyle in which people are increasingly letting wearables and apps track their health and make lifestyle choices for them. That includes Smiley himself who monitors his sleep with wearables. The healthier life people are now turning to is the life Smiley has been living this whole time which could prove to be the key to growing his brands.

By the end of the year he said Crisp & Green will have 25 locations with another 60 in the pipeline. Stalk & Spade is set to open up its second Minnesota location in early 2022.

Smiley believes the time is now for plant-based eating to go from a niche audience to a more mainstream one. ""We fed into the trends of healthy eating"" he said of the plant-based market. ""It's an opportunity for an entire new genre to start.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHlpbnRlcmxha2UuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9zZXAvMjYvZ2xhY2llci1jb25zZXJ2YW5jeS1mdW5kcmFpc2luZy1wcm9qZWN0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Studying Lake McDonald water quality among group's 2022 projects,"After collecting samples of crystal-clear water from Lake McDonald in 2018 researchers made a concerning observation: Nitrogen levels measured in the water were up to three times higher and phosphorus levels were up to 12 times higher than in samples taken from the lake three decades earlier. Algae particles also were found at higher concentrations.

The findings suggest Glacier National Park's most iconic lake is experiencing ""early signs of eutrophication"" the researchers wrote in 2018. That's the phenomenon in which bodies of water become excessively rich in nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen which can result in abundant and even toxic algae blooms and deplete oxygen that fish need to survive.

Lake McDonald remains one of the clearest lakes on the continent but unlike nearby Flathead Lake its water chemistry isn't routinely sampled and tested. Researchers have only two snapshots in time to compare — one study conducted from 1986 to 1990 and the other conducted in 2018 — so the cause of the lake's rising nutrients levels is difficult to parse. It could be any combination of runoff from aging septic tanks increased recreational use by park visitors and the burning of huge amounts of biomass in recent wildfires.

The researchers in 2018 recommended ""implementation of rigorous standardized monitoring"" of Lake McDonald ""so that data-driven adaptive management can occur to preserve its still-pristine status.""

NOW THE Glacier National Park Conservancy the park's official fundraising partner is seeking donations to support further research into Lake McDonald's water quality — one of 25 projects on the nonprofit's priority list for 2022.

The research which has an estimated $40000 price tag will be conducted over two years by Jim Elser director of the Flathead Lake Biological Station along with doctoral student Brooke Bannerman and Glacier's Aquatic Programs Manager Chris Downs.

They won't just collect and analyze water samples to compare with the earlier data. They also will collect meter-long core samples from the bottom of Lake McDonald in order to analyze a century's worth of sediment layers and dead plankton search for any signs of long-term changes in the lake's chemistry and help close the gap in historical information between the two previous studies.

Downs said Lake McDonald is still considered ""super-oligotrophic"" meaning it has very little biological productivity and that's what keeps the water so beautifully clear. But a sustained increase in phosphorus could change that by feeding more algae and plankton.

""We are going to work together to evaluate and do a nutrient budget for the lake but also to evaluate what has gone on in terms of change"" he said. ""Is it just a short-term potential blip as a result of fires? Or is it some sort of long-term buildup of phosphorus in Lake McDonald and perhaps other park lakes and other lakes in Northwest Montana?""

IN COMPARISON to Flathead Lake where samples have been collected 10 to 12 times per year since the late 1970s Elser said existing scientific data on all the lakes in Glacier National Park is ""pretty cursory.""

That's troubling not only in terms of ecological impact but also because the lakes are a huge part of the park's appeal and wonder.

""Lake McDonald of course is a treasure. It's possibly one of the most photographed lakes in the world"" Elser said noting countless visitors have photographed the multicolored rocks that line its shores looking like jelly beans under its glassy surface.

""That's an Instagram favorite right? And that picture would not be the same if that lake was turbid and cloudy"" he said. ""And one way you get cloudy conditions is with increased abundance of algae and phytoplankton in the water column.""

Doug Mitchell executive director of the Glacier National Park Conservancy said the nonprofit relies on donations big and small to support projects that help protect the park and improve the visitor experience.

""We've been able to provide the park with an average of $2 million a year in support for park projects"" Mitchell said. ""That just flat-out would not happen without private support.""

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnZlc3RvcnMtaGVhdmlseS1zZWFyY2gtbWVyY2stY28tMTMwMDE2MjkzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investors Heavily Search Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK): Here is What You Need to Know,"Merck (MRK) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +2.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry to which Merck belongs has gained 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

Merck is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share for the current quarter representing a year-over-year change of +202.9%. Over the last 30 days the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8.3%.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $8.66 points to a change of +473.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.3%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $9.91 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.7%.

With an impressive externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

For Merck the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.8%. For the current and next fiscal years $64.28 billion and $68.81 billion estimates indicate +6.9% and +7.1% changes respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Merck reported revenues of $15.78 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +8.9%. EPS of $2.07 for the same period compares with $1.40 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.32 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.95%. The EPS surprise was +6.7%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples such as price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on) is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

Merck is graded C on this front indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

London: Merck said on Thursday its therapy did not meet the main goal of disease-free survival in certain patients with endometrial cancer during a late-stage trial The drugmaker's Keytruda therapy in combination with chemotherapy was being evaluated in patients with high-risk endometrial cancer after surgery.The study's other main goal of overall survival was not formally tested since the trial failed in showing significant disease-free survival.Endometrial cancer begins in the inner lining of the uterus or endometrium and is the most common type of the disease affecting the organ.(Reporting by Christy Santhosh in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Shilpi Majumdar)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."

We added annotations to each slide that give more context because this type of research is designed to inform internal conversations and the documents were created for and used by people who understood the limitations of the research. Now we’re publicly releasing these two research decks with annotations.

Instagram Teen Annotated Research Deck 1

Instagram Teen Annotated Research Deck 2

Originally published on September 26 2021 at 4:00PM PT:

Contrary to The Wall Street Journal’s characterization Instagram’s research shows that on 11 of 12 well-being issues teenage girls who said they struggled with those difficult issues also said that Instagram made them better rather than worse.

This research like external research on these issues found teens report having both positive and negative experiences with social media.

We do internal research to find out how we can best improve the experience for teens and our research has informed product changes as well as new resources.

In advance of Facebook’s Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis appearing before a Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Thursday we want to be clear about what the research recently characterized by The Wall Street Journal shows and what it does not show.

It is simply not accurate that this research demonstrates Instagram is “toxic” for teen girls. The research actually demonstrated that many teens we heard from feel that using Instagram helps them when they are struggling with the kinds of hard moments and issues teenagers have always faced. In fact in 11 of 12 areas on the slide referenced by the Journal — including serious areas like loneliness anxiety sadness and eating issues — more teenage girls who said they struggled with that issue also said that Instagram made those difficult times better rather than worse. Body image was the only area where teen girls who reported struggling with the issue said Instagram made it worse as compared to the other 11 areas. But here also the majority of teenage girls who experienced body image issues still reported Instagram either made it better or had no impact. We go into more details below on how the research actually lines up with what The Wall Street Journal claimed.

In addition to putting specific findings in context it is also critical to make the nature of this research clear. This research some of which relied on input from only 40 teens was designed to inform internal conversations about teens’ most negative perceptions of Instagram. It did not measure causal relationships between Instagram and real-world issues. These documents were also created for and used by people who understood the limitations of the research which is why they occasionally used shorthand language particularly in the headlines and do not explain the caveats on every slide.

Studying these big societal issues and what impacts them is nuanced and complex. The Journal article implied that we were hiding this research and that the results are surprising but that is simply not accurate. Not only have we talked about the strengths and weaknesses of social media and well-being publicly for more than a decade external researchers have too. For example a survey and interviews from Harvard found that teens viewed social media “predominantly” positively though they reported both positive and negative impacts on their relationships and self-expression. And a Pew Internet survey reported the majority of teens credit social media for positive outcomes like 81% said it helps them connect while some also pointed to its negative impacts like 43% said they felt pressure to post things that make them “look good.”

Our internal research is part of our effort to minimize the bad on our platforms and maximize the good. We invest in this research to proactively identify where we can improve — which is why the worst possible results are highlighted in the internal slides. That’s why the most important thing about this research is what we’ve done with it. We have a long track record of using our research — as well as external research and close collaboration with our Safety Advisory Board Youth Advisors and additional experts and organizations — to inform changes to our apps and provide resources for the people who use them. For example on Instagram:

Below we contrast what The Wall Street Journal said versus what the research showed:

WSJ said: “Repeatedly the company’s researchers found that Instagram is harmful for a sizable percentage of them [young users] most notably teenage girls. ‘We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls’ said one slide from 2019 summarizing research about teen girls who experience the issues.”

What the data shows: The slide in question which The Wall Street Journal did not publish as part of their report and we’re releasing below shows that Instagram helps many teens who are struggling with some of the hardest issues they experience. On 11 of the 12 issues in the slide referenced by the Journal such as eating issues loneliness anxiety and sadness teenage girls who said they experienced these challenges were more likely to say that Instagram made these issues better vs. worse.¹ The one exception was body image. While the headline in the internal slide does not explicitly state it the research shows one in three of those teenage girls who told us they were experiencing body image issues reported that using Instagram made them feel worse — not one in three of all teenage girls. This is an important difference that is not explicit in the Journal’s reporting. And among those same girls who said they were struggling with body image issues 22% said that using Instagram made them feel better about their body image issues and 45.5% said that Instagram didn’t make it either better or worse (no impact).

WSJ said: “Teen boys aren’t immune. In the deep dive Facebook’s researchers conducted into mental health in 2019 they found that 14% of boys in the US said Instagram made them feel worse about themselves. In their report on body image in 2020 Facebook’s researchers found that 40% of teen boys experience negative social comparison.”

What the data shows: What the study also said was that 50% of US and 36% of UK teenage boys (who use Instagram and filled out a survey) say they feel better about themselves after using Instagram including 18% of US teenage boys saying they felt “much better.” In fact on 12 out of the 12 issues in the slide referenced above — such as eating issues loneliness anxiety and sadness — teenage boys who said they experienced some of these challenges were more likely to say that Instagram made these issues better vs. worse.

WSJ said: “‘Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression’ said another slide. ‘This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.'”

What the data shows: This finding comes from a set of focus groups of a small sample of 40 teenage Instagram users in the US and UK who struggle with body image self-esteem negative mood and/or other issues. What the Journal left out was another key finding from the same study: that the same teenage users say the overall effects of Instagram are positive for them. Additionally based on the research the Journal left out 8 out of 10 US teens who use Instagram and filled out a survey said Instagram either made them feel better about themselves or had no effect on how they feel about themselves. Here are some other important details from the slide above:

Among those teenage girls who said they had felt sadness in the past month 57% said Instagram made things better and 34% said Instagram had no impact. 9% said Instagram made it worse.

Among those teenage girls who said they had experienced loneliness in the past month 51% said Instagram made things better and 36% said Instagram had no impact. 13% said Instagram made it worse.

Again among those teenage girls who said they had experienced anxiety in the past month the numbers are similar: 40% said Instagram made things better and 48% said it made no difference. 12% said Instagram made things worse.

WSJ said: “Among teens who reported suicidal thoughts 13% of British users and 6% of American users traced the desire to kill themselves to Instagram one presentation showed.”

What the data shows: When we take a step back and look at the full data set about 1% of the entire group of teens who took the survey said they had suicidal thoughts that they felt started on Instagram.² Of course even one person who feels this started on Instagram is one too many. That is why we have invested so heavily in support resources and interventions for people using our services. In addition some of the same research cited by the Journal in the slide above shows that 38% of teenage girls who said they struggled with suicidal thoughts and self harm said Instagram made these issues better for them and 49% said it has no impact.

WSJ said: “But a mounting body of Facebook’s own evidence shows Instagram can be damaging for many. In one study of teens in the US and UK Facebook found that more than 40% of Instagram users who reported feeling ‘unattractive’ said the feeling began on the app. About a quarter of the teens who reported feeling ‘not good enough’ said the feeling started on Instagram. Many also said the app undermined their confidence in the strength of their friendships.”

What the data shows: One of the studies cited by the Journal highlights that teens using Instagram in the US and UK are roughly 3 times more likely to say that Instagram makes them feel better about their life rather than worse about it.³ But that’s exactly why we’ve invested in this research — and because we’ve made these investments we’ve been able to set up a specific effort to work on these issues to minimize the bad and maximize the good. Suggesting that Instagram is toxic for teens is simply not backed up by the facts.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjEvc2VwLzI2L2lzLWZhY2Vib29rLWxlYWRpbmctdXMtb24tYS1qb3VybmV5LXRvLXRoZS1tZXRhdmVyc2XSAWdodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS8yMDIxL3NlcC8yNi9pcy1mYWNlYm9vay1sZWFkaW5nLXVzLW9uLWEtam91cm5leS10by10aGUtbWV0YXZlcnNl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Facebook leading us on a journey to the metaverse?,"The concept of the “metaverse” first came from the 1992 sci-fi novel Snow Crash as a place that people flee to escape a dangerous corporation-dominated world. It has since come to refer to a range of virtual experiences that have gained popularity during the pandemic – including video games such as Fortnite non-fungible tokens or even online meetings and events.

But in recent weeks the term has gained new traction – and concern over its potential ethical and societal implications – after Mark Zuckerberg said that in five years Facebook would be a “metaverse company” and declared it the “successor to the mobile internet”.

Sharing his vision of what it might look like the founder and controlling shareholder of the $1tn (£750bn) company described an online world where people wearing VR headsets – Facebook also owns Oculus the virtual-reality platform – would not just view content but be inside it. It would be an online space built by companies creators and developers in which people could also live their lives – virtually going to performances and even work.

In Washington Facebook’s political push to promote the metaverse is reportedly already in full flow. Sheryl Sandberg Facebook’s chief operating officer and Nick Clegg its vice-president for global affairs and communications are leading the lobbying campaign. On Monday Clegg is set to lay out the company’s plans for how the metaverse could reshape society in a talk entitled Journey to the Metaverse.

According to the Washington Post the company is in conversation with thinktanks about metaverse standards and protocols – a move that some observers say allows the company to shift discussion away from issues such as the antitrust lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission last year.

But experts fear that with regulation still struggling to catch up with the impact of the first wave of social media the metaverse is likely to be a way for companies like Facebook to capture and profit from even more data. They also warn that more foresight and government protections are needed to counter the risk of the space and people’s lives being overrun by big tech.

“I know it’s not necessarily a popular view but I do think that the harms that we see after the fact for children especially but also for adults are sufficiently worrying that it would be more sensible to work to put in place governance arrangements – checks on transparency on data protection etc and harms especially to children – before these companies are permitted to come forth” said Robin Mansell professor of new media and the internet at the London School of Economics.

While to most people the metaverse is an abstract term internet giants are already investing much hope – and money – in it. Facebook recently launched a virtual-reality meeting service Horizon Workrooms where people gather remotely wearing headsets and meet as if they were physically there in an online virtual meeting space.

It has also launched Ray-Ban Stories its first “smart glasses” featuring two cameras a microphone speaker and voice assistant. Meanwhile Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella has said the company is heavily investing in the “enterprise metaverse”.

I don’t think people are scared of the metaverse I think people are scared of the Zuckerverse. Prof Scott Galloway NYU Stern School of Business

Mansell said the social-political issues associated with the metaverse will be identical to those on existing social-media platforms such as Facebook – including data surveillance regulation and representation of gender race and ethnicity. But in the immersive world of the metaverse they will be on a far larger scale. She believes tech giants should be forced to wait before launch until there is “clarity about how they’re going to be governed”.

“For me it seems like it is simply another step in the monetisation of data to the benefit of Facebook and other large platforms sold to people as fun exciting helpful for productivity at work and so on” she said.

Scott Galloway professor of marketing at NYU Stern School of Business in New York said Zuckerberg is at the heart of why the metaverse is attracting attention. “The notion that he’s decided that the only way to increase our attention is to become the universe is one of those problems when you sit back and ponder on it too long it feels like it could go nowhere good.”

He added: “I don’t think people are scared of the metaverse they’re scared of the Zuckerverse. And that is what he has accomplished in social media. There are more people who get their information from Facebook than people in the southern hemisphere plus India.”

Dr David Leslie ethics theme lead at the Alan Turing Institute in London said the metaverse would offer an “escape hatch” out of dealing with society’s biggest problems.

The concept he said poses ethical questions around everything from who builds and controls it the risk of losing “the safe space of private life” and an unrepresentative virtual population. “There is a risk that in terms of a socioeconomic gender ethnic makeup the populace of the metaverse may be imbalanced. We don’t live in a time where there’s equitable access to the sorts of infrastructure that one would need to engage in these technologies.”

Dr Brent Mittelstadt senior research fellow in data ethics at the Oxford Internet Institute said the potential social impact of the metaverse is far from certain. “If it were as disruptive as say people going on virtual dates rather than meeting up to be able to say what effect that would have on the nature of relationships would be very difficult in the same way that predicting the impact social media would have had when it was just being talked about as an idea.”

But he said if Facebook manages to get you to spend lots of time there it is accomplishing its goal of collecting more data and monetising it. “Suddenly you have more data sources than currently exist being combined and funnelled through this one thing – the metaverse. And if Facebook gets its way then you’d obviously be spending a significant chunk of your time on there.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0b29uaXN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5L21hcmtldGluZy1pbi10aGUtbWV0YXZlcnNlLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,marketing in the metaverse,"Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)

Lindsey McInerney at Anheuser-Busch InBev recently gave voice to the enthusiasm many marketers are feeling for the potential of the metaverse. She said:

“It’s a really exciting time to be a marketer in this space. I believe the shift we’re seeing to the metaverse is going to be one of the largest shifts we’ve seen in a long time … we are where we were in social media 17 18 years ago…

“Marketers like to be where people are …. Where there is set to be new traffic is certainly a place that marketers need to be paying attention to.”

First introduced in a 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash author Neal Stephenson imagined the metaverse as a future iteration of the internet where humans as avatars would interact with each other in 3D virtual spaces as a metaphor of the real world.

Social gaming platforms like Roblox Fortnite Animal Crossing Minecraft and Second Life are starting to show some of this potential at scale particularly for younger generations. Mark Zuckerberg recently framed Facebook’s future strategy as helping “bring the metaverse to life.”

And as Lindsey put it “marketers like to be where people are.” Done well this is a chance for brands to experiment with entirely new ways to add value to consumers. Done poorly it could echo Gary Vaynerchuk’s famous observation that “marketers ruin everything.”

Early branded virtual experiences with branded virtual collectibles like Van’s World or Gucci Garden generated a lot of interest. But marketers often go into new experiences with brand myopia over-inflating how much people actually want to engage with their brands.

Nick Pringle at R/GA London shared this perspective:

“The successful brands will be the ones that don’t simply replicate their current products and services in the metaverse but instead think more creatively about what they can offer…

“For example a brand making energy drinks in the real world could manifest as a supplier of rocket packs in the metaverse. Or an IRL automaker could provide teleports in the virtual world. This may seem fanciful but consider that the next generation could well discover your brand in virtual space first — so how do you want to be perceived and what positive values can be transferred to the real world?”

The lords of Silicon Valley are all done with earthly reality but as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos arrange plans to physically leave Zuckerberg wants to program a better earthly experience — one curated by Facebook. In July Zuckerberg announced that Facebook is in the process of transitioning into a “Metaverse” company over the next half decade. The social media giant wants to morph into an all-consuming all-encompassing platform with relationships work commerce and entertainment commingling under one big tent. If that’s vague it’s because the Metaverse is an octopus with a nearly infinite number of arms and no single blueprint which is why many are calling it the Web 3.0. It’s “the successor to the mobile internet” Zuckerberg told the Verge last month. “You can think about the Metaverse as an embodied internet where instead of just viewing content — you are in it.” As part of his initial Metaverse media blitz the Great Hoodied One appeared on CBS News last month to play show-and-tell with Horizon Workrooms and demonstrate what being “inside the internet” actually means. Workrooms Facebook’s attempt at trumping Zoom is an immersive conference call program where coworkers don an Oculus VR helmet and share a virtual office space to say scribble notes on a digital whiteboard using hand gestures while their avatars mimic their own movements. The demo looks laughably underwhelming (the cartoonish avatars look like what would happen if Nintendo made an app called Wii Work) but it’s easy to see why management might flock to a gentle brightly colored panoptic workplace where it’s impossible to escape the gaze of your boss even in your own bedroom. According to Zuckerberg Horizon Workrooms is just a taste of what’s to come. “Five years from now people will be able to live where they want and work from wherever they want but feel present when they do it” he said. If the Metaverse idea expands beyond the goofy CGI-driven trickery seen through the goggles of an Oculus helmet the idea of “being present” may change altogether over the coming years (though Zuckerberg’s half-decade timeline seems optimistic). Many of the Metaverse’s architects envision a future in which physical augmented and virtual realities converge into a single enhanced reality governed by a shared economic and media consumption system. Venture capitalist Matthew Ball outlined the Metaverse concept in an influential essay last January. The Metaverse “would revolutionize not just the infrastructure layer of the digital world but also much of the physical one as well as all the services and platforms atop them how they work and what they sell” he wrote. In other words the Metaverse would create a whole new ownership realm of consumer goods. Imagine for instance that you buy a Rick and Morty–themed skin for your digital avatar in the video game Fortnite. That’s currently possible but only by purchasing 1500 of Fortnite’s in-game currency V-Bucks. Suiting up as Rick Sanchez only works in the popular battle royale shooter. A Metaverse infrastructure would theoretically enable you to transfer the digital outfit to wear it at an online Lady Gaga concert (planned for Fortnite next year) or during a group Peloton workout with friends. If the Metaverse sounds like something ripped from the pages of a science-fiction novel that’s because it was. Let’s say you took the prank too far and the boss is annoyed that you show up to a real-life meeting as the cartoon scientist which everyone sees through their Ray-Ban smart glasses. You then sheepishly decide to trade the costume for currency in the form of a “Cool Cats” non-fungible token (NFT) and a handful of Dogecoin. Or perhaps the opposite happens and you come to love it so much that you want to not only keep the Rick skin forever but put it in your will and pass it on to your kids when you die. All of this and more would be possible in the Metaverse. If this vision sounds like something ripped from the pages of a science-fiction novel that’s because it was.

The Gargoylification of Society The term Metaverse first appears in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 novel Snow Crash which follows the futuristic adventures of Hiro a pizza delivery driver for the Mafia who moonlights as a hacker immersed in what’s described as “a computer-generated universe that his computer is drawing onto his goggles and pumping into his earphones.” The book has long been a Bible for the priests of high tech. Stephenson is revered as a prophet credited for inventing the concepts of avatars and cryptocurrency in addition to the Metaverse. Snow Crash was once required reading for Facebook’s management team. Stephenson was befriended by Bezos and hired by the augmented reality company Magic Leap in 2014 to help actually build the Metaverse. Apparently no one in Silicon Valley has a sense of irony. Snow Crash is a dystopian novel not a utopian one. The digital realms of Snow Crash’s Metaverse are even more insidious than the playground-like purgatories it helped inspire in pop culture offerings like the Matrix movies or the novel Ready Player One. Swallowing the red pill in The Matrix means piercing the veil of illusion and experiencing an authentic world. Likewise Ready Player One’s OASIS is akin to being plugged into the world’s most advanced PlayStation one which you can easily leave. Some users log in and out of terminals in Snow Crash but “gargoyles” a class of characters who wear reality-enhancing devices at all times never truly do. For gargoyles who inhabit the Metaverse at all times there is no “logging on” and “logging off.” Stephenson writes: Gargoyles are no fun to talk to. They never finish a sentence. They are adrift in a laser-drawn world scanning retinas in all directions doing background checks on everyone within a thousand yards seeing everything in visual light infrared millimeter-wave radar and ultrasound all at once. By making real designs to usher in the Metaverse Silicon Valley is trying to turn us all into gargoyles. French philosopher Jean Baudrillard had a word for this condition: hyperreality where reality and simulation are so seamlessly blended together that there’s no clear distinction between worlds. Ultimately he speculated the difference wouldn’t matter because people would derive more meaning and value from the simulated world anyway. For gargoyles who inhabit the Metaverse at all times there is no ‘logging on’ and ‘logging off.’ If the Metaverse can’t be separated from real life then the Metaverse is real life to the point where the term “Metaverse” itself eventually fades away and the constructed reality is rendered invisible. Consider how capitalism became something like the West’s version of Windows an operating system quietly running in the background in the neoliberal era. The End of Reality could become the new End of History. Can you imagine the power of those pulling the strings of this new reality? Zuckerberg can.

Ready World One Some regard the Metaverse as nothing but vaporware. After Zuckerberg’s announcement several critics including on the Left have dismissed it as “digital hokum” or a boondoggle “for babies” as Gawker sneered. A generation ago many boomers and young Gen Xers shrugged off news about the coming of the original internet or laughed at the idea that it would change society forever. I know this personally because in the winter of 1994 I wrote a feature for my high school newspaper with the headline “What Is the Internet?” and it earned a lot of confused looks. But then a funny thing happened: The nerds won and the internet actually did change everything. The evidence that Web 3.0 is on its way is everywhere. Over the last two decades we’ve increasingly abandoned shared physical and public spaces — what Baudrillard called the “desert of the real” — for the ecstasies of hyperreality and experiences mediated through screens. Ever wonder why we need the word “lived” as a modifier placed before “experience” now? When Vanity Fair asked Stephenson about his novels predicting the current age he said “The practice of going around hunched over a rectangle in your hand is completely normal now and when I see somebody in a car or walking down the street hundreds of feet away I can tell that they’re texting just by their posture.” COVID-19 pandemic policies like quarantine and social distancing have shifted the move to a digital-first society into hyperdrive. During lockdown average digital device usage increased by five hours a day with heavy users glued to their devices for about 17.5 hours a day. Zoom now has 300 million users compared to just 10 million in December 2019. Google Facebook Apple and Amazon — the Big Four of the information economy — are now “too big to fail” just as the nation’s top-tier banks and manufacturers were in the late aughts. Ever wonder why we need the word ‘lived’ as a modifier placed before ‘experience’ now? Even many protest groups like QAnon the boogaloo bois and antifa have a hyperreal quality as if they emerged from the fringe corners of the internet and onto the streets like costumed online avatars come to life. The surge in popularity of Reddit-driven meme stocks cryptocurrency and NFTs hint that our economy is headed that way too with Elon Musk able to make or break fortunes with a single tweet. In a very real sense digital work play shopping socialization and politics are already replacing rather than supplementing their physical world equivalents. Video games already have a Metaverse-like quality. In 2020 rap star Travis Scott performed five virtual concerts in Fortnite which Epic Games claims were attended by 27.7 million players. Roughly 1.5 million people a day play Axie Infinity a game in which users fork over hundreds of real dollars to raise Pokémon-like creatures on their PCs in the hopes of breeding a rare type that can earn high amounts of crypto. A not-insignificant number of young people are dropping out of the formal economy to farm Axies all day. To phrase it in Twitter-speak: the gig economy is tired; the leisure economy is wired. Silicon Valley sees the foundation for the Metaverse already in place and perhaps with good reason. A change as fundamental as this “is always a multi-decade iterative process” Ball wrote “and yet despite that fact there is an unmistakable sense over the past few years that the foundational pieces are coming together in a way that feels very new and very different.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbjk4Lm5ldC93aGF0LWlzLW1ldGEtcG9vbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is Meta Pool (META)?

Eli Manning's No. 10 retired at MetLife Stadium,"The Giants retired the No. 10 jersey worn by two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning and added his name to the Ring of Honor at MetLife Stadium. Manning retired after the 2019 season.

He was walked to the stage by members of his offensive line. He finished his short speech by quoting the last Giants owner Wellington Mara who frequently said: “Once a Giant Always a Giant.”

Manning held a virtual conference call Thursday to discuss his career. During the meeting with the media Manning was relaxed smiled a lot and was open with his answers.

He said he had no regrets about retiring and no desire to ever come back. He made it clear that three straight losing seasons were a big part of the decision to retire.

“You know the losses just hurt more” the 40-year-old Manning said. “They affect your sleep. They affect your week. It affects family life with wife and kids. And it was just I just got too much.”

While Manning knew it was time to retire he had no plans. All he wanted to do was reflect on the good and happy moments the friendships he had made and big wins they celebrated.

“I wanted to take time away” Manning said. “Football takes up a lot of your time during the season during the offseason nights. So I wanted to take a year off and just be around family and see if there is anything else I wanted to pursue or wanted to be interested in and just kind of step away.”

The COVID-19 pandemic helped Manning maintain some solitude. After 12 months he realized he still loved the game but not as a player anymore. He liked prepping for games watching and analyzing film and talking about football. He admits he doesn’t know the name of every player on the field but he likes rewinding plays and explaining them to the audience.

“I don’t know how to read a spreadsheet” Manning said. “I don’t know everything going on in the world all over the place. But I know the game of football and I enjoy talking about it.”

It led to a gig with his brother Peyton on “Monday Night Football” which also allowed him to remain at home where he could be with his wife and family and coach his children’s sports teams.

One thing that did continue was his appearances on commercials for cars hot sauces and barbecues. Some are with family members and he really enjoys that.

“I think those are always kind of a way to not take yourself too seriously in a way to show your personality and that was how I did it while I was a player” Manning said of the commercials. “Now I think it’s another way to continue showing the lighter side of things.”

Manning added to post-career jobs this year by joining the Giants’ front office. His primary focus is marketing and business development. He is involved in community initiatives content creation and customer engagement. There were a lot of days at training camp he talked with select visitors at practices.

Manning started wearing the No. 10 at Mississippi. His father Archie had worn No. 18 at Ole Miss and the school retired it. Mississippi officials offered to take it out of retirement for him but Eli Manning declined. He wanted a double-digit number and settled on No. 10.

After being traded to the Giants by the Chargers on draft night Manning struck a deal on the telephone with punter Jeff Feagles to trade for the number. It cost him a trip to Florida.

“If it would have been something outrageous. I probably would have moved on about it” Manning quipped.

Manning said there were many wonderful moments in his career. Naturally one that might have impacted his career the most was beating the then-unbeaten Patriots in the Super Bowl in February 2008. It was the first of two Super Bowls Manning and coach Tom Coughlin combined to win.

“I mean that whole playoff stretch was you know probably very very important in my career and in coach Coughlin’s” Manning said. “We were both on that line of: ‘Do these guys have what it takes or not?’ ”

The Giants played all four playoffs games on the road that postseason in winning the Super Bowl.

Manning expected the ceremony to be emotional but said he will focus on members of the organization who were part of his career. His believes his legacy will be starting almost every single week. He was durable and said he worked hard every year to earn the respect of his teammates from the rookies to the veterans.

“It’s going to be special. It’s obviously a very emotional day and kind of one last farewell to all those fans wearing the No. 10 and all of them that were supporting me during my time with the Giants continue to support me” he said. “And so as I appreciate their loyalty and their support through all these years.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uZmwvZ2lhbnRzL2dhbWVkYXkvbmV3LXlvcmstZ2lhbnRzLWZhbGwtdG8tZmFsY29ucy0xNy0xNC1pbi1taXN0YWtlLWZpbGxlZC11Z2x5LWdhbWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York Giants Fall to Falcons 17-14 In Mistake-Filled Ugly Game,"Mistakes and missed opportunities doom Giants yet again as they fall to 0-3 on Eli Manning Day.

EAST RUTHERFORD NJ -- Not even the magic and nostalgia of Eli Manning Day could bring out the best in the New York Giants who despite outgaining the Atlanta Falcons in yardage (346 to 296) were unable to outgain the Falcons who beat New York 17-14 at MetLife Stadium on a 40-yard field goal by kicker Younghoe Koo as time expired..

The Giants had a golden opportunity to take a 14-0 lead over the Falcons but mistakes in the red zone by both sides of the ball doomed two promising first-half scoring drives and aided one successful Falcons scoring drive.

The first came on the Giants' opening drive when on 2nd-and-goal from the Falcons 8-yard line Giants quarterback Daniel Jones was sacked by Grady Jarrett for an 11-yard loss a play in which left guard Ben Bredeson appeared to be the one beaten off the snaps.

The Giants faced with 3rd-and-goal from the Falcons 19-yard line could only regain 12 of the 19 yards needed thanks to Jones's scramble. The Giants then settled for the first of Graham Gano's two field goals in the first half this one from 25 yards out.

The Giants' second score a 31-yard field goal by Gano also was a drive dotted with mistakes the most blatant being a poor snap between center Billy Price and quarterback Daniel Jones that moved the ball back from the 17-yard like to the 28.

Two plays later fullback Eli Penny was called for a false start that turned a 3rd-and-17 into a 3rd and 22 and forced the Giants to settle for Gano's second field goal of the afternoon and the 6-0 lead instead of a 14-0 advantage.

The first-half mistakes weren't just limited to the Giants and the red zone.

Second-year safety Xavier McKinney was flagged for a personal foul when his helmet made contact with Falcons receiver Olamide Zaccheaus's helmet after catching a 14-yard reception on a 1st-and-10 from the Falcons' 29-yard line.

The yardage gained and the additional penalty yardage gave the Falcons a 1st-and-goal from the Giants 7-yard line. Three plays later Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan connected with Zaccheaus for the go-ahead 4-yard touchdown and the 7-6 halftime lead on the Giants' defense's third straight touchdown before the half in as many games this season.

Want more mistakes? The Giants with 1:33 left before the half had a chance to drive down the field but tight end Evan Engram making his 2021 debut after missing the first two weeks with a calf injury fumbled the ball and the Falcons recovered.

There were other mistakes such as a fumble and a drop by Evan Engram a penalty against Will Hernandez that wiped out a 20-yard Jones to Barkley pass in the third quarter and a missed pass to a wide-open CJ Board after the Falcons pinned the Giants deep in their own territory late in the second quarter.

And in the second half the Giants wasted two timeouts when they were unable to get their player correctly lined up time outs they might have ben able to use at the end of the game to stop the clock.

The Giants finally got their first touchdown of the day when Saquon Barkley punched it into the end zone from 1-yard out and quarterback Daniel Jones's rush converted the 2-point try to cap a 10-play 71-yard drive at the top of the fourth quarter going back on top 14-7.

However the Giants' luck was short-lived as the Falcons cashed in more Giants mistakes this time by the defense. Cornerback Adoree' Jackson failed to come up with an acrobatic interception in the end zone that would have snuffed out a Falcons scoring drive. Then on the next play safety Logan Ryan was called for pass interference which gave the Flacons a fresh set of downs on the Giants' 1-yard line.

Atlanta then knotted the score on tight end Lee Smith's 1-yard reception from Matt Ryan to cap the 15-play 72-yard drive spanning 8:40 in the fourth quarter.

Koo's game-wining field goal as time expired capped a seven-lay 58-yard scoring drive to give the Falcons their first win of the season. Meanwhile the Giants who fell to 0-3 are a team that is so badly stuck in a rut unable to get out of its own way as another season depressingly appears headed down the drain.

The Injuries Also Piled Up

The Giants will be holding their breath over the next 24 hours after several key players on both sides of the ball had to leave with injuries.

The most concerning is that suffered by defensive co-captain Blake Martinez announced as having a knee injury that appeared to happen on a non-contact play on the Falcons' opening drive.

Martinez had to be helped off the field but was able to walk to the Giants locker room on his own for further evaluation.

Martinez was declared out of the game not long after leaving the game.

Also leaving the game with injuries were receivers Sterling Shepard and Darius Slayton both of whom had hamstring strains.

Slayton was declared out toward the end of the first quarter; Shepard meanwhile was seen limping off the field and to the locker room in the second quarter and was ruled out.

And despite being active for the game receiver Kenny Golladay spent time on the stationary bike in between series even going so far as to not be on the field for the Giants' final drive of the first half.

Eli Honored at Halftime

The Giants gave their fans something extra to cheer about this week when former quarterback Eli Manning had his No. 10 jersey officially retired by the only team he ever played for.

Manning whose parents wife and children were also on hand for the ceremony was led tot he stage by his offensive linemen from 2007.

The quarterback threw his final two passes on the MetLife Stadium field in front of Giants fans fittingly to receivers David Tyree and Mario Manningham both of whom made historic catches in Super Bowls XLII and XLVI.

After having his jersey retired Manning was officially inducted into the team's Ring of Honor his plaque going alongside of defensive end Justin Tuck's. Manning was given the Giants' Ring of Honor jacket and thanked a loud and enthusiastic MetLife Stadium crowd for their support though the years.

Before he left the field for one last time Manning capped a moving ceremony by saying “Wellington Mara always used to say 'Once a Giant always a Giant.' I’m glad I’m only a Giant.”

Kenny Golladay Evan Engram Active for the Giants

Quarterback Daniel Jones has started 29 games for the Giants yet amazingly he's only had his full lineup of play-makers available to him for just one complete game that being Week 1 of the 2020 season.

Until today that is. Despite some late-week injury concerns about receiver Kenny Golladay and a hip ailment that popped up despite the extra time off following the game against Washington Golladay is active for the game.

But once again Jones's having a full lineup of playmakers was short-lived when receiver Darius Slayton left the game in the first quarter with a left hamstring injury.

The last time before today that Jones had his entire group of playmakers available was in Week 2 last season a game in which Saquon Barkley tore his ACL early in the second quarter and receiver Sterling Shepard suffered turf toe later that same quarter.

Devontae Booker a Surprise Scratch

This week the only mild surprise for the Giants personnel-wise was the team's decision to laver running back Devontae Booker inactive.

Booker signed to a two-year $5.5 million contract in the off-season which carries a $2.5 million cap hit this year played 30 snaps in the Giants' Week 1 game against the Broncos a game in which starter Saquon Barkley was active but limited snap count wise.

Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports

Last week against the Washington Football Team Booker's snap count dipped to 16 carries as Barkley's workload increased further.

This week the Giants opted to carry six receivers including C.J. Board who was added to the 53-man roster Saturday.

That move was likely a result of the Giants having some uncertainties about the health statuses of Kenny Golladay (hip) and Kadarius Toney (ankle) both of whom were on the injury report this week and were active for the game against the Falcons.

And speaking of Toney with his ability to carry the ball out of the backfield that also likely factored into the coaches' decision.

Mara was surrounded by a handful of other team VIPs who could have been responsible but detectives looking for circumstantial evidence need only to look at social media for the viral GIF of Mara throwing a chair in the past to connect the dots.

Asked by The Post to comment on what he just witnessed Mara respectfully said “No” without breaking stride or looking up from his shoes as he walked away from the clubs at the bottom of MetLife Stadium about 30 minutes after the final play.

John Mara Bill Kostroun/New York Post

Mara was booed when he spoke during the halftime ceremony to retire Eli Manning’s jersey numbers and induct the former quarterback into the Ring of Honor. When he returned to the press box Mara told a small group of reporters “I would boo too. We’re 0-2 and down at half.”

The Giants trailed 7-6 at the half took a 14-7 lead and allowed 10 unanswered fourth-quarter points losing on a last-play field goal for the second straight week. They are now 0-3 after starting 0-5 last season. They have started five straight seasons with at least two straight losses.

The fans booed the players throughout the game but the chance for them to see Mara is rare.

“I don’t think that’s fair to Mr. Mara” running back Saquon Barkley said. “He’s done a great job.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1jYWxsLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5LzI2L2RhbmllbC1qb25lcy1uZWVkcy10by1tYXNrLWdpYW50cy1mbGF3cy1hbmQtY2FycnktdGhlbS10by1hLXdpbi1vdmVyLWF0bGFudGEtZmFsY29ucy1zdW5kYXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Daniel Jones needs to mask Giants' flaws and carry them to a win over Atlanta Falcons Sunday,"Sunday is not about Eli Manning and the past.

Sunday is about Daniel Jones and the Giants’ present and future.

Joe Judge’s 0-2 team needs a win in the worst way against the lowly Atlanta Falcons (0-2) at MetLife Stadium. The Giants cannot lose this game.

An 0-3 start with a loss to Atlanta wouldn’t just dig a steep hole. It would cement the Giants once again as one of the NFL’s worst teams.

It’s nice that the franchise is retiring Manning’s jersey at halftime but Giants fans want more than a reminder of how long it’s been since this franchise was at the mountain top.

What they want is a reason to believe they will get back there again.

There is pressure on the whole team to step up especially the disappointing defense. But sometimes a quarterback just needs to put his team on his back and win.

It is time for Daniel Jones to have the kind of game that masks a team’s flaws.

It is time for Jones to play like he did in Week 2 at Washington but to finish the job with a ‘W’ over rookie Falcons coach Arthur Smith quarterback Matt Ryan and the Falcons.

The Giants believe Jones will do it.

“I believe in D.J.” tight end Evan Engram said Friday. “We believe in D.J.”

Jones knows the score too.

He didn’t want to hear about how well he played in last week’s division loss when he racked up 344 total yards two touchdowns and no turnovers but failed to get the victory.

He was asked this Wednesday if his Washington performance had been one of his better games as a pro.

“I don’t know” Jones said. “Judging it that way I don’t know how productive that is. We didn’t win the game so we didn’t do enough. I didn’t do enough and didn’t make enough plays. So we’ve got to look at that and improve.”

They have to improve on their situational play-calling and execution like their conservative three-play drive after James Bradberry’s interception in the fourth quarter at Washington.

Two Saquon Barkley runs and an inaccurate Jones incompletion to Sterling Shepard burned just 16 seconds off the clock before a Graham Gano field goal at the two-minute warning.

Offensive coordinator Jason Garrett curiously did not include Jones’ read-option element into the Barkley runs despite its success throughout that game. That gave Taylor Heinicke ample time to drive Washington’s offense down the field needing only a field goal to win.

“In those situations where it’s a little bit of a sell-out [by the defense] sometimes you want to use bigger personnel to protect the run a little bit more rather than spreading them out” Garrett said.

Garrett’s best contribution so far as the Giants’ offensive coordinator has been utilizing Jones’ running ability however and he should lean on it more.

Daniel Jones is third among NFL QBs in rushing yards and the Giants need to take better advantage of his skills.

Jones is third among NFL quarterbacks in rushing (122) with two TDs on the ground and third that was called back in Washington due to a phantom holding call against wide receiver C.J. Board downfield.

Washington’s defenders weren’t honoring Jones’ running ability on the outside and the Giants need to keep going to it until someone stops it consistently.

Eagles QB Jalen Hurts gained 62 yards rushing in Week 1 on a Falcons defense led by linebackers Foye Oluokun and Deion Jones. Atlanta has allowed 127.5 yards rushing per game ranked 24th in the league.

And Jones is eager to keep toting the rock. He is averaging 8.1 yards per carry on 15 attempts.

“I enjoy that part of the game” Jones said. “When those opportunities are there I certainly look forward to taking advantage.”

Either the Dallas Cowboys (1-1) or Philadelphia Eagles (1-1) will have two wins in the NFC East after Monday night’s showdown in Arlington Tex. even if Washington (1-1) has its hands full on Sunday with the Buffalo Bills (1-1).

The Giants’ upcoming schedule is unrelenting: at New Orleans at Dallas at home against the L.A. Rams and then the Carolina Panthers who are suddenly 3-0. Then they go to Kansas City to take on the Chiefs on Monday Night Football.

The Giants can’t afford to fall to 0-3 for the third time in five years.

Lamar Jackson’s surprise win over the Chiefs last weekend on Sunday Night Football therefore is a good example of what the Giants need from Jones here at MetLife Stadium.

They don’t need him to be perfect. Jackson threw two interceptions in that game including a pick-6 after all. They just need Jones to find a way to win.

“Every game is big” Jones said.

None as big as Sunday’s however if the Giants want to be relevant in 2021."

The Nevada Gaming Commission’s board room was oozing with history when the five-member — make that four-member — regulatory board gathered Thursday.

This was to be the last meeting for Commission Chairman John Moran Jr. who announced his retirement in August after notifying Gov. Steve Sisolak three months ago of his intention to step down and give someone else a chance to oversee Nevada’s most important industry.

Moran’s departure will take the commission down to three members since Sisolak has yet to replace Deborah Feutsch who left the board in May. Unless Sisolak makes an appointment between now and the next commission meeting Oct. 28 Vice Chairman Steven Cohen will run things.

One historic decision came out of the meeting as commissioners gave MGM Resorts International final approval to buy out Dubai World its partner in the development of CityCenter for $2.1 billion.

When the Dubai World licensing was approved in 2009 it was something regulators had never seen before because the company was owned by the government of the United Arab Emirates.

The Nevada Gaming Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission which included Moran worked through the complications of gathering background on key corporate leaders and asking whether they would be influenced by government leaders in their corporate decisions.

On Thursday longtime Las Vegas gaming attorney Jeffrey Silver of the Dickinson Wright law firm was representing William Grounds president and chief operating officer of Infinity World Development Corp. a Dubai World subsidiary in the matter of terminating its registration as a holding company to end the partnership.

Attorneys attending a board member’s final meeting often exchange pleasantries and wish them well in their future endeavors.

As Silver applauded Moran for his service Moran turned the tables and congratulated Silver on his future induction to the Gaming Hall of Fame at next week’s Global Gaming Expo in Las Vegas. Not only is Silver a notable gaming attorney he also served as a Nevada Gaming Control Board member in one of its most turbulent eras.

As the two talked about their experiences they realized that a role reversal was playing out — Silver was representing a gaming client on Moran’s last day and Moran as a young attorney representing gaming clients in the late 1970s appeared before Silver in his regulatory role.

But Silver had a bigger part in Nevada history when he sat on the board. He was appointed by then-Gov. Mike O’Callaghan at a time when the state was attempting to ferret out gangsters and organized crime and Silver then 29 and the youngest Control Board member ever appointed had experience asking tough questions as a prosecutor.

When the Control Board’s offices were on Maryland Parkway near UNLV Silver got the job of interrogating reputed mobster Frank “Lefty” Rosenthal about his suitability as a licensee when he was seeking permission to run the Stardust.

Rosenthal was represented by former defense attorney and ex-Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman. The movie “Casino” included scenes depicting the era and then-Nevada Gaming Commission Chairman Harry Reid.

Silver said he later learned that mobsters were considering assassinating “Silverman” but mob associates changed their minds.

“They figured whacking me would stir up too much heat” Silver said in an interview.

Silver’s role in removing bad actors from the state and ushering in the era of corporate ownership of casinos caught the attention of the independent committee that reviews potential nominees for the Gaming Hall of Fame.

Could roles again be reversed and Moran’s service to Nevada gaming someday land him in the Hall of Fame?

“Given his history in the state of Nevada and with the gaming authorities he certainly would qualify” Silver said. “They’ve put other regulators in there and he’s in the same category as them. I absolutely think he has the opportunity to do that.”

Moran's goodbye cake

John Moran Jr.'s colleagues celebrated his retirement from the Nevada Gaming Commission on Thursday with a large chocolate cake trimmed with symbols representing the three state commissions on which he has served.

Designed by Commissioner Ogonna Brown and Moran's wife Marilyn the center of the cake featured a crown symbolizing Moran's ""triple crown"" achievement of serving as chairman on three separate commissions.

Each corner of the cake had a chair. In one corner there were two deer next to the chair a reference to his service to the Nevada Wildlife Commission. A second corner had water bottles for Moran's work with the Colorado River Commission.

The top right corner featured casino chips for his chairing of the Nevada Gaming Commission.

And in the bottom right corner with an Adirondack chair there were palm trees sand and a sand pail representing retirement.

The 116000 sq ft expansion will more than double the size of the existing warehouse allowing the firm to increase production of low-carbon heating products. It will also include the construction of a new office building car park and infrastructure works including a new access road to the site. Ideal Heating employs over 750 people in Hull and a further 250 elsewhere in the UK.

In 2019 it became the world’s first boiler manufacturer to be certified to ISO 50001 for energy management achieving this international standard through measures including the use of renewable materials and energy resources in its design and production process.

Jason Speedy Chief Operations Officer at Ideal Heating said: “This investment is part of a wider ambitious plan to significantly grow our business through the introduction of low carbon products for the future. The expansion will enable us to step up production of these and other innovative new heating technologies reinforcing our well-established green credentials and creating more high-quality jobs in the city.

“We are pleased to be working with Britcon as our strategic delivery partner following a rigorous competitive tender process where they were scored on delivery safety cost and quality of submission. Following a number of site visits for comparable projects we were very impressed with Britcon’s approach to health and safety value engineering and all-important commitment to local engagement.”

Nick Shepherd Managing Director of Britcon added: “We are delighted to secure this contract as a local company and support Ideal Heating as it pursues its low carbon agenda.

“We have a strong local supply chain and are excited to be working in partnership with our client and associated stakeholders in not only delivering this project but also utilising our experience and resources to deliver local employment opportunities during the construction period.

“This is a significant boost for Britcon as we emerge from the impact of Covid as well as Brexit and I am proud of how the business has evolved since I joined in 2019 to be able to compete at the highest level with impressive credentials and fantastic team of professionals.”

If someone gets hold of or guesses your password they can pretend to be you from wherever they are in the world especially if you don't have two-factor authentication in place. Which is why Microsoft's recent move to go passwordless is such a welcome step toward better protection.

It's a transition you should welcome. The easier passwords are to remember the easier they are for someone else (or automated hacking tools) to guess. Making them harder to guess or crack makes them impossible to remember adding extra inconvenience and frustration whenever there's a new device to get up and running. And while a good password manager can solve a lot of those problems for you getting rid of passwords altogether gets you even further.

With that in mind Microsoft is pushing a password-free future and giving users the opportunity to log into their Microsoft accounts—which you probably use to access your Windows PC Xbox Outlook email OneDrive storage and more—via other methods.

The Microsoft Authenticator app can now replace your password. Screenshot: David Nield via Microsoft

It's a major shift although the traditional password method remains an option for Microsoft accounts for the time being. If you're interested in making your account more secure and your digital life less stressful it's something to consider—and it's not particularly difficult to make the switch.

Switching to a Passwordless Login

You can replace your Microsoft account password with a code from the Microsoft Authenticator app the Windows Hello biometric login system (usually facial or fingerprint recognition) a physical security key that you keep with you or a verification code sent via email or text.

While those options are not 100 percent foolproof they at least require you to have something physical with you (a phone or a key) or access to another account. That's an improvement over a name and password that anyone can use from anywhere and which can be leaked on the web.

Whichever method you want to use to make the switch away from passwords you need to download and install the Microsoft Authenticator app for Android or iOS first. (Microsoft unfortunately didn't make its system compatible with other authenticator apps.) Log in using your existing Microsoft account email address and password and the app can then verify your identity.

With the app setup done head to the security settings page for your Microsoft account in a web browser. If Microsoft has pushed out the feature to your account you'll see a Passwordless account option underneath Additional security—turn this on then click Next on the confirmation dialog then approve the request that will appear on your phone via the Microsoft Authenticator app.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjEvMDkvMjUvdGVjaC1zdWJwb2VuYS1zZWNyZWN5LWZpZ2h0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Google and other tech giants are pressing to stop prosecutors from secretly taking customer data,"When the FBI seizes your messages from Big Tech you may not know it for years

Rootkits are malicious tools threat actors create to evade detection by burying deep into the OS and used to fully take over compromised systems while evading detection.

WPBT is a fixed firmware ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) table introduced by Microsoft starting with Windows 8 to allow vendors to execute programs every time a device boots.

However besides enabling OEMs to force install critical software that can't be bundled with Windows installation media this mechanism can also allow attackers to deploy malicious tools as Microsoft warns in its own documentation.

""Because this feature provides the ability to persistently execute system software in the context of Windows it becomes critical that WPBT-based solutions are as secure as possible and do not expose Windows users to exploitable conditions"" Microsoft explains.

""In particular WPBT solutions must not include malware (i.e. malicious software or unwanted software installed without adequate user consent).""

Impacts all computers running Windows 8 or later

The weakness found by Eclypsium researchers is present on Windows computers since 2012 when the feature was first introduced with Windows 8.

These attacks can use various techniques that allow writing to memory where ACPI tables (including WPBT) are located or by using a malicious bootloader.

This can be by abusing the BootHole vulnerability that bypasses Secure Boot or via DMA attacks from vulnerable peripherals or components.

""The Eclypsium research team has identified a weakness in Microsoft’s WPBT capability that can allow an attacker to run malicious code with kernel privileges when a device boots up"" Eclypsium researchers said.

""This weakness can be potentially exploited via multiple vectors (e.g. physical access remote and supply chain) and by multiple techniques (e.g. malicious bootloader DMA etc).""

Eclypsium has shared the following demo video that demonstrates how this security flaw can be exploited.

Mitigation measures include using WDAC policies

After Eclypsium informed Microsoft of the bug the software giant recommended using a Windows Defender Application Control policy which allows controlling what binaries can run on a Windows device.

""WDAC policy is also enforced for binaries included in the WPBT and should mitigate this issue"" Microsoft states in the support document.

WDAC policies can only be created on client editions of Windows 10 1903 and later and Windows 11 or on Windows Server 2016 and above.

On systems running older Windows releases you can use AppLocker policies to control what apps are allowed to run on a Windows client.

""These motherboard-level flaws can obviate initiatives like Secured-core because of the ubiquitous usage of ACPI and WPBT"" Eclypsium researchers added.

""Security professionals need to identify verify and fortify the firmware used in their Windows systems. Organizations will need to consider these vectors and employ a layered approach to security to ensure that all available fixes are applied and identify any potential compromises to devices.""

Eclypsium found another vector of attack allowing threat actors to take control of a targeted device's boot process and break OS-level security controls in the BIOSConnect feature of Dell SupportAssist a software that comes preinstalled on most Dell Windows devices.

As the researchers revealed the issue ""affects 129 Dell models of consumer and business laptops desktops and tablets including devices protected by Secure Boot and Dell Secured-core PCs"" with roughly 30 million individual devices being exposed to attacks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzcmFkYXIuY29tL2RlYXRobG9vcHMtY29sdC12YWhuLXZvaWNlLWFjdG9yLWlzLWdldHRpbmctYS1wczUtZnJvbS1taWNyb3NvZnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deathloop's Colt Vahn voice actor is getting a PS5 from Microsoft,"Microsoft is sending the voice of Deathloop's Colt Vahn Jason Kelley a PS5 so he can play the game.

""I can probably help find you a PS5 so you can play it"" he tweeted back. ""You deserve a chance to play as Colt and enjoy your own amazing performance.""

According to an interview with JumpCut PLAY (thanks TheGamer ) Hines was true to his word too. As Kelley explained in a recent interview: ""I made an announcement I was doing a bit and said that I didn't have one and it turns out I was just notified by Bethesda that a PS5 was made available and is going to be shipped to me with the game as well. So I'll be playing the game... I'm super excited.""

""I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Deathloop. It wasn't what I thought it was going to be and it seemed to challenge my expectations without reservation"" Josh wrote. ""It's a murder mystery that's suspended in a time loop. It's a first-person shooter that features a shotgun that can transform into a rifle. It's a sci-fi spy adventure that's stuck in the '70s. It's all of these things and none of them at all.

""My impression of Deathloop seemed to shift with every passing hour and as a result it's difficult to not be impressed – if not thoroughly enthralled – with what Arkane has pieced together here. It's different it's stylish it's new. You won't play anything else quite like Deathloop for a very long time.""

These side effects are most often minor and go away in a matter of days.

According to the Centers for Disease Control ""no long-term side effects have been detected"" for COVID-19 vaccines and monitoring of potential side effects from the vaccine continues.

Allergic reactions are also possible.

Most common side effects

Here are the most common side effects from COVID-19 vaccination according to the CDC:

In the arm where the shot is received pain redness and swelling are common. One could also experience headaches tiredness muscle pain chills fever and nausea.

These — particularly fever and body aches — can be signs that your body is building up its protections against COVID-19.

The use of over-the-counter medication to address these side effects can be used after vaccination. It is not recommended that medication to address side effects be taken beforehand.

To reduce pain or discomfort from the shot exercising the arm or using a cool damp cloth can be effective. For a fever drink fluids.

Side effects from the second shot can be more severe than the first but this is not always the case.

Serious side effects

Serious side effects with the COVID-19 vaccine are rare and the CDC has determined that the benefits outweigh the risks.

Rare adverse events after the Moderna vaccine have included Guillain-Barré syndrome a rare autoimmune neurologic disorder that includes weakness and paralysis in the limbs and muscles and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) which causes blood clots and low platelet levels.

The Moderna vaccine has been given to more than 12 million people. There have been 100 reports of Guillain-Barré and one resulting death. Symptoms typically begin with weakness and tingling in the extremities that quickly spread.

According to the CDC there have been 38 cases of TTS within 15 days of vaccination and four resulting deaths. Symptoms typically appear four to 30 days after vaccination and can include persistent headaches visual changes abdominal pain chest pain leg pain coldness in limbs and acute bruising or bleeding.

Get vaccinated:Where to get a COVID-19 vaccine in Marion Polk counties

The CDC estimates that per million doses of Moderna given to men age 50-64 1800 hospitalizations and 140 deaths attributable to COVID-19 could be prevented by getting vaccinated compared with 14-17 Guilian Barré cases and 1-2 TTS cases prevented by not getting vaccinated.

Myocarditis an inflammation of the heart has been reported after the Pfizer vaccine particularly after the second dose and more often for men or young adults several days after vaccination.

About 141 million Americans have received both doses of the two vaccines. According to the CDC there have been 497 cases of myocarditis and no resulting deaths. Symptoms can include chest pain shortness of breath and feelings of having a fast-beating fluttering or pounding heart.

Flu shot and COVID-19 shot

The CDC has said it is safe to get a flu shot at the same time you get one of the COVID-19 vaccine shots.

When to call a doctor

How much the manufacturers stand to gain depends on how big the rollout proves to be.

The Biden administration last month announced plans to give boosters to nearly everybody. But U.S. regulators have rejected the across-the-board approach and instead said third shots of Pfizer’s vaccine should go to people who are 65 and older and certain others at high risk from COVID-19.

Still the crisis is constantly evolving and some top U.S. health officials expect boosters will be more broadly authorized in the coming weeks or months. And that plus continued growth in initial vaccinations could mean a huge gain in sales and profits for Pfizer and Moderna in particular.

“The opportunity quite frankly is reflective of the billions of people around the world who would need a vaccination and a boost” Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said.

Wall Street is taking notice. The average forecast among analysts for Moderna’s 2022 revenue has jumped 35% since President Joe Biden laid out his booster plan in mid-August.

Most of the vaccinations so far in the U.S. have come from Pfizer which developed its shot with Germany’s BioNTech and Moderna. They have inoculated about 99 million and 68 million people respectively. Johnson & Johnson is third with about 14 million people.

No one knows yet how many people will get the extra shots. But Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen expects boosters alone to bring in about $26 billion in global sales next year for Pfizer and BioNTech and around $14 billion for Moderna if they are endorsed for nearly all Americans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdsYW1vdXJtYWdhemluZS5jby51ay9hcnRpY2xlL2NvdmlkLXZhY2NpbmUtYnJlYXN0LXNpemUtaW5jcmVhc2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,People Are Reporting An Increase In Breast Size After Having Covid Vaccine,"The rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine has played a huge role in the reopening of society. However like any vaccine it can have side-effects which contribute to general mistrust towards the rollout.

There are currently three vaccines on offer: Moderna Oxford/AstraZeneca and the Pfizer/BioNTech. Although you don't normally get to decide which one you receive all have been proven to be safe and effective. This hasn't stopped some people voicing doubts over the safety of the vaccine. As well as the emergence of a troubling ‘anti-vaxx’ movement some public figures have used their influence to spread misinformation.

One such figure is Nicki Minaj who prompted an international backlash after tweeting that one of her friends had become impotent after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine in Trinidad. She wrote “My cousin in Trinidad won’t get the vaccine cuz his friend got it & became impotent. His testicles became swollen” adding that “His friend was weeks away from getting married now the girl called off the wedding.”

The rapper then encouraged her Twitter followers (all 22.5 million of them) to “pray on it & make sure you’re comfortable with ur decision not bullied.” Her tweets were almost universally condemned with the UK's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty saying “I think they know they are peddling untruths. But they still do it. In my view they should be ashamed.""

One of the latest rumours doing the rounds is that the Covid-19 vaccine can increase your breast size. Yep really. It comes as more people have reported feeling irregular lumps around their breast area after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine which has led some to worry about a potential link with breast cancer.

Bourla cited the Covid-19 booster shots in his reasoning.

“Finally Moderna’s CEO said this week that the pandemic is on course to be over in about a year. Do you agree with that?” Stephanapoulos asked Bourla.

“I agree that within a year I think we will be able to come back to normal life” Bourla agreed but added “I don’t think that this means that variants will not be continuing coming. And I don’t think that this means that we should be able to live our lives without having vaccinations basically. But that’s – again remains to be seen.’

Bourla said an annual vaccination would be the mostly likely outcome much as people get an annual flu vaccine to help battle those disease variants.

“The most likely scenario for me it is that because the virus is spread all over the world that we will continue seeing new variants that are coming out” he said. “And also we will have vaccines that – they will last at least a year. And I think the most likely scenario – it is annual re-vaccinations. But we don’t know really. We need to wait and see the data.”

Pfizer is the only Covid-19 vaccine manufacturer that has also been approved for a booster. The booster shots are only permitted by the FDA to be distributed to those age 65 and older and high-risk individuals.

Among the competing factors which explain this decline the most significant has been the sheer number of beverage alcohol products brought to market.

Consumption occasions and category switching

Brand launches over the past decade have increasingly aligned product attributes and branding with a consumer mindset centred around the drinking occasion. What consumers used to consider a ‘beer occasion’ may now be perceived as much more open to new categories: a hard seltzer on the golf course beer with lunch a cocktail before dinner a glass of red paired with the evening meal and a whisky before bed for example.

Recognising that demand has spread into other categories breweries began moving into this broader consumer consideration at retail. New products have been launched in categories such as hard seltzers; hard teas kombuchas and coffees; CBD and THC-infused drinks (where legal); spirits innovations in brewstilleries; and new wine and cider beverages.

While volumes of these products are not attributable to beer alone their contribution to the bottom line is considerable. It follows that breweries will perform better than the beer category overall given their investment in adjacency products that converge existing brands with innovations – primarily in the RTD category. This approach helps drive growth of topline profitability even as total beer volumes continue to decline. Growth however is subjective: from the producer’s perspective selling more product than last year is ‘growth’ regardless of the categories in which that growth occurs.

Although traditional beer will likely remain the primary focus for the majority of brewers some have seen that demand for beverages other than beer has driven RTD volumes to outperform their traditional beer offerings.

Industry investment

AB InBev recognised this shift in 2016 when they announced increased investment in their Beyond Beer portfolio. This suite of beverages consists of products such as canned wine hard seltzers prepared cocktails and FMBs; for example AB InBev’s acquisition of Babe Wine known for their canned rose Cutwater Spirits known for their spirit-based RTD line and Kombrewcha hard kombucha.

Other large brewing companies have also turned their attentions away from traditional beer. Molson Coors have launched the Coors Whiskey Company which takes advantage of Coors beer’s malt base. The company has also dropped “Brewing Company” from its corporate name and is now the Molson Coors Beverage Company. Molson Coors has invested in non-alcoholic beverage categories such as Zoa Energy an energy drink created by a team that includes Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson as well.

Pabst Brewing have also released various brands under the Pabst label including a whiskey hard coffee hard tea and hard seltzer. Boston Beer have launched RTD brands Truly hard seltzer and Twisted Tea.

As beer forges ahead into new territory incumbent value-priced beer brands – once the mainstay of the beer industry – are under review to assess if there is enough demand to justify their continuation. Molson Coors made the first large-scale move to focus more on streamlining and premiumising their portfolio by discontinuing 11 beer brands which make up 100 SKUs. It is expected that other breweries will follow suit and will discontinue brands no longer in demand to focus on priority brands and investing in further innovation.

Pockets of growth

Even though brewers have pivoted into producing brands in categories other than traditional beer pockets of growth exist within the beer category. These sub-categories will seed the future growth of the beer industry: sour beer is a nascent development which is being nurtured for robust growth in future years through education and trial. Hops will also increasingly take on a showcasing role in a similar way to how grapes are used in wine varietals. Consumers demanding healthier alternatives are driving the development of the no-alcohol beer movement compounded by newer more premium offerings that focus on flavour.

In parallel brewers are releasing lower-ABV versions of their flagship beer brands to provide consumers another ‘better-for-you’ option while staying within the brand family. Hazy IPAs of varying ABVs and full of flavour continue to excite the industry. Some external factors however still need to be addressed – hazy brews for example are supposed to be consumed as close to the born-on date as possible and kept cold. This is a challenge that breweries have yet to overcome as is the vast number of similar beers competing for limited refrigerator shelf space.

Compared to other categories such as whisky gin tequila and wine celebrity endorsement and influencers are conspicuous by their absence in beer. It is expected that brewers will recruit well-known celebrities to strengthen the social media bond between the brand and its consumers. The industry has been entertained by successful collaborations between Matthew McConaughey and Wild Turkey; Ryan Reynolds and Aviation; George Clooney and Casamigos; and Sarah Jessica Parker and Invio X wine to name a few. In addition since the beer category under-indexes in the ecommerce space the industry is expected to develop the grocery delivery channel so that beer is delivered cold.

From a local perspective the beer industry retains a distinct advantage over competing categories through neighborhood brewpubs. These establishments allow not only for the freshest beer on draft but also offer experiences such as sampling experimental flights meeting expert brewers observing the operation of tanks and fermenters and mixing with fellow brewhounds in a hyper-local setting.

Brewery-produced RTD brands aside it is expected that the beer category in the US will inevitably achieve balance through the culling of underperforming brands and greater attention on priority brands and innovation.

According to the BBC the US-headquartered major chocolate maker behind companies including Cadbury and Oreo has claimed the British firm has infringed on its established Milka bar range with lawyers for the business now reportedly issuing demands for removal of the London-based company’s stock from shelves.

However the firm which is under the banner of its parent group Nurture Brands specialising in healthier option snacks ranges including protein bars vegetable thins and sweet potato sticks has denied that there is any breach of trademark.

The company’s director Adam Draper confirmed that the snack series had launched in 2016 under a variety of colours with the lilac tone being just one of the latest of these and he did not believe there was a case to answer.

In a statement on its website the B-Corp registered company felt disappointed at what it described as a ‘lawyer led’ approach from Mondelēz. “We are facing our next challenge. In the past 24 hours we have been contacted and threatened with legal action in relation to chocolate brand ‘Milka’ owned by the confectionery giant Mondelez International over the colour of our Real Food Cocoa bar packaging. Their claim is that our product is imitating the Milka brand and that the lilac colours are identical and confusing their shoppers.

“While they own a trademark and a specific colour of lilac they do not own all colours and we believe our packaging is not close enough to warrant taking our product off the shelves across the whole of the EU and signing a very onerous ‘cease and desist’ contract. What has really taken us by surprise is the direct and uncompromising approach taken by the Mondelez. With no option for a conversation nor a request for the actual pantone references of our product we have been asked to accept defeat or prepare for a long court battle where they would pursue us for costs and damages. So it is a David versus Goliath affair but we think the claims are unreasonable and the approach unnecessarily aggressive.”

The company also took to Instagram to let consumers decide whether there are similarities between the packaging styles of the two products asking shoppers to ‘spot the difference’ between the two.

The case comes in the wake of a similar incident two years ago in which the company’s core Cadbury brand lost a long-running claim over moves to alter existing trademarks it had registered regarding its classic Dairy Milk purple wrapping.

This had previously been challenged by Nestle in 2013 and consequently a Court of Appeal hearing confirmed that the business could not be permitted to trademark the blanket use of an entire colour which observers had noted would have given it a monopoly on packaging styles.

Regarding the latest case with Primal Pantry Mondelez said that it was seeking to protect its existing brands. A statement for the company read: “We own a colour trademark in Europe for the distinctive lilac Milka colour for food products.

“As a matter of practice to protect the value of our brands which we have worked hard to build over hundreds of years we express our concerns to third parties when we feel they are using a protected brand element. We have opened up conversations with Primal Pantry to try and resolve the matter amicably.”

Nelson Peltz is an investor businessman and founding partner of Trian Fund Management.

Get Our Activist Investing Case Study! Get The Full Activist Investing Study In PDF

He started his career as a delivery driver for his grandfather’s food distribution business A. Peltz and Sons. Ultimately he and his brother ended up running the company acquiring other companies and listing it as Flagstaff Corp.

Peltz and CFO Peter May left the company in 1983 and bought Triangle Industries which manufactured vending machines. They used the company to make a series of acquisitions before selling the company to Pechiney SA in 1988.

Peltz and May’s next company was Triarc Cos which they used to make opportunistic acquisitions of companies that found themselves in trouble. In 1997 Triarc bought Snapple from Quaker Oats and in 2000 sold it to Cadbury Schweppes - this turnaround play was eventually featured as a case study at Harvard Business School.

Peltz May and Edward Garden founded Trian Fund Management in 2005 to focus on activist investing. The company now called Trian Partners manages $12 billion.

As a result of his activist investing Peltz has found himself on the board of numerous corporations over the years. He is currently Chairman of Wendy’s Company (NasdaqGS: WEN) and serves on the boards of Legg Mason (NYSE: LM) Proctor and Gamble (NYSE: PG) Ingersoll Rand (NYSE:IR) and Mondelez International (NasdaqGS: MDLZ).

Peltz has built a personal fortune of $1.68 billion during his career. In 2013 Forbes magazine listed him as one of the top 25 highest-earning hedge fund managers for the year. The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) has also recognized Peltz as one of the most influential people in corporate governance.

The Old School Activist Investor

Nelson Peltz would be best described as an activist investor. His style of investing has as much to do with operational issues as it does with traditional investment factors like valuation.

Unlike many other investors Peltz rose through the ranks of an industrial company. No doubt he uses this experience when restructuring troubled companies. The first business he ran was in the food distribution and wholesaling industry and the second was an industrial manufacturing business. Since then Peltz has never strayed from these two industries preferring to stick to what he knows (i.e. circle of competence).

Trian only invests in companies if Peltz believes he can gain a seat on the board and make fundamental changes to the structure of the company and the way it is run.

Over the years Trian has invested in Heinz Cadbury Kraft Foods Wendy’s DuPont PepsiCo and Family Dollar. Most of these investments were made with the intention of also bringing about structural or leadership changes at the companies.

Peltz’s first high-profile turnaround success was Snapple. The Quaker Oats Company had bought it for $1.7 billion but ran into cash flow difficulties. Peltz then managed to buy the company for $300 million in 1997 return it to profitability and then sell it to Cadbury Schweppes for $1.45 billion in 2000.

In 2008 Trian used its holding in Triarc Cos to acquire Wendy’s. Triarc already owned Arby’s restaurants and the two chains were merged. Arby’s was later sold to Roark Capital Group leaving Trian in control of Wendy’s. Peltz often uses one company to acquire a larger company before spinning off the smaller business.

Peltz’s strategies often rely heavily on changing the makeup of the board of a company. Sometimes these attempts are successful but just as often they fail.

In 2013 Trian bought a $1.2 billion stake in Du Pont and began pushing for four new board members to be appointed. Though the bid was unsuccessful it did eventually result in the CEO resigning and the company embarking on a cost-cutting plan.

In 2017 Trian bought a significant stake in Proctor and Gamble and pushed for Peltz to be appointed to the board. There was significant initial push back but he ultimately gained a seat on the board in December prompting speculation that the company may eventually split into two.

Trian Fund Management's Latest Form 13F Filing

On November 14th 2017 Nelson Peltz's firm Trian Fund Management filed their quarterly Form 13F regulatory filing. I reviewed the 13F filing to review holdings in Trian Fund Management's 8 stock portfolio.

Trian Fund Management's stock portfolio totals $13.0 billion according to the latest filing. The list value of stock holdings is down -2.1% when compared to the last quarter. As a benchmark the S&P 500 was up 3.9% over the same period.

Quarter-over-Quarter Turnover (QoQ Turnover) measures the level of trading activity in a portfolio. Trian Fund Management's QoQ Turnover for the latest quarter was 9.8% so the firm likely has high conviction in these holdings as indicated by the low turnover ratio.

Trian Fund Management's Stock Holdings

The Ideas section of finbox.io tracks top investors and trending investment themes. You can get the latest data on the holdings discussed below at the Nelson Peltz page. The following table summarizes his firm's entire stock holdings reported in the last filing:

Trian Fund Management Largest Holdings Ticker Name Holding ($mil) % Of Portfolio PG Procter and Gamble $3448.9 26.6% SYY Sysco Corp. $2400.4 18.5% MDLZ Mondelez Intl Inc. $1728.2 13.3% GE General Electric Co. $1713.2 13.2% BK Bank of New York Mellon $1186.3 9.1% PNR Pentair PLC $1033.1 8.0% DWDP DowDuPont Inc. $867.2 6.7% WEN Wendys Co. $606.2 4.7%

Although Trian Fund Management does not take a large number of positions the firm makes huge bets on the positions it does take. The average value from each of the eight positions is a sizeable $1.6 billion!

Managers with more than $100 million in qualifying assets under management are required to disclose their holdings to the SEC each quarter via 13F filings. Qualifying assets include long positions in U.S. equities and ADRs call/put options and convertible debt securities. Shorts cash positions foreign investments and other assets are not included. It is important to note that these filings are due 45 days after the quarter end date. Therefore Trian Fund Management's holdings above represent positions held as of September 30th and not necessarily reflective of the fund's current stock holdings.

However most can agree that with thousands of stocks traded on U.S. exchanges doing thorough research on each one is nearly impossible for smaller investors. Leveraging the resources of the largest hedge funds on Wall Street can be a powerful way to narrow down the list.

As of this writing I did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities and this is not a buy or sell recommendation on any security mentioned.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlZGVzdHJpYW4udHYvYml0ZXMvY2FkYnVyeS12ZWdlbWl0ZS1jaG9jb2xhdGUtZWJheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cadbury's Vegemite: Unopened Blocks Are Still Going On eBay For $500,"Cadbury’s discontinued blocks of Vegemite chocolate which were gone too soon to be quite honest are still going on eBay for *checks notes* $500.

That’s right if you have an unopened block of Cadbury limited edition Vegemite chocolate it might be best to hold onto it rather than ripping it open and taking a big ol’ bite.

The block which first dropped in 2015 and sold out in just two weeks is a lot kinder to the tongue for international vegemite-trying celebs like Selena Gomez or Steve Buscemi. Basically it’s the traditional caramel Cadbury with an extremely thin layer of vegemite in it.

And nearly seven years later there’s a limited supply that’s still going for a lot of dollaridoos on eBay.

While someone is listing two blocks for $60 another has started a bid at $50 with a buy-it-now price of $200. Side note: my favourite thing about the latter listing is the crinkled packaging.

In news that’ll make Moneybags from Spyro certainly pleased another is legitimately selling five of them for $500.

Holy fkn shit.

A standard block of Cadbury Dairy Milk is currently $2.50 at Woolies. That means that for five unopened blocks of Cadbury’s Vegemite pack on eBay you could buy 200 normal blocks. That’s a lot of chocolata.

Alternatively with that same kinda money you could nearly afford a Nintendo Switch console.

Back in 2017 Mondelez International ANZ director of marketing for chocolate Kjetil Undhjem claimed that the discontinued chocolate block was actually an experiment to get people to think of their other beloved chocolate flavours which is funny given all I can think about is the caramelised yeast in my mouth.

“The purpose of it wasn’t to launch a chocolate with Vegemite that would go into our repertoire the whole point of the campaign and activity was to generate talk about rediscovering your favourite chocolate flavours” he said per AdNews.

“We have 18 flavours in our blocks range and we wanted to create a conversation about flavours and rediscovering some of your favourites whether it’s top deck or crunchy or snack.

“We thought about the most disruptive flavour you can put in chocolate to get that conversation started.”

Anyway if you need me I’ll be mixing normal blocks of chocolate with Vegemite because my body ain’t made of coins.",,,

1) Persistence

His strategy is not constrained in the same way as many of his competitors.

Most of the time he's focused on analyzing and investing in companies rather than being restricted to specific themes or categories. So he is constantly on the look-out for emerging trends that could disrupt his holdings in particular persistence.

""Often trends start and people get excited about them"" Lynch said. ""And I think you want to wait some period of time before you get some conviction that there's something to it. I think persistence of a trend is something that we think about when we when we analyze any situation or any emerging trend.""

2) Paranoia

Lynch's team's investment horizon features a 10-year outlook and a ""mid-game"" five-year outlook. During this time his team will make assumptions where a company should be within that timeframe and frequently analyze if those assumptions hold true.

""It's really a constant iterative process and engagement with companies and research and making sure your signposts and the key assumptions you've made over those longer term periods are still intact"" Lynch said. ""And that's really how we spend our day to day.""

Part of effectively testing those assumptions is being paranoid about competitors and dedicating time and resources to monitor and learn about industry changes he said.

Betting on bitcoin

Lynch's self-confessed paranoia is partly what drove him to invest in bitcoin earlier this year. He started to think deeply about how most of his life has been spent generating wealth for clients. He questioned what happens if the goalposts suddenly changed? What if dollars no longer become the way to measure success in 10 years' time?

While that may have seemed a crazy thought years ago bitcoin's continued dominance and persistence prompted Lynch to take a small position to hedge against potential disruption.

""I like to say that bitcoin is like Kenny from South Park he dies every episode and comes back again"" Lynch said. ""And so ... you see in the newspaper the media that bitcoin's dead it's over this time and it just continues to persist.""

In addition to bitcoin's persistence Lynch was drawn to viral mechanics of the asset and its ""anti-fragile"" qualities which led to it succeeding from disorder.

""It's highly speculative"" Lynch said. ""Having said that there's some interesting qualities to it that I think that can add to a portfolio. And I think you don't get in trouble making investments if you size them properly … so I like the idea here that you can bet small win big.""

A stock-picker at heart

Lynch is a stock-picker at heart but even he's finding it tricky to invest in the current environment.

""We don't see any great opportunity here in equities"" Lynch said. ""Part of the issue is: what are you gonna do with your money? … We're trying to figure out what we would do and there just aren't a lot of great alternatives.""

Overall Lynch is leaning more towards smaller companies because they have room to grow.

""I think when you start having trillion and $2 trillion valuations a lot can go wrong"" Lynch said. ""If anything goes wrong it's a lot of market cap to be able to support through your fundamentals ... And as you get that big we're already seeing the other issue there which is regulation.""

One company Lynch is still bullish on despite significant growth is Zoom. His team invested in Zoom at the IPO stage and he still holds it because of how widely it's been adopted and how its competitors are still lagging.

Alternatively Tesla was one of the team's early bets that it no longer holds. Like bitcoin Tesla was a small speculative position based on initial consumer reports. However after holding for three years Lynch became uncomfortable with the capital intensity of the business.

""It does put you in a position of potentially during times of uncertainty 'relying on the kindness of strangers' and to continue the business model"" Lynch said.

Electric vehicle bull and top performing fund manager Cathie Wood views Tesla as more than a car company but Lynch struggles to get past this.

""Elon Musk is very controversial he's done a lot of really amazing things and I think he should get credit for that"" Lynch said. ""Having said that when you're when you rely on capital markets and you're dreaming big there's a fine line between inspiring and making promises maybe you can't keep and that can go badly from the ability to have access to capital required to sustain what Tesla's doing.""

There's no doubt she gained attention years ago after she took over ownership of the home with the the high-profile plant turned perennial decoration.

Whether it was wrapped in white cloth like a mummy for Halloween wearing a Santa hat for Christmas or decked out in Texas Tech gear ahead of a big game the bush in Robinson's front yard was a tradition that she continued after acquiring the house more than seven years ago.

But the one-time cancer survivor had previously told the Avalanche-Journal the message she wanted to be known for was one of hope even when facing life-threatening challenges.

In a breast cancer survivor's profile she shared in the A-J ahead of Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October 2012 the woman who made a living as a financial advisor acknowledged her journey with breast cancer wasn't over.

At the time Robinson said she was hopeful her story would be able to inspire others.

""I definitely don’t think this journey is over though"" said said as she marked two years as a breast cancer survivor in 2012. ""I feel that I am a survivor for a reason so I want to help other women either by preventing breast cancer from ever happening to them or to be a friend to lean on and talk to for those women who may be facing their own journeys.""

Ultimately cancer would return and take her life with Robinson's family confirming she died early Wednesday this week. She was 47.

Robinson was asked how breast cancer had changed her or her outlook on life back in the 2012 profile.

""More than ever I believe in living each day to the fullest because you never know what tomorrow may bring"" she said. ""I have made some changes to my diet and lifestyle so that hopefully I can be the best version of me for as long as my friends and family can stand me. I really try not to dwell on the small things as much anymore and if I can make at least one person smile or laugh a day then I’ve done my job.""

Later she would acquire the house with the famous bush and told the Avalanche-Journal in 2019 she had committed to continuing the tradition.

At that time she told the A-J passersby were loving the shrub’s mummy with white cloth wrappings and glowing orange eyes. She recalled buying the house with the understanding that keeping a smile on the bush’s face was important. The house came with some of the costumes the previous owner used like a pumpkin and Santa hat toppers.

“It’s grown a lot since I moved in so he’s outgrown some of his little costumes” Robinson told the A-J.

Tracy Moreno the owner of Lawn Pros who has helped maintain the bush shared a message in Robinson's honor in a GoFundMe account this week.

""...I would like for everyone that sees this post to say a prayer for her family and share the love we all had for her"" Moreno wrote. ""I still plan to continue decorating the bush in her honor! She lost her battle to cancer but is no longer hurting and has been healed completely. Thank you Alison for being a great friend.""

Robinson's family will celebrate her life with a fellowship and remembrance from 5 to 7 p.m. Sunday at Lake Ridge Chapel and Memorial Designers followed by a funeral service at 2 p.m. Monday.

The family invites people to visit www.memorialdesigners.net to view the live-streamed service sign her virtual guestbook and download her memorial keepsake folder.

Robinson a Denver City native lived in Plains until 1983 when her family moved to Slaton where she graduated from high school in 1992 according to the obituary provided by her family. After living in Dallas for a time she returned to the South Plains to attend Texas Tech where she began her pursuit of a masters of business administration which she earned in 2004.

She worked for The Lubbock Apartment Association from 2004 until 2007. From 2007 until her passing she worked at Morgan Stanley as a Financial Advisor.

""Alison had a great many joys in her life including spending time with her children and grandchild going to music festivals and concerts having a variety of small odd-looking pets getting her siblings on board for things they weren't sure about but had a good time doing anyway and having a wide circle of friends"" the obituary reads. ""She had few regrets two being never getting her pet pig and tiny goat.""

While this is only true depending on who you ask some bicycle manufacturers and innovators are still hard at work tinkering with bicycle design. Take No. 22 Bicycle Company’s ingenious coupler system as the perfect example of what happening in the bicycle industry.

Photo: No. 22 Bicycle Company

Photo: No. 22 Bicycle Company

When I first saw the cover photo you’ve just witnessed I had so many questions I just couldn’t help myself to find out what the heck is going on. After all it’s not everyday you see a bike “broken” in half and being sold as an industry benchmark.What you’re looking at is a coupler design and system that allows you to take apart your bike as if it’s built from Lego pieces and transport it while taking up as little space as possible. The company behind this system is No. 22 Bicycle Company  a crew of bicycle manufacturers designers engineers and craftsmen with the goal of creating high-grade titanium bikes ; it’s what the ‘22’ represents in their name titanium’s atomic number.However this new coupler system is not limited to just one bike from this crew’s lineup and can be applied across the board clearly only to No. 22 rides. As mentioned the idea behind it was to reduce a full-size bike to an easily transportable package able to fit in a suitcase.To achieve this No. 22 has created the coupler system you have before you. Simply put the top tube and down tube both break apart and separate the bike down the middle. Now coupler systems do exist but No. 22 looked to make things simpler in the process creating a system that requires nothing but an Allen wrench to put together.All you’ve got to do is introduce the wrench into a screw head give it a few twists remove the bolt and the frame breaks apart. From here the only other thing you’ve got to worry about is disconnecting the internally routed brake line.In order for this system to work fluidly and effortlessly No. 22 had to rethink the brake lines as well. In doing so they’ve come up with a “Brake Break” feature that decouples the brake line just as easily as the frame with a twist of the wrist.Now one question I had popped up in my mind was as to how safe this system may be. Looking closely at the coupling areas themselves with a tad of engineering knowledge you can figure out the riding a bike with this feature shouldn’t raise any alarms or signals as there’s no place for your frame to swivel or pull apart as you ride.What the team also focused on was making this entire setup as seamless as possible. If you have a look at the video below and some of the images in the gallery you can see how tight everything is once the bike is put back together. If you run your hands over this segment you shouldn’t feel any changes.Again this specific coupler is only available to No. 22 machines. Just to get an idea of how much you’ll have to spend to get one some of their bikes can reach into the $12000 (€10240 at current exchange rates) range depending on the sort of drivetrain you ask for.Frankly if they ever chose to sell the rights to this system it’s possible they’d be pulling in quite a bit of dough for the company. Heck after seeing this idea in action I felt that my own bike needs a system like this. Just think of the things you can do with a bicycle that can break down into just a few main parts.",,,,,,,,,

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of September 17 2021

Jason Hall: Let's go ahead and talk about Medallia. Nick this is a company that's in the middle of being acquired right?

Nicholas Rossolillo: Yeah it sure is. They are being taken private by private equity firm Thoma Bravo which does a lot in the tech sector. Medallia competes with a company called Qualtrics (NASDAQ: XM). Maybe that's a more familiar name. They help with the customer. Basically they measure when someone logs on to an app or interacts with the business on the internet. They measure the quality of the interaction and help businesses find ways to improve that interaction in various ways. So yeah. They're being taken private though. I think the second-quarter earnings results are not super helpful. But they are being acquired for $34 per share in cash. If you happen to own Medallia the stock is trading for basically that right now. So not a lot of upside there. I think the last news item to keep track of they did have a go-shop period that ended on Sept. 4. No one else came to the table with a higher offer by Sept. 4. So now this offer from Thoma Bravo is kind of what shareholders would need to vote on whether or not to approve this to go forward.

Hall: I'm going to share a chart here to just show you. It's pretty obvious when the deal was announced right here. The stock price just looked like a scary EKG and then it just flatlined right there. So I think some helpful thought here about this company because I know it's been recommended in a couple of portfolios. And there's probably some investors trying to decide what to do. And I just want to throw some insights out here that I think can be handy.

Clay Nick I'm going to put you guys on the spot here. I'm going to ask you to think about if you were an investor that owned Medallia and you're going to sell what would you do with that capital? What would you buy? We're just going to have a little fun and let you guys think about it while I just offer some thoughts here?

So this is a stock that was for members both times it was recommended it was back in 2019. Most members who bought it based on a portfolio recommendation did it more than a year ago. But if you've transacted in it within the past 12 months here are the implications for what you might want to think about deciding what to do. It's being taken private. You're just going to get cash. You can wait till the transaction closes with all your cash. Key there are some brokerage accounts are going to charge you a fee because they can so wait. If your brokerage is one of those and they charge you a lower trading fee or no trading fee it might be smart to just go ahead and sell. The other thing too is there's a little bit -- what's the buyout price Nick?

Rossolillo: Thirty-four dollars per share.

Hall: Thirty-four? I think we're actually above that right now. I think it's trading for a premium. No it's just below it's $33.91. There's just a little bit of a discount which is normal. The closer we get to the close the more of the price will move closer and closer to it. If you're looking to squeeze every penny out that you can the incentive is to wait as close to the deal as you can. But what you have to think about if you've transacted anytime in the past 12 months is what are the tax implications. If you own this in a taxable account and you bought it and you're going to profit -- let's say you're going to profit -- and you've held it for less than a year -- this is for U.S. investors -- and you sell it at a profit your gains are going to be taxed at your marginal income tax rate. For most of us that's higher than 15% which is the long-term capital gains rate. For anybody that's close to that point of being able to get over a year it's beneficial to do that because instead of paying your marginal income tax rate you pay 15% for most folks. If you're in the highest tax bracket you'd be paying like a 39% marginal rate. You pay a 20% capital gains rate. There's some tax arbitrage to think about in terms of when to transact.

There might be some investors that bought this year that are going to lose money. Then you're just thinking about capturing that tax loss. At this point I think that's the largest thing to think about. Besides do you have an idea of what you're going to do with that capital? Do you have something in mind to do when you deploy it? Clay you're not muted. Give us an idea.

Clay Bruning: Yeah. Just to give you a little bit of my personal modus operandi when it comes to this is when I see it's an all-cash deal I personally have no reason why I would sit on it. In this case so you had 10 shares it's 9 cents off that transaction price -- you're missing out on 90 cents. At a certain point there's an opportunity cost of deploying that capital in a different situation and I will use the Slack and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) acquisition for example -- that's a situation where I know I'm going to get shares of Salesforce and assuming at the time I didn't believe in that acquisition that's a transaction where I'm willing to wait so I can ensure that I guess those Salesforce shares rather than increasing my portfolio turnover or anything like that -- in terms of what I would do like I said I would certainly sell the shares rather than saving a couple of pennies or a couple of dollars. I think it depends if you want to stay in the same space.

But one interesting name to me that I've recently caught up with them is Fulgent Genetics (NASDAQ: FLGT). It's a very small-cap company I think under $3 billion. They spent a million dollars to create a COVID test last March. That has since generated probably at this point close to a billion dollars in revenues for them.

Hall: It's incredible yeah.

Bruning: Just if you ever want to study return on invested capital take a look at Fulgent Genetics in terms of their COVID test. It's absolutely incredible. Then their core business which is more so genetics testing is making very nice strides. I think they grew their genetic testing something like 250% last quarter. They just acquired complementary business in oncology to have more diagnostics excuse me on the cancer side of things.

This is a very young company. Like I said I think they are around $3 billion or less at this point in terms of total market cap. That's one that I've really been keeping my eye on especially when you have testing seemingly coming back quite nicely with that and having more mandates on vaccines and testing and stuff like that. You have schools recently reopening and they have a bunch of school contracts. That's one of my favorite names right now that I'm watching and hoping to add to in the coming weeks.

Hall: I think you can look past the COVID testing as its business and think about it as a perfect model of how good their IP is at developing and acting really quickly. You look at their core business and it's growing it's doubling. Their core business outside of that one COVID test has been so cash-rich it's wonderful. I love this business for the next 20 years. I love that. Nick you've got a 60-second pitch for us on one?

Rossolillo: Sure. I already mentioned Qualtrics. If you want to stay in the experience management space selling Medallia Qualtrics had its IPO early this year. It has a pretty young track record of providing financial quarterly updates for shareholders. But so far it's growing at a much more fast pace than Medallia was. It's a bigger business too is the leader in that -- standalone leader in software-based experience management. Yeah if you're just looking for a like type of replacement that's where I'll start.

Hall: It's an easy ticker to remember too. XM experienced management. That's cool.

The current Sarcos management team including chairman and CEO Ben Wolff will continue to lead the company. The company’s new board of directors will be comprised of current and former leaders from Apple The Boeing Company Credit Suisse Delta Air Lines Microsoft Nextel and the U.S. Department of Defense.

“The growing shortage of skilled workers that are able to conduct physically demanding tasks is a critical problem for companies industries and the global economy” said Ben Wolff chairman and CEO Sarcos. “Sarcos has a unique opportunity to usher in a new age of human and machine collaboration by deploying a fleet of its highly dexterous mobile robotic systems that augment humans rather than replace them. We think we can put a meaningful dent in the skilled labor shortage challenges by enabling skilled workers and the companies they work for to be more productive and safer across a wide range of industries for those jobs where automation is not feasible. Consummation of the business combination with Rotor will help ensure that Sarcos has the resources we need to realize our vision for a safer and more productive industrial workforce of the future.”

“We are delighted that our shareholders have approved our business combination with Sarcos” said Stefan Selig Chairman of Rotor. “We look forward to watching Ben and the rest of the management team execute on their plans to bring highly dexterous mobile robotic systems to unstructured work environments while providing a viable solution to the global labor shortage and enabling the workforce of the future.”

With this combination only Rex Bionics will remain privately held out of the original exoskeleton developers that have heralded exo technology. Sarcos will join these other major exoskeleton manufacturers on the stock market:

The SPAC deal would give Polestar a valuation of $20 billion.

The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday citing people familiar with the deal that the SPAC agreement was imminent. TechCrunch has updated the article to reflect information in the official announcement. Once the merger closes the combined company will be held by a new public company named Polestar Automotive Holding UK Limited. The company is expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “PSNY.”

Polestar falls under Volvo Car Group’s electric performance brand but both Polestar and Volvo are owned by Chinese car maker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.

With this announcement Polestar joins a hoard of other EV and EV-related companies to go SPAC over the last two years including Arrival Nikola EVgo Proterra Lucid Motors Bird and many more.

Polestar aims to create a life cycle assessment framework for the electric car manufacturing industry one in which the entire manufacturing sales and end-of-life process is so transparent and traceable that the company can create carbon-neutral vehicles. The automaker announced its plans in June to manufacture its first SUV the Polestar 3 in the United States production of which is expected to begin globally in 2022. High quality parts and a manufacturing facility in the States are not cheap endeavors. If the reports are true going public might be a way for Polestar to get the funds needed to achieve its goals.

The deal would also help the automaker get to market in the U.S. faster so Polestar could compete with Tesla. The automaker has positioned its Polestar 2 a sedan as a better car than the Tesla but it’ll need the capital in order to make it the same sort of household name in the EV industry and one that’s trustworthy. Last year Polestar had to recall all of its global vehicles over faulty components.

The SPAC company Gores Guggenheim raised $800 million in a March IPO and Bloomberg reported it was in talks with Polestar in July.",,,,,,

It was originally published on March 10 2018.

Netflix offers thousands of titles for viewing on demand but its library of available content changes on a regular basis. Although you’ll always be able to watch Netflix Originals which the streaming giant produces in-house syndicated videos that come from other television and movie studios have set expiration dates. You don’t want to find an episode you were about to watch has disappeared unexpectedly or miss watching one of your favorite films because you never realized it had become available. Here’s how to keep track of what’s coming to and leaving Netflix.

Netflix

Ironically Netflix is not the best source for telling you it actually has available. However it does have a couple tricks you can use to learn about new content. For information about soon-to-expire titles on the other hand you’ll need a third-party service (we’ve listed some good ones below). Netflix doesn’t share this data within its own menus possibly to avoid drawing attention to how frequently videos rotate out.

Through Netflix you can visit its “new and popular” page which shares titles freshly added to the streaming service the most popular shows and movies and what’s coming soon.

[Related: Hack Netflix with these add-ons and tricks]

Confusingly you can also visit a separate recently-added page. This gives you a similar list of titles but sorts them into clearer sections including Netflix’s genre categories and what’s popular with other users.

There are a couple other ways to find new content but neither is ideal. You can regularly look up your favorites with Netflix’s integrated search tool but this is time-consuming and easy to forget about. Alternatively you can follow Netflix on Twitter an account that shares some new titles as they join the library. However it doesn’t tweet about every new addition.

Once you discover a new movie or show you want to see you should remind yourself to watch it before it expires. So save it to your personal list: Click the Add to My List button (the plus icon) that appears as one of the options when you hover over the title. If you start every visit to Netflix on this page you won’t forget about the content you need to catch.

Reelgood

Third-party services actually do the best job of informing you about available content. For example the well-organized database Reelgood provides a straightforward catalog of everything currently on Netflix HBO Disney Plus Hulu and Amazon Prime Video.

Crucially for our purposes this site has specific sections for new arrivals content that’s coming soon and titles that are about to leave Netflix. Each is sorted by week so you can plan your viewing in advance. You can also search for specific keywords or filter the list by genre year of release or viewer rating.

While anyone can check out the site (or the app version free for Android and iOS) we recommend you register for a free account to keep up with library changes. Account holders can bookmark shows and movies they want to see and receive alerts when Netflix adds new episodes of favorite shows.

New On Netflix

New On Netflix is similar to Reelgood in that it offers a full catalog of everything currently on Netflix which you can browse by genre release year and rating. To avoid surprises it shows each title’s expiration date when this information becomes available. The service also includes a list of newly added content and for ongoing television shows it displays the launch date when a new season will show up.

How do the two compare? Well New on Netflix lets you search the database by additional parameters such as title or actor. For each item you can also check out comprehensive individual listings which give you just as many details as Netflix does including a description cast list and run time. However it lacks Reelgood’s visual polish and it only deals with Netflix.

Overall you can’t go wrong with either option. Like Reelgood New On Netflix lets you sign up for email updates that will inform you about new expiration dates and removals and alert you when content that interests you becomes available. Alternatively you can get updates on new arrivals by plugging the service’s RSS feed into your favorite reader.

Flixable

As we mentioned earlier Netflix’s built-in search tool leaves much to be desired. If you prefer an intuitive search engine to an update-sending service you might choose Flixable over options like Reelgood and New On Netflix. It lets you search by genre rating and year with ease. Plus the search results come back with the titles that are newest to Netflix right at the top of the list.

Flixable also includes valuable information about each title on its list. You can see how popular something is on Netflix the average rating it receives and the genres you might use to categorize it.

On top of its search capabilities Flixable boasts a clean and easy-to-navigate interface with separate pages for new arrivals and upcoming departures. The opening page displays the movies that showed up recently and from here you can click to individual pages of new TV shows or soon-to-leave content.

The following post discusses important plot points and the ending of ""Midnight Mass"" so beware if you haven't seen it yet.

Don’t look now old-school horror fiends but “Midnight Mass” just reinvented the vampire.

Creator Mike Flanagan’s newest Netflix series (streaming now) about religion addiction and redemption centers on a remote Crockett Island where miracles supernatural occurrences and a new priest create a fervor of faith that’s not entirely positive. Essential to that is another introduction the arrival of The Angel a vampiric winged figure whose blood Father Paul (Hamish Linklater) feeds to townspeople during the Catholic mass and creates a horde of Christian bloodsuckers that a nonfundamentalist faction has to stop before they can leave and begin a larger crusade on the mainland.

The show is “like a seven-episode ‘A-ha!’ moment” Linklater says.

The vampiric connection was one Flanagan made in grade school growing up in the church “always blinking out at me to the point that I would get in trouble for bringing it up frequently” he says. “It's the backbone of communion: ‘Drink from me and live forever.’

“When you’re an eighth-grader you don't have an adult understanding of the faith. We would try frequently to relate it to things we did understand and what I understood growing up was movies and books and comics” Flanagan explains. “So when you say ‘Yes you drink the blood and you get eternal life’ that reminds me of something else that I can relate because I just saw ‘The Monster Squad’ and I'm pretty sure the guy in that did the same thing.”

'Midnight Mass' gets emotional in one fiery moment

The major reveal midway through “Midnight Mass” gives way to a pivotal gut-wrenching fifth episode that walks the audience through the show’s mythology marks the ending of one main character’s story and begins the rise of the show’s primary heroine.

Riley Flynn (Zach Gilford) is a “Crock Pot” native back home after serving a four-year sentence for killing a young woman while driving drunk. Once an altar boy and now an atheist he reluctantly forms a bond with Father Paul but is killed by the Angel and turned into a vampire.

The fifth episode focuses on the conversation between the pastor explaining too him all that’s happened – and revealing to Riley that he is in fact the 80-year-old Monsignor Phillip he’s known his whole life just reverted back to his younger vampiric “best state.” “It feels like a Shaw play” Linklater says “because it is an hour-long argument to an end place that goes in such exciting byways and sideways and off-ramps.""

And Riley shares all that new info to his childhood love Erin (Kate Siegel). He takes her out at night into the middle of the water in a boat to watch the sunrise sacrificing himself to tell her what she needs to know to save the island. In a final scene both bittersweet and heartbreaking Riley sees the girl he killed and takes her hand to move on to the afterlife and it quickly flashes to Riley’s body bursting into flames and Erin screaming and sobbing in horror for more than a minute.

For that moment Siegel researched “how long it takes the human body to burn” she says. “I tried to really tap into physically what that experience would be like for Erin the smell what she was seeing the sun rising the overwhelming sense of ‘Oh God make it stop.’ And then Mike makes this brilliant choice and lets the scream continue over the credits so the audience gets a sense of how long this will take.”

Kate Siegel Zach Gilford embrace their 'Midnight' finales

In the aftermath Erin – who by this point has not only lost a baby due to all the supernatural goings-on but now also her true love – “turns what was just like the (worst) thing to ever happen on a boat into a heroic moment” Siegel says.

""Erin along the way really became the voice of someone who is quietly spiritual quietly intellectual quietly empathetic but in her actions she's special"" adds producer Trevor Macy. ""There should be more Erins in the world.""

In her dying moment in the final episode – after the heinous plans of villainous zealot Bev Keane (Samantha Sloyan) have been defeated – Erin visits with Riley and delivers an elegiac monologue about God and human existence. “Her seeing Riley there whole and beautiful to escort her into whatever comes next she is also realizing that that happened for him. And that it didn't hurt.”

Gilford filmed his death scene on his second day of work and recalls watching it for the first time with his wife actress Kiele Sanchez. “I was really happy that she cried” he says. “I was definitely insecure about it. It's not hard to watch yourself burn up but it's nice that your wife doesn't like watching it. And then I even tried to make out with her and she was like ‘Whoa I just watched you go up in flames.’ ”

But Gilford wasn’t bummed to miss out on doing any cool vampire stuff. “The next two episodes they're shooting all night in the cold (and) the rain and I'm at home with my family” he says. “I don't have to put wet sticky gross fake blood on me. I had the best part in the show for that reason alone.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMS90di9uZXdzL3RoZS13aXRjaGVyLXJlbmV3ZWQtc2Vhc29uLTMtdHJhaWxlci1zcGlub2ZmLTEyMzUwNzM1ODcv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIxL3R2L25ld3MvdGhlLXdpdGNoZXItcmVuZXdlZC1zZWFzb24tMy10cmFpbGVyLXNwaW5vZmYtMTIzNTA3MzU4Ny9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘The Witcher’ Renewed for Season 3 Expands Universe With New Projects,"“The Witcher” franchise took over the last stretch of Saturday’s Netflix promotional marathon “Tudum: A Netflix Global Fan Event” and fans were met with a ton of updates about the adventures of Geralt and his Witcher brethren.

Among the announcements the main “Witcher” series has been renewed for a third season ahead of the launch of Season 2 later this year.

Then two new clips from Season 2 were shared featuring a look at Kristofer Hivju’s monstrous character Nivellen and Ciri played by Freya Allan.





From there Netflix dropped the first behind-the-scenes look at the upcoming prequel series “The Witcher: Blood Origin” which will follow the creation of the first Witcher prototype as well as trace the events leading up to the “Conjunction of the Spheres.”

The streamer then announced its plans to fully develop the Witcherverse announcing a second anime feature following this summer’s “The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf” as well as a new kids and families series. Netflix also dropped a new trailer for Seasons 1 and 2 with some brand new footage of the upcoming sophomore outing.

Popular on Variety

“Witcher” star Henry Cavill previously spoke with Variety about what attracted him to the material.

“I’m a big fan of fantasy” he said. “I love the genre. My dad was reading it to me before I could read. This is just slightly different from your average fantasy genre. There’s something a bit more grim about it and I’ve been told that’s the Polish way. So there’s a heavy Polish influence. There’s just a harder edge which I found kind of fascinating. In the same way that in ‘Game of Thrones’ you didn’t know who was going to die in ‘The Witcher’ you can’t anticipate what’s going to happen because it is quite a grim world.”

“Tudum: A Netflix Global Fan Event” also included first looks and announcements from other Netflix series like “Stranger Things” “Umbrella Academy” and “Cowboy Bebop.”"

“But we can’t be complacent” said J.J. Ament the former CEO of the Metro Denver Economic Development Corp. and the new president and CEO of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce.

That’s why the Economic Development Corporation was determined to find the “secret sauce” that would distinguish metro Denver from other major metro areas striving to regain ground lost during the pandemic and expand. Even before the pandemic and ensuing recession in 2020 the EDC was working on a recipe to attract companies and workers alike.

The finished product unveiled Friday is “The Elevation Effect.” The logo three mountain peaks and accompanying marketing strategies were designed as a regional branding initiative to capitalize on what the EDC believes sets the Denver area apart: its workforce.

An analysis by the Myers-Briggs Co. known for its personality assessments produced the workforce profile that shaped the initiative said Amy Guttmann the EDC’s director of marketing and brand strategy.

Metro-Denver workers are aspirational collaborative creative supportive they set big goals and need to work with others around a shared vision according to patterns Myers-Briggs found. The company looked at about 30000 personality assessments previously taken by people in the nine-county metro area.

Information from the assessments were anonymous.

“We asked Myers-Briggs to help us figure out what we could talk about to companies beyond the idea that we’re the second most highly educated workforce in America (behind Massachusetts)” Guttmann said. “That is a great selling point we talk about it all the time but one of the things we know is that companies are focused on more than mere educational credentials.”

Companies want to know workers’ “soft skills” their digital skills and who they are as people Guttmann added.

When the EDC reviewed business pitches made by 16 other metro areas Guttmann said it found a “sea of sameness.” The analysis showed that economic development corporations sell their areas as good places to work live and play or as the next high-tech hub.

“We wanted to figure out how to talk about Denver in a way that breaks out of that sort of one-note cookie-cutter story line” Guttmann said. “What we can say is that we are wired as a business community and as a workforce to never settle. We work really hard to go after what we want.”

The staff named what it saw as the metro area’s distinguishing characteristics “The Elevation Effect” alluding to an attitude as well as the mountains and other natural assets that attract people seeking a good quality of life.

Ament who headed the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce’s economic development arm the past four-and-a-half years said the focus on workforce is important. He said the conventional wisdom used to be that workers went to where the jobs are.

“But I think it’s flipped” Ament said. “Post 9/11 I think it started. Post the Great Recession I think it accelerated. And I think it really took off (during) COVID.

“Talented and skilled workers degreed or not take a different assessment of how they want to live their life” Ament added “and that benefits Colorado and metro Denver because we’re a place where talented and skilled workers degreed or not want to be.”

Ament said the companies that want access to a talented workforce need to move to where those people are. He said the work the EDC staff has done on the new branding gives the region at least a two years’ head start on building back from the pandemic-related economic downturn.

Even during the pandemic the metro area added jobs Ament said. A report by the EDC shows that five of the nine industry groups the organization works with reported new jobs in 2020. Those include aerospace which grew 11.2%; financial services 1.1%; and information technology-software 8.9%.

“We weathered that storm about as well as you could hope for” Ament said. “That is not to say that there weren’t folks in our community that were severely dislocated and distressed.”

The EDC report shows that energy and natural resources contracted 4.6%. About 45% of the jobs lost were in leisure and hospitality and roughly 80% of the total jobs lost were in low-wage sectors according to the report. Ament said women and people of color were disproportionately affected.

The chamber of commerce has initiatives and teams working to help displaced or struggling workers Guttmann said. Those include programs for veterans small business development and leadership training.

Metro Denver business leaders sponsored a breakfast and panel discussion Friday with a team of site selectors people from large real estate and professional services firms that consult with corporations on places to expand or relocate.

“One of the fun things is the Friday morning breakfast” Ament said. “It’s a chance for our community to hear from professionals who don’t necessarily have a dog in the hunt to say what is great about us and where we need some improvement.”

Labor shortages and high housing prices are two areas Ament hears a lot about from business people. Employers across the spectrum say they have more jobs than they can fill.

The Denver area’s high housing prices put the region at a disadvantage with some of its competitors Ament said. “It’s not just an issue for us trying to recruit companies from somewhere else. How do we get companies that are already here to stay and grow here when their own folks particularly entry-level folks who are building careers can’t get into entry-level housing?”

Even the draw of the built-in natural assets has its limits when the outdoors can’t be enjoyed because of crowded mountain trails or wildfire smoke and smog obscuring mountain views and making outdoor activities unhealthy at times.

Business groups including the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce opposed a state program that would have required large employers to incentivize workers to reduce car travel to and from work. They said it should be voluntary.

State health officials recently withdrew the plan.

Ament said Denver’s air quality has long been a priority for the Denver chamber.

“We were instrumental in establishing the Regional Air Quality Council in 1989 and continue to participate in the council’s work” Ament said. “The chamber encourages members to take actions to improve air quality in ways that work best for their employees and companies.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA5LzI2L2FtZXJpc291cmNlYmVyZ2VuLW9wZW5zLW5ldy1ocS1pbi1jb25zaG9ob2NrZW4uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After 30 years in Chesterbrook AmerisourceBergen opens new headquarters in Conshohocken (PHOTOS ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2021/09/26/amerisourcebergen-opens-new-hq-in-conshohocken.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA5LzI2L2FtZXJpc291cmNlYmVyZ2VuLW9wZW5zLW5ldy1ocS1pbi1jb25zaG9ob2NrZW4uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3NhbXN1bmctcmVpbmZvcmNpbmctc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLWluLWFzaWEtdG8tZXhwYW5kLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tMTIxMDkyNjAwMTEyXzEuaHRtbNIBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9zYW1zdW5nLXJlaW5mb3JjaW5nLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbi1pbi1hc2lhLXRvLWV4cGFuZC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLTEyMTA5MjYwMDExMl8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung reinforcing supply chain in Asia to expand production,"Samsung Electronics is reinforcing its supply chain in Asia to meet increased demand of its products amid the pandemic industry insiders said as the South Korean tech giant eyes to build more plants and expand its workforce.

Creditors investors and suppliers of the embattled firm and its peers are top on traders’ impact list. Next up are companies with sizable revenue from China also in the spotlight due to the nation’s ongoing regulatory clampdown. Industrial stocks are a key focus for US market watchers while those in Europe are looking at miners.

Fears that an Evergrande collapse might spark financial contagion and curb growth in the Chinese economy roiled global markets on Monday. That anxiety moderated after the developer agreed to settle some local note interest payments but the problem is far from over with dollar bond holders yet to receive a coupon due.

Here are some of the stocks and sectors in traders’ sights:

Property Peers

Evergrande’s size coupled with Beijing’s tighter scrutiny of the real-estate sector will continue to have a significant bearing on property developers. The company has about 2 trillion yuan ($310 billion) in assets -- equivalent to 2% of China’s gross domestic product according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. calculations so any disposals could well disrupt the market.

Regardless of what happens to Evergrande China’s home prices are now at risk of “meaningful downside"" Citigroup Inc. says.

The Hang Seng Property Index dropped to its lowest in five years earlier this month. The 12-member gauge include Country Garden Holdings Co. which lost 25% since March-end and China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. which fell 16%.

Lenders and Investors

Shares of companies that have lent money to or invested in Chinese real-estate firms will remain volatile as traders mull the potential for a spike in bad loans and asset write-downs.

While policy makers are expected to provide support some banks may become victims Citigroup analysts including Judy Zhang wrote in a note on Wednesday.

Citi’s analysis of Chinese banks’ loan exposure to high-risk developers suggests credit risk is highest for China Minsheng Banking Corp. Ping An Bank Co. and China Everbright Bank Co. It sees Bank of Nanjing Co. Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank Co. and Postal Savings Bank of China Co. as less vulnerable.

China Banks Downplay Risks After Evergrande Missed Payments

While Chinese insurers have factored in concerns about potential impairment losses PICC Group’s enterprise value would be hit most among mainland-listed insurance companies in a worst case scenario. That’s followed by Ping An Insurance Group Co. according to Citi’s Michelle Ma in a note on Thursday.

Asian Suppliers

Suppliers of building materials and appliances to Evergrande’s projects will be closely scrutinized to assess how much the indebted property developer owes them and what its rise and fall may mean for recurring earnings.

Shares of Evergrande units such as Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd. -- which have halved this year -- and China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd. -- which are down over 90% -- also remain on watch.

U.S. Industrials

Any restructuring that weighs on the world’s second-largest economy will have ripple effects through the most economically-sensitive and globalized stocks in America. Industrial firms often seen as bellwethers for the U.S. economy’s health may take the hardest hit.

U.S. industrial manufacturers have an around 10% of sales exposure to China according to estimates from JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Stephen Tusa. Stocks to watch include General Electric Co. Otis Worldwide Corp. and Honeywell International Inc. as well as heavy construction and equipment maker Caterpillar Inc.

European Miners

In Europe Evergrande’s crisis is reverberating across the basic materials stocks.

China accounts for 62% of revenue at BHP Group Plc. 58% at Rio Tinto Plc and nearly half at Anglo American Plc and Glencore Plc according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Cement makers like HeidelbergCement AG as well as building suppliers including Kone OYJ and Schindler Holding AG may be directly affected by the Evergrande fallout according to strategists at Liberum.

“F*** you!” Mitch spat angrily every time host Scott Cam revealed one of the scores for their kitchen.

“I’m supposed to listen to them? Go f*** yourselves!” Mitch ranted.

“I’m not interested in their feedback. Their feedback is irrelevant.”

Adding fuel to the fire Mitch and Mark were fuming that (once again) Luke’s fiancé Olivia had been on site helping the Love Islanders get ready for room reveals.

Olivia was filmed helping the twins clean and style their kitchen ahead of judging – a clear breach of the rules. She did the same thing in master bedroom week. On neither occasion did her assistance effect the scores or even come up on judgment day – a bone of contention with Mitch and Mark.

“The boys (twins Josh and Luke) brought in help last night that Scotty clearly knows about because its all on camera and yet it has no impact” Mitch fumed to a producer. “So this is absolutely a farce.”

Despite their palpable rage Mitch and Mark were still good sports about Kirsty and Jesse’s victory.

The country musicians took home $120000 in prizes for their navy blue and gold kitchen which wowed the judges enough for Neale and Shaynna to each give it a perfect score. Darren scored them a 9.5 because they didn’t include a second bin in their expansive gingham butler’s pantry.

“My [arm] hair is standing on end that’s how perfectly they have done the five-zone kitchen in this space” Darren said using the opportunity to showcase his sculpted arms.

A bald Neale joked his hair was also standing on end because the room was “everything he wanted to see and feel in a kitchen”.

Given the overwhelmingly positive feedback from the judges for Kirsty and Jesse’s efforts Ronnie and Georgia wisely elected to hold on to their golden gnome to use at a later date when a bonus point would guarantee them the win.

Unfortunately Ronnie and Georgia’s neutral and impeccably styled kitchen was let down by yet another small cupboard.

The couple made the same mistake with their walk-in-robe in master bedroom which ultimately cost them the win and saw them having to redo it.

The judges were also underwhelmed by the size of the twins’ cupboards saying it was “more of a walk-in pantry than a butler’s” Which in design speak is the ultimate kitchen insult.

While they were wowed by the colour and style of Tanya and Vito’s pink and terrazzo kitchen the couple lost a lot of points for their functionality.

Neale said of their unusual design choices: “This is a kitchen that says love me or hate me but don’t ignore me.”

Shaynna noted the fridge was in the wrong place there was no bin and too much of their impressive terrazzo benchtop had been given over to sinks and cooktops leaving little room for people to sit at or prepare food.

“It makes me sick because they imported this [stone bench] and it is stunning but there’s no way to do anything different with that” Darren lamented.

Of course they saved their harshest words for Mitch and Mark describing their decision to store dry food in drawers as “dumb”.

“The comments are stupid. I have no respect for the judges so I shouldn’t let somebody hurt me that I have no respect for” Mitch said as Mark emphasised that they would not be implementing any of their suggestions.

Bring on tomorrow’s house tours because no doubt Mitch and Mark will have a lot to say about their competitors’ kitchens if they don’t like what they see.

“But we can’t be complacent” said J.J. Ament the former CEO of the Metro Denver Economic Development Corp. and the new president and CEO of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce.

That’s why the Economic Development Corporation was determined to find the “secret sauce” that would distinguish metro Denver from other major metro areas striving to regain ground lost during the pandemic and expand. Even before the pandemic and ensuing recession in 2020 the EDC was working on a recipe to attract companies and workers alike.

The finished product unveiled Friday is “The Elevation Effect.” The logo three mountain peaks and accompanying marketing strategies were designed as a regional branding initiative to capitalize on what the EDC believes sets the Denver area apart: its workforce.

An analysis by the Myers-Briggs Co. known for its personality assessments produced the workforce profile that shaped the initiative said Amy Guttmann the EDC’s director of marketing and brand strategy.

Metro-Denver workers are aspirational collaborative creative supportive they set big goals and need to work with others around a shared vision according to patterns Myers-Briggs found. The company looked at about 30000 personality assessments previously taken by people in the nine-county metro area.

Information from the assessments were anonymous.

“We asked Myers-Briggs to help us figure out what we could talk about to companies beyond the idea that we’re the second most highly educated workforce in America (behind Massachusetts)” Guttmann said. “That is a great selling point we talk about it all the time but one of the things we know is that companies are focused on more than mere educational credentials.”

Companies want to know workers’ “soft skills” their digital skills and who they are as people Guttmann added.

When the EDC reviewed business pitches made by 16 other metro areas Guttmann said it found a “sea of sameness.” The analysis showed that economic development corporations sell their areas as good places to work live and play or as the next high-tech hub.

“We wanted to figure out how to talk about Denver in a way that breaks out of that sort of one-note cookie-cutter story line” Guttmann said. “What we can say is that we are wired as a business community and as a workforce to never settle. We work really hard to go after what we want.”

The staff named what it saw as the metro area’s distinguishing characteristics “The Elevation Effect” alluding to an attitude as well as the mountains and other natural assets that attract people seeking a good quality of life.

Ament who headed the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce’s economic development arm the past four-and-a-half years said the focus on workforce is important. He said the conventional wisdom used to be that workers went to where the jobs are.

“But I think it’s flipped” Ament said. “Post 9/11 I think it started. Post the Great Recession I think it accelerated. And I think it really took off (during) COVID.

“Talented and skilled workers degreed or not take a different assessment of how they want to live their life” Ament added “and that benefits Colorado and metro Denver because we’re a place where talented and skilled workers degreed or not want to be.”

Ament said the companies that want access to a talented workforce need to move to where those people are. He said the work the EDC staff has done on the new branding gives the region at least a two years’ head start on building back from the pandemic-related economic downturn.

Even during the pandemic the metro area added jobs Ament said. A report by the EDC shows that five of the nine industry groups the organization works with reported new jobs in 2020. Those include aerospace which grew 11.2%; financial services 1.1%; and information technology-software 8.9%.

“We weathered that storm about as well as you could hope for” Ament said. “That is not to say that there weren’t folks in our community that were severely dislocated and distressed.”

The EDC report shows that energy and natural resources contracted 4.6%. About 45% of the jobs lost were in leisure and hospitality and roughly 80% of the total jobs lost were in low-wage sectors according to the report. Ament said women and people of color were disproportionately affected.

The chamber of commerce has initiatives and teams working to help displaced or struggling workers Guttmann said. Those include programs for veterans small business development and leadership training.

Metro Denver business leaders sponsored a breakfast and panel discussion Friday with a team of site selectors people from large real estate and professional services firms that consult with corporations on places to expand or relocate.

“One of the fun things is the Friday morning breakfast” Ament said. “It’s a chance for our community to hear from professionals who don’t necessarily have a dog in the hunt to say what is great about us and where we need some improvement.”

Labor shortages and high housing prices are two areas Ament hears a lot about from business people. Employers across the spectrum say they have more jobs than they can fill.

The Denver area’s high housing prices put the region at a disadvantage with some of its competitors Ament said. “It’s not just an issue for us trying to recruit companies from somewhere else. How do we get companies that are already here to stay and grow here when their own folks particularly entry-level folks who are building careers can’t get into entry-level housing?”

Even the draw of the built-in natural assets has its limits when the outdoors can’t be enjoyed because of crowded mountain trails or wildfire smoke and smog obscuring mountain views and making outdoor activities unhealthy at times.

Business groups including the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce opposed a state program that would have required large employers to incentivize workers to reduce car travel to and from work. They said it should be voluntary.

State health officials recently withdrew the plan.

Ament said Denver’s air quality has long been a priority for the Denver chamber.

“We were instrumental in establishing the Regional Air Quality Council in 1989 and continue to participate in the council’s work” Ament said. “The chamber encourages members to take actions to improve air quality in ways that work best for their employees and companies.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA5LzI2L2FtZXJpc291cmNlYmVyZ2VuLW9wZW5zLW5ldy1ocS1pbi1jb25zaG9ob2NrZW4uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After 30 years in Chesterbrook AmerisourceBergen opens new headquarters in Conshohocken (PHOTOS ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2021/09/26/amerisourcebergen-opens-new-hq-in-conshohocken.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA5LzI2L2FtZXJpc291cmNlYmVyZ2VuLW9wZW5zLW5ldy1ocS1pbi1jb25zaG9ob2NrZW4uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3NhbXN1bmctcmVpbmZvcmNpbmctc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLWluLWFzaWEtdG8tZXhwYW5kLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tMTIxMDkyNjAwMTEyXzEuaHRtbNIBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9zYW1zdW5nLXJlaW5mb3JjaW5nLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbi1pbi1hc2lhLXRvLWV4cGFuZC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLTEyMTA5MjYwMDExMl8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung reinforcing supply chain in Asia to expand production,"Samsung Electronics is reinforcing its supply chain in Asia to meet increased demand of its products amid the pandemic industry insiders said as the South Korean tech giant eyes to build more plants and expand its workforce.

Senate Health Policy Chair Manny Diaz made waves this week when he suggested his committee could reopen the book on vaccine mandates.

Not to reconsider his and other GOP lawmakers’ opposition to the policy requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination to attend school or hold a government job — that’s pretty much locked in under current state laws and executive orders with some facing legal challenges.

Instead Diaz indicated his committee would “review” the current list of vaccines required for children to enroll in day care prekindergarten or K-12 schools.

The list includes shots that have been around for decades.

The Greatest Generation were earning their diplomas when the combination shot for diphtheria tetanus and pertussis debuted. And many a boomer remembers lining up for a sugar cube wetted by the polio vaccine (it’s administered as an injection these days).

Public health experts estimate those vaccines and others on the list have saved millions of lives collectively with little downside.

Diaz acknowledged as much noting they were in a separate class from the COVID-19 vaccines.

“I think there’s a distinction when you have something that is proven to work and doesn’t have any side effects” Diaz said.

Still the backlash was fast and fierce.

The comments section for the Florida Politics+ original and its reprints were septic tanks of four-letter-word-laden rebukes. While less profane some of the Hialeah Republican’s Senate colleagues — mostly Democrats — were equally incensed.

“I’m in utter disbelief. Not only would this be dangerous but it’s a move to motivate the anti-vax base. When was the last time we saw cases of measles mumps or even chickenpox?? VACCINES WORK” Miami Democratic Sen. Annette Taddeo tweeted.

It appears the was received as Diaz walked back the review plan.

“I in no way shape or form intend to change the existing vaccination statutes for Florida schoolchildren” he told Florida Politics on Friday.

But he’s not backing down on the COVID-19 vaccine which U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona supports making a requirement for eligible schoolchildren.

“However I will stand on the side of freedom and the state retaining its power to review any emergency vaccination use imposed by the federal government” he said. “I do believe a review is necessary if and when any new government-mandated vaccinations are introduced.”

Take 5

The “Takeaway 5” — the Top 5 stories from the week that was:

Texas-style heartbeat abortion bill filed — Republican Rep. Webster Barnaby has filed a bill that would ban abortions after a fetus develops a heartbeat legislation party leaders have been working on since the U.S. Supreme Court let a similar bill take effect in Texas. Like the Texas law Barnaby’s bill circumvents abortion law precedent by putting the onus of enforcement on private individuals not state law enforcement. Most women aren’t aware they are pregnant by the time a fetus develops a heartbeat. And tying sounds from a fetus to a heartbeat is “misleading” medical experts said. Democrats resoundingly criticized Republicans for bringing the measure forward. Gov. Ron DeSantis who faces reelection next year has struggled to give a precise statement on the legislation but has called himself “pro-life.”

New Surgeon General makes student quarantining optional — DeSantis named a new Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo to replace Dr. Scott Rivkees whose contract expired this week. Like his new boss Ladapo opposes mask mandates government shutdowns and vaccine mandates. On Wednesday one of his first actions as Surgeon General was signing new protocols allowing parents to decide whether their children should quarantine or stay in school if they are asymptomatic after being exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. He also tweaked the state’s prohibition against school mask mandates forcing that lawsuit to return to square one. On Tuesday he told reporters Florida would “reject fear” in COVID-19 policy.

Committee weeks start ahead of 2022 — Legislators returned to Tallahassee for an abbreviated workweek marking the first committee week ahead of the 2022 Legislative Session. Agency officials briefed lawmakers with updates stemming from recent legislation. And the table is set for several priorities for next year including hospital policy and redistricting. As the already strained nursing industry continues to struggle under the weight of the pandemic one area to address will be telehealth. And with last year’s census redistricting panels met multiple times to brief lawmakers on the topic that even some veterans of the process aren’t familiar with.

Biden administration reimburses school officials — Alachua County Public Schools became the first school district in the nation Thursday to receive federal funds to cover money the state withheld over school mask requirements. The Education Department sent the district an initial grant of $147719 through a federal program formed this month under President Joe Biden. The Project SAFE program is in response to DeSantis and other governors withholding the paychecks of school district officials that required mask mandates in schools. Although masking has been a point of contention between parents schools the DeSantis administration and the federal government in recent months DeSantis remained silent on the matter this week.

Uthmeier named Chief of Staff — DeSantis General Counsel James Uthmeier will be promoted to Chief of Staff following Adrian Lukis’ departure next month. The Northwest Florida Daily News reported that Uthmeier who has served the Governor’s Office since March 2019 will become DeSantis’ top aide on Oct. 1. Uthmeier will be DeSantis’ third Chief of Staff both in his first term and in 2021. Lukis replaced Shane Strum in March. Uthmeier was promoted from deputy to chief General Counsel in October 2020. He’ll step in with a little over a year till DeSantis faces reelection in November 2022.

Land conservation

During this week’s meeting DeSantis and the Cabinet approved seven Florida Forever land acquisitions and conservation easements totaling 20000 acres.

The projects span Hardee Hendry Indian River Leon Okeechobee and Santa Rosa counties. All but the Leon County project 19739 acres in total are within the new Florida Wildlife Corridor.

“Land conservation is an essential tool for environmental protection” DeSantis said. “I thank the Florida Cabinet for their support in approving these critical land acquisitions and conservation easements which will conserve Florida’s wide array of natural lands protect our wildlife and provide recreational opportunities for residents and visitors.”

Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Shawn Hamilton thanked DeSantis and the Cabinet for supporting conservation efforts.

“Through partnerships the Florida Forever program will continue to provide citizens and visitors alike a sanctuary for enjoying the natural beauty Florida has to offer” Hamilton said. “With today’s approvals these parcels will be conserved into perpetuity — protected for generations to come.”

Several conservation organizations also thanked state leadership for their environmental support.

“Protecting critical parcels of land such as those on the agenda of the Florida Cabinet is not only necessary for wildlife such as the Florida panther black bear and gopher tortoise but also for water resources and nature’s ability to adapt to a changing climate” said one advocate Nature Conservancy in Florida Executive Director Temperince Morgan. “Acquiring lands under the Florida Forever program continues to allow for conservation of biodiversity at a landscape-scale level and The Nature Conservancy wholeheartedly supports the approval by the Florida Cabinet.”

Superhero Award

Attorney General Ashely Moody and Sen. Lauren Book are heroes according to the American Children’s Campaign.

The organization honored Moody with a Superhero Award for advocating for sex-trafficked children and young adults. Meanwhile Book was honored for reforming the treatment of public-school children with disabilities.

Florida ranks third in the nation for reports of human trafficking.

In 2019 Florida accounted for 896 human trafficking reports to the National Human Trafficking Hotline. Most of the reports 640 were for sex trafficking and 172 reports involved minors.

With support from the Attorney General’s Office Voices for Florida launched the Open Doors Outreach Network in 2017 to serve child and young adult victims of sex trafficking. Moody took up the mantle in 2019 when she became Attorney General.

To date 1249 victims have been served.

Book was the Senate sponsor of a bill (SB 192) last Session that ended seclusion and limited physical restraints for students with disabilities. That bill passed the House and Senate unanimously and DeSantis approved it in June.

Florida currently averages over 8500 incidents of physical restraints being used on children in public schools annually. Most restraints were on young children (Pre-K — third grade).

The Superhero Award honors people who envision or lead a transformational change for children. Fourteen people primarily private citizens and advocates have received Superhero awards since the American Children’s Campaign began in 1992.

“The common denominator for receiving a Superhero award is the large-scale transformative change that can be achieved” said the group’s President Roy Miller. “It recognizes system reform that fundamentally changes children’s lives for the better.”

House Democratic Co-Leader Bobby DuBose recently received the organization’s Superhero Protector of Children Award for sponsoring the House counterpart (HB 149) to Book’s bill.

Forestry firefighter honored

This week Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried recognized Senior Forest Ranger David Sechrist as the 2020 Forestry Firefighter of the Year.

Sechrist began with the Florida Forest Service in 2010 and rose to the rank of Senior Forest Ranger by 2018 serving in the Jacksonville Forestry District.

Notably Fried said he was among the nation’s first Incident Management Teams to respond to a wildfire amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

“David’s service to his fellow firefighters through teaching mentoring training and helping his colleagues recover from Hurricane Michael are exemplary as are his professionalism in protecting not only life and property in Florida but in the ongoing western wildfires as well Fried added.

The Florida Cabinet recognized Sechrist’s “outstanding service” at a meeting earlier this week. Sechrist helped implement COVID-19 safety protocol for fire line workers. He also deploys several times a year on national wildfire assignments.

Florida Forest Service Director Erin Albury said wildland firefighters work in some of the most challenging and perilous conditions.

“David Sechrist has always demonstrated strong leadership and his willingness to support his fellow firefighters goes above and beyond the call of duty” Albury said. “I commend David on this well-deserved honor and thank him for his selfless commitment to serve.”

Bell ringer

Led by Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis members of the Florida Cabinet honored Florida’s fallen firefighters this week at the state capitol in a “Ringing of the Bell” ceremony.

During the ceremony 18 fallen firefighters were honored as their names were inscribed on the Florida Fallen Firefighter Memorial in the Capitol Courtyard.

“They dedicated their lives to their communities and paid the ultimate sacrifice” Patronis said. “With the Ringing of the Bell tradition we honor those who have given so much and who have served with dedication compassion and dignity. With each ring we mark the ending of a final call for the brave souls honored on these walls the ones who lost their lives bravely and with honor.”

The ceremony came in the wake of the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attack and the more recent search and rescue efforts in Surfside.

Patronis noted the hard work and sacrifice of first responders in his remarks.

“This year as we reflect on the 20th Anniversary of 9/11 and the tragic condo collapse in Surfside it further emphasizes for everyone the tremendous sacrifices our first responders give to keep our communities safe”

Patronis said. “God bless these fallen heroes and their families.”

Search & rescue

This week Patronis honored search and rescue workers for their response to the Champlain Towers Condominium Collapse in Surfside.

Patronis presented members of Florida’s Urban Search & Rescue Task Forces with a Cabinet resolution noting the hard work and sacrifices made by first responders on the ground.

“These men and women left their families and homes to run into unknown danger working for 29 days straight in the worst conditions imaginable to save lives” Patronis said. “They faced falling debris fires rain and tropical storm winds. I cannot thank the more than 800 members of State and Federal Task Forces enough for their service to the Surfside community and the state of Florida.”

The Surfside Condo Collapse ranks among the worst disasters in state history. Emergency workers worked 12-hour shifts for 29 days straight while facing the “worst conditions imaginable” Patronis said.

According to the resolution Urban Search and Rescue teams combed through roughly 1300 tons of rubble at the scene. The effort marked the largest non-hurricane deployment in state history.

Eight Florida search and rescue teams as well as responders from New Jersey Philadelphia Indianapolis and elsewhere are recognized in the resolution.

Hispanic art

First Lady Casey DeSantis has announced contemporary artist Cesar Santos as Florida’s featured artist for this year’s National Hispanic Heritage Month.

“It is a privilege to recognize Cesar Santos as Florida’s featured artist for Hispanic Heritage Month” DeSantis said.

Santos’ artwork has received numerous accolades and been featured worldwide. Santos is known for his body of work he terms “Syncretism” describing his presentation of two or more art tendencies in aesthetic balance.

“Like Cesar there are thousands of Hispanic-American artists in our state who are using their influence to share the world around them and to help their communities” DeSantis said. “I encourage all Floridians to join me in celebrating Cesar and all of the Hispanic-American artists who live in Florida.”

Santos born in Santa Clara Cuba graduated from Miami-Dade College before attending Miami’s New World School of the Arts. He also studied at the Angel Academy of Art in Florence Italy and received the Hudson River Fellowship in New York.

Santos’ work reflects both classical and modern interpretations juxtaposed within one painting infusing harmony between the natural and the conceptual to create works that are provocative and dramatic.

“I am discovering a technique which at first glance might be confused with the known since we are bombarded with historical and new technological forms to represent the visual world” Santos said. “I sense what calls my attention and translate it back onto the pages of my sketchbook establishing what is actually given to the viewer.”

In Florida the theme for this year’s National Hispanic Heritage Month which runs from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15 is “Celebrating Hispanic American Community Leaders and Champions.” DeSantis is also hosting arts and essay contests and awards for teachers during the month.

Justice reform

Rep. Dianne Hart refiled two criminal justice reform bills this week ahead of the 2022 Session.

House Bill 169 “Parole Eligibility” establishes eligibility guidelines for parole and requires the Commission on Offender Review and the Department of Corrections to jointly develop a voluntary long-term inmate program.

House Bill 171 “Criminal Rehabilitation” specifies that rehabilitating offenders to transition back into the community successfully is one of the primary purposes of sentencing. The bill also incentives the completion of educational programs to earn “rehabilitation credits.”

“Florida’s criminal justice system is in need of major overhaul the evidence of this was seen recently with the closing of three correctional facilities due to understaffing issues in the agency” Hart said. “These bills if made law will save the state money that can be used to not only improve the quality of life for those housed in our facilities but help us to retain staff.”

Hart of Tampa has been a leading House Democrat in advocating for criminal justice reform.

The 2021 version of her parole eligibility bill received the unanimous approval of the House Criminal Justice & Public Safety Subcommittee but didn’t advance any farther. The criminal rehabilitation bill was never scheduled for a hearing last cycle.

Climate Week

Democratic Rep. Kelly Skidmore took part in a roundtable discussion this week about coastal resiliency at Climate Week NYC 2021.

Skidmore and state reps. Lydia Blume of Maine and David Tarnas of Hawaii highlighted the importance of states serving as “laboratories of democracy” among other topics.

Panelists also explored various coastal policies local projects and other environmental collaborations.

“Florida’s blue economy is one of my top legislative priorities” Skidmore said. “As the most recognizable peninsula in the country Florida is framed by the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico and is home to the Everglades Lake Okeechobee as well as a statewide network of rivers wetlands estuaries mangroves springs and aquifers. When looking at a hydrological map of the State it’s reliance on water cannot be overstated.”

Climate Week NYC is an annual event hosted by the Climate Group and in partnership with the United Nations COP26 and the City of New York.

Parks plate

The Florida State Parks Foundation named Sen. Dennis Baxley and Rep. Allison Tant their Legislative Park Champions of the Year for 2021.

The pair helped pass legislation to create a specialty license plate to benefit Florida State Parks. Following the event the State Parks Foundation unveiled that license plate which features an artistic interpretation of floating down one of Florida’s waterways from the perspective of a kayaker.

“We had a conversation among a few of us on the board and the executive committee who do we ask that can carry this for us through the respective chambers” said foundation President Gil Ziffer. “After great conversation I thought to two folks that I thought could be instrumental in making them happen were Rep. Tant and Sen. Baxley.”

Ziffer added that he’s known Baxley as a next-door neighbor and he’s known Tant for many years. Baxley a Republican from Ocala and Tant a freshman Democrat from Tallahassee are on opposite sides of the political spectrum but could agree to champion the license plate proposal through the Legislature.

“It’s very unique to be able to get — unusual I should say — to be able to get a license passed in its first year and we did that” Ziffer said.

Godfather’s professorship

Florida State University College of Communication and Information has created a new professorship to honor the late Jay Rayburn.

Rayburn who was eulogized as “godfather of the state’s communications industry” died earlier this month days ahead of what would have been his 74th birthday.

The college is seeking donations to raise $250000 for the Dr. Jay D. Rayburn Endowed Professorship which the school says would be a lasting tribute to his devotion to advancing the public relations industry.

“It is very fitting that this professorship is directed to serve students building on their futures in public relations” said Stephen McDowell interim dean of the FSU College of Communication and Information. “This was the focus of Jay’s professional life and this will help carry his dedication and commitment forward.”

The Moore Agency a leading communications and marketing agency headquartered in Tallahassee Florida provided the first gift to establish the new professorship.

“It is an honor to be the inaugural donor to the Dr. Jay D. Rayburn Endowed Professorship as we highlight Rayburn’s legacy” said More Agency founder and CEO Karen Moore. “We collaborated on substantial research projects and saw firsthand his decadeslong impact on students and the public relations profession.”

Rayburn joined the College of Communication and Information faculty in 1985 teaching public relations and integrated marketing for 35 years before his retirement in 2020.

“Apart from his distinguished talent and industry knowledge students and fellow faculty members — including myself — will greatly remember Professor Rayburn for his memorable stories and the countless laughs we shared with him” said the college’s former dean Larry Dennis.

Telly Award

The Florida A&M University College of Law recently won a Telly Award for a segment on the Ocoee Massacre.

The 1920 Ocoee Massacre remains the largest incident of Election Day violence in United States history. Between three and 60 African Americans reportedly died in the violence and the remaining Black residents fled.

WFTV’s Daralene Jones interviewed FAMU Law Dean Deidré Keller and professor LeRoy Pernell about the massacre voter suppression human rights violations mob violence and possible justice for the families of victims. Stephanie Strong and Mildred Graham produced the special. Matt Juvinall of Orange TV served as the segment’s executive producer and director.

The Ocoee Massacre special was featured on FAMU Law’s television program called Legal Connections which airs regularly on Orange TV in the Orlando market and FAMU TV 20 in the Tallahassee market. FAMU Law located in Orlando is unique in producing and hosting a cable television program in a major television market.

FAMU Law and Orange TV were honored as a Silver Winner in “General-Television.”

The Telly Awards was founded in 1979 to honor excellence in local regional and cable television commercials. Non-broadcast video and television programming were added soon after.

Free speech

Florida State University ranked No. 5 in this year’s College Free Speech Rankings published by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education making it the highest-ranked Florida university on the list.

FIRE a national campus free speech organization used seven components to identify the best campuses for student free speech and open inquiry among 159 of America’s most prestigious colleges. The seven categories are openness tolerance for conservative speakers tolerance for liberal speakers administrative support for free speech comfort expressing ideas disruptive conduct and the organization’s speech code rating.

Last year FSU revised its free expression policies to earn FIRE’s top free speech “green light” rating.

“This ranking is a testament to Florida State University’s enduring commitment to foster a respectful and civil environment where students can freely discuss and exchange different beliefs and opinions” said FSU Vice President for Student Affairs Amy Hecht. “We’re pleased that our efforts to protect every individual’s right to free speech and expression have been recognized by FIRE.”

FIRE surveyed 37104 college students currently enrolled in four-year degree programs at 159 colleges and universities in the United States. Students answered a survey of 25 items about their experience and attitudes about free speech and expression on their college campuses. Students also answered an open-ended question about their experiences.

NKE,Nike,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uaWtlLWNhcmJvbi1ydW5uaW5nLXNob2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike's Vaporfly edge isn't down to carbon,"The impact of super shoes has been profound. Since Nike’s Vaporfly 4% hit the roads in 2016 the controversial trainers – with their combination of a carbon plate big stack of high-rebound midsole foam and lightweight uppers – have changed running at every level. Toppling records and forcing regulation changes.

Kenyan Eliud Kichoge took the men’s marathon world record in Berlin in 2018 followed by that historic sub-2-hour marathon in 2019. Both in the AlphaFly. Brigid Kosgei beat Paula Radcliffe’s women’s world marathon record in the same shoe. Japan’s Mariko Yugeta became the first woman aged 60 or over to break the three hour marathon barrier when she ran 2:59:15 wearing the Vaporfly.

Nike hasn’t had all the glory though. Twenty-year-old Kenyan Rhonex Kipruto claimed the men’s 10km road world record in 2020 wearing a pair of prototype Adidas carbon shoes. Ethiopia’s Derara Hurisa was disqualified after winning the Vienna Marathon wearing the Adidas Adizero Prime X which has soles that are five centimetres (50 mm) – thicker than the new regulation 40mm stack height.

In ultra running Jim Walmsley set the 50-mile world record in HOKA’s Carbon X while Lithuanian Runner Sania Sorokin captured the 100-mile track world record running an average 6:45 min/mile pace in a combination of Hoka Carbon X2 and the Nike AlphaFly.

Fast forward to 2021 and the revolution is still gathering pace. Every running shoe brand from Adidas Brooks and Saucony to Hoka – and even The North Face – now has its own carbon racer. But have Nike’s rivals levelled the playing field as much as the marketers would have us believe? Not according to the scientists.

New research from Austin State University has revealed that despite hefty price tags and bold claims some carbon running shoes offer little or no benefits compared to a traditional non-carbon race shoe. The study’s findings also suggest that Nike still leads the pack when it comes to performance-enhancing running economy and its authors advise runners to think carefully before buying into the marketing promises.

While previous carbon shoe studies validated the performance enhancements of Nike’s Vaporfly and AlphaFly shoes this is the first study to compare the leading carbon shoes against each other and a traditional race shoe to find out which delivers the biggest gains.

The study looked at how the high-end shoes performed on 12 trained male distance runners size 10-11 US who’d been running at least three times a week for the previous three months. Each runner had also clocked a sub-17:30 minute 5km race performance (or equivalent race performance for distances 3km to marathon) within the last year and had the ability to run below the lactate threshold at the 16km/hr tested running economy speed. That’s just over 6 minutes/mile or 3.75 minutes/km so the faster end of amateur runners.

Researchers selected seven carbon shoes based on availability at the time with Adidas a notable omission. These comprised: Nike AlphaFly Nike Vaporfly 2 Saucony Endorphin Pro Hoka Rocket X Asics Metaspeed Sky New Balance RC Elite and the Brooks Hyperion Elite 2. The eighth non-carbon comparison shoe was the Asics Hyperspeed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uYmEvaGF3a3MvY3VsdHVyZS9oYXdrcy1yb29raWUtamFsZW4tam9obnNvbi1zaWducy1lbmRvcnNlbWVudC1kZWFsLXdpdGgtbmlrZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atlanta Hawks Rookie Jalen Johnson Signs Multi-Year Endorsement Deal with Nike,"It's been a big week for sneakerheads who live in Atlanta. Yesterday we covered the official unveiling of the Adidas Trae Young 1 shoe and apparel collection. Then last night Chris Kirschner of The Athletic reported that Hawks rookie Jalen Johnson signed a multi-year endorsement deal with Nike.

Recently I broke down the Hawks roster by Nike Adidas and Peak (shoutout Lou Williams) athletes. The Hawks have a disproportionate amount of Adidas athletes including one of only five NBA players with their own signature shoe through the German brand. Yet the majority of the team still wears the swoosh.

Of course Johnson will not be getting his own signature sneaker line anytime soon (if ever). So what can we expect to see on Johnson's feet this season? So far he has shown a strong affinity for Kyrie Irving's signature line. It makes sense both are from Duke and their game is predicated on quickness.

Now that Johnson is in the league hopefully Nike hooks him up with every colorway of his preferred Kyrie model. Keep it locked in as we count down the hours until training camp starts on September 28.

Sure sneakers were obviously meant to be worn. But sometimes we do have the urge to keep our kicks in pristine condition—or even set them aside in deadstock condition treating our grails like rare collectibles. Nike’s upcoming “Alter & Reveal” Pack makes the case for wearing your sneakers by utilizing special uppers that gradually reveal a new colorway after some time of wear. After showcasing an Air Max 90 to be a part of the new pack another pair has emerged in GS sizing.

At first glance the GS-exclusive seems to be composed of a mix of leathers suedes and textiles in neutral and grey tones. These rather understated shades are only applied to the style on the surface level. With enough wear the arrangement transforms into a brightly color-blocked proposition consisting of bold red blue and yellow. To hint at the hidden fun the lacestays and ankle feature unexpected contrast stitches while the tongue label and insole see special “Alter And Reveal” branding. Furthermore the Air cassette uses a grey speckled design that houses an Air unit that includes hints of red. The result is a new offering that continuously delivers a new look as a reward for wearing your sneakers.

Take a closer look at the Air Max 90 below which will be available at Nike.com in the coming months.

It’s didn’t last long.

“I didn’t want to go out too fast” Barna said. “I’ve kind of been doing that the last two races. I’ve been going out 4:50 4:55 (for the first mile). I want to run sub-15 (minutes) so that won’t work.”

But a controlled early pace is easier to do when someone else is taking the lead. When Barna broke from the start line no one else went with him.

“Force of habit I went out sub-4:50” he said. “And from that point I knew it was going to hurt.”"

Each match is worth one point. Ties are worth a 1/2-point to each side.

The three days of the matches consist of 28 total matches each of which is worth one point. There are no playoffs in Ryder Cup matches. Ties result in a half point for each team.

What's the 'envelope rule' at the Ryder Cup?

From the AP's Doug Ferguson: ""At some point Saturday evening as the captains are filling out their lineups for the final session of singles matches they are required to put one name in the envelope. That player would sit out and be given a half-point if someone on the other team can’t play because of injury.""

That is expanded to four names this year because of the pandemic. Captains will submit three additional names in a second envelope to be used only if players have to withdraw because of COVID.

When is the 2021 Ryder Cup?

The matches in the 2021 Ryder Cup start Friday Sept. 24 and finish on Sunday Sept. 26. There is plenty of hoopla before then of course including practice rounds and the opening ceremonies. That is when the captains will announce their pairings for the next day

When was the 2021 Ryder Cup opening ceremony?

The opening ceremony was Thursday Sept. 23.

What Is the Ryder Cup?

The Ryder Cup is a competition between a team from the United States and one from Europe that is played every other year usually. The 2020 Ryder Cup was postponed because of the pandemic. The first Ryder Cup was played in 1927. The competition has been in its modern format since 1979 and features both fourball and foursome matches on Friday and Saturday and singles matches on Sunday. Fourball means every player plays his ball and posts a score. Lowest score wins a hole. Foursomes feature alternating shots lowest score wins the hole.

Where is the 2021 Ryder Cup?

The 2021 Ryder Cup is at Whistling Straits in Haven Wisc. about 15 minutes north of Sheboyan. The location of the Ryder Cup alternates between Europe and the United States. The 2018 Ryder Cup was at Le Golf National outside Paris France. The most recent Ryder Cup in the United States was at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska Minn. in 2016. The 2023 Ryder Cup will be in Rome Italy. The 2025 event will be at Bethpage Black in New York.

How are the Ryder Cup teams made?

The 2021 U.S. Team is made up of the top six in the points rankings with six captain's picks. These are the American players who qualified automatically:

Collin Morikawa

Dustin Johnson

Bryson DeChambeau

Brooks Koepka

Justin Thomas

Patrick Cantlay

These are the captain's picks Steve Stricker announced Sept. 8:

Tony Finau

Xander Schauffele

Jordan Spieth

Because the Ryder Cup was postponed points American players earned in 2019 were included with the ones earned in 2020 and 2021. Players earned points based on money won in major championships WGC events and regular PGA Tour events.

The European Team is made up of the first four players from the Ryder Cup European Points List on Sept. 12 followed by the leading five players from the Ryder Cup World Points List. Captain Padraig Harrington made his three captain's picks Sept. 12 when he added Ian Poulter Sergio Garcia and Shane Lowry.

Who's on the 2021 American Ryder Cup roster?

1. Collin Morikawa (rookie)

Age: 24.

World ranking: 3.

Ryder Cup record: Rookie.

Career victories: 5.

2021 victories: WGC-Workday Championship British Open.

Majors: PGA Championship (2020) British Open (2021).

Ryder Cup partners: None.

Ryder Cup moment: Leading the U.S. standings in his first year of eligibility.

His form took a dip in the PGA Tour postseason for the second straight year but the intensity of the Ryder Cup should get his attention. He figures to be a rock in foursomes with his repeatable swing. The one area of his game under the most scrutiny is his putting.

2. Dustin Johnson (2010 2012 2016 2018 2021)

Age: 37.

World ranking: 2.

Ryder Cup record: 7-9-0.



Career victories: 25.

2021 victories: Saudi International.

Majors: U.S. Open (2016) Masters (2020).

Ryder Cup partners: Phil Mickelson (0-2-0) Jim Furyk (0-1-0) Matt Kuchar (3-1-0) Brooks Koepka (0-2-0) Rickie Fowler (1-2-0).

Ryder Cup moment: Holing a 30-foot birdie putt on the 17th at Medinah in a Saturday afternoon fourballs victory. It’s believed to be his biggest fist pump ever.

He still is regarded as the most talented American but finding him a partner has been a challenge in the Ryder Cup. Johnson and Whistling Straits will evoke memories of his club touching sand that turned out to be a bunker costing him a spot in the playoff in the 2010 PGA Championship.

3. Bryson DeChambeau (2018)

Age: 28.

World ranking: 7.

Ryder Cup record: 0-3-0.

Career victories: 9.

2021 victories: Arnold Palmer Invitational.



Majors: U.S. Open (2020).

Ryder Cup partners: Phil Mickelson (0-1-0) Tiger Woods (0-1-0).

Ryder Cup moment: Being picked for his first Ryder Cup and getting Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson as his partners. They lost both matches.

His length should be a good fit for Whistling Straits especially the short par 4s where he can go for the green. His thin skin has been an issue though he probably won’t have to worry about that in front of a pro-American gallery.

4. Brooks Koepka (2016 2018 2021)

Age: 31.

World ranking: 9.

Ryder Cup record: 4-3-1.

Career victories: 11.

2021 victories: Waste Management Phoenix Open.

Majors: U.S. Open (2017 2018) PGA Championship (2018 2019).

Ryder Cup partners: Brandt Snedeker (2-0-0) Dustin Johnson (0-2-0) Tony Finau (1-1-0)

Ryder Cup moment: Winning three matches in his 2016 debut at Hazeltine none going beyond the 16th hole.



Injured his left wrist again hitting tree root beneath the turf at East Lake causing him to withdraw from the rest of the Tour Championship and raising questions about how healthy he will be for the Ryder Cup.

5. Justin Thomas (2018 2021)

Age: 28.

World ranking: 6.

Ryder Cup record: 4-1-0.

Career victories: 14.

2021 victories: Players Championship.

Majors: PGA Championship (2017).

Ryder Cup partners: Jordan Spieth (3-1-0).

Ryder Cup moment: Drilling his drive down the middle of the 18th fairway in Paris that led to a 1-up victory over Rory McIlroy in singles in 2018.

He made an impressive debut in 2018 by going 3-1 and partnering with longtime friend Jordan Spieth. He has been frustrated by his putting for most of the year.

6. Patrick Cantlay (rookie)

Age: 29.

World ranking: 4.

Ryder Cup record: Rookie.

Career victories: 5.



2021 victories: Memorial BMW Championship Tour Championship.

Majors: None.

Ryder Cup partners: None.

Ryder Cup moment: Winning the Tour Championship to get the final automatic spot on the team.

Makes his Ryder Cup debut and already looked upon as a feared opponent based on his clutch putting from the last month and not having any apparent weakness in his game. He partnered well with Xander Schauffele in the Presidents Cup.

7. Tony Finau (2018 2021)

Age: 32.

World ranking: 10.

Ryder Cup record: 2-1-0.

Career victories: 2.

2021 victories: The Northern Trust.

Majors: None.

Ryder Cup partners: Brooks Koepka (1-1-0).

Ryder Cup moment: His 8-iron that hit the wooden plank framing the water on the 16th hole soaring in the air and landing 3 feet away for birdie to square the opening match of the 2018 Ryder Cup.

He made a solid debut in 2018 by going 2-1-0 and handing Tommy Fleetwood is only loss of the week. Finau figures to have even more confidence coming off his playoff victory in The Northern Trust. Not winning had been a burden.

8. Xander Schauffele (rookie)

Age: 27.

World ranking: 5.

Ryder Cup record: Rookie.

Career victories: 5.

2021 victories: Olympics.

Majors: None.

Ryder Cup partners: None.

Ryder Cup moment: Getting left off the 2018 team as Jim Furyk used his captain’s pick on Tony Finau.

One of the most complete players on the U.S. team whose strength is bouncing back from bad holes. He already has one victory this year playing for the flag winning the gold medal in the Olympics.

9. Jordan Spieth (2014 2016 2018 2021)

Age: 28.

World ranking: 14.

Ryder Cup record: 7-5-2.

Career victories: 15.

2021 victories: Valero Texas Open.

Majors: Masters (2015) U.S. Open (2015) British Open (2017).

Ryder Cup partners: Patrick Reed (4-1-2) Justin Thomas (3-1-0).

Ryder Cup moment: Has only lost two of the 11 team matches he has played but still hasn’t won a singles match.



He missed the Presidents Cup in 2019 and didn’t figure to be part of this team at the start of the year until rediscovering his game and his touch. He was the runner-up to Jason Day at Whistling Straits in the 2015 PGA Championship.

10. Harris English (rookie)

Age: 32.

World ranking: 11.

Ryder Cup record: Rookie.

Career victories: 4.

2021 victories: Sentry Tournament of Champions Travelers Championship.

Majors: None.

Ryder Cup partners: None.

Ryder Cup moment: Challenging for a spot on the 2014 team and then going his final seven tournaments without finishing in the top 30.

Good length off the tee good touch around the green and easily the most agreeable character on the U.S. team. He is the oldest of the six rookies at age 32 and one of only three Americans with multiple victories this year on the PGA Tour.

11. Scottie Scheffler (rookie)

Age: 25.

World ranking: 21.

Ryder Cup record: Rookie.

Career victories: None.

2021 victories: None.

Majors: None.

Ryder Cup partners: None.

Ryder Cup moment: Getting what is believed to be the sixth and final captain’s pick.

First player since Rickie Fowler in 2010 to make Ryder Cup debut as a captain’s pick without having won on the PGA Tour. His his consistent play is why he qualified for the last two Masters and the last two Tour Championships.

12. Daniel Berger (rookie)

Age: 28.

World ranking: 16.

Ryder Cup record: Rookie.

Career victories: 4.

2021 victories: AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.

Majors: None.

Ryder Cup partners: None.

Ryder Cup moment: At least being talked about as a potential pick for the 2016 team.

He showed plenty of emotion and no mercy during the U.S. rout in the Presidents Cup in 2017. Berger’s resurgence began after golf returned from the pandemic. He has won twice since then.

He won at Quail Hollow but still isn’t all the way back to living up to his talent. He remains a central figure for Europe. Since his debut in 2010 McIlroy has yet to sit out a match. He has partnered with rookies in each of the last two Ryder Cup matches.

What is the format of Ryder Cup matches?

The first two days of competition feature fourball and foursomes matches. The order is determined by the home captain. The third day consists of 12 singles matches.

In fourball each member of a two-man team plays his own ball so four balls are in play on every hole. Each team counts the lowest of its two scores on each hole and the team whose player has the lowest score wins the hole. If the low scores are tied the hole is halved.

In foursomes each two-man team plays one ball per hole with the players taking turns until each hole is complete. Players alternate hitting tee shots with one leading off on odd-numbered holes and the other hitting first on even-numbered holes. The team with the low score on each hole wins that hole. If their scores are tied the hole is halved.

In singles each match features one player from each team. The player with the lower score on each hole wins that hole. If their scores are tied the hole is halved.

Unlike stroke play players don't have to complete each hole in match play. If a player concedes a stroke – almost always a putt – to his opponent the opponent picks up his ball takes the score he would have made on the next stroke and moves on to the next hole.

The funding from the Government will help create at least 670 hectares (1660 acres) of woodland in the scheme which aims to link trees across the M62 corridor from Liverpool to Hull the Woodland Trust said.

The Northern Forest was launched three years ago to establish at least 50 million trees across an area where 13 million people live and which includes Liverpool Manchester Leeds Sheffield and Hull.

Already three million trees have been planted in the area which with only 7.6% woodland cover is much more sparsely wooded than the England average.

The funding will help another million trees go in the ground in the next year according to the Trust which is working with community forests in the region to create the new woods.

Some £6 million will go directly to the Northern Forest supporting the Woodland Trust’s Grow Back Greener programme while £8.8 million will go to community forests within the area through the Trees for Climate programme.

“We desperately need more trees up here for both people and wildlife.

“It’s great to see investment going into supporting something so positive and it’s inspiring that from Liverpool to Hull there will be places for people to go and enjoy a bit of green space.”

Simon Mageean the Woodland Trust’s programme director for the Northern Forest said: “This new funding is massively significant for this project and enables us to push on with this new phase.

The funding will help increase woodland cover (The Woodland Trust/PA)

“Not only do these new trees have the power to transform people’s lives through all the green space they bring in areas of traditionally low tree cover they are also set to bring a big boost to our fight against climate change and encourage nature recovery.”

Forestry Minister Lord Goldsmith said: “There has never been a more exciting time for tree planting and I am delighted that through our Nature for Climate Fund we will see at least a million more trees being planted in the Northern Forest in the next year contributing to our overall commitment to increase tree-planting across the UK to 30000 hectares per year by the end of this Parliament.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL3Nwb3J0L2dvbGYvYXJpZC00MDcwNjE4OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Unlucky' Shane Lowry and Rory McIlroy remain defiant despite big Ryder Cup deficit,"Rory McIlroy sounded a defiantly confident tone for Team Europe on Friday night despite slumping to another heavy defeat on the opening day of the 43rd Ryder Cup matches.

McIlroy and fellow Irishman Shane Lowry came up against the red-hot American putter of Tony Finau as the European pair were beaten with three holes still to play at Whistling Straits.

It was the first time in six appearances for Europe that McIlroy had lost two matches in one day as the dream Irish pairing of the firm friends and Olympic team-mates failed to keep pace with the in-form Finau and his rookie better-ball playing partner Harris English.

The 4&3 reverse on Friday night followed an opening-session 5&3 loss for McIlroy and foursomes partner Ian Poulter to Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele reflecting the broader picture of the day as Padraig Harrington’s Europeans struggled against the strongest USA Ryder Cup team ever assembled.

Steve Stricker’s side had won the opening session of foursomes matches 3-1 and American red was once again squeezing European blue off the scoreboard in the evening fourballs as the irish pair were defeated in match three but McIlroy said: “We can come back from 6-2. If it's 6-2 we can come back.” It made for a deeply disappointing debut for 2019 Open champion Lowry one of Harrington’s three captain’s picks despite the Offaly golfer had made much of the running for the European pair with a birdie three at the opening hole as the teams halved the opening four holes.

It was McIlroy though who drew first blood at the par-5 fifth sinking a 30-foot eagle putt to go 1Up. It would be the last time Europe broke par but their American rivals were only just getting started.

Finau provided an instant reply with a birdie at the par-four 6th to level the match and Harris sent the USA into a lead they would not relinquish with his birdie at the par-4 eighth. Then came Finau’s turn to take control his confidence buoyed by last month’s FedEx Cup play-off series win at the Northern Trust in New Jersey and transferred seamlessly into a team setting in Wisconsin.

Birdies at nine 10 and 13 sucked the life out of the European challenge and sent Team USA into a 4Up lead with the Irish duo unable to find a response. Holes were halved at 11 12 and 14 but it was wins Europe needed and holes were running out. The end came at the 15th Finau’s nerveless putting sealing the deal from nine feet to halve the hole and put the match beyond Europe.

“We got unlucky today” Lowry said. “We probably didn't play our best but we hit some good shots and got bad breaks. I feel like 80 yards in the middle of the fairway on the last (15th) and they made an easy par. We probably should have given them a better match than we did but it is what it is.

“Now try to get a couple points in the last few matches go out tomorrow and give it our best and see if we can get a lead going into the singles.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLW5vcnRoZXJuLWlyZWxhbmQtNTg1NzQ4NznSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dental services in NI are 'neglecting disabled children',"""We do acknowledge that the trust is not able to be as responsive to the needs of children who have dental problems as we were able pre-covid and there have been delays in arranging to bring these children in for care even when they are experiencing dental pain."

The service’s sixth-generation fighter is already airborne years ahead of schedule for a few key reasons. One of them is digital engineering a fast-spreading technique showing progress across a wide range of weapons systems. Digital engineering relies on simulations and computer modeling to maintain developmental fidelity and detail without having to wait years to actually “build” large numbers of prototypes.

“Digital engineering is allowing us to go at a quick pace and focus on meeting milestones we have established” Greg Manuel Northrop Grumman’s sector vice president and general manager told the National Interest. “We will start our production program in 2026 with some early procurement in 2024 of long-lead items that can take a year or two to build. Digital innovation has afforded us the opportunity to build deliver and meet what would have been a potential gap between Minuteman III and GBSD. We are on a path to meet the Air Force expectation.”

Digital engineering allows the GBSD to sustain the U.S. ground-fired ICBM fleet well into the 2070s and beyond with new levels of targeting and guidance technologies. These software upgrades can improve a weapon’s guidance systems technologies and sensors. This is an important factor given that the new ICBM is to operate against a new generation of enemy threats and countermeasures for decades to come.

The early designs of the weapon included a pathway for potential upgrades. It would make sense that the weapons were built to accommodate modernization given that the U.S. Air Force has a long history of upgrading and maintaining ICBMs.

“We’ve made good progress on engineering the weapons systems” Manuel added. “Digital engineering is paying off quite well for us and expediting knowledge.”

Digital engineering brings the added advantage of being able to save time and lower costs by assessing and testing designs before “bending metal.” It is proven to very reliably replicate weapons system performance through simulation to give developers a realistic and quick estimation of key performance parameters and design effectiveness.

“You can imagine that Minuteman III was designed with 1960s technologies to last for ten years... GBSD is designed in a digital environment to last fifty years with current technology to drive out the risk of the development of the program and build in an ability to have adaptability and flexibility” Manuel added.

This digital blueprint allows for a significant reduction in operational maintenance costs Manuel said.

“We... have sensors to help you understand what is going to break before it breaks” he said. “There are a lot of moving parts that have to get maintained using this digital environment. Tens of thousands of parts will be monitored and on alert every single day as this is the only weapon system that works every single day and stands on alert. Every launch facility will actually come with a configuration book that we call a ‘digital threat.’ Every product will have the heritage of where it came from.”

With limited resources both in research funding and time astronomers decide what questions they are most interested in pursuing and recommend telescopes that can help them answer those questions. It’s a process by astronomers for astronomers but their decisions are primarily funded through federal dollars and lead to scientific discoveries and images which make their way into public discourse. The Hubble Space Telescope and its breathtaking views of the universe exist in part because of this practice called the Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics. The National Academy of Sciences is due to release their updated Decadal Survey later this year and the astronomy community anxiously awaits to see the latest recommendations from a 50-plus year process that has led to some of the most groundbreaking and iconic projects in modern astronomical history.

Hubble received priority status in the 1970s Decadal Survey was funded and became the first of NASA’s Great Observatories to be launched into space. (ESA/Hubble & NASA F. Pacaud D. Coe)

It takes more than one type of telescope to observe all the light and information streaming towards Earth from the near and distant universe. This means that different astronomical questions rely on different types of telescopes to answer them. Want to study planets orbiting other stars? You’ll get the best data flying a telescope on a plane in the high Earth atmosphere or better yet launching a telescope into space. Want to study supernovae? The high energy gamma rays created by a supernova explosion can only be studied directly with a space telescope that uses special detectors. How about neutrinos? These elusive particles that can help astronomers discover the sources of cosmic rays are best studied with observatories built deep beneath Earth’s surface. Each area of research requires building very different observatories so astronomers must choose where they want to focus their efforts.

Telescopes are designed to measure different types of light and are often placed above Earth’s atmosphere which blocks many types of light from reaching the surface. (STScI/JHU/NASA)

Through the process of prioritizing astronomical questions and instruments the Decadal Survey serves as a recommendation to Congress on where federal money should be allocated to NASA for astronomical research. Large observatories whether they are located underground built on a tall mountain flown through the atmosphere or launched into space are expensive endeavors and take years of development and construction. Because of these constraints astronomers often have to decide if they prefer several small and mid-range telescopes or one or two extremely large telescopes. In addition to prioritizing future research topics and the required instruments of those projects astronomers also consider the current state of previously constructed observatories.

The first three decadal surveys prioritized a suite of space-based telescopes that covered the universe from the infrared to gamma rays. These four space telescopes became known as NASA’s Great Observatories and have been the bedrock for astronomical research in space for the last 30 years. The 1970 report prioritized what became the Hubble Space Telescope and a series of high energy astrophysical observatories which led to the development of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. The 1980 report prioritized the Chandra X-ray Observatory and in the 1990s the Spitzer Space Telescope and infrared astronomy received the highest ranking.

Chandra’s X-ray data (top right) is shown in blue Hubble’s optical data (middle right) in yellow and Spitzer’s infrared data (bottom right) in red. Combined these observatories create a more detailed look of the universe. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/ ESA/STScI/K. Gordon /CXC/JHU/K.Kuntz et al.)

In the 2000 and 2010 Decadal Surveys astronomers focused on continued pressing questions in astronomy most notably: How did galaxies evolve from birth? How do planetary systems form and evolve? What is dark energy? Where are the potentially habitable planets? Two of the space telescopes prioritized were the Next Generation Space Telescope now called the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Wide-Field Infrared Telescope now called the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. The 2000 and 2010 Decadal Surveys also established a stronger collaboration with international partners in effort to coordinate large-scale projects that are too costly for the U.S. to carry out on its own a crucial element for JWST whose budget has increased significantly since its start. After several delays JWST is currently scheduled to launch in December 2021 after which astronomers hope to fulfill the Decadal Survey’s expectation and make discoveries that will rival those of the Hubble Space Telescope when it was first launched. The Roman Space Telescope is scheduled to be launched in 2025.

Engineers completed final tests of the James Webb Space Telescope at Northrop Grumman facilities in California. The tennis court-sized sunshield was folded and stored. This was the final stop before being shipped to the launch site in Kourou French Guiana along the northern coast of South America. (Northrop Grumman)

Astronomers proposed four space telescopes for consideration in the 2020s Decadal Survey:

The Lynx X-ray Observatory. Lynx would be a significant upgrade to the Chandra X-ray Observatory and would reveal finer detail of the violent processes happening around black holes the explosive nature of supernova and other high-energy objects and events in the universe.

The Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR). LUVOIR is a scaled-up version of the Hubble Space Telescope and would transform our view of exoplanets stars and galaxies.

LUVOIR is a scaled-up version of the Hubble Space Telescope and would transform our view of exoplanets stars and galaxies. The Origins Space Telescope. This telescope would study the infrared universe and expand our understanding of the origin of solar systems stars and galaxies.

Each telescope has its strengths but together they have the potential to form what astronomer Grant Tremblay calls the New Great Observatories. Chances are low that the Decadal Survey will recommend pursuing all four telescopes together but each poses a unique view of the many mysteries of the universe.

The Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics holds immense power in directing future research and discovery. These recommendations to NASA have resulted in budget requests and approvals that have led to huge advances in astronomical research and instrumentation. After the 2020 Decadal Survey is released and prioritizations are made the next stage of development can begin where one or more of these telescopes is launched into space in the coming decades.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9uYXNhLWxhbmRzYXQtOS1lYXJ0aC1vYnNlcnZhdGlvbi1zYXRlbGxpdGUtZ28tZm9yLWxhdW5jaNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Landsat 9 NASA's most powerful Landsat satellite ever is 'go' for launch on Monday,"NASA has cleared its newest powerful Earth-observing satellite for a launch into orbit from the California coast on Monday (Sept. 27).

The satellite called Landsat 9 is on track to lift off from the Vandenberg Space Force Base atop an Atlas V rocket provided by the United Launch Alliance. Liftoff is targeted for 2:12 p.m. EDT (11:12 a.m. PDT or 1812 GMT)

""The spacecraft the Atlas V rocket all range equipment are ready"" NASA launch director Tim Dunn told reporters in a press conference Saturday (Sept. 25). The mission has a 30-minute window in which to lift off from Vandenberg's Space Launch Complex 3E he added.

Four small cubesats will also launch into orbit with Landsat 9. Two will study the solar wind and exoplanet atmospheres as part of NASA research. Two others are flying undisclosed missions for the U.S. Space Force Dunn said.

Landsat 9 will be the ninth and most advanced satellite to study Earth from above for the Landsat program a joint effort by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey that has provided constant imagery of our planet for nearly 50 years. It carries a high-resolution camera and a sensitive infrared sensor that together can image the Earth across 11 spectral bands and resolve objects down to about 50 feet (15 meters) wide. The satellite should orbit the Earth at altitude of about 438 miles (705 kilometers) over the planet's poles.

""For nearly 50 years Landsat satellites have documented Earth's changing landscape"" Michael Egan NASA's Landsat program manager said in the press conference. ""Landsat 9 will improve and expand upon this unparalleled record of our home planet.""

Landsat 9 will be able to image the entire Earth every 16 days. When combined with data from its predecessor Landsat 8 which launched in 2013 and is still in use today the two satellites can cover the entire Earth every eight days Egan said. Landsat 9 is designed to last at least 5 years in orbit and replace the aging Landsat 7 which is also in use today.

Landsat satellites have been studying the Earth since 1972. That continuous coverage is key to tracking Earth's changes especially as the planet experiences more extreme weather powerful storms fires and other effects from climate change mission officials said.

""As we know climate change is real"" said Tanya Trujillo Assistant Secretary for Water and Science at the Department of the Interior in the press conference. ""The Landsat program is an excellent tool to help guide our efforts to understand and document the changes we are seeing on a daily basis.""

Northrop Grumman built the $750 million Landsat 9 for NASA with the mission's team shaving about $90 million off its initial budget Thomas Zurbuchen NASA's associate administrator for science missions told reporters Saturday.

It's been a long road to the launchpad for Landsat 9. The satellite was initially supposed to launch on Sept. 16 but was delayed to Sept. 23 due to a liquid nitrogen shortage related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. High winds prompted another delay to Sept. 27.

The mission will also launch a minute later than planned to avoid a collision chance with NASA's Calypso/CloudSat satellite in orbit Dunn said. Currently weather forecasts predict a 60% chance of good conditions at launch time.

If NASA and the United Launch Alliance are unable to launch Landsat 9 on Monday a backup launch window is available on Tuesday with similar weather conditions expected.

""I just felt like there was something inside of me that was not complete and I went to church.""

That's where he said he found joy.

Gomez served as the Associate Pastor in Hacienda Heights and is now administrator at Holly Cross Church on Cliff Drive in Santa Barbara.

He hopeS to be bring the joy he found to Holy Cross.

""The business mantra is to make the stockholders happy to maximize the profit. Here we are trying to bring hearts and souls to Jesus.""

The launch is scheduled to occur within a 30-minute launch window that opens at 11:11 am PT / 2:11 pm ET. Earlier today the crew tied to the Launch Readiness Review gave approval for Monday’s liftoff. Meteorologists at Vandenberg Space Force Base predict there will be a 90% or better favorable weather conditions for launch time. NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) are responsible for the satellite which Northrop Grumman built. Landsat 9 is the most advanced satellite in the Landsat series; it will extend the data record of Earth’s land surface that began with the first Landsat satellite in the early 1970s. Landsat’s high-quality scientific data makes multi-decadal time series studies possible and its data are regularly used for land management efforts around the world. The LANDSAT series of satellites celebrated their 49th birthday earlier this year.

The launch was originally scheduled for earlier this month but was delayed due to complexities created by the ongoing pandemic in the United States. Due to an increase in demand for liquid oxygen for COVID patients there was a transportation shortage which impacted over-the-road deliveries of liquid nitrogen (LN2) supplies for launch. The government supplier Defense Logistics Agency coordinated a new delivery of LN2 with their supplier to the base. With rocket fuel on-hand and to make way for other space travel traffic the launch was rescheduled to Monday September 27.









In preparation for launch Landsat 9 was successfully joined or mated with the rest of the Atlas V launch vehicle in the early morning hours of Wednesday September 15 2021. “This is one of the major milestones in the processing operations involving both the observatory team and the launch vehicle team” explained John Satrom the NASA Landsat 9 Launch Integration Manager. “Once the observatory is mated to the launch vehicle ULA assumes responsibility for the health and safety of Landsat 9 as we jointly make the final preparations for launch.”

“We are proud to continue to serve as the primary launch provider for Landsat missions. ULA and our heritage launch vehicles have launched every Landsat mission since 1972” said Gary Wentz ULA vice president of Government and Commercial Programs. “The Landsat series provides outstanding data for Earth environment and science-based research and Landsat 9 will add to these capabilities. We have worked alongside our partners in a challenging health environment to prepare to launch this important mission that will empower Earth research from space for decades to come.”

Landsat 9 is a joint mission of NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). In addition to Landsat 9 this mission includes the ESPA Flight System (EFS) which will deploy multiple CubeSats after Landsat 9 separation. The Atlas V will deploy Landsat 9 and the CubeSats into two different orbits enabling the first four-burn Centaur mission for ULA on an Atlas V rocket. According to ULA the Centaur upper stage has the capacity for increased performance and the flight design of the Landsat 9 mission takes advantage of that capability.

The mission will launch on an Atlas V 401 configuration rocket that includes a 13.7-ft (4-m) Extra Extended Payload Fairing (XEPF) and stands 194 ft. (59 meters) tall. The Atlas booster for this mission is powered by the RD AMROSS RD-180 engine. Aerojet Rocketdyne provided the RL10C-1 engine for the Centaur upper stage.







Launch will occur at Space Launch Complex-3 and the lifting rocket should be visible in the sky across much of southern California. If clear skies allow the rocket should be visible for much of the Los Angeles metro area about 90 seconds after lift-off; San Diego should also be able to see the rocket roughly 3 minutes after lift-off. The rocket will move over the Pacific Ocean in a south-southwest direction.

Those unable to view the rocket in-person in California can watch on NASA TV. NASA plans to begin launch coverage at 10:30 am PT / 1:30 pm ET.

This will be the 88th launch of the Atlas V rocket and 20th mission launched on an Atlas V in partnership with NASA’s Launch Services Program (LSP). This launch is the 300th Atlas launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base. To date ULA has launched 144 times with 100 percent mission success."

Business Wire via AP



The world's biggest carbon-capture plant – which sucks carbon dioxide out of the air – just opened.

A UN report says carbon capture technology is necessary if the world wants to be carbon neutral by 2050.

But many experts think the tech is too expensive and not scalable in the next few decades.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Framed by a backdrop of volcanoes a semi-circle of gigantic fans in Iceland are sucking in air super-heating it then filtering out the carbon dioxide.

This carbon capture and storage facility named Orca turned on two weeks ago after more than 18 months of construction. The fans are embedded in shipping container-sized boxes and once the carbon dioxide is separated it gets mixed with water then travels through snaking fat tubes deep underground where the carbon cools and solidifies.

Through this process Orca can trap and sequester 4000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year – making it the largest facility of its kind in the world (though there are currently only two running).

""Think of it like a vacuum cleaner for the atmosphere"" Julio Friedmann an energy policy researcher at Columbia University who attended the plant's ribbon-cutting ceremony told Insider. ""Nothing else can do what this tech does.""

According to the latest report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) carbon capture and storage is a necessary part of our best-case climate scenarios. But currently facilities like Orca only negate a sliver of global emissions.

Climate scientist Peter Kalmus has done the math: ""If it works in one year it will capture three seconds worth of humanity's CO2 emissions"" he wrote on Twitter.

-Dr Peter Kalmus STOP LINE 3 (@ClimateHuman) September 9 2021

Put another way Kalmus told Insider ""at any given moment it will capture one 10-millionth of humanity's current emissions.""

""It's remarkable to me it is being considered as part of those plans"" he said of the IPCC report.

'Probably the most expensive solution'

The Orca facility works differently than the carbon-capture technologies built into some power plants steel mills and industrial facilities. Those collect the carbon produced in the manufacturing process before it enters the air. It can then be converted into materials like concrete or stored underground.

More than 20 facilities worldwide currently do this most of which are in the US. But that simply prevents more carbon from accumulating in the atmosphere. Orca by contrast is an attempt to deal with the greenhouse gas that's already up there.

This technology known as direct air capture is in its infancy. The Swiss company Climeworks which built Orca has the only operational game in town; its other plant is in Switzerland. Before that the technology had only been used on a small scale in spacecraft and submarines.







Two other plants are in planning phases: The Canadian company Carbon Engineering which is backed by Bill Gates started designing a similar facility in northeastern Scotland three months ago. It also plans to start construction on a a plant in Texas next year. Each of those facilities could remove up to 25 times more carbon per year than Orca.

But as with many emerging technologies direct air capture is expensive. Christoph Gebald Climeworks' co-founder told the Washington Post that it costs at least $600 to capture one metric ton of carbon dioxide since super-heating the air takes a lot of energy.

That cost would need to drop to one-fourth its current level to bring it in line with technologies like wind and solar in terms of their carbon abatement – the degree to which they reduce emissions. To sell carbon commercially – like to beverage companies making fizzy drinks – the price would have to get even lower probably between $65 and $110 per metric ton.

Friedmann thinks a drop to below $200 is likely by 2030 and a drop to $100 two decades after that. By that point he said the market for carbon removal market – companies paying to abate their emissions – will have grown significantly.

But even at that $100 price removing all of humanity's annual carbon emissions would cost more than $5 trillion per year according to Gates' book ""How to Avoid a Climate Disaster."" That would require 50000 Orca plants.

""It's probably the most expensive solution"" Gates wrote.

There's also the question of timing. The IPCC report says that without capturing significant amounts of carbon over the next 30 years it will be impossible to get humanity to net-zero emissions by 2050 – and consequently to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

But Mathew Barlow a climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts Lowell said three decades isn't enough for the technology to be deployed widely.

""There's no possible way for it to scale up on that timescale"" Barlow who contributed to the IPCC report told Insider. ""We're at the point where you need to get the tech off the shelves not be building it out.""

'Fossil-fuel companies love carbon capture'

Plants like Orca do however out-perform their natural counterparts – trees.

""The Orca facility does the work of 200000 trees in 1000 times less space"" Friedmann said.

What's more once a facility like this stores its carbon it's locked away. If trees burn the carbon they've absorbed gets released.

But trees capture carbon at a much lower cost of $50 per metric ton.

Kalmus thinks carbon capture ultimately distracts the world from other solutions that would make a bigger dent in emissions like investment in renewables and regulations targeting the fossil-fuel industry.

""Fossil-fuel companies love carbon capture because it really does let them off the hook"" he said.

Friedmann though thinks it's possible to expand carbon-capture infrastructure enough to make a difference. If the Senate's infrastructure bill passes in the House it would allocate $3.5 billion toward direct air capture facilities in the US. Elon Musk also announced this year that he's funding a $100 million carbon-capture contest.

""We now know that we can do it"" Friedmann said. ""Now we're just haggling over price and literally asking how much we're willing to pay to save the Earth.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL25laWdoYm9yaG9vZC9jeWZhaXIvYXJ0aWNsZS9UZXhhbnMtY2hvb3NlLUN5LUZhaXItY2hpbGQtYXMtS2ljay1PZmYtS2lkLWZvci0xNjQ4NjgzNy5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cy-Fair child chosen as the Kick Off Kid for Houston Texans,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.houstonchronicle.com/neighborhood/cyfair/article/Texans-choose-Cy-Fair-child-as-Kick-Off-Kid-for-16486837.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL25laWdoYm9yaG9vZC9jeWZhaXIvYXJ0aWNsZS9UZXhhbnMtY2hvb3NlLUN5LUZhaXItY2hpbGQtYXMtS2ljay1PZmYtS2lkLWZvci0xNjQ4NjgzNy5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vcmFtcDI0Ny5jb20vcHJvcy1pbi1tb3Rpb24va3FrcS1sYXVuY2hlcy1uaWtraS1zcGljb2xpLW1vcm5pbmdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KQKQ Launches 'Nikki & Spicoli Mornings' – RAMP – Radio and Music Pros,"• NRG Media Hot AC KQKQ (Sweet 98.5)/Omaha today launches its newly revamped morning show — Nikki & Spicoli Mornings makes its market debut at 6am today.

The tech is based on the same idea as Nvidia's DLSS (coming to The Elder Scrolls Online at the same time) only instead of improving performance DLAA uses AI upscaling to improve image quality—reducing jagged edges while running at your native resolution where DLSS runs games at a lower resolution and uses upscaling to make it less noticeable.

DLAA and DLSS are live on ESO's public test server and MxBenchmarkPC's has some footage comparing both to the regular temporal anti-aliasing. The video above was captured on a GeForce RTX 3080 at maximum settings with motion blur and depth of field turned off.

If you're squinting at that footage and having difficulty telling the difference between TAA and DLAA you're not alone. Shadows seem slightly better with DLAA at the cost of some fuzziness maybe? The difference becomes much more noticeable when walking toward stairs. Start the video here and you'll see the moiré shimmer with TAA is absent with DLAA. Whether that's worth your framerate dropping 8% is a question only you can answer.

It is no secret that human motion synthesis has been a complex and as of yet unmet need. Existing techniques are limited by the lack in quality capture data which can be expensive to acquire for training purposes – especially with current technology limitations such as human slow-mo videos.

A research team from NVIDIA University of Toronto and Vector Institute developed a method for generating human motion based on monocular RGB videos that do not require expensive equipment like motion capture. The new system which is more efficient and accurate than previous ones in its class uses contact invariant optimization to refine noisy image-based pose estimates by enforcing physics constraints through computing forces interacting with each other naturally. The researchers refine the model by feeding it through a time-series generative network that synthesizes future motion and contact forces.

By introducing a smooth contact loss function the team could refine pose estimates without using separately trained detectors or solving nonlinear programming problems. The study also demonstrates that when combined with the presented physics-based optimization even without access to motion capture datasets it is still possible and sufficient for an algorithm or model trained through visual pose estimation alone.

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09913.pdf

The referred method was validated on the Human3.6m dataset and demonstrated both qualitatively and quantitatively improved motion synthesis quality and physical plausibility achieved by the proposed model compared to prior work such as PhysCap or HMR models.

Key takeaways:

In this research a new framework was introduced for training motion synthesis models from raw video pose estimations without using any of the expensive and time-consuming processes.

The proposed framework refines noisy pose estimates by enforcing physics constraints through contact invariant optimization including the computation of contact forces.

Time-series generative model was then trained on the refined poses synthesizing both future motion and contact forces.

The detailed analysis of the results demonstrated significant performance boosts in pose estimation via a physics-based refinement and motion synthesis from video.

NVIDIA looks set to resume its potential impulsive up move (medium-term technical analysis)

Time stamped: 26 Sep 2021 at 4:00pm SGT

Source: CMC Markets (click to enlarge chart)

The share price of NVIDIA (NVDA) a major US designer & manufacturer of computer graphics processors has continued to evolve within a medium-term ascending channel in place since its 8 March 2021 low of 115.70.

The recent decline of -10.3% from its recent all-time high of 230.41 printed on 30 August has managed to stage a rebound right at a confluence zone of key technical elements; the 50-day moving average the former medium-term swing high of 5 August and the close to the median line of the aforementioned ascending channel.

In conjunction the daily RSI oscillator has managed to stage a rebound at its 41% significant corresponding support level on 21 September which indicates a potential revival of medium-term upside momentum.

If the 206.37 key medium-term pivotal support holds NVDA may kick start another leg of potential impulsive up move sequence towards the next resistances at 236.15/238.60 & 246.10/249.70 (upper boundary of the ascending channel & Fibonacci expansion cluster levels).

(upper boundary of the ascending channel & Fibonacci expansion cluster levels). On the other hand a daily close below 206.37 invalidates the bullish scenario for an extension of the corrective decline to target the next support zone of 176.60/171.80 (61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent up move from 13 May 2021 to 30 Aug 2021 & the lower boundary of the ascending channel).

Ballard Stadium — until they weren’t.

And then things got downright cruel.

Kyle Vantrease passed for 191 yards and a touchdown and Buffalo survived the wildest of comebacks in a 35-34 non-conference win over Old Dominion.

The Monarchs trailed 35-7 at halftime before scoring four straight touchdowns to reach the brink of tying it with 19 seconds left.

But Nick Rice’s PAT try — turned into a 35-yard kick because of a post-touchdown celebration penalty — sailed wide right ending one of the most thrilling games in the history of the venue.

Ultimately ODU (1-3) fell agonizingly short of overcoming a mistake-riddled first half.

“We’re going to keep fighting to the bitter end” said Monarchs coach Ricky Rahne whose team outgained the Bulls (2-2) 433 yards to 297 in total offense. “There’s no one who’s going to come in here and take what we deserve. We’re just going to keep fighting. No moral victories. We can’t make some of the mistakes we made and expect to beat a good football team but we’ve got to continue to improve.”

The Monarchs might’ve looked their best in one sense and for a while their absolute worst in the sense that matters most. Wearing “Hudson Blue” uniforms — so named for longtime ODU sports information director Carol Hudson — for the first time the Monarchs committed a seemingly endless string of gaffes to fall into a major hole before snapping out of it.

Trailing 35-28 after fumbling on the Buffalo 2-yard line ODU forced a three-and-out to get the ball back on its own 46 with 3:03 to go.

Running their already frenetic offense at top speed the Monarchs arguably should have caught two would-be touchdown passes before a Blake Watson 10-yard run set them up on the 18.

An incomplete DJ Mack Jr. pass on first down stopped the clock with 56 seconds left. Another incompletion was followed by a pass for a 1-yard loss setting up a fourth-and-11 play with everything on the line.

After Bon Jovi’s “Livin’ on a Prayer” pumped the crowd during a timeout with 26 seconds remaining Mack dropped back and threw a jump ball to the back right corner of the end zone. Tight end Zack Kuntz used every bit of his 6-foot-8 frame to pull it from the grasp of a defender and the place went nuts.

Unfortunately for the Monarchs so did a player on their sideline who was flagged for coming onto the field.

That set up Rice’s kick which knocked the air out of the place.

Rice who became the school’s career field-goals leader last week and had missed just one PAT in his career had the support of his teammates.

“It’s easy when you’re brothers” Mack said. “You just talk him up.

“That’s just the way life works. And as humans and as teammates it’s our job to keep him going. Because if not then it could be worse.”

Old Dominion defensive coordinator Blake Seiler left celebrates with linebacker Ryan Henry (8) after Henry came up with a big stop on third down against Buffalo in the first quarter at S.B. Ballard Stadium on Saturday September 25 2021 in Norfolk Va.

Mack passed for 224 yards and a touchdown while rushing for 84 yards and two scores. He threw an interception and was sacked four times.

Rahne was far from pinning the loss on Rice whose lone previous missed extra point came on a blocked kick.

“No one play ever wins or loses a football game — ever ever in the history of football” Rahne said.

Speaking of history at 3 hours 53 minutes the game was the longest ODU’s ever played.

In pitching a second-half shutout ODU’s defense held the Bulls to 40 total yards on 20 offensive plays. The Monarchs had 319 yards and ran 51 plays.

“I feel like it shows the glimpses of who we can be and who we want to be and who we’ve believed we could’ve been since camp started” said linebacker Jordan Young. “It shows the team what we want to continue to build and work towards. Every moment we spend together every opportunity we get to play we’re building towards that.”

What could have been a game-tying drive ended with an Isiah Paige fumble at the Buffalo 2 with 4:07 remaining.

Jon-Luke Peaker’s 7-yard touchdown run with 8:36 remaining in the fourth quarter pulled the Monarchs to within striking distance at 35-28. It ended a quick five-play 63-yard drive that consumed just 1:48.

With his team down four scores Mack scored a pair of unanswered third-quarter touchdowns — from 42 and 2 yards — to change the complexion of what had been a laugher pulling the Monarchs to within 35-21 by the period’s end.

ODU trailed 35-7 at halftime after putting up just 114 total yards to the Bulls’ 252.

When the Monarchs’ opening drive of the second half ended with a fourth-and-10 sack of Mack at midfield the exits — and probably the bars — started to fill.

Perhaps the most the announced crowd of 18197 got worked up in the first half was when the Bulls’ Jake Zimmer was whistled for unnecessary roughness in the waning seconds after he slung Paige into the punter’s practice net on Buffalo’s sideline. The officials intervened in the ensuing skirmish and cooler heads quickly prevailed.

With his team already leading by three touchdowns Buffalo’s Tim Terry scooped up an Elijah Davis fumble and returned it 67 yards to give the Bulls a 35-7 lead with just over three minutes to go in the half.

Dylan McDuffie scored on a 20-yard run to give Buffalo a 28-7 lead with 3:14 remaining in the second quarter.

Vantrease’s 13-yard touchdown pass to Quian Williams gave the Bulls a 21-7 lead with 8:28 to go in the first half.

Vantrease’s 4-yard touchdown run finished a 74-yard 11-play drive to give the Bulls a 14-7 lead just over two minutes into the second quarter.

The game marked the first meeting between the Monarchs and Buffalo which plays in the Mid-American Conference.

ODU hadn’t played a game this season with a scoring margin smaller than 28 points including last week’s 45-17 loss at Liberty.

Rahne said he learned something about his players as they got embroiled in their first dogfight.

“That the pressure of the moment didn’t impact their performance” he said. “We kept playing. It didn’t matter what was going on. Our defense kept playing. Our offense kept playing. We had some things go wrong in the second half and we just kept playing.”

Special teams figured into things early and often.

The Monarchs blocked a first-quarter punt and returned it to the Buffalo 22. Four plays later Blake Watson jammed it in to tie the game at 7 with 2:37 remaining in the period.

After ODU blocked a punt on the Bulls’ opening possession to set up the Monarchs on the Buffalo 11 Rice attempted a 24-yard field goal.

But the Bulls’ C.J. Bazile blocked it and returned it 90 yards down the right sideline for the game’s first score with 10:14 left in the first quarter.

After a calming talk from Rahne at halftime the Monarchs managed to pull it together.

“The second half was really honed in on making sure everybody was in their spot doing their job not trying to do too much” Young said. “I feel like once we did that we honestly didn’t present them with that many options.”

(ODUSports.com) - Old Dominion University football hosts Buffalo on Saturday Sept. 25 at Kornblau Field at S.B. Ballard Stadium in the final non-conference game of the regular season. ODU will wear Hudson Blue uniforms for the first time in football program history.

• ODU lost at Liberty 45-17 last week while Buffalo fell to No. 16 Coastal Carolina 28-25.

• In his return to Lynchburg Elijah Davis had 11 carries for 57 yards and a touchdown. He also caught two passes for four yards.

• Tight end Zack Kuntz and wide receiver Stone Smartt each recorded career highs with four receptions. Kuntz caught four passes for 60 yards and a touchdown while Smartt had four receptions for 27 yards. The touchdown catch was the first of Kuntz's career. He also made his first career start.

• Linebacker Ryan Henry had a game-high and career-best nine tackles. He also recorded a tackle for loss.

• Redshirt freshman John Morton had a busy day on Saturday. Morton the long snapper on punts recovered a muffed punt to set up ODU's first points a Nick Rice field goal. A kick in which Morton was the holder on.

• Linebacker Jordan Young had six tackles. He is fourth in school history with 268 career tackles. He is 73 stops away from tying Craig Wilkins' school record of 340 career tackles.

Records Fall

Senior kicker Nick Rice broke the school career record for field goals with his 50th last week. Rice was tied with Jarod Brown who is ODU's all-time leader in points. Rice is 6-for-6 on field goals so far this season.

Sack Masters

Four defensive ends on the team have accumulated sacks so far this season with three of them recording the first sacks of their careers. Amorie Morrison Marcus Haynes Deeve Harris and Cory Jackson have all notched sacks with all but Haynes registering their first. ODU is tied for third in C-USA with eight sacks. All but one of those sacks comes from a defensive end. Steven Williams is the only non-defensive end to have a sack so far this season for Old Dominion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3ZpcmdpbmlhL2FsbC1zcG9ydHMvdXZhLWZpZWxkLWhvY2tleS1naXZlcy11cC10d28tbGF0ZS1nb2Fscy1pbi1sb3NzLXRvLW9kddIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No. 11 UVA Field Hockey Defeated by No. 21 Old Dominion,"Amber Ezechiels gave Virginia the early lead but the Monarchs scored twice in the final ten minutes of the game to steal the win

For fifty minutes of Sunday afternoon’s game between No. 11 Virginia and No. 21 Old Dominion it appeared that the Cavaliers were on their way to securing their third win over a ranked opponent in as many games.

ODU had other plans.

The Monarchs scored twice in less than two minutes late in the game to steal the 2-1 victory at UVA.

After a scoreless first quarter Virginia struck first on a goal by senior back Amber Ezechiels on a penalty corner. Greer Gill and Meghen Hengerer set up the shot for Ezechiels who put it in for her third goal of the season tied for second on the team.

Virginia outshot ODU 5-2 in the second quarter and 12-7 for the match overall. However shots on goal were even at six for each team.

UVA added four more shots in the third quarter but could not get any of them to find their mark.

With ten minutes remaining in the fourth quarter the Monarchs got loose on a fast break. Marlon de Bruijne found Illse Westera who put the ball past UVA goalkeeper Tyler Kennedy to knot the match at 1-1. Kennedy made four saves on six shots on goal in the match.

Just one minute and 43 seconds later ODU scored again to take the lead on a goal by Marlee McLendon on a penalty corner. Meghan Smart set up the shot for McClendon who fired a low rocket into the back left corner of the cage for her seventh goal of the season.

The Cavaliers who were running out the clock on a victory just a couple of minutes earlier suddenly found themselves desperately trying to find an equalizer.

ODU goalkeeper Cam MacGillivray made five saves on six shots faced to give the Monarchs enough time to mount the comeback and then the ODU defense tightened up not allowing UVA to even attempt a shot in the final 8 minutes of the game.

With the loss Virginia drops to 6-3 overall and 1-1 in the ACC. The Cavaliers are 2-2 in their last four games each of which have been against ranked opponents.

Up next Virginia hosts No. 18 Duke on Friday at 5pm.

Since the initial months of the pandemic a number of companies across sectors have highlighted their concerns about the problem. Demand for chips is exceeding supply and many automobile manufacturers and consumer electronics companies across the world have said that production will be affected.

The unforeseen situation is not expected to improve anytime soon and supply constraints could potentially continue into 2023. Though companies are on a war footing to ramp up production the problem will likely worsen before reaching a resolution.

Intel's chief executive Pat Gelsinger recently warned that the worst is yet to come. He told the BBC that it will be ""a year or two"" before supplies return to normal.

The Quad Alliance - India  US Japan  and Australia - has joined hands to secure supply chains in critical areas such as semiconductors and 5G telecom technologies in a bid to contain the rising influence of China in these strategic sectors according to geopolitical experts.""Resilient diverse and secure technology supply chains - for hardware software and services - are vital to our shared national interests"" the US said in a statement during the first-ever in-person summit of Quad leaders in Washington on Friday.Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined US President Joe Biden Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in calling for ""close cooperation on supply chains with allies and partners who share our values"" with an aim to enhancing ""security and prosperity"" of the four partner nations and to ""strengthen capacity to respond to international disasters and emergencies"".The agreement comes at a time when there is a global shortage of semiconductors.Several nations including China Japan and the US are racing to build significant domestic capacity. India for the third time in two decades is attempting to build local semiconductor manufacturing capabilities by offering incentives to global firms to set up fabrication units in the country that can be used to supply silicon chips both to the local market as well as become a base for global supplies.""This (the Quad agreement) is very positive for India. Multilateral cooperation on semiconductors is the only way as self-sufficiency has not yielded results"" said Pranay Kotasthane who specialises in high-tech geopolitics as deputy director at The Takshashila Institution a Bengaluru-based think tank.Modi who met Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon in Washington DC this week asked the American company to step up its India investments in areas such as chips used in 5G telecom networks. Globally Taiwan dominates the worldwide semiconductor manufacturing arena. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co its flagship company is also the world's largest producer for over half of the globe's semiconductor requirements including advanced 5 nanometer chips. It plans to make 3 nanometer chips later this year.The Quad's focus on securing high-tech supply chains is also due to this global dependency on Taiwan which has a strained relationship with China Kotasthane said. ""China has been violating Taiwanese air space and there have been cyber-attacks on Taiwan. These are risks and it can lead to supply chain bottlenecks. We already see it in the automotive industry. Collectively Quad wants to rejig the supply chain and ensure the adversary doesn't have key controls of the supply chain"" he said.The four leaders have also jointly agreed on a framework of Quad principles that will drive the future of technology design development governance and use. The Quad is also focused on fostering and promoting a diverse resilient and secure telecommunications ecosystem it said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vcmZvbmxpbmUub3JnL2V4cGVydC1zcGVhay9zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1jb3JwLXNtaWMtZ2VhcnMtdXAtdG8tZG91YmxlLWl0cy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWJ5LTIwMjXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) gears up to double its production by 2025,"One of the unforeseeable consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic is the shortage of semiconductor chips across the world. According to a report from Susquehanna Financial Group the global chip crunch has gotten worse since July and the wait time—the gap between the companies placing orders for semiconductors and receiving them—has hit an all-time high at 21 weeks. It has impacted several sectors especially the consumer electronics and automobiles industries. The situation is much worse for a few Chinese companies who face the dual challenge of logistics disruption caused by the pandemic and US sanctions. However Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) China's would-be national semiconductor champion is determined to fill in the void by scaling up.

SMIC is on track with the construction of new chip fabrication plants in different cities despite lingering risks of US restrictions that may prevent its acquisition of production equipment. On September 3 SMIC announced its plan to establish a new factory in the Lin-Gang Special area—part of Shanghai's free trade zone. The proposed US $8.87-billion worth foundry has a planned monthly production capacity of 100000 12-inch wafers. Earlier in March this year SMIC announced that it would work with the Shenzhen government to invest in a US $2.35 billion project to produce 28 nanometre (nm) and above integrated circuits to produce 40000 12-inch wafers per month. Last year it unveiled its plan to partner with Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area Management Committee (BDAC) to develop facilities to produce 12-inch wafers. If all this is accomplished SMIC's output should nearly double by 2025. The new investments aim to ease the semiconductor shortage while reducing Chinese demand for imported semiconductors.

SMIC is on track with the construction of new chip fabrication plants in different cities despite lingering risks of US restrictions that may prevent its acquisition of production equipment

SMIC's latest infrastructure expansion plans came a day after the company reported revenue of US $1.34 billion in the second quarter of 2021; an increase of 43.2 percent year over year mainly on the back of strong demand from manufacturing enterprises. SMIC's last year listing on the STAR market the Sci-Tech Innovation Board of Shanghai Stock Exchange explicitly showed the market's confidence in the firm. State media reported that SMIC raised US $6.55 billion in the Shanghai public offering more than double its initial target. The company also received preferential treatment in its listing process as authorities fast-tracked its application to support the hometown semiconductor manufacturing giant. Moreover SMIC has robust financial backing from the state. As per SMIC's exchange filing an investment entity designated by the Shanghai government will take a 25 percent stake in the mega fab in Shanghai. Government-backed Shenzhen Major will hold a stake of about 23 percent in the joint venture in Shenzhen. BDAC pledged to invest US $2.4 billion in the first phase worth US $7.6 billion of the project with SMIC.

SMIC raised US $6.55 billion in the Shanghai public offering more than double its initial target. The company also received preferential treatment in its listing process as authorities fast-tracked its application to support the hometown semiconductor manufacturing giant.

Despite the strong state support SMIC is at least a decade behind the global chip giants in technology. SMIC's most advanced production lines can manufacture 14 nm Fin Field Effect Transistor chips while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung are currently producing 5 nm chips and are moving towards 3nm. This means SMIC can cash in by producing automotive ICs and other semiconductor products for consumer electronics that are currently in short supply. Still it cannot climb up the value chain anytime soon as it cannot produce advanced chips used in cell phones and PCs.

Lack of talent and access to advanced technologies are significant challenges in the path of SMIC. Since investment in research and development does not yield results instantly SMIC has been building up its management and technical expertise by aggressively recruiting and generously rewarding engineers from foreign firms especially TSMC which has irked Taiwan. On the other hand apart from putting SMIC on the export blacklist the US has been trying to block the supply of advanced lithography machines from other countries to China.

The world's fourth-largest chip foundry SMIC seems to be China's best hope at achieving self-sufficiency in semiconductors. However it is yet to be seen how successful that bet would be.

This complex and hyperglobal supply chain worked so seamlessly that its functioning got taken for granted.

This perception has changed in a matter of months. First semiconductors became a domain of confrontation between the US and China. And then the demand shock of COVID-19 led to a severe shortage of chips in automobiles medical devices and other sectors. And finally fears of a Chinese takeover of Taiwan—which alone accounts for nearly 73 per cent of the world’s global contract chip manufacturing—have made countries scramble for alternatives. And so from being at the margins of the technology policy agenda of several countries semiconductors have become a primary focus area. Little wonder then that the first in-person Quad Summit meeting on September 24 had semiconductors on its agenda.

What Got Discussed at Quad Summit?

One of the outcomes of the first-ever Quad summit-level meeting on March 12 2021 was establishing a critical and emerging technologies (C&ET) working group. At the time there was no common understanding of which technologies classify as “critical” and “emerging”. The technology cooperation plan appeared to be too dispersed to enable any concrete action.

Six months later we have a much clearer picture. The Quad leaders’ summit identified four focus areas: 5G communications technical standards collaboration biotechnology and semiconductors.

On semiconductors Quad launched an initiative to “map capacity identify vulnerabilities and bolster supply-chain security for semiconductors and their vital components.” The summit fact sheet adds that the Quad partners should collectively support a diverse and competitive market for producing semiconductors. The last sentence is significant—it signals a shift in mindset from national indigenisation to strategic cooperation. Here’s how.

Starting 2015 China’s ‘Made in China 2025’—a state-led industrial policy for technology including semiconductor indigenisation—unsettled many democracies. In response these countries started offering massive incentives and subsidies to attract local semiconductor manufacturing.

In February 2021 US President Biden signed an executive order to address the shortage. Earlier in April 2020 India launched its production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme to ‘crowd in’ investment in this sector. Then in June 2021 Japan formulated a draft growth strategy promising generous financial incentives to cutting-edge chip-making facilities. Despite these initiatives semiconductor self-sufficiency remains a distant dream for all these countries.

The complexity and costs of the semiconductor supply chain demand a global supply chain. Rapid improvements in the processing capabilities of our devices have happened precisely because of a globally diversified semiconductor supply chain. This approach has allowed companies to specialise and excel in one or two stages of the supply chain relying on companies from other countries for the remaining stages. Semiconductor Industry Association a prominent industry voice estimates that a typical semiconductor production process spans 4+ countries 3+ trips around the world 25000 miles travelled and 12 days in transit. To overturn the economic logic of comparative advantage countries would need to continually divert their scarce resources to build and support indigenous semiconductor manufacturing.

This is why a multilateral approach such as the Quad’s Semiconductor Supply Chain Initiative makes sense. Instead of aiming for national self-sufficiency Quad countries seem to agree now that they need to ensure redundancy in the global semiconductor ecosystem so that an adversary does not dominate it.

Multilateral strategic cooperation can achieve this goal. Using countries’ existing comparative advantages instead of duplicating them will lead to sharing costs and complementing each other’s strengths to accelerate innovation.

It is in this respect that Quad is suitable for semiconductor collaboration. The US is a global leader in the semiconductor design stage. American companies also dominate two key stages upstream to the design process—electronic design automation (EDA) and licensed intellectual property. Japanese companies enjoy a dominant position in semiconductor materials and chemicals used for manufacturing chips. Japan also leads the market in silicon wafers substrates on which ICs (integrated circuits) get made. Australia occupies an important place in the broader electronics supply chain as it has access to critical materials and advanced mining capabilities. Finally semiconductor design requires large numbers of skilled engineers where India’s strength lies. Collectively the Quad has most of the building blocks to make the semiconductor supply chain resilient and China-free.

Is This Supply Chain Initiative Enough?

Mapping the supply chain vulnerability should only be a first step of the collaboration. The grouping can directly bolster supply chain security in the following ways.

One Quad can form a consortium aimed at building a diversified semiconductor manufacturing base. The consortium could create a roadmap for new manufacturing facilities across Quad countries. The focus should be to collectively have access to manufacturing at the leading-edge nodes (5 nanometres and below) and critical trailing-edge nodes (45 nanometres and above). The latter will continue to remain workhorses for automotive communications (5G) and AI.

Two Quad can sponsor new standard developments such as composite semiconductors and create one centre for excellence (CoE) in each Quad country in an area of its immediate interest. For example Australia could host the CoE for new materials in electronics Japan could host the CoE for silicon manufacturing equipment and the US and India could host CoEs on specific fabless design architectures.

Three Quad can facilitate strategic alliances between companies in each other’s countries. For example faster visa processing and lower employment barriers for semiconductor professionals in Quad member countries could facilitate higher technology exchange and joint development levels. Removing technology transfer restrictions could make overseas licensing easier. Easing capital flows in this sector could again foster more joint development projects.

What Does India Gain?

India should use the Quad collaboration to get a Japanese or American company to manufacture semiconductors in India even if it’s at a trailing-edge node such as 65 nm. Collaborating with partners would minimise the risk of failures while ensuring India’s core defence and strategic interests are secured.

Moreover the AUKUS defence alliance has shown that the US is willing to share sensitive technologies with key partners something it wasn’t amenable to in the past. This new technology alliance mindset should become the norm in Quad as well. India should push for the US to lower investment barriers and reduce export controls.

Apart from IC manufacturing India should double down on its core strength. In a Takshashila Institution report titled India’s Semiconductor Ecosystem: A SWOT Analysis we observed that India has an outright advantage in semiconductor design. The next step should be to encourage indigenous intellectual property creation. PM Modi’s meeting with the Qualcomm CEO is vital in this regard. With more multinational companies moving their cutting-edge semiconductor design to Indian offices the Indian ecosystem will develop organically.

Finally given India’s developmental challenges its financial incentives for technology R&D are unlikely to match what richer countries can afford. In such a situation India must adopt an allied approach to technology cooperation. For developing critical and emerging technologies multilateral cooperation is a necessity not a choice.

The US stock market has been content to rally to new highs with many stocks going to the Moon including most of our AI tech giants a rally that I have been distributing into to the extent that I have now sold 80% of my holdings in the Top 6 AI stocks in my portfolio some of which I have been accumulating for over a decade (Microsoft). The primary objective of this analysis is the determine where we stand in terms of THE TOP after all all bull markets eventually do top either ending with a CRASH (1987) or a bear market (2000 and 2007). So what to hold and what to sell is the question I am asking myself with a view to riding out a potential bear market / crash where this analysis deploys a new automated metric of individual stock SELLING LEVELs so that one better knows where one stands in terms of ones portfolio all in just one table. After all the risk we all fear is that of a 2000 style collapse that sends stocks lower for the next 20 years! Remember that bear market bottomed with a 85% collapse for tech stocks! Yes one could say the likes of Amazon Microsoft Apple had become dirt cheap but that would have been a very painful and prolonged discounting event. So a case of balancing the risks of letting some stocks ride whilst cashing in those that will pay a heavy price for their over exuberance all whilst being aware of the AI mega-trend trundling along in the background.

And we have the likes of AMD going to the MOON yes in hindsight we can all wish we had bought more I came close in Mid May to buying more but at that time was fully invested and thought it unwise to take on even more risk on. But I and my patrons have had plenty of opportunities to buy AMD all the way from the March 2020 lows right up until my analysis of 10th of May at a price of $78 or better that AMD traded down to several times so I will give AMD extra attention in this article.

Stock Market Bubble Valuations 2000 vs 2021

How to quickly know if a stock is over valued or under valued\? Simply divide the annual earnings by the price and you get a trailing price / earnings ratio. Whilst far from being perfect hence why I have long since progressed to what I call the EC Ratio a formulae used to better determine if a stock is Expensive or Cheap (EC) based on 15 metric that also includes the Price / Earnings ratio. Nevertheless I still use the P/E ratio when referring to stocks because I generate the EC ratio only for a handful of stocks. Maybe one day I will get around to writing a web application that automatically generates it for any stock and makes the results available to patrons.

So how do today's tech giant market cap stocks compare to those of March 2000 at the peak of the Nasdaq dot com bubble.

Firstly here is how the giant mega-trend corps of the dot com era have faired over the past 21 years.

Microsoft's stock price in March 2000 was trading at $120 on a earnings multiple of 56 as the stock was in a race to become the worlds first $1 trillion market cap stock. Set this against today's price of $289 and multiple of 36 coupled with an EC score of 71. So whilst Microsoft today is not exactly cheap neither has it reached its 2000 bubble valuation for that Microsoft would be trading at $450! And before one considers holders having been invested in winner that survived the dot com crash bear in mind the following chart which shows that Microsoft (allowing for stock splits) would only have cleared its Dot com high during 2017! That is 17 YEARS! And during that time one would have seen the value of ones investment fall to a low of 25% of the stocks high.

CISCO - The backbone of the then fast developing internet much as Tesla is the backbone of the fast emerging EV and automated vehicles sector with the likes of Google throwing tens of billions into AI and robotics each year. Everyone owned Cisco just as everyone owns Google Amazon Apple or Facebook stock today.

Back In March 2000 Cisco was trading at a price of $146 on a PE of 120 to the moon TO THE MOON! Where many were concerned Cisco WAS the Internet one of the most valuable certification tracks of the time were those by Cisco where even I was CCNA certified desperately trying not to get further sucked into the highly costly Cisco certification tracks where CCNA gave way to CCNP to CCIE and beyond the certifications were mushrooming into more OTT levels than what scientology has! CCNA OTTIV where after decades and several hundreds of thousands of dollars one would become one with the internet be able to move data packets around with their mind! Other companies soon saw what a money spinner the certification tracks were and so the likes of Microsoft started their own such as Microsoft Office certifications but I digress.

So what happened to the King of the Internet Cisco which according to many at the time was destined to go to the MOON!

Well even 21 years later Cisco has still not even recovered to the half way mark in market cap terms even the share price trades below the March high of $146 splitted to $78 this despite extensive buy backs in recent years to try and drive the price higher to overcome that $78 brick wall!. The P/E ratio says it all as to why where Cisco's current P/E of 23 is a far cry from 120 that it was trading at 21 years ago and thus sowed the seeds for what transpired since.

Imagine all those who either bought in the months before or after the dot com bubble top and decided to hang on have YET to break even! You have to understand that in March 2020 it was a done deal Cisco was the Nvidia was the Amazon was the Apple of its time destined to become the worlds first $1 trillion stock! Whilst everyone recognised there were many over priced stocks but CISCO was BLUE CHIP! Cisco was going to OWN the future! GAME OVER as Cisco WAS the internet!

Just as many take today's multi trillion dollar corps as unassailable blue chips. And then we have the insane valuations of the likes of TESLA trading on a PE of 364! Understand this when the bubble bursts Tesla's fate will be worse than any of the top 5 of 2000!

Digging further into the depths of internet history courtesy if Cisco's network hardware here's what one investment analyst (Paul Weinstein) working for First Boston said of Cisco in March 2020.

""We humbly submit that over the next two to three years Cisco could be the first trillion dollar market cap company and don't think they woudln;'t love it"" As Weiensten put Cisco on a ""Strong Buy"" at virtually it's final HIGH! Three years later Cisco instead of doubling had collapsed to 1/10th it's March high!

INTEL's 2000 stock price high of $76 had the chip giant trading on an earnings multiple of 42 which is hardly exuberant in today's terms. Today Intel trades at $54 on a P/E of just 12. If intel was trading on par with that of its 2000 high then the stock price today would at $189. Which also suggests Intel has never managed to fully recover from the dot com bust mostly down to failure to innovate due to bad management hence for a good 6 years was stuck at 7nm whilst tiny competitors such as AMD have grabbed CPU market share. In recent years every time Intel dips below $48 I tend to buy a little who knows given it's low valuation a breakout above $76 may send Intel to the moon once more. And this is how the Intel stock price has faired over the past 21 years.

The EC ratio for Intel is just 10 which makes Intel in any era bull or bear dirt cheap! Look even if AMD is crushing it like a bug at an EC of 10 there really isn't much downside! Hence any dip is a buy op even if upside is going to take several years of INNOVATION!

I think you get the picture so I won't repeat the exercise for Oracle and IBM.

Tech Stocks in a Bubble today?

US GDP in 2000 was $10 trillion with Microsoft at 5.65% of US GDP today's largest stock is Apple on a market cap $2.4 trillion which is 10.5% of US GDP of $22.7 trillion!

Yep sorry to burst your bubble but we are in a bubble!

And remember I am not looking at the loss making junk stocks of that age but the tech giants. Hence why I de-risked by selling out of Nvidia Apple Microsoft and Amazon. Whilst I will cling onto Google at 50% and Facebook at 30% as they are the best of the best.

Amazon to the MOON 2021! Then what?

YES Apple Amazon Facebook Google and Nvidia all have highly compelling reasons for why they should all continue keep going to the MOON! But so did all of the tech giants in 2000!

And 20 years on only Microsoft eventually made it through to the other side to new all time highs. Imagine holding Intel in 2000 for which one had every reason to continue to hold just as there is every reason to hold Google Apple or Amazon today! And then look at what happened to the likes of Intel over the next 20 years! Where the stock price is STILL yet to trade to new highs! And this despite stock BUYBACKS!

As for Intel today well it is where Microsoft was about 5 years ago when everyone thought it was game over for Microsoft just as everyone thinks its game over for Intel today given that AMD has won! BUT I am pretty confident that we will be seeing Intel in the not too distant future leaving it's sleeping giant status and doing it's own moon shot.

So I hope this acts as a wake up call for my Patrons who think investing is just a case of dollar cost averaging as one really does need mechanisms to disinvest from over valued stocks even though it is is extremely hard to do so after all no one wanted to sell any of the tech giants in March 2000 given the amount of too the moon cool aid that was sloshing around at the time but within a few short months many wish they had!

For instance it was painful for me to hit the SELL button on Microsoft a stock that I have been accumulating from when it was trading in the $20's! With my intention to buy back some day soon but as what has happened to chinese stocks illustrates one just does not know what is around the corner that could trigger a collapse in stock prices by 50% or more to a level where most are then too afraid to buy.

So in a few months time we may be living in a completely different world where the likes of Microsoft Amazon and Apple after a plunge in price have most investors who were happy to pile in at all time highs with their dollar cost averaging mantra are then too scared to either buy or sell as they watch in fear stock market armageddon take place all whilst the MSM blogosFear and Youtubers reinforce their state of paralysis acting as echo chambers just regurgitating that which others have posted.

As for what I will be doing ? BUYING the PANIC! Even if I turn out to be early because during the mayhem most of the pieces of the puzzle will be unknown.

Not long after selling software company Endeca to Oracle in 2011 for over $1 billion Steve Papa called Bessemer Venture Partners with a hot tip. He said three of his best engineers were working on something new that Bessemer which had previously backed Endeca would be crazy not to fund. Kent Bennett who'd been a junior associate on the Endeca deal fielded the call. He told Papa there was some empty space at the firm's office in Boston that his people could use. But Bennett knew he couldn't get his firm one of the biggest and most successful in the venture industry to write a check to three engineers with an unspecified project. ""I said 'Well just send them over here and they can hang out here until they figure it out'"" Bennett told CNBC recalling his conversation with Papa. The three guys and some office space eventually became Toast a provider of software and hardware to restaurants that held its New York Stock Exchange debut on Wednesday closing the day with a market cap of over $31 billion. (It's since slipped to $28 billion.) The three co-founders — Steve Fredette Aman Narang and Jonathan Grimm — are billionaires and remain top executives at the company. Fredette Narang and Grimm now have about 2200 co-workers. They call them Toasters.

watch now

Bessemer eventually ended up investing in Toast in 2015 and Bennett joined the board. But even though it's one of the largest holders with over a 12% stake the returns would've been much larger had Bessemer jumped in earlier. Bennett told one of his partners he'd made a ""massive mistake"" by passing. It wasn't just Bessemer. Venture capitalists wanted nothing to do with the restaurant industry where margins are low and budgets notoriously tight. So in early 2013 Papa filled the initial void by investing $500000 of his own money into his buddies' start-up. ""I said 'guys it's not my space but you helped me be successful and I owe it to you'"" Papa who was on the Toast board until recently said in an interview after the IPO. ""I was going to help them no matter what. In this case it meant capital to get them going. Did we understand the shape of it at that time? No."" Papa's investment today can be measured in billions. As of Friday's close his 12% stake in Toast is worth $3.1 billion amassed from the initial investment and follow-on funding. He controls slightly less than Bessemer which owns $3.3 billion in Toast shares after investing just over $100 million between 2015 and early 2020.

No 'West Coast offense'

Start-up origin stories are part of the fabric of the tech industry. Apple and Google famously started in Silicon Valley garages Facebook was built by a boy-wonder Harvard dropout and PayPal came together through an awkward collaboration between Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and included an exhaustive list of engineers who would go on to build other billion-dollar companies. Increasingly Silicon Valley stories have become more formulaic thanks to programs such as Y Combinator which has turned into a Unicorn factory over the past decade. The start-up incubator has helped spawn Dropbox  Airbnb  Stripe DoorDash  Coinbase and Instacart and serves as a direct path to meetings with the top venture capitalist firms. Toast was born on the other side of the country and a world away. The founders lived in the Boston area and had no plans to leave. Boston had been a venture hub in an earlier era but the momentum had shifted to Silicon Valley where all the big exits were taking place. Bessemer has offices in both locations. Papa said one Bay Area VC indicated interest in the pitch for Toast but said he didn't want to get on a plane. Fredette Toast's president said the company's East Coast roots ultimately became an advantage because it could be ""a little unconstrained by the traditional wisdom of grow grow grow."" ""We used to talk about West Coast offense which was hype over substance"" Fredette said in an interview from the NYSE on Wednesday. ""East Coast would be substance first and not enough hype."" The founders sprinkled in a healthy dose of naivete. Fredette said they were so inexperienced with fundraising and business in general that he and Narang the chief operating officer would often debate each other during investor meetings. The original idea for Toast came from all the hours Fredette Narang and Grimm spent hanging out in Boston bars cafes and restaurants trying to figure out what to build. After experiencing a particularly long wait time for the check one day they thought they'd found a problem that could be fixed by paying the check from their smartphone — if only the technology existed. They developed an app and launched it in 2012 with Firebrand Saints a bar they frequented in Cambridge. The app gave customers a way to start a tab at the restaurant and link a credit card. ""We used to go there a lot after work to get a burger and a beer"" Fredette said. As they slowly expanded in the region they signed up Dwelltime a cafe in Cambridge. That's where Bennett got to demo the product. The transaction went through. Still Bennett was terrified of putting money into a company that was trying to take on incumbent point-of-sale (POS) vendors like Micros which Oracle bought in 2014 for $5.3 billion and NCR . ""To me it sounded like a suicide mission"" said Bennett recalling that he told the founders it would take them five years to build something viable. ""These legacy systems were old and painful but they were 50000 features into a really complex roadmap."" Meanwhile Papa would soon start flying around the country trying to help land new business deals and recruit talent. One place he wasn't going: The Bay Area. ""We intentionally chose not to put reps in Silicon Valley"" Papa said. As long as potential competitors didn't see the product in action they could continue ""arrogantly dismissing it"" he said. Instead Papa was traveling to places like Grand Rapids Michigan home to a 124-year old company called Gordon Food Service. Gordon distributed food to restaurants across the country and became a critical distribution partner for Toast. ""We focused on the middle of the country which was mostly overlooked"" Papa said. Toast quickly evolved from a relatively simple mobile app at Firebrand Saints and a few other spots to a more complete back-end restaurant system that used Android tablets as terminals. At the time iPads were the far superior product and were being used by buzzy start-ups like Revel Systems. Toast opted for Google's open source Android technology which allowed the company to design its own hardware and customize software rather than being restricted to Apple's closed system.

Toast's point-of-sale system. Toast

By late 2015 Toast was up to 170 employees had millions of dollars in revenue and was used in thousands of restaurants including Costa Vida a Mexican-themed chain with 75 locations and Beach Hut Deli which had 40 locations on the West Coast. Chris Comparato another Endeca alum had just joined as CEO. That's when Bessemer finally took the plunge leading a $30 million round along with Google's venture arm at a valuation of about $100 million. Bennett said the big move that changed his thinking was Toast's push into payments. As a full POS vendor that was getting a cut of every transaction on the system Toast at last had a volume business with a consistent and profitable revenue stream. They used margin from payment processing to support software development Bennett said and the business model clearly worked. In a memo to the firm in December 2015 Bennett wrote that ""we've stood by anxiously as the team hit obvious product-market fit but punted on raising more equity."" To get onto the cap table Bennett was having monthly dinners with the founders trying to convince them to take Bessemer's money. He also recalled telling Felda Hardymon his mentor at the firm ""I think this will be the biggest business Boston has ever seen.'"" Papa was making similar pronouncements as he tried luring investors. In a June 2015 presentation he wrote in one slide that Toast had ""the potential to be the next Uber or Airbnb valued in the many billions"" and that it had ""potential to build $10b+ exit."" ""In fairness to VCs a lot of people put stuff like that on slides"" Papa said. ""We have survivorship bias.""

Toast in 2015 Steve Papa

Bessemer was very bullish but it never predicted Toast would be worth this much. In Bennett's memo he laid out potential outcomes and how much the firm would receive in each case. The off-the-charts ""just goes nuts"" scenario would produce an $8.3 billion company and a $700 million return for Bessemer.

'Oh my god we're going to lose it'

Toast's growth trajectory over the next four-plus years was so dramatic that in February 2020 the company raised $400 million at a $5 billion valuation. Annual revenue had swelled to $665 million mostly from payment transaction fees. Toast was helped by a 10-year bull market in the tech industry featuring astronomical valuations for companies across the board. A month after that mega-financing round it almost all came crashing down. The Covid-19 pandemic immediately exposed Toast's glaring risk: Reliance on a single industry. As infections spread rapidly restaurants across the country saw revenue plunge 80% in March squashing Toast's business. Cash quickly dwindled and Toast was force to slash about 50% of its workforce in April eliminating roughly 1300 jobs. ""With limited visibility into how quickly the industry may recover and facing slower than anticipated growth we now find ourselves in the unenviable position of reducing our headcount"" Comparato wrote in a blog post announcing the job cuts. At the board level panic set in. ""Immediately we said we're burning a ton of capital and are going to go out of business if we don't do something now"" Bennett said. ""I remember everyday going by thinking 'oh my god we're going to lose it.'"" Even more shocking was the speed of the rebound. Restaurants reopened their doors to takeout and outdoor dining and brought in a bunch of new technology to enable contactless ordering and mobile payments. Toast's POS system had expanded to include inventory management payroll and multi-location menu controls which were all useful in simplifying a manager's job. But what restaurants really needed was a takeout app that synced with their existing system and a way for diners and wait staff to limit contact. So they turned to Toast for newer products like curbside notifications for takeout flat-fee deliveries and mobile software that enabled ordering and payments from their devices. By the third quarter revenue was increasing again from the prior year. And for all of 2020 sales jumped more than 20% to $823.1 million. Headcount is back near pre-Covid levels. Bennett said that during the pandemic Toast became a consumer brand. He knows because his friends started telling him about their experience at restaurants using mobile payments with the Toast logo.

""I probably got three-dozen texts this year from friends who were like 'this is the piece of bread from your t-shirts'"" Bennett said. It's the exact idea that inspired the founders eight years earlier long before the technology existed to make it work. Narang said on Wednesday that ""we were just too early"" and the company has come ""full circle."" Even Bennett has been surprised by how many restaurants now use it. After a recent meal at Pammy's in Cambridge Bennett was waiting a while for the check to arrive. After eventually paying by card he noticed the QR code on the receipt. Had he scanned it the Toast payment option would have popped up on his phone. ""It would've gotten me out of there a lot sooner"" he said. Papa is also hearing from friends including those who could never have imagined that the restaurant-tech start-up he seeded almost a decade ago would be worth close to $30 billion. ""I remember you telling me exactly how this would all play out over lunch one day in Kendall Square"" a friend emailed him on Thursday. ""But I don't remember you mentioning the part about the pandemic. Anyways quite the success story.""

They’re back big time. Three of the big four banks are back – while Wells Fargo keeps getting slapped on the wrist – after all four were out of it last year due to pandemic-rated financial restrictions. Intel fell out of it. But the rest of Big Tech is in and Apple bigger than ever. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway after rightfully dissing share buybacks for years has become one of the largest share buyback queens. And Charter Communications has jumped into it massively.

The top 10 companies – ranked by their cumulative buybacks over the past five years – bought back more of their shares than ever in Q2: $85 billion according to S&P Dow Jones Indices this week accounting for 43% of the total share buybacks by all S&P 500 companies. Since 2014 these 10 companies bought back $1.13 trillion of their own shares.

The two surges in the chart below – first after the corporate tax cuts in 2017 and second after Q2 2020 – quadrupled the quarterly rate of share buybacks for these 10 companies from around $20 billion a quarter in the four years through 2017 to $85 billion in Q2 (data via YCharts.com):

The top 10 share buyback queens based on their share buybacks in Q2 2021:

Top 10 Companies Share Buybacks in Billion $ Q2 2021 12 months 5-year total 1 Apple [AAPL] 25.6 89.7 334.1 2 Alphabet [GOOG] 12.8 40.0 87.7 3 Facebook [FB] 8.4 19.2 51.1 4 Oracle [ORCL] 8.0 21.6 93.8 5 Microsoft [MSFT] 7.2 27.4 92.4 6 JPMorgan [JPM] 6.2 11.0 81.5 7 Berkshire Hathaway [BRK.A] 6.0 30.5 43.5 8 BofA [BAC] 4.2 8.1 78.5 9 Charter Comm. [CHTR] 3.5 14.9 42.8 10 Union Pacific [UNP] 3.1 5.2 28.1

Rounding out the top 20 are in that order: Lowe’s Home Depot Morgan Stanley P&G Citigroup Walmart HCA Healthcare Visa Chubb and Mastercard. Wells Fargo and Intel which used to be in the Top 10 have fallen off the list entirely.

In total 294 of the S&P 500 companies reported buybacks in Q2 of at least $5 million down from 335 companies in Q1 2021. But the top 10 did the lion’s share of buying.

Combined they bought back $199 billion of their own shares in Q2 the fourth largest amount ever behind the records in the three quarters through Q1 2019 following the corporate tax cuts (blue columns in the chart below).

Since the beginning of 2012 the S&P 500 companies have bought back nearly $5.5 trillion of their own shares with the top 10 share buyback queens accounting for 25% of it.

But in recent years this has gotten a lot more top heavy. In Q2 2021 the top 10 accounted for 43%.

But without the Top 10 share buyback queens the share buybacks by the remaining 284 companies amounted to only $114 billion (red line) roughly flat with Q1 and below most quarters in prior years – that’s how top-heavy this scheme has become:

Even today as crazy as this sounds the $5.5 trillion that the S&P 500 companies incinerated on buying back their own shares is a lot of money. They could have been invested in expansion projects in the US and in labor in the US rather than in cheap labor overseas and in training or god forbid the companies could have tried to somewhat less aggressively dodge US income taxes and pay a little more given that the US government deficit has been horrendous for years and has become more horrendous with the corporate tax cut of 2017 and has become a lot more horrendous starting in March 2020

Along with share buybacks comes the corporate debt and it has ballooned as many companies borrowed heavily to fund the share buybacks.

Nonfinancial corporate debt (bonds and loans outstanding owed by companies other than lenders) spiked in the first half of 2020 and in Q2 reached a new record of $11.2 trillion having soared by 73% over the past eight years. The $5.5 trillion incinerated on share buybacks played a large role in creating this debt:

The primary purpose of share buybacks is to undo the dilution of their EPS metric that occurs due to massive executive stock-based compensation packages. These share buybacks hide the cost of stock-based compensation on EPS; and many of those share buybacks are funded with debt but debt doesn’t impact EPS.

In terms of actually lowering the share count: Only 5.4% of the companies that did share buybacks reduced their share count by at least 4% year-over-year according to S&P. This 5.4% share was down from a 17.8% share a year ago and from the 28.2% share in Q1 2016.

Creditors investors and suppliers of the embattled firm and its peers are top on traders’ impact list. Next up are companies with sizable revenue from China also in the spotlight due to the nation’s ongoing regulatory clampdown. Industrial stocks are a key focus for US market watchers while those in Europe are looking at miners.

Fears that an Evergrande collapse might spark financial contagion and curb growth in the Chinese economy roiled global markets on Monday. That anxiety moderated after the developer agreed to settle some local note interest payments but the problem is far from over with dollar bond holders yet to receive a coupon due.

Here are some of the stocks and sectors in traders’ sights:

Property Peers

Evergrande’s size coupled with Beijing’s tighter scrutiny of the real-estate sector will continue to have a significant bearing on property developers. The company has about 2 trillion yuan ($310 billion) in assets -- equivalent to 2% of China’s gross domestic product according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. calculations so any disposals could well disrupt the market.

Regardless of what happens to Evergrande China’s home prices are now at risk of “meaningful downside"" Citigroup Inc. says.

The Hang Seng Property Index dropped to its lowest in five years earlier this month. The 12-member gauge include Country Garden Holdings Co. which lost 25% since March-end and China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. which fell 16%.

Lenders and Investors

Shares of companies that have lent money to or invested in Chinese real-estate firms will remain volatile as traders mull the potential for a spike in bad loans and asset write-downs.

While policy makers are expected to provide support some banks may become victims Citigroup analysts including Judy Zhang wrote in a note on Wednesday.

Citi’s analysis of Chinese banks’ loan exposure to high-risk developers suggests credit risk is highest for China Minsheng Banking Corp. Ping An Bank Co. and China Everbright Bank Co. It sees Bank of Nanjing Co. Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank Co. and Postal Savings Bank of China Co. as less vulnerable.

China Banks Downplay Risks After Evergrande Missed Payments

While Chinese insurers have factored in concerns about potential impairment losses PICC Group’s enterprise value would be hit most among mainland-listed insurance companies in a worst case scenario. That’s followed by Ping An Insurance Group Co. according to Citi’s Michelle Ma in a note on Thursday.

Asian Suppliers

Suppliers of building materials and appliances to Evergrande’s projects will be closely scrutinized to assess how much the indebted property developer owes them and what its rise and fall may mean for recurring earnings.

Shares of Evergrande units such as Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd. -- which have halved this year -- and China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd. -- which are down over 90% -- also remain on watch.

U.S. Industrials

Any restructuring that weighs on the world’s second-largest economy will have ripple effects through the most economically-sensitive and globalized stocks in America. Industrial firms often seen as bellwethers for the U.S. economy’s health may take the hardest hit.

U.S. industrial manufacturers have an around 10% of sales exposure to China according to estimates from JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Stephen Tusa. Stocks to watch include General Electric Co. Otis Worldwide Corp. and Honeywell International Inc. as well as heavy construction and equipment maker Caterpillar Inc.

European Miners

In Europe Evergrande’s crisis is reverberating across the basic materials stocks.

China accounts for 62% of revenue at BHP Group Plc. 58% at Rio Tinto Plc and nearly half at Anglo American Plc and Glencore Plc according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Cement makers like HeidelbergCement AG as well as building suppliers including Kone OYJ and Schindler Holding AG may be directly affected by the Evergrande fallout according to strategists at Liberum.

There’s an easier part and a harder part to a smart meter rollout. The easier part is installing the new meters and radios and associated software. I say this part is (relatively) easy because it’s hard to mess up too badly. The harder part is developing time-based rate plans that are widely adopted fair and will help customers and the utility save on cost and emissions. This part is pretty easy to mess up; it’s happened many times. I will talk briefly about both parts here.

Many of you reading this already have smart meters and are getting started with time-of-use rates. I’d love to hear your experience so far. Palo Alto is late to the game. The City of Palo Alto Utilities (CPAU) will begin replacing all 30000 legacy electric meters in earnest in two years along with 9000 older water meters. They will also retrofit all 45000 gas and water meters to detect and transmit hourly usage information. The rollout will be complete by the end of 2024 at which point the utility will be able to roll out time-of-use rates in 2025.



I am really looking forward to this change. The main reason for my enthusiasm has to do with electricity rates. The cost (and emissions) of electricity vary significantly throughout the day and the year. A time-invariant rate does not price power correctly which means that we are not using power efficiently. If we want an affordable and clean power supply that closely matches our demand then our rates must include a time component and smart meters are the infrastructure that enables that.



Demand in California (blue) varies by hour and season as does the amount of solar (yellow) and wind (green) available. Summer has greater demand increasing through afternoon and evening. Winter has less solar and more wind than summer. The result is steep differences in “net demand” (red) which is demand minus solar and wind. We want to even out (and lower) that “net demand” curve to reduce the amount of peak capacity we need to build. Source: CAISO

Once we have well-designed pricing plans there are many benefits we can expect from these smart meters. There are even a few benefits we will derive automatically. Here is my list.

1. The utility and residents can buy more inexpensive power. Power is generally more expensive in the evening and less expensive midday. When power rates better reflect the true cost of energy residents can choose to shift their use as convenient towards cheaper hours. Residents and the utility will then save on cost. For this to work well the rate design has to be effective which is covered in the second part of this post.

2. The utility will be able to reimburse power contributions from residents more accurately. A resident can contribute power to the grid from rooftop solar a home battery or even an EV battery in time. Power contributions are more valuable when supply is scarce and reimbursement rates should reflect that. This should help to make home batteries for example more affordable.

3. Residents can save money when the utility alerts them to potential water leaks or other significant anomalous use. During the roughly four-year pilot program for these meters in Palo Alto water leaks were detected in 30% of the homes!

4. Residents can save money by doing their own analysis of their use which will be reported on an hourly basis (or finer if they request a ZigBee radio). A resident might be surprised to see how much power they are using at night for example or how much water for irrigation and be able to make some cost-saving adjustments.

5. The grid will become more resilient because the utility is better able to detect locate and respond to voltage deviations and outages. Furthermore hourly usage profiles help the utility more efficiently maintain and enhance its distribution networks for power gas and water.

6. The meters enable more conservative management of voltage on the distribution network which can reduce overall energy consumption by 0.5% to 1%.

7. There are some smaller benefits as well. For example service transitions can be done without the need to make an appointment to read a meter. And the new meters are more accurate than some of the older (and slower) meters out there. (1)

While the utility will save on the cost (2) and difficulty (3) of manually reading meters I don’t count this as much of a benefit because they will need staff to manage the new metering infrastructure and those staffing costs more or less balance out. (4)

The trick to realizing many of these benefits is a well-designed rate plan that is aggressive but fair one that allows most households to save money but all households to break even. Such a plan will likely have these characteristics:

– Off-peak rates are less than half the peak rates to better motivate customers to make changes that are convenient for them.

– The peak (high-rate) period is relatively narrow (e.g. four hours rather than six).

– Customers are made aware of tools they can use to help schedule their power use when convenient (e.g. an appliance scheduler).

– Customers are opted-in by default.

– There is a no-risk period that allows customers to try out a rate and back away from it if it doesn’t work for them.

– Customers are allowed to opt out of time-of-use rates entirely.

Palo Alto ran a poorly designed pilot of time-of-use rates from 2012-2017 that resulted in virtually no change in usage or bills for residents. The best and worst rates differed by just 5-10% for much of the year with power being slightly cheaper from 11pm to 6am. Even at the height of summer the highest power rate (noon to 6pm on weekdays) was just 50% higher than the lowest. The peak period to avoid was a lengthy six hours. And because few of the EV owners were charging during that interval anyway they had little opportunity to save.



The time-of-use rates for CPAU’s pilot were not well designed based on what we know today. Source: Palo Alto Finance Committee report 2012

The new time-of-use rates will be very different. They will encourage midday use and discourage evening use. (Mornings and nights will be somewhere in between.) The new rates will be much more aggressive. CPAU spokesperson Catherine Elvert explains: “The expectation is that the time-of-use period rate differential will be larger than that developed in the 2013-14 period because the market price differential is larger now.” More people now have electric loads that they can easily move (e.g. EVs or electric cooling/heating) and more tools are available to help shift those loads (e.g. scheduling thermostats).

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District did a pilot with aggressive time-of-use rates — 27 cents between 4-7pm vs 8 cents other times — and found they were able to shift 8-10% of their load off of peak. And that was almost ten years ago. Peninsula Clean Energy more recently found that they were able to decrease peak charging energy by 50% among EVs enrolled in a managed charging pilot. It is clear that we can shift demand significantly and therefore reduce costs and emissions with the right incentives and tools.

CPAU is working with experienced consultants to help design the smart meter rollout. They have done multiple deployments and should be able to help residents and the utility get the most value from the new meters.

I would love to hear your questions or comments about the smart meter rollout and potential new rate designs. I just wish it were happening sooner.

Notes and References

1. To be fair this may not be viewed as a benefit by the residents living with those older meters! But it is a benefit to the rest of us. CPAU spokesperson Catherine Evert says that the utility “does not anticipate this will be a prevalent issue.”

2. The utility will be allowing residents to opt-out of smart meters and those opt-outs will continue to incur meter reading costs.

3. City documentation indicates that injuries to meter readers are not uncommon.

Davis’ multi-year deal will see him write and executive produce the film with talks currently underway with original series cast members to return. The news comes on the four year anniversary of the original Teen Wolf finale on MTV.

The original Teen Wolf (1985) was a coming-of-age romantic fantasy comedy film directed by Rod Daniel and written by Jeph Loeb and Matthew Weisman that starred Michael J. Fox stars as title character. The film was a commercial success grossing over $80 million on a $1.2 million budget and spawned an animated series and Teen Wolf Too (1987) which starred Jason Bateman but failed to match the success of its predecessor grossing only $7.9 million on a $3 million budget. A second sequel starring Alyssa Milano was planned but never filmed but was later developed into 1989’s Teen Witch.

MTV first greenlit a television series adaptation in 2009 that was developed by Jeff Davis which also centered on a high school student who becomes a werewolf. The story was reimagined as a supernatural teen drama with elements of action and horror and starred Tyler Posey. It aired for six seasons from 2011 to 2017.

In addition to the Teen Wolf movie Davis will also develop a new series for the streamer based on Edo Van Belkom’s Wolf Pack books with Davis serving as showrunner on that series. Finally the previously announced Aeon Flux live-action reboot — on which Davis will serve as showrunner and pilot director — has moved over to Paramount+ after originally being set up at MTV.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2RkODc0ZDEyLWE0YTMtNDU2NS1iNWNlLTBlNTJmNWFkZTY4MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Europe's instant grocery start-ups deliver frantic summer of dealmaking,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Elden now 30 is currently suing the band’s surviving members and Kurt Cobain’s estate among other individuals and entities. The lawsuit alleges that the use of Elden’s image on the album art taken when he was a few months-old baby amounted to “commercial child sexual exploitation”.

It goes on to allege that the band and other defendants “violated” federal child pornography statutes by using the image and that Elden sustained “injuries” and “lifelong damages” as a result of the album cover and the record’s global success and fame.

“Neither Spencer nor his legal guardians ever signed a release authorising the use of any images of Spencer or of his likeness” the filing claims “and certainly not of commercial child pornography depicting him.”

Elden also wants the album art altered for any future re-releases according to his lawyer Maggie Mabie. “If there is a 30th anniversary re-release he wants for the entire world not to see his genitals” lawyer Maggie Mabie told The Associated Press.

Since the lawsuit was filed a deluxe 30th anniversary reissue of ‘Nevermind’ has been officially announced and is set to be released on November 12. Pre-orders for the various deluxe edition are currently available on Nirvana’s website with Elden’s image uncensored.

What would you regard as the gap in financial coverage and inclusion for Nigerians especially those in rural areas?

According to a 2020 financial access survey report by EFInA about 36 per cent of the adult population in Nigeria are financially excluded and those most affected are in the rural areas.

These are people that are considered unbanked or have no access to financial services. Relative to several other African countries like Kenya South Africa and Rwanda there is still so much work to be done to address gaps in financial coverage and inclusion in Nigeria.

In what ways are fintech spearheading innovations in the Nigerian market?

In the last 10 years Fintechs have brought significant innovation to the banking and payment ecosystem in Nigeria. Before Fintechs the potential of agent banking apps digital wallets and payment gateways were only read and heard of in other markets like Kenya (mPesa) and other developed markets. Fintechs have been and are still at the forefront of bringing these innovations to Nigeria through investments in technology infrastructure customer education product/service innovation creative frameworks and business models. These efforts by Fintechs have brought about convenience and lowered transaction fees for banking transactions being delivered to customers which in the past were quite high and has additionally enabled access to financial services to so many people who were financially excluded or underserved.

According to a McKinsey 2020 report there are over 200 registered Fintechs in Nigeria today driving innovation in payments lending savings and many other sectors. Fintechs are already helping to boost the economy. Millions of people are gainfully employed in agent banking software engineering R&D product development and customer service. Past and recent capital raises and valuations of Nigerian Fintechs are clear indications of the impact and positive effects Fintechs can and are having on the economy.

In 2020 alone Fintechs accounted for 44 per cent of total startup funding deals and leading experts project that the Fintech industry in Nigeria has a GDP potential of $50bn and can attract an additional investment of up to $3bn or more boosting the economy and delivering long-term economic impact.

How would you describe the Nigerian business environment?

The Nigerian business environment is full of so many opportunities but very challenging. There has been some progress over the years but Nigeria still has major challenges with network and technology infrastructure. Broadband and other network services are still not readily available or reliable in some parts of the country and are quite expensive. These have a major impact on the availability and reliability of banking and other financial services.

Government regulators like the CBN CAC and others are doing a lot to improve the starting and ease of doing business in Nigeria but there is still some work to be done to improve our country’s ranking globally. Policy decisions by the government regulators have a significant impact on local and foreign investments.

Additionally finding capable and experienced hires in Nigeria is quite challenging due to the state of our educational system and the brain drain Nigeria has suffered over the years. The insecurity challenges have also exacerbated the problems in the business environment making it unsafe to travel across Nigeria as it was in the past hence it is challenging to develop and deliver access to financial services in some parts of the country.

What have been OPay’s biggest challenges and in what ways has the company adapted over time?

OPay entered the market in 2017 through an investment into PayCom Nigeria Limited one of the early CBN Mobile Money Licensees. PayCom obtained its Mobile Money licence in 2011. Although PayCom was an innovative company and made some inroads in the B2B and B2C working with the likes of the Nigerian Bottling Company and Bet9ja in the early phases of go live it was not able to drive scale in its agent banking wallets apps and cards business due to its limited financial capacity and business and technical resources.

Fortunately OPay was interested in coming into the Nigerian market and saw the potential in PayCom and decided to acquire a major stake rebranded and commenced operation as OPay in August 2018.

OPay’s biggest challenge when it commenced was how to achieve scale and sustain it. In tackling the challenges OPay brought innovation to product and service offerings business models and pricing strong engineering capability and resources and finance to drive scale starting with the agent banking business where there were significant gaps in the market and saw it as the most critical building block to the delivery and growth of financial access and services in Nigeria.

The company quickly gained momentum through this. So to further drive adoption and deepen financial inclusion OPay made efforts into ride-hailing and food services. However due to the government ban and the COVID-19 pandemic it had to divest from those areas and narrow its focus to payments.

OPay as a smart intuitive and innovative company has been able to adapt and navigate its way through the numerous challenges by understanding the needs of the market and customers and tailoring its products and services to meet them leveraging on partnerships technology data AI and social media. These efforts paid off and the company has had rapid growth and success so far in Nigeria and gradually expanding to other African markets and the Middle East. In just 3 years the company now has a valuation of $2bn and has some of the world’s major venture capitalists as investors.

What would you regard as OPay’s success so far?

OPay has succeeded in becoming a major catalyst for agent banking and mobile wallet services and the deepening of financial inclusion in Nigeria as CBN had envisioned. With about 400000 registered merchants our platform provides jobs and means of livelihood for so many families in Nigeria.

What are OPay’s expansion plans in the area of the product tech and markets?

OPay intends to broaden its offerings to more millions of SME merchants in the Nigerian market empowering them with the technology business tools and required use cases they need to accept and process payments. In addition to this OPay plans to expand the scope of its wallet offerings by making the OPay debit card widely available to its over eight million registered wallet customers.

OPay recently launched in two new markets Egypt and Pakistan. The immediate focus will be to develop our business activities in those markets.

What do you think the role of the government should be in the finance market?

In my opinion the role of the government should be balanced. Government must act as both a regulator and an enabler. There must be regulation otherwise there would be chaos which could pose systemic risks to the payment ecosystem.

At the same time for the growth and development of the sector and economy at large regulatory guidelines and policies should enable business innovation and foster healthy competition among operators.

I believe the efforts of regulators particularly the CBN so far are commendable. The CBN over the years has taken a positive approach to provide oversight and regulation by constantly engaging banks and payment ecosystem operators to understand the challenges and to formulate policies that sustain the progress that has been made so far.

The frameworks on the regulatory sandbox open banking and revised guidelines on Mobile Money Operations are recent examples of the CBN efforts to support the growth and development of the market.

How would you describe the future of the fintech industry in the light of emerging technologies?

The Fintech revolution is happening globally and is now transforming how banking and payment services are being accessed and delivered. Even regulators are not left out in the innovation as several countries including Nigeria are at various stages of implementing digital currencies. So the future is very bright.

Though the Facebook CEO is often criticized for being robotic and unfeeling Thiel saw the younger man’s indifference as “a sign of intelligence” writes Max Chafkin in his book “The Contrarian” (Penguin Press) out now.

The two formed a mutual respect based on their iconoclastic ways.

“Zuckerberg like Thiel had stuck it in the eye of his politically correct peers when he’d hacked Harvard’s online directory to create FaceMash.” At college in the ’80s Thiel had launched a conservative monthly called The Stanford Review which fearlessly mocked liberals on campus.

When Facebook’s first president Sean Parker first brought Thiel into the fold as an investor in 2004 he warned Zuckerberg against the financier’s “dirty tricks.”

But Zuckerberg said he found Thiel’s tactics inspiring and would even use them to drive his friend and co-founder Eduardo Saverin out of Facebook the next year.

“I learned it from him” Zuckerberg replied to Parker in an instant-message exchange.

“And I’ll do it to Eduardo.”

Thiel who turns 54 next month is one of the most cutthroat financiers of his generation. With a fortune of $4.3 billion according to Forbes he’s difficult to pigeonhole — having gone from hedge-fund trader to Silicon Valley entrepreneur to data-mining surveillance capitalist — and almost impossible to understand.

“He is self-created a Silicon Valley Oz who has through networking and a capacity for storytelling constructed an image so compelling that it has come to obscure the man behind it” Chafkin writes.

6 THE ADMIRER: Mark Zuckerberg says he learned from Thiel — to cut out friend Eduardo Saverin. Ron Sachs – CNP

Many of the people the author contacted for his book — millionaires with political power — “told me they were scared of him” Chafkin writes. “He was that powerful and he was that vindictive.”

Thiel is famously so vengeful that his name itself has become a verb. To “Peter Thiel” someone is to exact horrible retribution like he did when he brought down gossip Web site Gawker Media in 2016. And as with almost every other takedown in his life he did it without personally pulling the trigger.

The son of German immigrants Thiel was born in Frankfurt and moved with his family to Cleveland Ohio when he was a baby. The Thiels moved frequently before settling in the San Francisco suburb Foster City. He was an outsider from the beginning a fan of science fiction — he claimed he had memorized the entire “Lord of the Rings” trilogy — and an easy target for bullies “even among people who considered themselves Thiel’s friends” writes Chafkin.

One of his bullies who helped plant “for sale” signs on the front lawn of Thiel’s home told Chafkin that he “always thought [Thiel] might have a list of people he’s going to kill somewhere and that I’m on it.”

When Thiel enrolled at Stanford in 1985 he was disgusted by the hard-partying antics of his peers. “They drank; they smoked pot; they hooked up” writes Chafkin. “Needless to say Thiel did not partake in any of it. He didn’t really seem interested in making friends.”

6 THE CHALLENGER: Elon Musk tried to force Thiel out at PayPal — but found himself ousted instead. AP

Instead he started the satirical publication The Stanford Review which lampooned progressive causes with false reports on everything from a new course on black hairdos implying that “Stanford had replaced the traditional Western Culture curriculum with discourses on kinky hair” to a story on how “it was impossible to visit a men’s restroom (on campus) without witnessing a gay sex act.”

It was also where he first learned to become a “puppet master” Chafkin writes.

When law student Keith Rabois a frequent contributor to the Review (and like Thiel at the time still very much in the closet) decided in 1992 to hurl homophobic slurs at a professor’s cottage as an exercise in free speech Thiel didn’t discourage it.

“Fa–ot!” Rabois shouted. “You are going to die of AIDS. You’re going to get what’s coming to you!”

Overall Thiel felt that outrageous stunt was justified because conservatives [had become] “too conservative” writes Chafkin. Just like mainstream liberals accepted communists he felt conservatives shouldn’t be shy about associating with more extreme far-right views.

After graduating from Stanford Law School in ’92 he worked at a law firm and as a derivatives trader in New York before launching PayPal in California in 1998. The idea was to create a space for financial transactions that couldn’t be regulated by the government. In other words an anonymous foreign bank account “which Thiel wanted to make available to all” Chafkin writes.

“It was a real-world version of the wild arguments he’d published in his Stanford Review days” Chafkin writes. “Forget bringing down morally bankrupt university administrators — PayPal had the potential to bring down governments.”

He brought many of his more outlandish Review scribes like Rabois with him. “I used to think it was a mistake because what does a guy who worked on a weekly newspaper know about tech support?” said Martin Hellman a Stanford professor who helped design PayPal’s encryption software. “But Peter was brilliant in hiring people who recognized him as the leader and would not fight with him.”

By January of 2000 PayPal was a hot commodity with 9000 new users joining every day. Finding new customers was “easier than catching a cold” Thiel bragged to The Wall Street Journal. “And it’s spreading as fast as a virus.”

In February of 2000 Elon Musk called Thiel proposing a fifty-fifty merger. He was worried that PayPal would end up being acquired by a company like Yahoo and X.com Musk’s online bank would be pushed out of the market.

“Together Musk argued they would have a better shot of surviving” Chafkin writes. “And they would have an easier time dealing with federal regulators if and when the government got around to cracking down on the new digital payment technologies.”

Thiel agreed but tensions between the two visionaries ran high from the start. Musk insisted on switching servers putting PayPal on a Microsoft platform. He also wanted to change the name to “PayPal by X.com” eventually phasing out the PayPal name altogether.

But Thiel found a way to oust Musk without getting his hands dirty.

Even though Musk got to be CEO after the merger most of Thiel’s deputies — Stanford alum and Review writers like Paul Marti Max Levchin and David Sacks — filled the executive ranks. “X’s former executives were marginalized and Musk was surrounded by a team that was more loyal to Thiel than to him” writes Chafkin. He had in effect “laid a sort of trap for Musk.”

In May 2000 Thiel resigned from the company claiming in an e-mail to employees that he was “exhausted” and that he considered himself “more of a visionary and less of a manager.” When Musk disappeared for his honeymoon in Australia that fall several Thiel loyalists — like PayPal co-founder Max Levchin and Vice President of Finance Roelof Botha — issued an ultimatum to Mike Moritz one of the company’s biggest investors. Either the board fired Musk and installed Thiel as the new CEO or they would walk.

PayPal “wouldn’t have a chance of survival if Levchin the company’s most talented engineer walked out with half the business development team” writes Chafkin.

Without any direct involvement from Thiel their demands were met before Musk had returned from his honeymoon. Not only did Thiel seize total control without lifting a finger he also convinced almost all of Musk’s most ardent defenders to stay with the company.

One former X staffer who declined to give his name met with Thiel to scold him for what happened but after listening to the new CEO discuss his vision for PayPal he left “with a lot of respect for him. It was a formative experience.”

Two years later Thiel sold PayPal to eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

After that Thiel used his PayPal profits to invest in everything from hedge funds to new technologies like Palantir a big data analysis company and a new social networking site called The Facebook. In 2004 Thiel became the company’s first angel investor laying down $500000 for a 10 percent stake and giving Zuckerberg one piece of advice: “Just don’t f–k it up.” Thiel eventually walked away with a billion dollars for his investment.

But he could also make moves that were surprisingly obtuse. In 2006 Thiel turned down the opportunity to invest in Tesla because as Musk told the author “he doesn’t fully buy into the climate change thing.”

As a result “Thiel lost out on a chance to own a substantial chunk of a company that would be worth $800 billion by the end of 2020” Chafkin writes.

Later Thiel showed how ruthless he could be when Gawker published a story in 2007 with the headline “Peter Thiel is totally gay people.” It wasn’t exactly an outing — Thiel’s homosexuality was an open secret by that point — but still Thiel was furious.

He first hired a private investigative firm to dig into the personal life and finances of Gawker’s founder Nick Denton. But then he decided to enact revenge in an even more lethal way. In 2016 when former wrestler Hulk Hogan filed a lawsuit against Gawker for publishing portions of his private sex tape Thiel secretly contributed $10 million to his legal costs. Hogan went on to win his lawsuit and was awarded $140 million in damages forcing Gawker to fold.

Later when Thiel’s involvement was revealed he said it was “the most philanthropic thing I’ve ever done.”

That same year Thiel became one of the few major figures in Silicon Valley to back Donald Trump in the presidential election. Though they were in many ways polar opposites — he was no fan of Trump the “libidinous New Yorker incapable of preserving an inner monologue” Chafkin writes — Trump was also a candidate willing to say the unsayable “and for this Thiel would love him.”

His donations to the Trump campaign led reporters to unearth his 1995 book “The Diversity Myth” in which he called date rape “belated regret.”

In a rare show of remorse Thiel said in a statement: “I wish I’d never written those things.”

But a year later at a Stanford Review event he allegedly told a student editor that the apology had been for show. “Sometimes you have to tell them what they want to hear” he allegedly said.

Today he lives in Vienna Austria with his long-time partner Matt Danzeisen whom he married in 2017 and now co-parents a baby daughter. Though he’s avoided the limelight in recent years he is still feared by many. As anti-monopoly activist Matt Stoller told Chafkin: He’s “a nihilist a really smart nihilist. He’s entirely about power — it’s the law of the jungle: ‘I’m a predator and the predators win.’ ”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9mYWN0Y2hlY2svMjAyMS8wOS8yNi9mYWN0LWNoZWNrLXRyZWFzdXJ5LXByb3Bvc2FsLXdvdWxkbnQtbGV2eS1uZXctdGF4LXBheXBhbC12ZW5tby81ODQ4MjIwMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fact check: Treasury proposal wouldn't levy new tax on PayPal Venmo transactions,"The claim: Borrowed funds exceeding $600 deposited via smartphone apps would be taxed under a new bill

A proposal from the Department of the Treasury aimed at decreasing tax avoidance has become the subject of misinformation online.

One Facebook post claims the “new tax bill” would tax transactions exceeding $600 on smartphone apps like PayPal and Venmo.

“That means if you borrow money using any of those things over $600 that money will be taxed again” reads the Sept. 20 post which was shared more than 1300 times in four days. “You know who deposits $600 or more into their bank account from outside sources to help them survive? The poor and middle class.”

The Treasury proposal would change reporting requirements to account for transactions made on smartphone apps. But the claim that it would levy new taxes is wrong.

More:Don't fall for this scam as IRS child tax credit payouts hit bank accounts

“It looks like (the proposal) is just extending to more entities the obligation to report transactions exceeding $600” Karen Brown a tax law professor at George Washington University told USA TODAY in an email. “It places these bank surrogates in the same position as others. It is clearly an anti-tax avoidance measure.""

Proposal doesn’t suggest new tax

The Facebook post misconstrues a Treasury proposal that suggests broadening financial reporting to ""improve tax compliance.""

In May the Treasury proposed requiring financial institutions to report to the Internal Revenue Service annual inflows and outflows from most bank loan and investment accounts. The requirement applies to accounts whose inflows and outflows including paychecks and transactions made via smartphone apps add up to $600. The details of individual transactions would not be reported.

The proposal is an effort to reduce the country’s annual tax gap – the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid – which the IRS estimates to be roughly $166 billion per year. It does not suggest levying a new tax.

""First off the proposal does not change what is taxable in any way. It does not authorize Treasury to expand what is taxable at all"" David Super a tax law professor at Georgetown University told USA TODAY in an email. ""Second the proposal does not specify what particular reporting standards would be adopted.""

The claim that borrowed money would be taxed is nonsense too. Personal loans are not considered income and cannot be taxed unless they are forgiven according to Investopedia.

""The statement that borrowing money will be subject to taxation is false: loan proceeds have never been income and hence have never been taxable"" Super said.

“It is absolutely false that poor people or anyone is taxed on borrowing funds” Brown said. “That's the quintessential feature in our tax system. Borrowed funds are not subject to tax because of the borrower's offsetting obligation to repay.”

Joey Gates the Facebook user who shared the claim told USA TODAY in a Facebook message that ""regardless of whether I have a misunderstanding of the tax proposal or not it is baffling to me that more money would be collected from tax payers while we leave billions of dollars of tax payers money (in) Afghanistan.""

Our rating: False

Based on our research we rate FALSE the claim that borrowed funds exceeding $600 deposited via smartphone apps would be taxed under a new proposal. A Treasury proposal would require financial institutions to report annual inflows and outflows including transactions on smartphone apps for most bank loan and investment accounts. But it would not create an additional tax on those funds. Personal loans are not considered income so they cannot be taxed unless they're forgiven.

Epic Games dares Apple to let Fortnite for iOS back in the App Store

Following the judge’s ruling in the Epic-Apple antitrust lawsuit Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney asked Apple to reinstate Epic’s developer account. But as Epic said it aims to appeal the court’s ruling Apple informed the company that it won’t be reinstating Epic’s account until the appeals have been resolved. In effect that means Fortnite may not return to iOS for years if Epic is forced to wait for the appeal’s decision to be made final.

Sweeney made the request public by tweeting out a letter he sent to Apple making the request and the company’s response. The letter promises Apple that Fortnite would play by the rules — something that it didn’t do before when it breached its contract with Apple by implementing its own payments to force the lawsuit. The letter also noted it had already disabled Epic payments server-side since it can’t update the app on users’ devices. And it said it paid Apple the $6 million in fees ordered by the court which had been gained as a result of routing around Apple’s in-app purchases with its own system.

But what makes the letter interesting is that it’s not just Epic asking for re-entry. It’s daring Apple to follow the current court order.

The judge’s decision deemed Apple “not a monopoly” which Apple then jubilantly celebrated saying it’s something “we’ve known all along” quoting the judge’s statement that Apple’s success was “not illegal.” However the one part of the case where Epic won was where the judge declared Apple’s current in-app purchase (IAP) system anticompetitive. The court’s decision was that Apple would now have to accommodate developers by giving them the choice to include buttons or links to other places where users could pay for their in-app purchases outside the App Store in addition to Apple’s IAP option.

Sweeney’s letter tells Apple Fortnite will play by the rules if Apple will. That is if Apple follows the court’s guidelines to allow buttons and external links to other purchasing mechanisms then Epic would resubmit the Fortnite app. In other words Epic is ready to take advantage of the now legal option to route around Apple’s IAP system.

Apple though wasn’t having it. Apple’s legal team called Epic’s behavior in the past “duplicitous” when it breached its contract and Apple saw no reason to reinstate the account until the court’s decision is made final. And of course Sweeney tweeted that too noting that appeals may take up to five years. (So bad news Fortnite players.)

Apple’s decline may help to signal to other developers not to try to break its rules but for Epic it sets the stage for the next battle — one where it’s not just daring Apple to let it back in based on the new terms but one where it’s also daring Congress to act too. After all Epic’s position seems to be if Apple can boot out a multibillion-dollar company that made amends for breaking rules it believed to be illegal then what hope would smaller developers have to ever fight back against the tech giant? And once kicked out there is no other path to iOS. This seems to try to position Apple as the monopolist that the court said it wasn’t — which is what the appeal is all about.

Apps to have a record Q3 with $34B in consumer spending

A new forecast from (the recently busted) App Annie indicates the third quarter will be another good one for the app economy. Consumers worldwide will spend $34 billion on apps and games in Q3 a 20% year-over-year increase in spending. The jump indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on consumer habits and behavior is having a lasting effect when it comes to how people are now using apps for entertainment shopping work and education. Consumer spending on iOS apps grew 15% year over year to $22 billion and 15% year-over-year on Google Play to reach around $12 billion. Most of this revenue is generated by gaming apps which account for 66% of the spend across both app stores. In terms of non-gaming apps iOS commands 76% of consumer spending

Downloads in Q3 will also grow by 10% year-over-year to reach a record high of 36 billion driven by Google Play and particularly downloads in emerging markets like India and Brazil and others.

The app offers direct deposit with the ability to get paid up to two days early improved bill pay a digital wallet peer-to-peer payments messaging shopping tools ported over from its acquisition of Honey crypto capabilities and a “high-yield” savings account (well it’s 0.40% APY) powered by Synchrony Bank. Some of the features are arriving now others in the weeks and months ahead. And the rollout itself is staggered so you might not see the update right away either.

Following the threat of an SEC lawsuit Coinbase canceled its planned launch of a “Lend” product which would have allowed users to lend their crypto holdings back to the exchange for the promise of earning interest rates that are much higher than traditional savings accounts offer. This sort of functionality is already offered by other platforms like Gemini which is why Coinbase was proceeding toward a launch before the SEC’s intervention.

This continues even if the user has asked the app not to track them.

Former chairman and CEO of PepsiCo Indra Nooyi will be releasing her memoir ' My Life in Full : Work Family and Our Future' on September 28. As the former CEO waits for her book to hit the shelves she took to her official Twitter account to interact with her over 89K followers.""If you had the opportunity to call up your past self and give them a piece of wisdom what would it be?"" the 65-year-old asked. Sharing a picture from her teen years Nooyi further reflected on her own past.The New York City based business executive shared the advice she'd give her younger self. ""To this version of myself I would say — when you take on something give it everything you’ve got. If people can’t accept you for who you are it’s their loss"" Nooyi added.Nooyi who was termed as one of the world's most admired CEOs for many years shared her journey through the events that shaped her in her book. From her childhood and early years in India to her Yale School of Management experience and her rise to the corporate world the book tells it all. Thrilled about her book launch Nooyi even shared the first few pages from 'My Life in Full: Work Family and Our Future' book.The story begins with Nooyi finding herself in a room alongside then President of America and Prime Minister of India. ""One foggy Tuesday in November 2009 after hours of meetings in Washington DC with two dozens top US and Indian business executives I found myself standing between the president of the United States and the prime minister of India. Barack Obama and Manmohan Singh had entered the room for an update on our group's progress and President Obama began introducing the American team to his Indian counterpart. When he got to me - Indra Nooyi CEO of PepsiCo - Prime Minister Singh exclaimed ""Oh! But she is one of us!""And the president with a big smile and without missing a beat responded ""Ah but she is one of us too!"" the first page of Nooyi's book read which she shared on LinkedIn.Just like the former CEO people are extremely excited to get their hands on the book as well while those who preordered it and are currently reading it are in absolute awe of the business executive.""I keep smiling/ chuckling to myself at the warmth and authenticity that is on every page. Thank you Indra Nooyi for this gift"" a person replied to Nooyi's post.While many expressed a keen desire to read Nooyi's life journey after all she was consistently ranked among the world's 100 most powerful women. In 2015 Nooyi bagged the second spot on the Fortune list of most powerful women.In 2019 she again got the second rank as the most powerful woman but this time on the Forbes list of The 19 Most Powerful Women in Business.Nooyi who was born in Madras (now called Chennai) in the year of 1955 is currently on the boards of Amazon and the International Cricket Council.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvaW5kcmEtbm9veWktb24tYS10cmFpbGJsYXppbmctbGlmZS_SAURodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9pbmRyYS1ub295aS1vbi1hLXRyYWlsYmxhemluZy1saWZlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Indra Nooyi on a trailblazing life,"Indra Nooyi's office in Greenwich Conn. looks like a shrine to rock 'n' roll. In fact Nooyi the former CEO of PepsiCo one of the most iconic brands in the world was something of a rock star herself in her native India.

""I was in an all-girls rock band when I was in high school"" she told correspondent Mola Lenghi. ""Remember I was in a Catholic school so songs that were appropriate to those nuns but they were good songs!""

""The nuns picked the band name?"" Lenghi asked.

""Nuns picked the name Logarithms because we were studying Logarithm Table.""

""Nothing says rock 'n' roll like nuns picking your band name!""

Nooyi went on to become a rock star in the corporate world. Tapped to lead PepsiCo in 2006 she was one of only a handful of female CEOs at Fortune 500 companies.

""In 2018 when I retired as CEO of the Fortune 500 out of 500 companies there were 41 women CEOs"" she said. ""Now you can read it as great progress from zero to 41. Or you can say in 25 years we moved from zero percent to about eight-and-a-half percent. Is that progress? Yes and no.""

Though technically retired she's still hard at work trying to improve not just one company but all companies. How? Simple really: more women.

""Women are 50 percent of the population"" she said. ""Women get more college degrees than men. They're 70 percent of high school valedictorians. They are over-represented in professional schools.""

But at some point their career paths derail. Today women account for roughly a quarter of senior leadership jobs.

Nooyi takes aim at this disparity in a new memoir chronicling her self-admittedly improbable rise to becoming as Fortune magazine described ""one of the most powerful women in the world.""

Portfolio

Lenghi asked ""Do you consider your time as CEO of PepsiCo a success?""

""I'd say it was a pretty good success"" Nooyi replied. ""Did bold things did transformational things did things that people at that time criticized before but now call it prescient.""

She pushed the more-than-100-year-old company to put families first by focusing on challenges facing women in the workplace offering generous paid family leave and help with childcare.

Nooyi said ""The biological clock and the career clock are in conflict. Some people are delaying childbirth for many many years freezing their eggs or just not having children at all. Others are saying 'I can't keep working I can't go through this rat race.' So my point is we've got to make it less of a rat race.""

Her ideas on family are rooted in her own experience – one that began in a strict but loving multi-generational home in Chennai India: ""[Being] in a family that believed the girls should be allowed to soar as much as the boys made a huge difference huge difference.""

In 1978 Nooyi was accepted into Yale Business School so off to America she went some 8000 miles from everything she had ever known. One of the few women (and even fewer minorities) in her class she arrived on campus to a rude awakening.

""Nobody's smiling to welcome you. I'm like 'Oh my God what have I done?' And I'm starving. How do I get food? I go to the grocery store. Ultimately I bought a loaf of bread a tomato and some potato chips and I ate it crying saying 'What have I done?'""

Turns out she knew exactly what she was doing. Nooyi graduated got married to her husband Raj and had two daughters Preetha and Tara all while working more than full time eventually landing a job at PepsiCo and climbing the corporate ladder.

In 2000 she was appointed president of the company. She rushed home to tell her family the news but was quickly humbled by her mother: ""She said 'You know I don't care if you're president or on the board. I don't even know what that means. But let me just tell you when you walk in this door you're a mother you're a wife you're a daughter you're a daughter-in-law. That's all you are in this house. So please do me a favor just leave that crown in the garage.'""

Indra Nooyi. CBS News

She says it was a critical life lesson: ""That's why I always say work and life is not a balance; it's a juggling act. And how you juggle this every day is the big challenge.

""Look tradeoffs are part of everybody's life. Being a mom being an executive – how do I be the best at everything? – are painful emotional tradeoffs. So I think back at some of those and there is hurt. I feel pain I feel a loss.""

While she has forgiven herself the reminders of time with family that she traded for time in the office are still present. She show Lenghi some of the sacred artifacts are at once a mother's mementoes of her children and a CEO's lesson in the sacrifices made for success.

""When I found them there was so painful and poignant and emotional. I thought I should keep them very very carefully.""

""Dear Mom I really love you. I really would appreciate if you came home early. Please please please please please please. If you say yes I love you again.""

CBS News

Lenghi asked ""You kept these things all these years. Why?""

""I don't know I cannot get myself to not look at them regularly"" she replied.

Despite the tough choices Nooyi said she has no regrets and wants the same for other women. And while her mission is gender equity she insists it can also be good business.

""I approach it as an economist first rather than just a feminist because it's such a lost opportunity. Women are smart. They're driven. They want the power of the purse. They want to work. They want economic freedom. Let's harness their capabilities.""

Cap'n Crunch: Inside the Crunch Berry Lawsuits,"For nearly 60 years Cap’n Crunch and Toucan Sam have served the public honorably. One is a respected seaman; the other is a beloved immigrant. In 1963 each launched a new fruity breakfast cereal that quickly became part of the very fabric of this country. But despite their obvious contributions to the American (breakfast) experience both came under assault about a decade ago by people claiming the mascots had been knowingly deceitful.

Beginning in 2007 multiple Californians declared that they were tricked by Froot Loops and Crunch Berries because due to the names of the cereals they believed the cereals contained a significant amount of real fruit. As ridiculous as this sounds these claims were strong enough — or at least presented the prospect of a big enough payday — to attract several different law firms as there were a total of seven of these nearly identical lawsuits from 2007 to 2010. “All of them were brought under California’s Consumer Protection Law” explains Kevin Underhill a partner at the law firm Shook Hardy & Bacon and the author of The Emergency Sasquatch Ordinance: And Other Real Laws That Human Beings Actually Dreamed Up. He adds that while these kinds of laws make it easier to sue companies for wrongdoing they can result in absurd cases as well.

The Froot Loops and Crunch Berries lawsuits never amounted to much as they were deemed to be entirely frivolous (and one was tossed out on legal technicalities). Regardless they do offer something to the annals of legal history — namely they’re the most absurd and hilarious court documents ever filed. And so with Underhill as my guide I pulled out some of the most insane bits of legal lunacy from each.

McKinnis v. Kellogg July 2007

The court summary for the first of these lawsuits states that the “plaintiffs a married couple allege that they wanted to purchase healthy cereal for their children so they purchased this product because they believed that based on the front panel of the cereal box that the cereal contained actual fruit.”

Apparently they were lead to believe this because of “the use of the word ‘Froot’ in the name [and] the depiction of brightly colored rings of cereal that plaintiffs claim resemble fruit.” But the most ridiculous part of their claim is where it says that the “plaintiffs purchased [Froot Loops] from time to time over the past four years.”

Four fucking years! It took them that long to realize that Froot Loops weren’t real fruit!

Unsurprisingly the case was ruled against the plaintiffs as a misuse of the Consumer Protection Law. The ruling highlights the different spellings of “fruit” and “Froot” but really eye-rolls the plaintiffs’ claim that the cereal resembles actual fruit. The ruling states “Plaintiffs’ allegation that the cereal pieces themselves resemble fruit is not rational let alone reasonable. The cereal pieces are brightly colored rings which in no way resemble any currently known fruit.”

Underhill who has covered these cases extensively for Forbes as well as his legal humor blog “Lowering the Bar” explains that some lawyers — himself included — relish the opportunity to be funny in a ruling. “It doesn’t occur often and you have to be very careful and appropriate but once in a while you get the perfect opportunity” he tells me.

Videtto v. Kellogg June 2008

A layman would rightfully assume that a ridiculous lawsuit that’s been laughed out of court might dissuade similar filings in the future but Underhill explains that this isn’t always the case. On the contrary actually: “Many lawyers have alerts to let them know of these kinds of cases” as they’re looking to jump on the bandwagon if they sniff an opportunity. That’s how you get a case like Videtto v. Kellogg which made the exact same arguments as McKinnis v. Kellogg and was dismissed in much the same manner.

“The packaging makes clear that the product is a ‘multi-grain’ cereal and truthfully depicts that cereal in the shape of multi-colored rings rings that do not resemble any known fruit” the ruling states. “Moreover defendant uses the word ‘Froot’ as part of its trademarked name and the fanciful use of a nonsensical word cannot reasonably be interpreted to imply that the product contains or is made from actual fruit.”

Sugawara v. PepsiCo Inc. June 2008 and July 2009

With a couple of swipes at Toucan Sam having failed someone decided to put Cap’n Crunch to the test over the use of the word “berries” in Crunch Berries cereal. For this one Underhill says his favorite excerpt from the case summary reads “In addition to the use of the word ‘berries’ in the product name the product’s principal display panel the portion of the product box designed to face consumers as they shop in a market aisle features the product’s namesake ‘Cap’n Crunch’ thrusting a spoonful of ‘Crunch Berries’ at the prospective buyer.”

As such for his Forbes write-up on the case Underhill wanted to go with the headline “Lawsuits Accuse Sea Captain of Thrusting His Berries at Unsuspecting Consumers.” Sadly Forbes went with the much more conservative “California Plagued With ‘Frooty’ Lawsuits.”

The plaintiff also borrowed the Fruit Loops argument pretty much verbatim: “The Crunch Berries are pieces of cereal in bright fruit colors shaped to resemble berries. While close inspection reveals that the Crunch Berries are not really berries plaintiff contends that the colorful Crunch Berries combined with use of the word ‘berry’ in the product name convey the message that Cap’n Crunch is not all sugar and starch but contains redeeming fruit.”

Again however the judge wasn’t buying it writing “While the challenged packaging contains the word ‘berries’ it does so only in conjunction with the descriptive term ‘crunch.’ This court is not aware of nor has plaintiff alleged the existence of any actual fruit referred to as a ‘crunch berry.’” An even better burn comes later: “As far as this court has been made aware there is no such fruit growing in the wild or occurring naturally in any part of the world.”

Janine Sugawara the plaintiff in this case also pursued it as a class-action lawsuit which was similarly dismissed. With two cases against Quaker Oats — which Pepsi owns — Sugawara was briefly the queen of frivolous cereal lawsuits. Within a year though she’d be overshadowed by a man named Roy Werbel.

Werbel v. Kellogg and Werbel v. PepsiCo Inc. September 2009 and March 2010

On September 22 2009 Werbel filed two lawsuits — one against Kellogg and the other against PepsiCo. The Kellogg claim was dismissed because Werbel’s lawyers failed to actually serve Kellogg with the lawsuit — whoops! It didn’t go much better when Werbel tried again the following April.

As for his claim against Cap’n Crunch Werbel didn’t show up to a case management conference but he eventually got his shit together and was able to proceed with things the following July. None of it was all that original. As with the others Werbel maintained that “the colorful Crunch Berries on the [cereal box] combined with the ‘berry’ in the product name conveys only one message: that Cap’n Crunch has some nutritional value derived from fruit” and that the package had led him to believe that “Crunch Berries is a combination of Crunch biscuits and colorful red purple teal and green berries.”

The judge savaged him in response: “It is obvious from the product packaging that no reasonable consumer would believe that Cap’n Crunch derives any nutritional value from berries. As an initial matter the term ‘Berries’ is not used alone but always is preceded by the word ‘Crunch’ to form the term ‘Crunch Berries.’ The image of the Crunch Berries which is ‘ENLARGED TO SHOW TEXTURE’ shows four cereal balls with a rough textured surface in hues of deep purple teal chartreuse green and bright red. These cereal balls do not even remotely resemble any naturally occurring fruit of any kind.”

With that the cereal lawsuits drew to a close and Toucan Sam and the Cap’n have been more or less left alone since. Which I have to say is kinda disappointing. I understand that these lawsuits are total money-grabs that waste the time of important judges and lawyers — to say nothing of taxpayer money — but they do provide some levity in a pretty miserable world. Perhaps then I can remind all the serial cereal litigants out there that a certain white rabbit has been selling fruity cereal since 1954.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS93aGVuLWluZGlhbi1wbS1hbmQtdXMtcHJlc2lkZW50LWJvdGgtY2xhaW1lZC1pbmRyYS1ub295aS1pcy1vbmUtb2YtdGhlaXJzL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg2NTI0MzQ4LmNtc9IBjQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS93aGVuLWluZGlhbi1wbS1hbmQtdXMtcHJlc2lkZW50LWJvdGgtY2xhaW1lZC1pbmRyYS1ub295aS1pcy1vbmUtb2YtdGhlaXJzL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NjUyNDM0OC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When Indian PM and US President both claimed Indra Nooyi as one of theirs,"

Washington: Indian-American Indra Nooyi the former chairperson and CEO of PepsiCo still vividly remembers a 2009 meeting with the then US president Barack Obama and former prime minister Manmohan Singh during which both claimed: ”she is one of us”.

“I belong in both worlds” Chennai-born Nooyi 65 writes in her new memoir “My Life in Full: Work Family and Our Future” recollecting the memorable events of November 2009 when Obama had hosted Singh for his first state dinner.

In the memoir set to hit the bookstores next Tuesday Nooyi describes the events that shaped her life from childhood to her becoming Pepsico CEO a position from which she retired in 2018.

“One foggy Tuesday in November 2009 after hours of meetings in Washington DC with two dozen top US and Indian business executives I found myself standing between the president of the United States and the prime minister of India” she writes in the introduction of the memoir that runs into over 300 pages.

“Barack Obama and Manmohan Singh had entered the room for an update on our group’s progress and President Obama began introducing the American team to his Indian counterpart. When he got to me—Indra Nooyi CEO of PepsiCo—Prime Minister Singh exclaimed “Oh! But she is one of us!” “And the president with a big smile and without missing a beat responded “Ah but she is one of us too!” “It’s a moment I never forget—spontaneous kindness from the leaders of the two great countries that have given me so much” Nooyi writes in the memoir an advance copy of which was obtained by PTI.

“I am still the girl who grew up in a close family in Madras in the South of India and I am deeply connected to the lessons and culture of my youth. I am also the woman who arrived in the US at age twenty-three to study and work and somehow rose to lead an iconic company a journey that I believe is possible only in America. I belong in both worlds” she writes narrating her immigrant story.

From a sari-clad intern at Booz Allen Hamilton rising to the post of Pepsico CEO Nooyi writes that the business world has improved immeasurably for women in the US since she started her professional career. Nooyi writes that more recently the #MeToo movement and Time’s Up campaigns have had a profound impact on exposing the degree to which women are subjected to sexual violence and harassment. The movement and campaigns have created a necessary community for survivors she observes. “I was never sexually assaulted. I did witness and hear about plenty of male behavior early in my days in the corporate world that offended my sense of decency and my values. I later made it a priority to shut down offensive behavior as soon as I saw it or it became known” Nooyi writes.

Nooyi says after she became PepsiCo’s president she instructed the compliance department to address harassment complaints made to their anonymous Speak Up Line immediately. “We were quick to fire confirmed harassers” she writes.

In the book she rues that women hold just 26 percent of US corporate board seats. “In my view companies should consider setting term limits on board members of fifteen years and a mandatory retirement age of seventy-two. Immediately they could also expand their boards by one or two members to make room for qualified people who better understand the issues facing working women and young families” she said."
PFE,Pfizer,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDkvMjYvcGZpemVyLWNlby1ib29zdGVyLXZhY2NpbmVzLTUxNDMwOdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer CEO: We can do both booster shots and primary vaccines,"Bourla said that out of the 2 billion vaccine doses Pfizer will have produced by the end of September 500 million of the doses have already gone to middle- or lower-income countries.

“In the remaining of the year we will produce an additional billion doses so a total of three. And 1 billion of these doses will have gone to low- and middle-income countries. That will not change because of the approval or not of boosters” he said.

The Biden administration last week announced that a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine will be available to people ages 65 and older as well as adults at an elevated risk of severe Covid-19.

While announcing the rollout President Joe Biden pointed out that more than a quarter of those eligible in the U.S. have yet to get even one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.

“We still have over 70 million Americans who have failed to get a single shot” Biden said on Friday. “There are elected officials actively working to undermine with false information the fight against Covid-19. This is totally unacceptable.”

Biden’s announcement came after weeks of debate within his administration. An FDA panel last week voted in favor of rolling out booster shots to people over the age of 65 younger people at a high risk of severe Covid-19 and people in high-risk jobs including frontline health care workers.

But the CDC’s advisory panel which is charged with deciding which people get a shot and when did not include individuals working in high-risk settings in its ruling on booster shots. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky overruled her advisory board to also include those workers in high-risk jobs bringing the CDC’s recommendation more in line with FDA’s booster authorization.

Pfizer announced last week that a trial had showed that the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine is safe for children ages 5-11. Bourla said that the data would be submitted to the FDA for approval soon.

“It’s a question of days not weeks” he said. “And then it is up to FDA to be able to review the data and come to their conclusions and approve it or not. If they approve it we will be ready with our manufacturing to provide this new formulation of the vaccine because the vaccine that the kids will receive ... is a different formulation.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiwAFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vdGVuc2UtZGVjaXNpb24tbWFraW5nLWFzLWNkYy1qb2lucy1mZGEtaW4tcmVjb21tZW5kaW5nLXBmaXplci1ib29zdGVyLXNob3QtZm9yLTY1LWFuZC11cC1wZW9wbGUtYXQtaGlnaC1yaXNrLWFuZC10aG9zZS13aXRoLW9jY3VwYXRpb25hbC1leHBvc3VyZS10by1jb3ZpZC0xOS0xNjg3MDPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tense decision-making as CDC joins FDA in recommending Pfizer booster shot for 65 & up people at high risk and ...,"Following the recommendations of its vaccine advisory committee the Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization to Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine booster dose for certain populations. The single shot is to be administered six months following completion of the original two-dose course.

The FDA’s Sept. 22 2021 decision to not extend boosters to the general population – at least not yet – was a direct rebuke to the Biden administration’s announcement in August that booster shots would be rolled out to all eligible Americans beginning in late September. Biden’s pledge had been widely criticized for getting out in front of the science and the regulatory process.

The FDA instead limited its authorization of the third Pfizer dose to people 65 and older people ages 18-64 at high risk of severe COVID-19 due to pre-existing conditions and individuals with frequent risk of exposure to the coronavirus through their work such as health care workers and teachers.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices then issued its own booster recommendations on Sept. 23 2021. Its guidance aligned with the FDA’s authorization of boosters for use in ages 65 and up and people at high risk of severe COVID-19 but stopped short of endorsing booster shots for people with frequent occupational exposure. However in an effort to realign the two agencies’ recommendations CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky overrode the CDC advisory committee providing the go-ahead for all groups listed under the FDA’s emergency use authorizations – including those with increased job-site risk.

Despite the mixed messaging between the agencies the immediate effect is that millions of Americans will be in line for added protection amid concerns over waning vaccine immunity. An ongoing evaluation of whether COVID-19 boosters should be administered more broadly among vaccine-eligible people is likely to take place in the coming months as more data becomes available to inform questions of safety need and efficacy of boosters.

Fault lines between the FDA and CDC

This fraught booster approval process may strike some as strange as the FDA is solely responsible for drug approval in most contexts. However as the body responsible for managing U.S. public vaccination programs the CDC’s approval is required in order to begin the distribution and administration of vaccines.

The close intersection of the two agencies in approval and distribution of vaccines has recently become a point of contention for some high level officials with two senior FDA vaccine leaders resigning from their posts in early September 2021. One former FDA leader cited the expanding role of the CDC in vaccine evaluation as a major reason for their departure.

The tensions between these agencies was on full display when the CDC’s advisory committee excluded high occupational exposure risk as a booster-eligible group breaking from the FDA recommendation and authorization. The committee’s vote to not authorize boosters for those with frequent occupational exposures stemmed primarily from concerns that the recommendation was overly broad – potentially leading to confusion as to who counts as a worker at “high risk.”

This combined with a shared view – including among some public health officials – that critical pieces of data being used to advocate for the booster in the broader population were incomplete and open to interpretation resulted in a 9-6 vote from the CDC committee against the third dose for those at increased occupational risk.

Back in alignment

Ultimately Walensky’s decision to side with the FDA on extending boosters to those with frequent occupational exposure – such as health care workers and teachers – brings the two agencies into alignment. And while it still falls short of the Biden administration’s pledge of boosters for all vaccine-eligible people in the U.S. the decision will pave the way for millions of third Pfizer doses to be administered in the coming months.

“As CDC Director it is my job to recognize where our actions can have the greatest impact. At CDC we are tasked with analyzing complex often imperfect data to make concrete recommendations that optimize health. In a pandemic even with uncertainty we must take actions that we anticipate will do the greatest good” Walensky said in a statement.

More guidance on COVID-19 boosters is expected to be issued soon for people who received the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said on ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday it's possible to provide both COVID-19 booster shots as well as doses for people who have not yet been vaccinated.

""I think it is also not the right thing to try to resolve it with an 'or' when you can resolve it with an 'and'"" Bourla told ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos. ""It's not 'Shall we give boosters or give primary doses to other people.' I think the answer should be 'Let's give both boosters and doses for other people.'""

With millions more Americans now newly eligible for a booster COVID-19 shot from Pfizer Bourla's optimism punctuates what's become a protracted hot-button issue amongst the scientific community over who needs the boost and when. The White House has stressed that the rationale for green-lighting boosters must be uncoupled from the question of global vaccinations and that one does not preclude the other.

Just after midnight Friday Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky endorsed her independent advisory panel's recommendation for seniors and other medically vulnerable Americans to get a booster shot of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine six months after their second dose partially overruling the panel by adding a recommendation for a third dose for people who are considered high risk due to where they work.

On ""This Week"" Sunday Bourla called that decision a ""very good one.""

""We are looking forward to being able to vaccinate all these vulnerable people so that we can put an end to this pandemic"" Bourla told Stephanopoulos.

The CDC's final sign-off at least in part buttoned up what has become a seething scientific debate on the issue. The Biden administration announced there would be ""boosters-for-all"" before any review from federal regulatory bodies or their independent groups and while some political appointees had endorsed that timeline some federal career scientists and advisers vehemently objected to the incomplete data they were being asked to assess -- and that there should be a more global focus on getting more first shots in arms.

The booster debate has played out amid the delta variant's surge even as the World Health Organization has reupped their call for a moratorium on booster shots in the interest of more equitable distribution of primary vaccinations as many countries are still struggling with providing first and second doses.

Pharmaceutical companies have faced criticism for not doing enough Stephanopoulos expressed pointing out a tweet from Dr. Tom Frieden CDC director under President Barack Obama.

""While focusing on selling expensive vaccines to rich countries Moderna and Pfizer are doing next to nothing to close the global gap in vaccine supply. Shameful"" Frieden wrote.

""He believes you should be waiving intellectual property to speed vaccine distribution. Is that a good idea?"" Stephanopoulos asked.

Bourla pushed back on the criticism and said he doesn't think it's a good idea.

""Intellectual property is what created the thriving life sciences sector that was ready when the pandemic hit"" Bourla said. ""Always there is more we can do but I want to make sure people understand what we are doing right now.""

That includes he said the commitment Pfizer has made to be able to produce billions of vaccine doses for both primary shots and boosters and pricing them lower for middle- and low-income countries.

Meanwhile as the academic year kicks off in into the pandemic's uncertainty for a second time -- and as pediatric COVID infections have soared to alarming levels -- Pfizer's Bourla told Stephanopoulos they expected to submit their data to the FDA for review very soon.

On Wednesday Pfizer released its first safety data about COVID-19 vaccines for children ages 5 to 11 reassuring parents that a safe and effective vaccine soon could be available for those younger than 12. In a trial of more than 2200 children results showed a smaller dose of Pfizer's vaccine -- one-third the amount given to adults and adolescents 12 and up -- provided robust and adequate immune responses among those ages 5 to 11.

""I think we are going to submit this data pretty soon. It's a question of days not weeks"" Bourla said deferring to the regulatory review process for final answers.

If and when the FDA does agree with Pfizer's assessment Bourla said his company is poised to finally begin providing shots to younger children.

In the midst of the promising data his company has touted however Bourla tempered his prediction for when the U.S. and world could finally return to ""normal life"" underscoring progress is dependent on improved vaccine uptake and some measure of herd immunity.

While he said ""within a year"" he believes ""normal life"" will make a return ""The most likely scenario for me is that because the virus is spread all over the world we will continue seeing new variants that are coming out.""

With that he predicts annual vaccinations will be the norm.

""But we don't know. We need to wait and see the data"" he added.

""Intellectual property is what created the thriving life sciences sector that was ready when the pandemic hit"" Bourla said. ""Without that we wouldn’t be here to discuss if we need boosters or not because we wouldn’t have vaccines.""

Bourla also said the U.S. government in a recent agreement with the company bought 1 billion vaccine doses at cost and they donate those doses at no cost to poorer countries.

""There’s no other company that can claim to have done so much good for humanity than we have done"" Bourla said calling Frieden’s comments ""unfair.""

Bourla noted that future vaccines could last at least a year to fight these new variants.

Ugochukwu who stands 6-foot-3 is a three-star prospect and the No. 274-ranked player in the 2024 class according to the 247Sports composite rankings. Listed as the No. 43-ranked combo guard he is expected to handle the point guard responsibilities at Miami.

""Divine is great young prospect out of Houston who had a tremendous senior season"" head coach Jim Larranaga said in a statement. ""He is a high-IQ point guard with elite athleticism and a great feel for the game. We are very excited to add a player like Divine to our freshman class.""

He averaged 17.6 points 4.4 rebounds 6.2 assists and 1.8 steals per game as a senior leading the Rangers to a 32-1 season with the only loss in the UIL Class 6A state championship game. He shot 54.6 percent from the field 37.3 percent from 3 and 75 percent from the free-throw line. He scored over 1500 points in his high school career and earned Texas Association of Basketball Coaches Class 6A All-Region III Team honors and was a finalist for the Guy V. Lewis Award given annually to the top player in the Houston area.

He played for Houston Hoops on the Nike EYBL circuit in 2023 averaging 6.6 points 3.6 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 12 games. He shot 54.7 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from 3.

Ugochukuwu joins Miami's 11th-ranked recruiting class which also includes guards Jalil Bethea and Austin Swartz and forward Isaiah Johnson-Arigu who each signed letters of intent in November and will be one of eight newcomers on the 2024-25 roster after a large turnover following Miami's 15-17 season.

Ugochukwu received an offer from Baylor last month. He also had offers from SMU and Texas A&M among others early in the recruiting process.

Clements also features 2026 shooting guard Aziz Olajuwon son of Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon and recent Marquette commit Joshua Clark.

Miami still has three scholarships remaining for the 2024-25 season.

Brunson is averaging an eye-popping 36.5 points per game in eight playoff appearances for the Knicks this season including a streak of four consecutive 40-point games in the postseason. The 27-year-old has been beyond impressive as the leader of a scrappy New York team that currently holds a 2-0 series lead over the Indiana Pacers after dispatching the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.

However gaudy Brunson's numbers might be there still is a massive gulf between his career accolades and the lengthy resume Curry has accumulated which includes four NBA titles two league MVP awards nine All-NBA selections and 10 All-Star nods. The 36-year-old also won the 2024 NBA Clutch Player of the Year award this season.

What Brunson and the Knicks are doing during the 2023-24 NBA playoffs is inspiring but don't get it twisted -- Curry still remains the gold standard at the point guard position.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Faced with the possibility of going into the luxury tax next season the New Orleans Pelicans could going into the offseason trying to cut payroll with several trade candidates on their roster.

Michael Scotto said on the latest episode of the HoopsHype podcast that CJ McCollum is ""not untouchable"" in trade talks but he's considered a ""grown-up in the room for a young Pelicans squad providing stability on the court and a good locker room presence for the team.""

The Pelicans currently have $167.4 million in salary on their books for next season. That total doesn't include cap holds that bring their total up to $199.7 million which is nearly $10 million over the projected second tax apron.

Jonas Valančiūnas who has a $23.2 million cap hold is the biggest question mark for the Pelicans among their potential free agents.

ESPN's Bobby Marks noted the Pelicans have never paid the luxury tax in franchise history and the front office's decision regarding Valančiūnas and Naji Marshall who is also a free agent will determine if the club has the full nontaxpayer mid-level exception of $12.9 million or the taxpayer mid-level of $5.1 million available.

Of the potential trade candidates for the Pelicans Brandon Ingram has been the most-talked about thus far. The 26-year-old will be playing on a $36 million expiring contract next season but his deal includes a 15 percent trade kicker that could complicate any potential deal.

ESPN's Brian Windhorst has cited the Philadelphia 76ers as a potential landing spot for Ingram this summer. Scotto noted rival executives consider him to be the ""most likely"" Pelicans player to be moved because the fit on the court ""isn't ideal"" with Zion Williamson.

Next season will mark the first year of McCollum's two-year $64 million deal he signed in September 2022. The contract has descending salaries of $33.3 million in 2024-25 and $30.7 million in 2025-26 that could make it easier to trade.

The Pelicans have invested a lot of money in this core that hasn't produced great results. They have made the playoffs in two of the past three years but lost in the first round both times. They were swept by the Oklahoma City Thunder this year with Williamson unavailable due to a hamstring injury he suffered in the play-in tournament loss to the Los Angeles Lakers."

(Adam Fenwick Photo)

MARTINSVILLE Va. — It’s been nearly two years since Philip Morris climbed aboard a race car to compete but that changes Saturday at Martinsville Speedway.

Morris a five-time NASCAR Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series national champion and three-time winner of Martinsville’s ValleyStar Credit Union 300 made a surprise return Friday thanks to a partnership with Billy Martin Racing that was arranged by his former crew chief Forrest Reynolds.

“Forrest Reynolds that’s the nuts and bolts of why I’m here” Morris said late Friday evening. “I’ve been away for a little while and I’ve wanted to race but it just didn’t feel right until now.

“For him to come up with this kind of arrangement is really really cool. It’s really honoring and humbling to me.”

Morris is one of the most decorated short-track racers in the Southeast having won nearly everything there is to win in the region. However following the passing of his son Blake last April Morris took an indefinite leave of absence from racing.

At the time of his passing Blake Morris had just begun racing late models alongside his father at tracks in Virginia. Now more than a year after his son’s death the 56-year-old Morris wanted to get back in a race car to honor his son.

Doing it at Martinsville just seemed like the right fit.

“One of the things that I liked when my son was racing was trying to teach him how to do the lines and how to get him through the corner” Morris recalled. “You know how kids are they usually don’t listen to whatever dad says. I always wanted to have a seat in the car with him beside me so I could show him the line and show him why the car would do what it would do with him.

“When he passed away in April a year ago that was pretty devastating” Morris continued. “I didn’t know if I ever would come back to do even a one-off like this right here (at Martinsville). I was steady on the fact he could be riding with me now. I didn’t want to miss that chance.

“I’ve always loved driving late models it’s where my heart is. But it’s been too raw for me to do it up until now.”

Morris acknowledged it was difficult keeping his emotions in check Friday. Martinsville was a place his son wanted to race which makes it even more challenging for Morris.

“It’s been tough all day. This is the place my son wanted to come. He wanted to come here and he wanted to come right away. He wasn’t scared” Morris said. “I hate that he missed that chance.”

The deal for Morris to drive for Billy Martin Racing which is also fielding a car for 2016 ValleyStar Credit Union 300 winner Mike Looney wasn’t finalized until about a week before the race. Very few were aware of the deal until his car appeared in the pits for inspection Friday morning.

“Billy Martin’s cars have always been pretty good. That’s pretty gracious of them to let us use it” Morris said. “It’s an opportunity you couldn’t turn down pretty much. Forrest’s heart was all the way in it and I thought it would be great for all the guys to get back together.

“Forrest hasn’t really told me how it happened” Morris added. “I feel pretty confident coming here that I can just get in the car and go.”

If Morris hopes to win the ValleyStar Credit Union 300 for the fourth time on Saturday he’ll have to race his way into the field via one of four 25-lap heat races. A disappointing qualifying effort Friday evening means he will start 14th in the second of the four heats.

Daniel Silvestri and Bobby McCarty are the only two competitors locked into the ValleyStar Credit Union 300 field. The remainder will have to come from the four heat races and Morris knows how difficult that can be.

“Obviously I had higher expectations for how we would perform here” Morris said. “You don’t lay off of this series for as long as I have and expect…it’s kind of lofty to expect something that big. This is the qualifying part of it. I feel pretty good about the racing side of it for what we have. We’ll just keep pressing on. My ultimate goal is happening so we’ll see how that works out and where it takes me from here.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

With a growing client list and $5 million round of series-A funding ransomware protection software company HeraSoft needed a central location for its formerly dispersed administrative staff. Now the company is based in the former county courthouse building 504 Silas St. and anticipates doubling or tripling its local staff in the next year.

“Real estate prices are very affordable services on the whole are very affordable relative to a top 50 U.S. city. All of these things for an early stage company like ours — we’re not a Fortune 500 company — we have to be really cognizant of everything we do. How we direct our resources is really critical” Anthem Blanchard said.

“I think with the COVID era that’s upon us people are appreciating less dense environments. Bartlesville is so neat … because it feels like a town that’s three to five times bigger.”

While the company plans to move more administrative sales and business development positions to its new headquarters it will maintain offices for research and development in Houston and programming in Sao Paulo Brazil he said.

In its Sept. 7 meeting the Bartlesville City Council approved a Bartlesville Development Authority program to offer those moving for the company $10000 for buying a house in the city or $20000 for building one as an incentive for inbound employees to live locally instead of in Owasso or Tulsa.

BDA President David Wood said in May when the Bartlesville Development Trust Authority was working with HeraSoft on possible building renovations it contacted BDA about a possible opportunity.

“So for us it wasn’t about landing the company it was about maximizing the community’s benefit from their decision – capturing new employees as new residents” Wood said.

“There was very little downside risk for us to offer the relocation incentive with an unlimited potential upside. Apple Computers was started in a garage so one never knows. It made sense for us to support them on a pay-as-they-grow basis. Certainly diversification beyond the cyclical oil and gas industry makes Bartlesville more resilient.”

With the large employment base and presence of both ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 making the community feel bigger and the growing role of the technology industry in the economy as a whole Anthem Blanchard said he feels the company has a lot of room to grow in its new home.

“It’s interesting to come to Bartlesville and feel like you’re still in a city but not have all the hassles. Everything is more efficient. In this day and age you can do everything electronically and not have to suffer through traffic” Anthem Blanchard said.

“All in all it’s a great location.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzLzIwMjEvc2VwLzI2L2Zsb3lkLXNhZ2VseS0yMDIxLTA5LTI2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Floyd E. Sagely Obituary,"Born March 26 1932 in Van Buren Ark. Floyd E. Sagely was one of aix children born to Garland and Virgie (Berry) Sagely. He was preceded in death by his parents; siblings Edith Opal JC Kenneth Jewell Ridenour and Maurice. He was also preceded in death by his daughter Cynthia Anne. He is survived by his wife of 67 years Jimmie Lou of the home; his son Floyd E. Sagely Jr.; and two grandsons: Weston and Colton Sagely of Fort Smith; and several nieces and nephews. After his father lost his job with the railroad in 1933 the family was forced to leave their home in Van Buren and move back to a one-room log cabin in Rudy Ark. which was built by hand by his father. There were nine people living in that one-room log cabin. The Sagely family as well as both his grandmothers lived there. In 1936 Sagely's father's job was reinstated with the railroad and they all moved back to Van Buren. Sagely was All-State in both football and basketball during his time at Van Buren High School. While attending high school he lettered in four sports: football baseball basketball and track. Van Buren won the Overall State Basketball Championship during his senior year in 1950. In addition he was voted Most Valuable Player in the State basketball tournament and was also voted All-Southern in football during high school. After graduation he was chosen to play in the high school All-American basketball game held in Murray Ken. One of his teammates in the game in Murray was Bob Petit who went on to be in the NBA Hall of Fame and was the first player to receive the NBA's Most Valuable Player Award. His interest in the oil and gas industry began in high school when the Phillips 66 Basketball Team invited him to Spring practice during his junior and senior years of high school. During the 1950-51 school year Sagely was a starter on both the freshmen football and basketball teams at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. He then moved up to the varsity team and became the last Razorback to be a starter in both football and basketball for all three varsity seasons. As a senior he led the SWC in football in pass receptions and led the Razorbacks in pass interceptions. He had 30 catches for 542 yards that year. This was the last time this feat was accomplished by any Razorback and he was ranked sixth in the nation. For the 1953 season he was named first-team All-SWC and second-team All-America. Along with Pat Summerall Sagely was on the All-Decade Football Team for the Razorbacks in the 1950's. Those two were the only Ends on that team. During the spring of 1954 the student body honored Sagely with a trophy for his outstanding career at the University in both football and basketball. This trophy now stands on exhibit at the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame in Little Rock. After his final University of Arkansas appearance in 1954 Oklahoma State head basketball coach Hank Iba said ""There goes the last of the Iron Men."" Upon graduation from the University Sagely was invited by the Committees in charge of the Blue/Gray All-Star Football Game and the East/West Shrine All-Star Football Game to participate in both games. He did however have to decline playing in both games as he had to concentrate on his basketball obligations. Also immediately after graduating from college Phillips 66 offered him a job at the Company and wanted him to play basketball for them. Prior to the NBA being formed amateur teams representing different corporations from all over the country were formed. He turned down this opportunity as he decided to play football in the National Football League. After college at 6'1"" and 185 pounds he was a second-round draft choice of the San Francisco 49ers and played offensive end and defensive back as a rookie in 1954. His professional football career was interrupted by the U.S. Army in 1955 where he served twenty-two months during the Korean War. He served in the Artillery Division at Fort Sill in Lawton Okla. during his time in the Service and was chosen to play on the All Army football team while there. He returned to the San Francisco 49ers in November of 1956. He spent the 1957 season as a defensive halfback for the Chicago Cardinals and then retired to go into the oil and gas business. In 1953 while attending the University of Arkansas Sagely met the love of his life Jimmie Lou Anderson. They married in the Spring of 1954. Soon after he was drafted into the NFL. Jimmie Lou was then and still is his greatest inspiration and supporter. She has stood by his side for more than 67 years. Together they had two children: Floyd E. Sagely Jr. and Cindy Sagely. They also have two grandsons: Weston and Colton Sagely. In 1958 he retired from the NFL and started as a Landman doing day work for various oil and gas companies. After a few years of doing different jobs for different oil and gas companies he formed his own oil and gas exploration company in 1962. That company still operates today as Floyd E. Sagely Properties Ltd. In the mid-1960's Sagely was one of the three founders of the first Fellowship of Christian Athletes organizations in Arkansas. He was also one of the first sponsors of the First Tee in Fort Smith Ark. By the special request of Jack Stephens Sagely went before the Fort Smith Board of Directors and First Tee began. Pat Summerall and a group of professional golfers came to town for that opportunity. In the 1980's Sagely served on the Board of the Arkansas State Golf Association for nine years. He was President of the Association for three of those years. Additionally Sagely along with Pat Summerall and Ray Tucker started the annual Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame Golf Tournament in 1999 now known as the Pat Summerall Celebrity Golf Classic which continues to grow each year and is a major fundraiser for the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame. As a young man he coached baseball and basketball with the church leagues in Fort Smith. He served as Chairman of the Board of Deacons at First Baptist Church and was a Sunday School teacher there too. He also served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of First United Methodist Church. In addition he filled a vacancy on the Fort Smith School Board. Sagely was the contact person with the PGA to bring the fundraising Fort Smith Golf Classic to Hardscrabble Country Club. This tournament was sponsored by Stephens Inc. and raised a lot of money each year for local charities. In 1985 Sagely was inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame. In 1997 Sagely was inducted into the University of Arkansas Sports Hall of Honor in Football. A private service for his family will be held and officiated by Ed Saucier with burial to follow at Oak Cemetery. Services are under the direction of Edwards Funeral Home.

Gianforte went on to praise the surrounding communities for their immediate response to the incident.

“Rescue teams and ambulances from Chinook Browning and down to Great Falls lined up at the incident site and outside the ER to assist” he said. “Community members brought food and supplies. Many of the passengers were comforted here in this building and other community members voluntarily provided airport trips to Great Falls or Kalispell to strangers so that family members could be reunited with the ones they love.”

Governor Gianforte then provided an update on the passengers.

“At this time I'm told all of the passengers that were on the train had been transported out of Chester” he said. “Additionally with the exception of the five passengers who remain hospitalized in stable condition all passengers have been treated and released from medical centers.”

Now he has reached the pinnacle completing his Eagle Scout project. The Eagle Scout is the highest honor for Boy Scouts.

The raised garden beds he built were dedicated on Sunday Sept. 12.

Kunst 16 lives in West Boylston and is a student at Leominster High School enrolled in the CTEi graphics communications program.

""Through the support my family showed and memories I made with my friends in Scouting over the past 10 years I made it to Eagle Scout"" Isana said. ""As a big thank you to the Immanuel Lutheran Church in Holden which have let Troop 175 of Holden""

The COVID-19 pandemic proved an inconvenience but Isana was able to make it work.

""Even with the precautions that made it difficult to meet in person while planning and the skyrocketing rates for supplies during the situation. I was able to get it done but not without the great team that I had an opportunity to lead and work with"" he said. ""It was my first time leading a team and was a learning experience for everyone. I hope for years to come many can enjoy the beautiful floral and vegetables planted for the community.""

Isana had family support for the project

""I am very proud of my son's accomplishments and working on this project. It taught him patience how to research prices and work with others"" his father Jason said. ""Also to work with being thrifty by trying to get reduced pricing. It’s not only a major commitment for the Scout but also for the family - if they’re involved - to help push along.

""Frustrating and overwhelming at times for all.""

Work began on the third-largest beach renourishment project ever in PCB earlier this month. During the next four to five months about 12 miles of white sandy beaches will be restored to their proper states after being heavily eroded by Hurricanes Michael and Sally.

According to the Bay County Tourism Development Council about 2.1 million cubic yards of sand will be placed during the $28.5 million federally-funded project. That’s the equivalent of 424145454.5 gallons enough to fill more than 642 Olympic swimming pools.

The fifth renourishment of Bay County beaches has started with work in the Carillon Beach area on Monday.

The project extends from Pinnacle Port to the PCB City Pier and from St. Andrews State Park (not including the park) to Ocean Towers. The middle of the beach from the City Pier to Ocean Towers will not be renourished because it did not experience enough erosion to justify construction.

While not directly receiving sand placement the middle reach will benefit from the sand placement occurring to the west and east the TDC says.

Because the project is federally funded the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will manage all construction work. The Bay County TDC on behalf of Bay County will serve as the local sponsor for the project and stay in constant communication and coordination with the Corps of Engineers.

“This project is super important” said Philip Griffitts Bay County commissioner and member of the TDC board. “Army Corps of Engineers surveys show that the No. 1 reason people continue to come here is still the beach.”

The federal funding was made possible following Michael and Sally Griffitts said.

“Both of those events were pretty detrimental” he said.

The fifth renourishment of Bay County beaches has started with work in the Carillon Beach area on Monday.

Equipment and pipeline continue to be delivered to the west end project area beach the TDC states. Active dredging and placement of sand on the beach has begun in the Carillon Beach area.

Construction should progress at a rate of 500 feet to 1500 feet per day. Barring any temporary work stoppages this means the active construction area might be in front of residents’ properties for only a couple of days.

The sand for large-scale beach nourishment projects comes from permitted offshore “borrow areas.” The main borrow area is located about 1.5 miles offshore of Shell Island and secondary borrow areas are located near the St. Andrews Bay entrance channel.

The project is not expected to impact sea turtles as their nesting season has wrapped up for the year. There are permitted procedures in place for relocation of nests that could be laid late in the season that would be impacted by the start of construction in September and October.

While this latest project is third largest of its kind ever in PCB it’s also only the fifth for the area.

The fifth renourishment of Bay County beaches has started with work in the Carillon Beach area on Monday.

“It takes years to pull these projects off” Griffitts said. “It’s a very big process once it gets going.”

The initial restoration in Panama City Beach in 1998-1999 placed about 9.8 million cubic yards of sand along the 18.5 miles of beaches. The 2005-2006 project placed about 3.3 million cubic yards of sand along 17.5 miles of beaches and it was conducted in response to 2004’s Hurricane Ivan.

The 2011 project placed about 1.3 million cubic yards of sand along 7.5 miles of the beaches (east and west ends) and was referred to as a “repair” project as it was conducted in response to several storms following Hurricane Ivan. That project also formally incorporated a project at Pinnacle Port and Carillon Beach.

The 2017 project placed about 840000 cubic yards of sand along four project areas — a half-mile at Pinnacle Port/Carillon Beach a 1-mile segment stretching west from the City Pier a 1-mile segment stretching west from the County Pier and a 1-mile segment stretching from the western end of St. Andrews State Park to Gulf Drive/Hurt Street.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRod2VzdHN0YXIuY29tLmF1L3N0b3J5Lzc0NDU3NzYvY2xhc3NpYy1mYWxjb24tc2VsbHMtZm9yLXJlY29yZC0xM20v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Classic Falcon sells for record $1.3m,"""It is the pinnacle of Australian muscle cars and has consistently held its value over its lifespan since its release in 1971"" Mr Hames said in a statement on Sunday.",,,,,,

At present Heritage Pool Supply Group is one of the newest companies in the industry. This number one pool company intends to become a nationwide distributor of pool products. Recently the Heritage Supply Group bought Naperville Ill.-based Aqua-Gon. Nevertheless the other principals of this top-notch pool company will still run its operations in its designated locations.

The future looks promising for Heritage Supply Group

President of Heritage Pool Supply Matt McDermott says that the company has an excellent reputation. Thus they have managed to build a strong rapport with their partners and clientele. Moreover they are striving to become the best in the pool industry in the next few years.

On the other hand the president and owner of Aqua-Gon Phil Horvath says that partnering with Heritage looks promising. He says that Heritage will provide them with all the necessary resources they need to expand their company. Not to mention the programs offered by Heritage will give them amazing financial and professional opportunities. Phil believes that they will build a legacy out of this partnership.

The success of Heritage Supply Group over the years

Heritage is the second pool company to venture nationwide this year. In the past twenty years the pool and spa distribution industry was only dominated by one company. Founded in 2018 Heritage Landscape and Supply have tremendously grown over the past few years. Now Heritage is supplying its services to up to 135 locations in 25 states in America. The company owes its rapid growth to the established distributors it acquired. Heritage has approximately 15 to 20 branches that were the recently acquired distributors.

The operations of the company

Heritage company says that they seek to create an independent family more than establishing a national channel. Thus the company prefers that all acquired distributors operate on their own like before. The previous owners continue to operate like before. Nevertheless all administrative duties are dealt with by Heritage. Additionally Heritage does not expect these distributors to change their brand names. They will continue operating and meeting customer needs in their local area. Keep in mind that local pool owners are already familiar with our acquired distributors. Therefore changing their brand name might lower our sales in the respective areas.

McDermott says “As Heritage Pool Supply Group they will help their distributors to operate to their maximum potential. But this does not mean that they will alter their brand name. Heritage also plans to grow by giving its employees leadership roles. In particular the company plans to make its employees shareholders of the company in the near future.

Heritage Pool Supply Group is not selective when it comes to choosing partners

It is not clear where Heritage plans to start first. Also the company has not set any deadlines for all the set goals. McDermott says that the company will identify its service locations based on the opportunities available. He says that they cannot jump into any market blindly. There’s a lot they need to evaluate before venturing into a particular market. The company is very deliberate in meeting and working with the most professional people.

Fortunately the company is very flexible on the companies they plan to work with. Nevertheless there have to be principals that align with their values before they choose to work with you. But generally Heritage is not looking for owners who plan to leave the sale immediately does not cater to their requirements.

Currently PoolCorp holds a significant market share in the pool industry. McDermott says that there’s space for everyone in the pool industry. All companies can win and coexist really well.”

In case you didn’t know the Heritage Pool Supply Group comes from the SRS family of distributors. SRS began with selling building products. At present SRS has 460 locations in 44 states. Two private equity groups Leonard Green & Partners and Boston-based Berkshire Partners back up this company.

Conclusion

Heritage Pool Supply Group is looking to expand its distribution services across the nation. Fortunately the company is not selective when it comes to choosing people to work with. The company also hopes to continue expanding in the next few years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0aWVzL3B1bmUtbmV3cy9wbWMtb3BlbnMtc3dpbW1pbmctcG9vbHMtZm9yLWFsbC12YWNjaW5hdGVkLXdpdGgtYm90aC1jb3ZpZC1kb3Nlcy0xMDE2MzI2NjM1NzkxNjEuaHRtbNIBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0aWVzL3B1bmUtbmV3cy9wbWMtb3BlbnMtc3dpbW1pbmctcG9vbHMtZm9yLWFsbC12YWNjaW5hdGVkLXdpdGgtYm90aC1jb3ZpZC1kb3Nlcy0xMDE2MzI2NjM1NzkxNjEtYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PMC opens swimming pools for all vaccinated with both Covid doses,"PUNE The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has issued an order allowing all swimmers who have taken both Covid-19 vaccine doses to be allowed to use swimming pools in the city.

Mark Neal principal of Wells Middle School 6800 Penn Drive was put on paid administrative leave after the incident which was captured on video.

Heather Duncan an assistant superintendent with the Dublin Unified School District announced that Neal would return to work in an e-mail sent out Friday to the school’s staff.

“The district has completed its investigation” Duncan said in the email.

What sparked the Sept. 17 confrontation remains unclear.

The student who recorded the video 15-year-old Sebastian Feliciano and his mother Lisa Archuleta Feliciano told this news organization that during their interaction Neal slapped Sebastian’s phone from his hand then pushed a table against his mother to stop her from getting to the phone.

While the video does not indicate that the volatile discussion got physical the confrontation caused a stir in the community. Some people commenting on a Nextdoor post that included the video called for Neal to be fired.

But dozens of teachers and staff from Wells which has about 1000 students gathered in front of the school to express support for Neal. They said he has been a unifying presence since taking the helm last year.

The confrontation at Wells took place after Feliciano’s mother said she wanted to meet with Neal to clear up an incident involving her son.

Dublin police said a school resource officer was sent to the campus Sept. 17 around 3:15 p.m. after receiving a report of a “high school-aged” person “causing a disturbance on a bicycle in that area.”

Police said the person “was contacted by our SRO and dispersed from the area.”

Sebastian said he was that student and visited the school while on his way to his grandparents’ home because he felt he needed to intervene when he saw a crowd of people including staff members allegedly involved in a confrontation around some girls who are family friends of his.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

At the Troup County School System board meeting on Thursday the board approved Deana Brown who has served as the director of elementary education for the last two years as the new assistant superintendent of curriculum instruction and professional learning.

“Deana competed against eight very strong candidates during interviews on Wednesday Sept. 8 2021” Shumate said. “The interview committee consisted of 11 people: the superintendent one assistant superintendent two human resources directors one elementary principal one middle school principal one high school principal one high school assistant principal one nursing coordinator one technology director and one chief financial officer.”

Shumate said Brown began her administrative career as an assistant principal in the Meriwether County School System.

“She accepted her first principal position in 2011 at Mountain View Elementary in Meriwether and served in that position until being promoted in 2017 to the position of assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction” he said. “She has a proven track record of success in the elementary division as a principal and as an assistant superintendent. Her experience and expertise will be a valuable asset to our administrative team.”

Brown thanked the school board for allowing her the opportunity to serve them faculty and staff students and the community in her new role.

“I know they are very big shoes to fill with a lot of expectations” she said. “And I’ve had the pleasure of working with so many visionary leaders over the last couple of years to see the things that are already going on in Troup County that are really absolutely amazing. But to continue to build onto that and make it to where we have high expectations for all of our students and provide additional opportunities that they are interested in that make them very successful members of our community upon graduation.”

In other business at the meeting a number of teachers were honored for continuing their education with advanced degrees. They were Thomas Edward Lawson Jr. who recently completed his master of applied teaching/teaching secondary education from the University of Georgia; Bridgette Tatum who completed her specialist in curriculum and instruction from LaGrange College; Shelby Key Waldroup a horticulture teacher at Troup High School who completed her master of science in agricultural leadership and education from the University of Georgia; and Kelton Hunt an audio-visual/film teacher at Troup High School received his master of music in music production from Berklee College of Music.

Community volunteers were also recognized.

“We have a group of amazing community volunteers who stepped up last year during a critical time for our virtual students to become trained virtual volunteer tutors and mentors” Board Chair Cathy Hunt said.

“These community volunteers were trained in literacy practices to work with matched elementary school students twice a week for at least 30 minutes each session.”

Hunt said the volunteer tutors not only helped with “tricky words” phonemic awareness drills and interactive read aloud from online reading sites but built relationships with the students and their families.

“We are grateful for their commitment during a year that our school system and our families needed extra supports from the community” she said.

“Several of these community tutors are still working virtually with their students this year as well.”

The volunteers recognized were Pam Huff Debra Boswell Lera Cotton Robin Cheeks and Sharon Dunson from Continental Society; Catherine Holmes Emily Joseph Kim Myers Stephanie Preston and Gail Gordon from Get Troup Reading; Ann and David Sellman Debbie Burdette Sue Duttera and Judy Lawrence from First Presbyterian Church; Ann Blackwell Claire Batchelor Kay Elem and Cerie Godfrey from First Baptist Church; Barb Henigin from Rotary; Molly Allen Heather Wallace and Pam Murphy from TCSS staff; Chalton Askew Connie Askew Edward Boswell and Erin Srivastava from Education Task Force; Maralyn Hazelgrove from Foster Grandparents; and Nathan Taylor from Troup County Sheriff’s Department.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vc3R1ZHljYWZlLmluL2dzdC1jYmljLXJlbGF4ZXMtcmVxdWlyZW1lbnQtb2YtZmlsaW5nLWpvYi13b3JrLWRlY2xhcmF0aW9uLWluLWZvcm0tZ3N0LWl0Yy0wNC0xMDU2NDcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GST: CBIC relaxes Requirement of Filing Job Work Declaration in Form GST ITC-04,"GST: CBIC relaxes Requirement of Filing Job Work Declaration in Form GST ITC-04

The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has announced that the filing of employment work declarations in Form GST ITC-04 is no longer required.

The term “job work” refers to the process of a person working on items that belong to another registered person. The main manufacturer retains ownership of the items which does not pass to the job-worker. The job worker’s role is to carry out the process that the main manufacturer specifies on the goods that are delivered to him. A job worker is someone who does job-related tasks.

For instance a large belt manufacturer (principal) delivers half-finished belts (upper section) to smaller manufacturers (job employees) to punch the hole. The belts are sent back to the big manufacturer (principal) by the smaller manufacturers (job workers).

Taxpayers whose annual aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year is above Rs. 5 crores shall furnish ITC-04 once every six months while taxpayers whose annual aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year is up to Rs. 5 crores shall furnish ITC-04 annually as per rule 45 (3) of the CGST Rules.

The Central Goods and Services Tax (Eighth Amendment) Rules 2021 were recently published by the CBIC.

With effect from October 1 2021 the following changes will be made to Rule 45(3) of the CGST Rules: for the words “during a quarter” the words “during a specified period” will be substituted; for the words “the said quarter” the words “the said period” will be substituted; after the proviso the following Explanation will be inserted: “Explanation. – The word “specified period” shall mean (a) the period of six consecutive months beginning on April 1st and ending on October 1st in respect of a principal whose aggregate turnover during the immediately preceding financial year exceeds five crore rupees; and (b) a financial year in any other case.”

Details of challans for goods dispatched to or received from a job worker during a specified period must be included in FORM GST ITC-04 filed for that period on or before the twenty-fifth day of the month following the said period or within such further period as the Commissioner may extend by notification. Any extension of the time limit notified by the Commissioner of State Tax or the Commissioner of Union Territory Tax is presumed to have been notified by the Commissioner.",,,,,,

He was at that moment trying to mediate a Democratic Party struggle between the left-wing lawmakers sitting before him and the moderates he had hosted a few hours earlier. When the meeting ended Biden pulled aside Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington State. He thumbed through a folder of papers he was holding. Eventually Biden handed Jayapal a copy of the speech he delivered to Congress in April in which he laid out the economic vision he wanted to enact—the ambitious agenda to expand the social safety net over which Democrats are currently haggling.

The president’s gesture of support underscored the political reality that is driving the tense negotiations on Capitol Hill: In the battle for ideological supremacy in the Democratic Party the progressives have already won. Biden was indeed a proud moderate during his three and a half decades as a senator but he has fallen in firmly with the progressives as president. He’s embraced the agenda championed by the likes of his former rivals Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren—tackling climate change; creating a new child-care tax credit; expanding the government’s role in health care; endorsing universal pre-K free community college and paid family leave—and made it his own. The moderates in the House and Senate are balking at the size and scope of Biden’s plan and still the president is siding with the progressives. He used last week’s meetings to reassure lawmakers like Jayapal and to pressure centrists such as Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona who have opposed the $3.5 trillion price tag of the Democrats’ proposal but have yet to make a counteroffer of their own.

The progressives’ intraparty victory could wind up being an empty one in the end. With the Democrats’ slim majorities in Congress the moderates have the votes to sink all but the relatively modest infrastructure portion of Biden’s agenda which passed the Senate in a bipartisan vote this past summer. Embittered progressives could then reject the infrastructure bill leaving the party with a catastrophic whiff heading into its already-uphill effort to hold Congress in next year’s midterm elections. “Most people feel that progressives have gotten rolled over and over again because they haven’t been able or willing to leverage their power” Jayapal told me.

At minimum the moderates are likely to scale back the much larger package that Democrats need to pass without help from Republicans. But that prospect is not as frightening to progressives as it might have been in past years. Because of their early success the second bill is so broad that even if moderates were to cut its cost in half Biden could still lay claim to legislative accomplishments that when added to the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan enacted this spring are more significant than any Democratic president of the past half century. Manchin opposes the breadth of the bill’s climate provisions and House moderates have blocked a plan aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs. The Senate parliamentarian has nixed a proposal to include a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Yet even if those measures are watered down or scrapped what’s left in the bill would still dramatically increase federal support for child care early education college and health care.

“Progressives are in the driver’s seat here” says Joseph Geevarghese the executive director of Our Revolution the advocacy group that grew out of Senator Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign. “Are we going to get everything we want? No. That’s just the reality of politics. But if you look at where we are compared to the Obama era it’s transformational.”

Read: The man in Joe Biden’s way

The dynamic playing out under Biden is a direct result of the lessons Democrats—both elected leaders and progressive activists—learned from their experience the last time the party controlled both chambers of Congress and the White House. The Democratic majorities in 2009–10 were far larger but each of the major legislative initiatives of that era started closer to the political center as compromises designed to attract Republican votes. Democrats held back the cost of their initial stimulus package in 2009 and loaded it up with tax cuts at the expense of bigger investments in other areas such as infrastructure. They modeled the Affordable Care Act on a law that Mitt Romney signed as the GOP governor of Massachusetts. The climate bill that never passed the Senate adopted a market-based cap-and-trade program instead of a simpler carbon tax.

On all of those proposals moderates outmaneuvered progressives without succeeding in winning over Republicans. Now progressives are driving the policy agenda and have a Democratic president they can claim as an ally. “He was not my candidate in the election” Jayapal who backed Sanders in the 2020 primary said of Biden. “But what he has laid out in this Build Back Better Plan is extremely progressive and what he has supported as we’ve gone through is extremely progressive.” Even so Jayapal isn’t taking any chances. As chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus she has led the group in adopting a more confrontational posture toward the party leadership. Progressives in the House have threatened to vote down the Senate-approved bipartisan infrastructure bill if the broader Democratic bill does not pass first.

The most consequential move by progressives however might prove to be not their tactical positioning now but their success in winning—and keeping—Biden’s support for their agenda. When the president gave Jayapal a copy of his speech last week he was demonstrating to her that he would fight for their agenda as it hangs on the edge that their vision remains his vision. Jayapal asked him to sign it and he did. An autographed speech is not the presidential signature that progressives ultimately want but for the moment it’s the best they can get.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUub3JnL2xhdGVzdC9yZWxpZ2lvdXMtcmlnaHQtY29udGludWVzLXBvaXNvbi1ldmVyeXRoaW5nLW1hc2Npb3RyYS0yMTA5MjQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How the Religious Right Continues to 'Poison Everything',"The destructive influence of rightwing evangelical Christianity is one of the most underrated factors in the devolution of American politics. Despite falling rates of religious participation among the general public Christian conservatives have to paraphrase Christopher Hitchens poisoned everything.

By conquering the Republican Party the religious right has taken over the Supreme Court. The horror of this is currently on full display in Texas where the state government has deputized random citizens to report women (or anyone who assists them) to authorities for even inquiring about how to obtain an abortion. For the McCarthyite act of “naming names” to draconian law enforcement agencies Texans can receive a $10000 reward if they file a civil lawsuit against the people they name.

Meanwhile white evangelical Christians—81 percent of whom voted for Donald Trump in 2020—are the most zealous and deranged in their objections to the COVID-19 vaccine. As if enabling the spread of a deadly disease wasn’t poisonous enough many Christian conservatives express blanket opposition to anything deemed remotely “progressive” such as Black Lives Matter trans rights and measures to mitigate climate change.

It often mystifies observers of U.S. politics how so many Christians could routinely behave according to an agenda of hatred paranoia and oppression.

One of the most shocking images of the January 6 insurrection was a group of young men including the so-called QAnon shaman standing at the head of the Senate Chamber praying to Jesus that their efforts to dismantle democracy would prevail. They were not alone. In the company of white supremacists and violent militia groups large numbers of Christian nationalists carried crosses and religious banners as they stormed the Capitol building and cheered for the execution of one of their brethren Vice President Mike Pence.

It often mystifies observers of U.S. politics how so many Christians could routinely behave according to an agenda of hatred paranoia and oppression. Randall Balmer a historian of U.S. religion and professor at Dartmouth College puts an end to the mystery in his riveting and important new book Bad Faith: Race and the Rise of the Religious Right (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company). At a breezy pace and in clever prose Balmer examines the impetus of the religious right tracing exactly how its adherents entered politics and why they have developed into an enemy of multiracial democracy.

The book opens with Balmer for research purposes begrudgingly attending a 1990 closed-door conference of evangelical leaders to mark the tenth anniversary of Ronald Reagan’s election to the presidency. In the middle of an otherwise dull and self-congratulatory event Paul Weyrich—a Republican strategist and co-founder of the Heritage Foundation who perhaps more than anyone else was responsible for the politicization of evangelicals—gives an “impassioned soliloquy in which he declared that abortion had nothing whatsoever to do with the emergence of the Religious Right.”

The initial issue that galvanized Christian conservatives into political action by Weyrich’s own admission was the federal government’s removal of tax exemptions from religious schools that refused to admit Black students. Balmer writes that Moral Majority leader Ed Dobson one of the Reverend Jerry Falwell’s leading surrogates quickly concurred. Surrounding them on the stage were rightwing power brokers such as Richard Viguerie the pioneer of direct mail fundraising for the Republican Party; Ralph Reed then executive director of the Christian Coalition; and Donald Wildmon founder of the American Family Association. No one objected to Weyrich’s assessment.

Evangelical Christians were largely apolitical in the 1960s and 1970s due to their theological doctrine that the world is irredeemably corrupt and the belief that a Christian’s sole duty is to evangelize for the faith while waiting on the apocalypse. The Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade in 1973—yet Jerry Falwell’s first reference to abortion did not appear in a sermon until 1978. Six years before Roe v. Wade Ronald Reagan who would become an icon for the Protestant right championed and signed the most liberal pro-abortion law in the country in 1967 while he was governor of California.

Contrary to popular belief it was not Reagan but Jimmy Carter who first attracted the electoral support of evangelical Christians because of his own “born again” testimony. Without regard for ideology Christian Conservatives were compelled to vote a fellow evangelical into the highest office in the United States. Less than four years later the flock would choose Reagan as its shepherd helping to lead the country off a cliff of union busting exploitation of the poor and racial demagoguery.

Balmer marshals a staggering amount of evidence to prove that the Religious Right turned away from Carter (and forever into the arms of the Republican Party) because of the federal government’s revocation of tax exempt status for religious schools that discriminated against students and families of color.

Following the Brown v. Board decision Balmer shows that there was a mass exodus out of public schools in the South and many Christian alternatives including Jerry Falwell’s own Lynchburg Christian School opened with the explicit promise to enforce a “whites only” admission policy.

It was actually not Carter but President Gerald Ford who began to investigate and punish Christian “segregation academies” to use Balmer’s appellation; Carter enhanced the policy by devoting more funding and personnel including lawyers in his newly created Department of Education to the cause of racial integration.

As Balmer notes throughout the book Falwell James Dobson several administrators from Bob Jones University Grover Norquist and many other rightwing luminaries are on public record confirming Balmer’s thesis: “The real roots of the Religious Right lay not in the defense of a fetus but in the defense of racial segregation.”

The birth of the religious right is critical in comprehending U.S. politics for several reasons. First it demonstrates the centrality of racism to the Republican Party both among its leaders and its foot soldiers. Reagan barely attempted to disguise his hostility to Black people in his public statements decrying “welfare queens” and praising “states’ rights” in a Southern city infamous for hate crimes against civil rights activists.

The increasingly reactionary GOP is not a “blue-collar protest party” but a white nationalist and theocratic insurgency.

Decades later Donald Trump tore off the thin mask that Reagan had worn with his wry smile. No amount of propaganda or delusional leftwing theorizing about the consequences of the real failures of the Democratic Party can conceal the truth of what the Republican Party is today. The increasingly reactionary GOP is not a “blue-collar protest party” to quote Thomas Frank but a white nationalist and theocratic insurgency.

Second the Religious Right’s commitment to Jim Crow exposes the deceit of its favorite weasel term “religious freedom” which is regularly invoked to justify sexism homophobia and opposition to mask and vaccine mandates.

The book ends where it begins with the nauseating candor of Paul Weyrich. He told Balmer and other journalists on various occasions that he knew a transition to abortion was ultimately necessary because overt appeals to racism would have undermined the nationwide popularity of the Religious Right.

Cooperating with the advice of his handlers Reagan as a presidential candidate turned on a dime into one of the most obstinate forces against reproductive freedom. His running mate George H.W. Bush did the same.

Abortion now has members of the Religious Right in combat mode and they’ve finally succeeded in establishing their dystopic dream in Texas. As long as the rightwing Supreme Court refuses to hear challenges to the Texas law many other states in the South and the Midwest are likely to enact their own versions leaving women in a desperate position where their health constitutional rights and bodily autonomy exist under the control of Christian nationalists and the politicians who pander to them.

Bad Faith: Race and the Rise of the Religious Right provides a rich irony to anyone looking to better understand the Christian conservative insurgency and its fanatical opposition to democracy and public health. It is a phrase belonging to Charles Darwin that best summarizes the religious right: They bear the stamp of their “lowly origin.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL2Vjb25vbWljLWVxdWFsaXR5L3dlbmRlbGwtYmVycnktb24tY2FwaXRhbGlzbdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wendell Berry on Capitalism Advertising Greed and the Good Life,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.laprogressive.com/economic-equality/wendell-berry-on-capitalism on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUuY29tL2Vjb25vbWljLWVxdWFsaXR5L3dlbmRlbGwtYmVycnktb24tY2FwaXRhbGlzbdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1bmpvdXJuYWwuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMjYvZmFjZS10aW1lLWNsYXJrLWNoYW1iZXJsaW4tYWQtY29weXdyaXRlci13b3JraW5nLW9uLWV2ZXJ5dGhpbmctZnJvbS1wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZS10by1wZXBzaS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Face Time: Clark Chamberlin — ad copywriter working on everything from Progressive to Pepsi,"Auburn native Clark Chamberlin was recognized earlier this year as one of Adweek’s 2021 Creative 100 billed as “an annual celebration of today’s most fascinating creative professionals.”

We asked about his career path and for a behind-the-scenes peek. He shared the creative process the occasional wee-hours-of-the-morning hours and what it’s like to see your work out in the wild.

Name: Clark Chamberlin

Age: 29

Lives: San Francisco

What career path led you to copywriting? I went to Babson College outside of Boston. That’s a school where the only major is business so when I graduated with a bachelor’s in management the one advertising job I qualified for was in client relations. And that’s what I did. I started as an account executive at Mullen helping manage clients on greeting card brands and banks. I was pretty mediocre at it but that first job helped me discover that I’d love to be a copywriter: the person who comes up with ideas for ads.

Once I decided I should make the switch I spent about six months building a copywriting portfolio. I’d write fake ads for all kinds of brands and mock up my best ones so they looked real. I eventually used those fake ads to land a job as a copywriter at Arnold. They’re the Boston agency that invented Flo so there I spent two years helping come up with ads for Progressive Insurance among other large national brands.

Then I got a call from Goodby Silverstein & Partners the San Francisco agency behind “Got Milk” and many iconic Super Bowl commercials. I spent almost three years at GS&P working on big game ads for Doritos and Pepsi an Oscar’s campaign for Adobe and I even made an ad with David Hasselhoff. It was awesome. Goodby and Silverstein (who are both in their 70s now) creative-directed many of my projects and I learned a ton from them.

In October I’m headed to work for Erich & Kallman a new 25-person agency in San Francisco run by the guy who wrote “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like.” You know the Old Spice commercial with the handsome man on a horse? I’m pretty excited about it. And that means I’ll be in the Bay Area a bit longer which I’m excited about too.

Can you walk us through the process of how an ad comes to life? It’s actually pretty fast. From ideation to production the whole process takes about three months.

First the client comes to us with a problem or a business challenge. I spend about two weeks coming up with ad campaigns that might help solve it and then pitch my ideas and solutions to creative directors. After we’re feeling good about a few directions I write about 20 scripts we present five to our clients and they eventually choose one winner.

Sometimes we test the winning script with focus groups sometimes we don’t but once we have the final green light we find a director hire actors and then film the commercial. It’s usually cheaper to shoot internationally so we might go somewhere like Mexico City or Kyiv Ukraine. Kyiv is actually super popular right now.

During COVID times we’ve been filming commercials remotely so we just send the director to our shoot location and then watch along on Zoom. Ukraine’s daytime is pretty far off from California’s (it’s a 10-hour difference) so most of my recent shoots have involved lots of coffee.

When filming is done we put the commercial together with an editor pick music and sound effects with a sound designer add visual effects with an animation studio and then grade it with a colorist. Normally I’m in a different location for each of those steps (usually LA or NY) but again COVID restrictions have required us to do that part remotely too.

And then the commercial is finished. The client approves and we put it on air.

I hear you’ll have an ad in the Super Bowl next year? Is it your first? I’ve worked on Super Bowl campaigns before but this one (if it gets made) will be really great. I can’t talk about any of the details but I’d be proud to have my name on it.

What’s it feel like when you’re watching TV and it’s suddenly “Hey! I worked on that.”? When I first started seeing my ads out in the world was an amazing feeling. Now it feels a bit more normal. In fact when I see something I wrote on TV I often find myself nitpicking it. I should stop doing that haha.

It must give you a keen eye in spotting details in other ads most people might miss like unexpected green screen use or unusual edits? Yeah for sure. One thing I notice a lot is actors. There are like 200 people in LA who star in pretty much every commercial. You see them in most of your casting sessions so you start to notice them in other commercials too. I swear I’ve seen the same guy in like six different ads this week. Good for him.

You’ve also been involved in pro bono work? Pro bono work is something I’m really passionate about. I’m constantly coming up with ideas to help social issues and then pitching them to relevant charities. So far I’ve done campaigns for gun safety COVID-19 home fire awareness and I’m currently pitching ideas for Pride 2022.

I loved this line in your bio: “When I’m not making ads I’m probably making music skiing or riding my motorcycle around the Bay Area. Please don’t tell my mom.” Let’s pretend your mom isn’t reading. Should any reader find themselves in the Bay Area on a bike what stretch do they need to check out? The Bay Area is an amazing place to have a motorcycle. You’ve got fun hills to ride downtown ocean roads along the Pacific Coast Highway and mountains right next to the Golden Gate Bridge. But honestly the reason I have a bike is for the parking. It’s hard to find car spaces in downtown SF but motorcycle parking is always a breeze. Luckily my new job has a parking garage.

Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona has reportedly told her Democratic colleagues that she will not support any tax hikes on corporations or wealthy individuals a stance that could derail the party's plan to fund its sprawling safety net and climate package.

""The right-wing Dems are carrying water for big corporations and billionaires who don't want their taxes to go up.""

According to the New York Times Sinema's ""resistance to tax rate increases"" that Democrats have proposed to finance their reconciliation bill ""has set off a scramble for alternatives including a carbon tax international corporate tax changes and closing loopholes for businesses that pay through the individual income tax system.""

Democrats can't afford a single defection in the Senate a dynamic that gives Sinema and other right-wing lawmakers significant leverage over the reconciliation bill which is a centerpiece of President Joe Biden's domestic policy agenda. On top of opposing tax hikes Sinema has also said she won't support a package that includes $3.5 trillion in spending over the next decade a price tag that progressive lawmakers have characterized as a bare minimum.

""This gives away what is really going on in Congress"" Robert Cruickshank campaign director at the advocacy group Demand Progress said in response to Sinema's posturing. ""The right-wing Dems are carrying water for big corporations and billionaires who don't want their taxes to go up.""

The government watchdog group Accountable.US estimates that Sinema has received at least $923000 in donations from industry lobbying groups that are currently working to kill or water down Democrats' reconciliation package which has been dubbed the Build Back Better Act. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and its leadership boards have donated $448000 to the Arizona Democrat Accountable.US found.

""Super-rich corporations have given Senator Sinema nearly a million reasons to vote against making them pay their fair share in taxes"" Kyle Herrig president of Accountable.US said in a statement. ""Make no mistake if she sides with her wealthy donors and kills popular investments to jump-start the economy everyday families--including across Arizona--will pay the price.""

It's not clear whether Sinema would be willing to tank the entire reconciliation package over Democrats' proposed tax increases which would partially or completely reverse elements of the GOP's deeply unpopular 2017 tax law. Sinema voted against the Republican tax cuts.

According to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy House Democrats' proposal to fund the Build Back Better Act ""would result in a tax cut for the average taxpayer in all income groups except the richest 5%.""

On Friday Biden expressed confidence that congressional Democrats will ultimately approve enough revenue raisers to ""pay for"" the entire reconciliation package which is expected to include major investments in green energy child care housing Medicare expansion and more.

""It is zero price tag on the debt we're paying"" the president said in remarks from the State Dining Room of the White House. ""We're going to pay for everything we spend.""

Sinema's opposition to her party's tax plan was reported as progressive and conservative Democrats continued to fight over the top-line price tag and the specific details of the emerging reconciliation package. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced Saturday that she intends to bring to the floor and pass both the Build Back Better Act and a $550 billion partisan infrastructure bill--which Sinema helped author--within the next week.

""The initiatives of the Build Back Better Act are ones in which President Biden takes a great pride which House and Senate Democrats share"" Pelosi wrote in a ""Dear Colleague"" letter. ""Build Back Better will cut taxes for the middle class create more jobs lower costs for working families and make sure the wealthiest and corporations pay their fair share.""

Last month Pelosi vowed to bring the Senate-passed bipartisan infrastructure bill to the House floor for a vote by September 27. But progressives are threatening to vote down the bipartisan bill if it comes up before Congress approves the reconciliation package which likely won't be finished by Monday.

Progressives fear that passing the bipartisan bill first would free conservative Democrats to tank or dramatically pare back the reconciliation package.

In an appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.)--chair of the 96-member Congressional Progressive Caucus--said that ""the votes aren't there"" to pass the bipartisan bill before the reconciliation process is complete.

""Ultimately we're delivering on the president's agenda"" Jayapal said. ""The Build Back Better agenda is not some crazy agenda that just a few people support. It's actually the vast majority of the Democratic caucus and there's a few people in the House and a couple in the Senate who aren't quite there yet. But even moderates in frontline districts all support this Build Back Better agenda."""

Earlier this month the government unveiled the Account Aggregator (AA) network to allow sharing of financial data of individuals which can be used by various financial services providers such as banks insurers fintech companies.

""We really look forward to that. We have been in discussion for onboarding on that platform. What the system can really do is that it will digitise the whole journey (of data collection)...today if I have to ask a customer I will have to ask for his bank statement income tax statement among others.

""It is a big enabler and there are some discussions. We will have to see operationally where exactly we are"" Deepak Kinger Chief - Risk and Compliance ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company (ICICI Pru Life) told PTI.

When a customer buys an insurance policy the core part in that buying journey is that the insurer provides coverage against whatever will be income loss to the family in case of an untoward happening the official said.

""As a part of that an important element is to do a financial assessment of the person to know what is the income of that person what will be the income loss in case of loss of life etc"" Kinger said.

Procuring data from a single source will not only bring efficiency but will also help reduce the cost for the customers he said. It can become a multi-step process in a few clicks.

""So how to simplify that journey will be a really big thing. From a customer proposition instead of having the hassle of tracing the documents to give to an insurance company (or any other service provider)...I think it will be a very big thing"" Kinger said.

On affordability of services he said when cost decreases some degree of it is passed on to customers as well.

""More than cost I see it as a whole journey of buying (a financial service)"" he said.

An Account Aggregator (AA) will be regulated by the RBI through an NBFC-AA licence. It will allow individuals access and share their information securely and digitally from one financial institution they have an account with to any other regulated entity in the AA network.

The data can be shared only after the consent of the individual.

The AA system aims to bring a revolutionary change in the investment and credit sector as customers will have greater access and control over their financial records.

For years mutual fund investors have lived under the impression that liquid funds are their only saviour when it comes to planning and investing for short-term financial goals. Investors have been programmed to think that equity and short-term goals are a lethal combination. This is akin to the blinkers tied to horses to ensure that they can look only in one direction and not sideways. But it's time that we put an end to this fallacy for there is a type of mutual fund apart from liquid funds which may be ideal for your short-term financial goals - the Arbitrage Funds.

Now you must be wondering 'what are arbitrage funds?

Honestly the name sounds like a fancy French dessert! Well if you too are confused about what are arbitrage funds or how arbitrage funds work then fortunately you are not alone. A majority of retail investors have been deterred from investing in arbitrage funds because their modus operandi is quite confusing. But this needn't be the case here onwards.

In this article we are diving deep into the complex world of Arbitrage Funds to discover the five best Arbitrage Funds in 2021 suitable for your short-term financial goals.



5 Best Arbitrage Funds in 2021 for your Short-Term Financial Goals

Data as of 21st September 2021

(Source: ACE MF PersonalFN Research)

We will be studying each of these best Arbitrage Funds in 2021 in detail later in the article. But before that it is important for you to fully understand the meaning of Arbitrage Funds and how they work.



What are Arbitrage Funds? - Definition of Arbitrage Funds

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) defines arbitrage funds as ""a mutual fund scheme following arbitrage strategy and investing minimum 65% of its total assets in equity and equity-related instruments.""

So basically Arbitrage Funds invest a minimum of 65% of the corpus in equity and the balance of 35% in debt and cash instruments. This is why 'technically' Arbitrage Funds are a type of hybrid fund but owing to dominant equity allocation from a taxation angle Arbitrage Funds are classified as equity-oriented. The objective of the Arbitrage Fund is not necessary to use the balance 35% in debt and cash to hedge the portfolio because the equity portion is already hedged. The objective behind 35% debt and cash investments is to handle redemption pressure from investors.

Note two important points from the above definition of Arbitrage Funds:

Arbitrage Funds must follow an arbitrage strategy. Arbitrage Funds are equity-oriented mutual funds in the strictest sense as they invest a minimum of 65% of their total assets in equity i.e. stocks.

To understand what are Arbitrage Funds you first need to understand the arbitrage strategy. Wikipedia defines arbitrage as the simultaneous buying and selling of securities currencies or commodities in different markets or in derivatives format to take advantage of differing prices of the same asset.



How Does an Arbitrage Fund Work?

Arbitrage Funds aims to exploit the price differential in two different segments (spot and futures or cash and derivatives) of the equity market. They buy stocks in the spot market and sell in the future market simultaneously thereby making gains with the price differential (called the spread).

The differential usually is in sync with the prevailing interest rates in the economy; but depending on the market volatility it could sometimes be higher as well. That being said these are short-term opportunities that spring up due to a lack of information to a set of market participants in one of the markets.

Since the transactions are in either direction the positions are completely hedged. And the remaining 35% of the total asset is deployed in debt and money market instruments.

Let us understand Arbitrage Funds and how Arbitrage Funds work with the example below -

The share price of ITC Ltd. on the National Stock Exchange is Rs 232.95 as on 20th September 2021. Mr. Ram buys 3200 shares from NSE.

Simultaneously he will sell one lot (1 lot of ITC is 3200 shares) in the futures market. Let's say he sells one futures lot at Rs 243.90.

Now Mr Ram is aware that the share price of ITC in the spot will converge with the futures price on expiry. By buying in spot and selling in futures Mr Ram has managed to create risk-free return of Rs 35040 (243.90-232.95 * 3200). This is known as the arbitrage strategy.

Recall the definition of arbitrage funds -

Simultaneously buying and selling In different markets (spot and futures)

Of the same asset (1 lot of ITC Ltd.)

To take advantage of the price difference also known as the spread (Rs 243.90 in futures vs Rs 232.95 in the spot market)

Now you might have noticed that we have underlined the term risk-free return in the above example. This is done purposely to stress the fact that there is minimal to no risk because the positions are hedged --meaning in the case of Arbitrage Funds the underlying securities are squared-off in the futures market. So the fund manager does not have to worry about adverse price movements since he has hedged his cash position with a futures contract.



Where do Arbitrage Funds Invest?

Arbitrage Funds can invest across three asset classes -

In the equity portion the fund manager of an Arbitrage Fund has the freedom to choose which stocks to invest in depending on the arbitrage opportunity available. While for the debt portion the top-quality Arbitrage Funds invest mainly in AAA-rated debt papers like sovereign bonds state government bonds certificates of deposits commercial papers etc. and the cash component is mainly parked in Treasury bills (across maturities) margin money and repo instruments.



Advantages of Arbitrage Funds - Why Should You Invest in Arbitrage Funds?

Opportunity to Participate in Arbitrage Strategy: While lucrative arbitrage opportunities are scarce and time-sensitive as the price in the spot and futures market would eventually converge. So the fund managers are on a constant vigil to forage for arbitrage opportunities in the market. Retail investors do not have the time or resources to probe for such arbitrage opportunities and hence Arbitrage Funds are a worthy choice for them as the fund manager and his team of experienced professionals identify and capitalise on lucrative arbitrage opportunities. Significant Position with Limited Capital: In futures trading you only have to pay margin amount to participate in a trade. In the above example the total value of the transaction is Rs 7.8 Lakhs (Rs 243.90 * 3200). But Ram only has to pay an initial margin amount of let's assume 15% of the contract value which comes to Rs 1.17 lakhs. With limited capital Ram has managed to generate 29.93% returns. Now Ram could have made much higher profits if only he had access to more capital. The fund manager of an Arbitrage Fund has ample capital (pooled from lakhs of investors) to undertake big positions in the futures market and earn substantial profits which may not be possible to do for an individual investor. Higher Returns: Arbitrage Funds have managed to generate superior returns than Overnight Funds which are considered to be the safest amongst the sub-categories of debt mutual funds in India. They have also managed to perform in line with liquid funds as reflected in the graph below. Data as of 21st September 2021

(The graph above is for illustration purposes only) [Read More: Liquid Funds v/s Overnight Funds: Where to Park Your Short-Term Money?] Taxation Benefit: As mentioned earlier from a taxation angle Arbitrage Funds are classified as equity-oriented mutual funds. And this is probably the biggest advantage of the Arbitrage Funds and the primary reason why many investors who are looking to invest for the short-term are drawn to Arbitrage Funds. When you invest in liquid funds you pay a short-term capital gains tax on redemption within a period of three years. But like equity mutual funds the holding period considered for taxation in the case of Arbitrage Funds is only 12 months. So to qualify for long term capital gains you need not stay invested in the fund for 36 months. You can simply redeem from Arbitrage Funds after 12 months and you will end up saving as much as 5%-15% in taxes.



​How are Arbitrage Funds Taxed? - Arbitrage Fund Taxation

Since Arbitrage Funds maintain a 65% equity allocation to follow equity taxation the long-term holding period for Arbitrage Funds is typically 12 months.

If you redeem your Arbitrage Fund units before 12 months you are liable to pay a Short-Term Capital Gains tax (STCG) @ flat 15%.

If you redeem from Arbitrage Funds after 12 months but your capital gains are less than Rs 1 lakh in a financial year then your Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) are exempt from tax.

If you redeem from Arbitrage Funds after 12 months and your Long Term Capital Gains are more than Rs 1 Lakh in a financial year then you are liable to pay LTCG tax @10% for the gains over Rs 1 Lakh.

Dividends earned from Arbitrage Funds are added to the investor's overall income and taxed as per his/her income tax slabs.

If the dividend income from Arbitrage Funds exceed Rs 5000 in a financial year then a Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) @ 10% is deducted by the fund house before distributing the dividend.

Wickr—now an AWS company—helps organizations protect their collaboration with a secure and compliant solution. Wickr delivers advanced security features not available with traditional communications services.

Built with a security-first mindset communication mechanisms such as one-to-one and group messaging audio and video calling screen sharing and file sharing are protected with 256-bit end-to-end encryption. Within global federation organizations can also collaborate with external stakeholders with the same level of privacy and security they enjoy internally. Customers can choose from three different services to find the right solution for their needs: Wickr Pro Wickr Enterprise and Wickr RAM.

All user data is encrypted on the sender’s device and only the intended recipient can access it reducing the risk of person-in-the-middle (PITM) attacks. No one—including Wickr or AWS—has the keys to decrypt conversations or documents giving users full control over their data.

To allow organizations to remain compliant with industry regulations including General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) HIPAA and PCI Wickr gives IT administrators greater control over their collaboration environment. Information that must be maintained for HIPAA FINRA FOIA FRA e-discovery and auditing purposes can be selectively logged to a secure customer-defined data store as required. Users maintain full administrative control over all data including controlling permissions setting expiration timers and defining security groups. Wickr is able to integrate with additional services such as Active Directory SSO via OIDC MDM and more.

Public sector customers from around the world rely on Wickr every day to communicate and collaborate effectively and securely.

Customers find flexibility and security in Wickr

The United States Air Force (USAF) works with sensitive military communications every day that require complete security from both foreign and domestic cyber threats. Wickr is accredited by the US Department of Defense (DoD) as the only US-based collaboration service with full functionality to meet all security criteria assessed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and is an Air Force Cloud One and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) cloud-certified fully managed service provider. “Government cloud-secured Wickr applications enable secure mobile collaboration down at the tactical edge and higher to enable mission success. This fills major mobility collaboration gaps and there is no other DoD approved system at scale” said Todd Wieser chief technology officer at the AFSOC.

Beyond the DoD law enforcement also relies on Wickr to command control and coordinate mission operations. Lieutenant Jon Bowers has been a law enforcement officer for 30 years 26 of which have been with the Fort Wayne Police Department (FWPD) in Indiana. In this role Bowers has overseen the planning and execution of hundreds of operations—from small-unit controlled drug buy to multi-agency roundup service of dozens of arrests and search warrants. “The first rule of planning and execution: Without communications you have nothing. And if your communications plan is broken it is one of the first things to fix” said Lieutenant J. Bowers. Wickr has become essential to FWPD in its day-to-day operations. With Wickr FWPD can now coordinate real-time situational awareness and target acquisition between the field and the operations center all while relaying information quickly to responding teams. For example group calling in presentation mode allows FWPD to live screen share of annotated overhead maps or live drone video to mission room personnel supporting real-time secure collaboration and communication.

The native security and real-time collaboration were also critical factors determining the choice of Wickr by the nonprofit Freedom Shield Foundation (FSF). The FSF works with an operational partner to help rescue thousands of women and children from human trafficking. The nonprofit also provides advanced trauma care to the rescued survivors. This work requires secure timely collaboration around the world—especially in places where communications are heavily surveilled by local governments and terrorist organizations. With Wickr FSF has successfully collaborated in real time to coordinate missions track assets and ultimately deliver on their mission to rescue women and children from human trafficking. As one member of the FSF team said “Wickr has kept us safe. There is a lot of risk out there but this is one thing we don’t have to worry about.”

Trusted by millions worldwide

Organizations in the US and abroad rely on Wickr to deliver on their missions. Wickr is compliant with GDPR regulations which allows customers across the EU to communicate securely across operations. For example the Cybercrime Division of the Bundeskriminalamt (German Federal Criminal Police Office) turned to Wickr to keep its operations running during the COVID-19 pandemic. With Wickr the Cybercrime Division increased and maintained its collaboration effectively to 80-85% versus the rest of the agency’s rate of 20%. When the COVID-19 pandemic began the German Federal Criminal Police Office needed a way to maintain its work even while remote. The Cybercrime Division decided to automate tasks with a Wickr IO integration gateway to build a series of “WickrBots” to perform critical operations and workflows. These “WickrBots” help the Cybercrime Division track current working status and work progress as agents developers and support personnel report status to another WickrBot which provides information on demand to other agents.

Millions of customers and users worldwide rely on Wickr to improve workflows collaborate securely and communicate without compromise. Visit wickr.com to learn more.

Not long after selling software company Endeca to Oracle in 2011 for over $1 billion Steve Papa called Bessemer Venture Partners with a hot tip. He said three of his best engineers were working on something new that Bessemer which had previously backed Endeca would be crazy not to fund. Kent Bennett who'd been a junior associate on the Endeca deal fielded the call. He told Papa there was some empty space at the firm's office in Boston that his people could use. But Bennett knew he couldn't get his firm one of the biggest and most successful in the venture industry to write a check to three engineers with an unspecified project. ""I said 'Well just send them over here and they can hang out here until they figure it out'"" Bennett told CNBC recalling his conversation with Papa. The three guys and some office space eventually became Toast a provider of software and hardware to restaurants that held its New York Stock Exchange debut on Wednesday closing the day with a market cap of over $31 billion. (It's since slipped to $28 billion.) The three co-founders — Steve Fredette Aman Narang and Jonathan Grimm — are billionaires and remain top executives at the company. Fredette Narang and Grimm now have about 2200 co-workers. They call them Toasters.

Bessemer eventually ended up investing in Toast in 2015 and Bennett joined the board. But even though it's one of the largest holders with over a 12% stake the returns would've been much larger had Bessemer jumped in earlier. Bennett told one of his partners he'd made a ""massive mistake"" by passing. It wasn't just Bessemer. Venture capitalists wanted nothing to do with the restaurant industry where margins are low and budgets notoriously tight. So in early 2013 Papa filled the initial void by investing $500000 of his own money into his buddies' start-up. ""I said 'guys it's not my space but you helped me be successful and I owe it to you'"" Papa who was on the Toast board until recently said in an interview after the IPO. ""I was going to help them no matter what. In this case it meant capital to get them going. Did we understand the shape of it at that time? No."" Papa's investment today can be measured in billions. As of Friday's close his 12% stake in Toast is worth $3.1 billion amassed from the initial investment and follow-on funding. He controls slightly less than Bessemer which owns $3.3 billion in Toast shares after investing just over $100 million between 2015 and early 2020.

No 'West Coast offense'

Start-up origin stories are part of the fabric of the tech industry. Apple and Google famously started in Silicon Valley garages Facebook was built by a boy-wonder Harvard dropout and PayPal came together through an awkward collaboration between Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and included an exhaustive list of engineers who would go on to build other billion-dollar companies. Increasingly Silicon Valley stories have become more formulaic thanks to programs such as Y Combinator which has turned into a Unicorn factory over the past decade. The start-up incubator has helped spawn Dropbox  Airbnb  Stripe DoorDash  Coinbase and Instacart and serves as a direct path to meetings with the top venture capitalist firms. Toast was born on the other side of the country and a world away. The founders lived in the Boston area and had no plans to leave. Boston had been a venture hub in an earlier era but the momentum had shifted to Silicon Valley where all the big exits were taking place. Bessemer has offices in both locations. Papa said one Bay Area VC indicated interest in the pitch for Toast but said he didn't want to get on a plane. Fredette Toast's president said the company's East Coast roots ultimately became an advantage because it could be ""a little unconstrained by the traditional wisdom of grow grow grow."" ""We used to talk about West Coast offense which was hype over substance"" Fredette said in an interview from the NYSE on Wednesday. ""East Coast would be substance first and not enough hype."" The founders sprinkled in a healthy dose of naivete. Fredette said they were so inexperienced with fundraising and business in general that he and Narang the chief operating officer would often debate each other during investor meetings. The original idea for Toast came from all the hours Fredette Narang and Grimm spent hanging out in Boston bars cafes and restaurants trying to figure out what to build. After experiencing a particularly long wait time for the check one day they thought they'd found a problem that could be fixed by paying the check from their smartphone — if only the technology existed. They developed an app and launched it in 2012 with Firebrand Saints a bar they frequented in Cambridge. The app gave customers a way to start a tab at the restaurant and link a credit card. ""We used to go there a lot after work to get a burger and a beer"" Fredette said. As they slowly expanded in the region they signed up Dwelltime a cafe in Cambridge. That's where Bennett got to demo the product. The transaction went through. Still Bennett was terrified of putting money into a company that was trying to take on incumbent point-of-sale (POS) vendors like Micros which Oracle bought in 2014 for $5.3 billion and NCR . ""To me it sounded like a suicide mission"" said Bennett recalling that he told the founders it would take them five years to build something viable. ""These legacy systems were old and painful but they were 50000 features into a really complex roadmap."" Meanwhile Papa would soon start flying around the country trying to help land new business deals and recruit talent. One place he wasn't going: The Bay Area. ""We intentionally chose not to put reps in Silicon Valley"" Papa said. As long as potential competitors didn't see the product in action they could continue ""arrogantly dismissing it"" he said. Instead Papa was traveling to places like Grand Rapids Michigan home to a 124-year old company called Gordon Food Service. Gordon distributed food to restaurants across the country and became a critical distribution partner for Toast. ""We focused on the middle of the country which was mostly overlooked"" Papa said. Toast quickly evolved from a relatively simple mobile app at Firebrand Saints and a few other spots to a more complete back-end restaurant system that used Android tablets as terminals. At the time iPads were the far superior product and were being used by buzzy start-ups like Revel Systems. Toast opted for Google's open source Android technology which allowed the company to design its own hardware and customize software rather than being restricted to Apple's closed system.

Toast's point-of-sale system. Toast

By late 2015 Toast was up to 170 employees had millions of dollars in revenue and was used in thousands of restaurants including Costa Vida a Mexican-themed chain with 75 locations and Beach Hut Deli which had 40 locations on the West Coast. Chris Comparato another Endeca alum had just joined as CEO. That's when Bessemer finally took the plunge leading a $30 million round along with Google's venture arm at a valuation of about $100 million. Bennett said the big move that changed his thinking was Toast's push into payments. As a full POS vendor that was getting a cut of every transaction on the system Toast at last had a volume business with a consistent and profitable revenue stream. They used margin from payment processing to support software development Bennett said and the business model clearly worked. In a memo to the firm in December 2015 Bennett wrote that ""we've stood by anxiously as the team hit obvious product-market fit but punted on raising more equity."" To get onto the cap table Bennett was having monthly dinners with the founders trying to convince them to take Bessemer's money. He also recalled telling Felda Hardymon his mentor at the firm ""I think this will be the biggest business Boston has ever seen.'"" Papa was making similar pronouncements as he tried luring investors. In a June 2015 presentation he wrote in one slide that Toast had ""the potential to be the next Uber or Airbnb valued in the many billions"" and that it had ""potential to build $10b+ exit."" ""In fairness to VCs a lot of people put stuff like that on slides"" Papa said. ""We have survivorship bias.""

Bessemer was very bullish but it never predicted Toast would be worth this much. In Bennett's memo he laid out potential outcomes and how much the firm would receive in each case. The off-the-charts ""just goes nuts"" scenario would produce an $8.3 billion company and a $700 million return for Bessemer.

'Oh my god we're going to lose it'

Toast's growth trajectory over the next four-plus years was so dramatic that in February 2020 the company raised $400 million at a $5 billion valuation. Annual revenue had swelled to $665 million mostly from payment transaction fees. Toast was helped by a 10-year bull market in the tech industry featuring astronomical valuations for companies across the board. A month after that mega-financing round it almost all came crashing down. The Covid-19 pandemic immediately exposed Toast's glaring risk: Reliance on a single industry. As infections spread rapidly restaurants across the country saw revenue plunge 80% in March squashing Toast's business. Cash quickly dwindled and Toast was force to slash about 50% of its workforce in April eliminating roughly 1300 jobs. ""With limited visibility into how quickly the industry may recover and facing slower than anticipated growth we now find ourselves in the unenviable position of reducing our headcount"" Comparato wrote in a blog post announcing the job cuts. At the board level panic set in. ""Immediately we said we're burning a ton of capital and are going to go out of business if we don't do something now"" Bennett said. ""I remember everyday going by thinking 'oh my god we're going to lose it.'"" Even more shocking was the speed of the rebound. Restaurants reopened their doors to takeout and outdoor dining and brought in a bunch of new technology to enable contactless ordering and mobile payments. Toast's POS system had expanded to include inventory management payroll and multi-location menu controls which were all useful in simplifying a manager's job. But what restaurants really needed was a takeout app that synced with their existing system and a way for diners and wait staff to limit contact. So they turned to Toast for newer products like curbside notifications for takeout flat-fee deliveries and mobile software that enabled ordering and payments from their devices. By the third quarter revenue was increasing again from the prior year. And for all of 2020 sales jumped more than 20% to $823.1 million. Headcount is back near pre-Covid levels. Bennett said that during the pandemic Toast became a consumer brand. He knows because his friends started telling him about their experience at restaurants using mobile payments with the Toast logo.

Toast mobile payments Toast

""I probably got three-dozen texts this year from friends who were like 'this is the piece of bread from your t-shirts'"" Bennett said. It's the exact idea that inspired the founders eight years earlier long before the technology existed to make it work. Narang said on Wednesday that ""we were just too early"" and the company has come ""full circle."" Even Bennett has been surprised by how many restaurants now use it. After a recent meal at Pammy's in Cambridge Bennett was waiting a while for the check to arrive. After eventually paying by card he noticed the QR code on the receipt. Had he scanned it the Toast payment option would have popped up on his phone. ""It would've gotten me out of there a lot sooner"" he said. Papa is also hearing from friends including those who could never have imagined that the restaurant-tech start-up he seeded almost a decade ago would be worth close to $30 billion. ""I remember you telling me exactly how this would all play out over lunch one day in Kendall Square"" a friend emailed him on Thursday. ""But I don't remember you mentioning the part about the pandemic. Anyways quite the success story.""

The SPAC deal would give Polestar a valuation of $20 billion.

The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday citing people familiar with the deal that the SPAC agreement was imminent. TechCrunch has updated the article to reflect information in the official announcement. Once the merger closes the combined company will be held by a new public company named Polestar Automotive Holding UK Limited. The company is expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “PSNY.”

Polestar falls under Volvo Car Group’s electric performance brand but both Polestar and Volvo are owned by Chinese car maker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.

With this announcement Polestar joins a hoard of other EV and EV-related companies to go SPAC over the last two years including Arrival Nikola EVgo Proterra Lucid Motors Bird and many more.

Polestar aims to create a life cycle assessment framework for the electric car manufacturing industry one in which the entire manufacturing sales and end-of-life process is so transparent and traceable that the company can create carbon-neutral vehicles. The automaker announced its plans in June to manufacture its first SUV the Polestar 3 in the United States production of which is expected to begin globally in 2022. High quality parts and a manufacturing facility in the States are not cheap endeavors. If the reports are true going public might be a way for Polestar to get the funds needed to achieve its goals.

The deal would also help the automaker get to market in the U.S. faster so Polestar could compete with Tesla. The automaker has positioned its Polestar 2 a sedan as a better car than the Tesla but it’ll need the capital in order to make it the same sort of household name in the EV industry and one that’s trustworthy. Last year Polestar had to recall all of its global vehicles over faulty components.

The SPAC company Gores Guggenheim raised $800 million in a March IPO and Bloomberg reported it was in talks with Polestar in July.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcGVuaW5zdWxhcWF0YXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjUvMDkvMjAyMS9RYXRhci1yYW5rcy1oaWdoLWdsb2JhbGx5LWluLWRpZ2l0YWwtdHJhbnNmb3JtYXRpb24tb2YtZ292dC1zZXJ2aWNlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qatar ranks high globally in digital transformation of govt services,"The Peninsula

Doha: Qatar has come in Group A of two indices namely Public Service Delivery Index (PSDI) and GovTech Enablers Index (GTEI) according to the World Bank report titled ‘GovTech Maturity Index: The State of Public Sector Digital Transformation’.

It has also ranked in Group B in terms of ‘high significant focus on GovTech’ with respect to two indices namely Core Government Systems Index (CGSI) and Citizen Engagement Index (CEI) as outlined in the same report issued by the World Bank.

The report comprises a comprehensive overview of the development achieved in economies of 198 world countries with respect to their digital service delivery and they are classified into four categories based on GovTech maturity.

The report provides a global glimpse on GovTech in addition to different examples of practices and guidelines to use technology in the public sector services. It is also based on 48 key indicators and divided into four indices which are Core Government Systems Index (CGSI): It measures the government approach towards digital transformation by checking e-services enterprise architecture information and financial management systems.

Public Service Delivery Index (PSDI): It unveils file transfer and tax return submission services e-payment means among others. Citizen Engagement Index (CEI): It measures citizen participation and the presence of means to find out about their opinions in addition to easing their use of government portals.

GovTech Enablers Index (GEI): It is measured through unveiling the institutions and laws of a government as well as its digital skills and launch of innovative programs to promote government technologies.

The World Bank evaluates the performance of countries worldwide in terms of digital transformation and GovTech maturity based on four groups (A B C and D). Whereas Group A represents the countries with an extremely high significant level in GovTech maturity and adoption of public sector digital transformation Group B represents the countries that have achieved a high level in GovTech maturity and adoption of public sector digital transformation.

Among the key impacts in the GovTech Maturity Index is the wide spread of COVID-19; the matter which resulted in the isolation of so many people in their homes and affected the regular work practices of governments all around the world.

COMBAT sport has grown a bad reputation over the years as people feel it encourages violence especially in children.

Mixed Martial Arts which employs a brutal blend of boxing wrestling judo and karate rugby and boxing are perennially among the most popular sport whose status is a frightening indication of the flowering of violence in sports booming to unknown levels.

Although the flooding of violent games has no clear benefit of social benefit Vusumuzi Ncube founding president of Panthers Taekwondo Club believes it’s a misconception that these sports are “violent” and that has affected the growth of sport in the country.

He said most people misinterpret taekwondo as a violent or aggressive practice yet it has rules that instil discipline if observed correctly.

Taekwondo he said enhances social skills and teamwork and also addresses the increasing scourge of bullying and other aggressive behaviours by improving students’ abilities to resolve conflicts in a peaceful manner.

“Taekwondo is a sport that is not yet popular but has been there for a while. If you mention taekwondo to anyone they think of violent fighting which is wrong” said Ncube.

“What we actually teach is confidence fitness and general well-being. Some even join taekwondo for weight loss while for others it’s just fun.”

Ncube feels taekwondo does not get much attention from authorities hindering the growth of the sport.

“In terms of growth I feel we are not getting the support that other sport codes like football get. It is almost like we do not exist. Our wish is for the Government to give us more attention and invest more in combat like sports. When we organise tournaments it’s not easy to get sponsorship because most companies think they’ll be supporting violence and it’s a misconception that should be clarified” said Ncube.

“We are saying taekwondo teaches us discipline; it’s teaches life skills. For example if a child starts doing taekwondo at the age of four he/she will grow up with high self-esteem and discipline. They will know if their uniform is dirty and when it’s time for training. My Grade 4 child can take class because he knows warm-up training and warm down.”

He says the sport has also not been spared by the devastating effects of the covid-19 pandemic.

“After the lockdown a lot of people have not returned to the sport. Panthers Academy was running taekwondo in 16 schools around Bulawayo but those numbers have dropped significantly. We hope to retain those and more numbers but it will not be easy. We are already planning to go on a drive that will see us going to the suburbs where a lot of talent remains untapped” said Ncube.

He thanked the SRC for helping with the process of registering his academy.

It was not easy when he started but the Ministry of Youth Sport Arts and Recreation invited him to events and workshops enabling him to reach out to the wider community.-@innocentskizoe",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vcG93ZXJsaW5lLm5ldC5pbi8yMDIxLzA5LzI1L2ludGVydmlldy13aXRoLWRlZXBhay1hbWl0YWJoLTMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Interview with Deepak Amitabh: “We are the first port of call for power trading solutions” - Power Line Magazine,"PTC India Limited incorporated in 1999 has played a pivotal role in developing the Indian electricity market for over two decades. The company has grown from strength to strength with traded electricity volumes witnessing a growth rate of 13 per cent in the past few years and cross-border power trade accelerating with growing regional cooperation in South Asia. Given the optimistic outlook for the power market in the country the company is now planning to launch a new-age energy exchange in the next few months. In an interview with Power Line Deepak Amitabh Chairman and Managing Director PTC India Limited spoke about the sector’s progress challenges and outlook as well as the company’s future plans…

What in your view have been the most noteworthy achievements in the power sector over the past 25 years?

The journey of transformation started in 1998 with the enactment of the Electricity Regulatory Commission (ERC) Act 1998 which was followed up by the Electricity Act 2003; the National Electricity Policy 2005; the Tariff Policy 2006; and the Power Market Regulations 2010 among others.

In my view the most noteworthy achievements would be the enactment of the ERC Act 1998 and the Electricity Act 2003. While the former endeavoured to provide a level playing field for all participants the latter paved the way for corporatisation of the power business by unbundling transmission generation and distribution. Its impact was further enhanced by the delicensing of generation facilities. The twin objectives of availability and affordability were addressed to a large extent by these fundamental and structural changes. The Power Market Regulation 2010 brought the design of very short-term markets into focus.

How has the power market in India evolved over the years? Do you think that the draft National Electricity Policy (NEP) 2021 can help address the challenges faced by the power trading segment?

The draft NEP endeavours to develop the Indian power markets to fully benefit the consumer in an environment of adequate reserves affordable and available power competition and choice. The light-handed regulations are consistent with a competitive market focus integrated planning and a framework for faster implementation. The decision-making framework has been further strengthened with economic social and technological dimensions. All of the above collectively endeavour to bring in efficiency and transparency in the sector.

The basic building block of any market-based initiative (including trading) is effici­ency and transparency of/in the system which the NEP is attempting to implement.

“The power trading market is at the cusp of the next level of growth primarily driven by market-oriented policy initiatives including a willingness to reform distribution.”

What is your outlook for the power trading market volumes prices etc. in the medium to long term? What more is needed to deepen the power trading market?

The power trading market is at an inflection point primarily driven by the market-oriented policy initiatives of the Government of India including a focus on reforming the distribution sector. Trading involves optimisation of an existing resource base thereby deferring investment in additional ca­pa­city. It also promotes investment by offering a service to access demand in the unserved power markets.

In the medium and long term we see a firm demand due to the natural growth in urban population more latent dema­nd converting to express demand and shifting of the mobility business to electricity. Supply is likely to be a little constrained as new (thermal and hydro) capacities are still at the planning stage and renewable capacities have their own limitations in terms of supplies intermittent timing and quantum. The price matrix is a functional derivative of demand-supply parameters with seasonal variations and emergent events.

Distribution sector reforms provide a big opportunity for trading services in the sector as they enable consumers to reap the benefits of a comprehensive de­sign of the market. Reforms such as multiple service providers in the electricity supply business and lowering of open ac­cess capacity from 1 MW to 500 kW will improve competition and bring in af­fordability and reliability.

“The draft NEP endeavours to develop power markets that would fully benefit the consumer through competition and choice. The light-handed regulations are consistent with a competitive market focus and integrated planning.”

What is your outlook for cross-border power trading going forward?

Cross-border power trading is governed by the cross-border energy trade Gui­de­lines issued by the Central Electri­city Re­gulatory Commission. Inter­connec­t­ed neighbouring countries are expected to be beneficiaries of these power trading solutions through India. At present the entire surplus power from hydroelectric projects in Bhutan is being supplied to India through PTC. In addition Nepal is also being supplied power through radial lines connecting it to the state of Bihar – the 400 kV Muzaffar­pur-Dhalkebar line and the 133 kV Ta­nak­pur line. Further around 1000 MW of power is being supplied to Bang­ladesh through the Ber­hampore–Bheramara high voltage direct current line.

Regional energy cooperation is high on the agenda of the respective governments of these countries and with new generation capacity being developed in Nepal trading relations are bound to be strengthened further.

By and large supplies from sustainable sources will be key for long-term electricity trading relations with neighbouring countries.

What have been PTC’s biggest achievements in the past few years?

In the past few years we have been able to grow our volumes consistently at 13 per cent per annum. Last year we ac­hie­ved the highest ever traded volume of 80 BUs. We have become the first port of call for electricity trading services in India. Moreover in the past few years we have acted as a catalyst in bringing in stranded thermal capacity with bankable po­w­er purchase agreements which has help­ed in making 1900 MW of stranded ca­pa­­city operational for three years and 2500 MW of similar capacity is under processing. These events validate the role of a trader in correcting market distortion and improving efficiencies.

“Our value-added services technologycentric solutions and endeavour to shift from business-to-business to business- to-consumer in rolling out solutions will be the key focus areas in the coming years.”

What will be PTC’s focus areas in the coming years? What are some of the growth avenues that the company is looking at?

PTC is evolving along with sectoral needs demand and situations. Our value-added services technology-centric solutions and endeavour to shift from business-to-business to business-to-consumer in ro­ll­ing out solutions will be the key focus areas in the coming years.

PTC recognises the shift to technology as the mode of conducting business. Ac­cordingly it is investing heavily in technology development and testing service roll-out. In the same vein PTC along with the Bombay Stock Exchange and ICICI Bank is in the process of launching a new-age energy exchange which is expected to become operational by the end of this financial year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc2FtYmFkZW5nbGlzaC5jb20vZXhwbGFpbmVkLXdoeS1hbmQtaG93LWFyZS1jeWNsb25lcy1uYW1lZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Explained: Why and How are Cyclones named,"Bhubaneswar: The practice of naming storms (tropical cyclones) began years ago in order to help in quick identification of storms in warning messages because names are presumed to be far easier to remember than the numbers and technical terms. Many agree that appending names to storms makes it easier for the media to report on tropical cyclones heightens interest in warnings and increases community preparedness.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO)/ ESCAP Panel on Tropical Cyclones at its twenty-seventh session held in 2000 in Muscat Sultanate of Oman agreed in principle to assign names to the tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. After long deliberations among the member countries the naming of the tropical cyclones over north Indian Ocean commenced from September 2004. Accordingly a list of names was prepared.

Preparation of new list in 2019

During the 45th PTC Session held at Muscat in September 2018 it was proposed to prepare the new list of names of tropical cyclones considering the fact that the existing list has only 6 unused names out of a total 64 names. The last list was prepared based on the proposed names from 8 countries. In view of the addition of 5 new countries as members of PTC during 2016-18 it was required to prepare the new list including names of all the 13 countries namely Bangladesh India Iran Maldives Myanmar Oman Pakistan Qatar Saudi Arabia Sri Lanka Thailand United Arab Emirates and Yemen.

All the member countries provided a list of 13 names each for tropical cyclones over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.

Criteria for implementation of the list of names

* Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) New Delhi will be responsible to name tropical cyclones that have formed over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea when they have been analysed with maximum wind speeds of 34 knots or more.

* The name of a tropical cyclone from south China Sea which crosses Thailand and emerge into the Bay of Bengal as a Tropical cyclone will not be changed.

* The names of tropical cyclones will not be repeated.

* Panel Members names will be listed alphabetically country wise.

* The names will be used sequentially column-wise.

* The first name will start from the first row of column one and will continue sequentially to the last row in the column thirteen.",,,

Oregon joins 11 other states in requiring gun owners to store their firearms in a gun room or safe or use a trigger lock when it is not being carried or under their control.

Here's what to know about the new law:

A firearm is not considered secured if a key or combination to the trigger cable lock or the container is readily available to a person the owner or possessor has not authorized to carry or control the firearm or a handgun is left unattended in a vehicle and is within view of people outside the vehicle.

The safe storage requirement doesn’t apply if a gun owner is either alone in their home or with other people allowed to use the gun.

Violations of the law are civil infractions but the penalties increase if a minor gets access to an unsecured firearm as a result of the violation.

If an owner violates the safe storage law and as a result the firearm is used to injure a person or property within two years of the violation the injured party may bring a civil lawsuit against the owner and the court must find that the owner or possessor was negligent.

If a person transfers a firearm and a criminal background check is required prior to the transfer the person is also required to transfer the firearm with a trigger lock or in a locked container.

A gun dealer must post in a prominent location a notice in block letters not less than one inch in height that states “The purchaser of a firearm has an obligation to store firearms in a safe manner and to prevent unsupervised access to a firearm by a minor. If a minor or unauthorized person obtains access to a firearm and the owner failed to store the firearm in a safe manner the owner may be in violation of the law.”

Failing to secure a firearm would result in a maximum fine of $500.

That fine increases to $2000 if a minor accesses an unsecured firearm.

Another portion of the bill imposes a new gun ban at the state Capitol and allows public school districts community colleges and universities to set their own gun ban policies.

The bill received pushback from Republicans and spurred a failed referendum petition.

Sen. Ginny Burdick D-Portland one of the chief sponsors of the bill told Oregon Public Broadcasting the public supported the push to increase gun safety and control. She pointed to the public opinion being influenced in part by armed groups at the state Capitol.

""The people who are opposing this bill are actually the best poster child for the bill” she told OPB.

The Qualcomm Snapdragon 888+ (Plus) 5G Mobile Platform is a high-end SoC for smartphones that was introduced in mid 2021 and manufactured in 5 nm at Samsung.

Integrates one “Prime Core” based on a ARM Cortex-X1 architecture clocked at up to 3 GHz. Three more performance cores are based on the A78 but clock up to 2.42 GHz. Furthermore four energy saving cores are integrated that are based on the ARM Cortex-A55 architecture and clock at up to 1.8 GHz. In addition to the processor cores the SoC integrates a WiFi 6e modem a Hexagon 780 DSP (up to 26 TOPS of AI performance) and a Spectra 580 ISP. The integrated memory controller now supports faster LPDDR5 memory with up to 3200 MHz. 5G is now included in the chip with the Snapdragon X60 modem.

Compared to the older Snapdragon 888 the 888+ offers a slightly higher clocked prime core (+160 MHz) and a 23% faster Hexagon 790 DSP. Therefore it is now the fastest Android SoC (at the time of announcement) but still slightly slower (CPU and GPU) than the Apple A14 and A15 Bionic SoCs.

This is sizeably larger than the 2815mAh capacity found on its predecessor the iPhone 12 Pro.

Apple had promised that the new model should last up to 1.5 hours longer on a single charger so it figures. The battery is L-shaped this time and is manufactured by the China-based Sunwoda Electronic Co.

The teardown video by blogger WekiHome (via: GSMArena) further reveals that the iPhone 13 Pro is utilizing the Qualcomm X60 as its 5G modem. Additionally it comes with a Samsung-supplied 120Hz screen and a slightly smaller Taptic Engine compared to last year. The device’s RAM is also supplied by Samsung while Japan’s Kioxia is responsible for the flash memory.

All in all the innards of the iPhone 13 Pro are not too different when compared to the 12 Pro although there have been plenty of adjustments.

That said those that are looking to purchase the latest and greatest iPhones from Apple will be disappointed to know that the Cupertino-based company has delayed their delivery time to October. Preorders are still being taken though.

Apple’s iPhone 13 series handsets include storage options of 128GB 256GB and 512GB with the Pro versions getting a 1TB storage variant for the first time. The entry-level model costs $699 while the top-tier model costs $1599. Sierra Blue Silver Gold and Graphite are the four color options available for the Pro versions.

There was Jason Sudeikis Halsey Mike Tyson Kate Hudson Rob Lowe and the Kardashians among the sellout crowd packed into SoFi Stadium in Inglewood Calif.

But the biggest celebrity in Hollywood is Matthew Stafford following the Rams’ 34-24 win over the Bucs.

In the NFL there’s no business like throw business and Stafford stole the show from headliner Tom Brady by passing for 343 yards and four touchdowns in the biggest football game in L.A. in two decades.

“I guess they can push it down the field so easily” coach Bruce Arians said of Stafford. “You’re right up in his face one time and he finds the guy wide open down the field and gets it to him. Other guys they see him but they can’t get it to him. He gets it to them. So yeah he’s a special player.”

The Rams simply played the role as the best team in the NFC Sunday. They beat the Bucs by a field goal in Raymond James Stadium a year ago with Jared Goff under center but traded their first-round quarterback to Detroit with two first-round picks and a third-rounder for Stafford.

One play to start the second half exposed the Bucs’ injury-riddled secondary and served as an ominous reminder of why it will be so hard for them to repeat as Super Bowl champions.

With the Rams leading 14-7 and facing third and 10 at their own 25-yard line to start the third quarter Stafford found receiver DeSean Jackson streaking free down the right sideline and hit him with a perfect pass that resulted in a 75-yard touchdown.

Jackson ran into a tunnel in the corner of the end zone and was chased into it by Rams coach Sean McVay.

Two things happened on that play that could doom the Bucs this season. Stafford had all day to wind up in the pocket. There was a miscommunication between cornerback Carlton Davis and safety Mike Edwards who turned Jackson loose.

“Busted coverage. Just totally bust the coverage” coach Bruce Arians said. “Lack of communication. They didn’t get the call to each other. That’s what young guys do.”

When reminded the Bucs have only one sack in each of their first three games Arians said “That’s the pass rush. You can’t sit back there and hold the ball. We’ve got to get home.”

As for the Bucs’ secondary it’s becoming wafer-thin. Already playing without starter Sean Murphy-Bunting who could miss a month after dislocating his elbow the Bucs lost cornerback Jamel Dean at the end of the first quarter during the Rams’ first scoring drive.

The Bucs finished the game with backups Ross Cockrell and Dee Delaney on the field. Earlier this week they freed some $4 million of salary-cap space by restructuring the contract of guard Ali Marpet.

The only question following Sunday’s game was whether the Bucs have enough to coax five-time Pro Bowl cornerback Richard Sherman to fly back from California with them.

Brady did about all he could passing for 432 yards and a touchdown while rushing for another score. But by the third play of the second half the Bucs had to abandon their running game. In fact Brady led Tampa Bay with 14 yards rushing on three scrambles. He was sacked three times and hit on five other occasions.

“Those guys up front are trying to create space and our backs are trying to run hard” Brady said. “Again when you’re losing all day you’re going to get into more throwing than we probably want.”

The Bucs defense allowed Stafford to convert 10 of 15 third-down situations. The Rams actually missed on their first two third downs before converting eight straight. Stafford was 7-of-7 for 180 yards and two TDs during that stretch.

“Very disappointing” Bucs linebacker Lavonte David said. “We’ve got to be better and be able to put together a full four quarters. “There were times where we could’ve gotten the ball on defense.”

All week long McVay made no secret of the Rams’ desire to get the football to Jackson who spent two mostly unproductive seasons in Tampa Bay. Stafford was brought to the Rams to win big games like this. “No doubt Tampa is a really good football team” he said. “You know they’re Super Bowl champs. Tom Brady the defense all of it. It was a big challenge for us.”

Of course even before they boarded a Delta charter at LAX Sunday the spotlight only got brighter for Brady and the Bucs.

Brady next Sunday returns to Gillette Stadium and New England where he spent 20 seasons. Get ready for a week of stories about the prodigal son returning home. “I want to win every time I take the field” he said.

Dave Hanna in the upstairs of the Central Fire Station last week. Each had fading photos microfiche scans and newspaper clippings of their loved one in their hands as they sat down to share stories.

Their loved ones died decades apart and neither family knew each other but they were brought together by Hanna’s research of five fallen firefighters he is working to memorialize on a wall in Dover. The coronavirus pandemic delayed plans in the near-term for a Dover memorial but both families will be honored in Concord on Saturday as their loved one’s name is added to the state's fallen firefighter memorial wall.

“We have a lot of rich history here but in the past the fire department hasn’t been very good at recording it” Hanna said as he thumbed through a black binder full of news articles and notes that detail the lives of two fallen firefighters.

That research led him to Raymond Turgeon who was researching his grandfather’s life in the fire service and how to get his name on the firefighter memorial in Concord. With the help of Hanna Fire Chief Paul Haas and the New Hampshire Firemen's Association Raymond Turgeon’s grandfather Earnest LeBlanc was approved to be added to the memorial wall. Hanna didn’t want to stop there.

He got in touch with Investigative Services in Dover to help track down the family of another fallen firefighter former Chief James Smith. With the help of a private investigator Hanna had contact information for Smith’s great-grandchildren within a day.

Both Earnest LeBlanc and James Smith were added to the Concord fallen firefighter memorial and a ceremony will be held for the families Saturday to honor the two men who died in the line of duty. Newington Fire Chief Darin Sabine who passed away last year from cancer will also be added to the wall.

Meet two of Dover’s fallen firefighters

According to the information that Hanna gathered fallen firefighter Earnest LeBlanc died on Saturday Feb. 14 1959 at the age of 45. He was a Lieutenant of Ladder Co. 1 and started at the department in 1944. On the day he died he was fighting a fire that occurred in the attic at 29 Second St. He was providing roof ventilation with his brother Lucien also a Dover firefighter when he became overcome with smoke and collapsed. After being rushed to Wentworth Hospital attempts to save his life failed and he died from asphyxiation by smoke inhalation.

Fallen firefighter James Smith died on Sunday Feb. 8 1925 at the age of 54. He was the Chief and started at the department in 1898. He was Assistant Chief that was put in charge of handling the “Great Mill Fire” in 1907. On the day he died he was searching for a gas leak in the basement of the Strafford Bank building at 83 Washington St. which is where Thirsty Moose is today. There are mixed accounts in newspapers of how the explosion happened but he died from blunt force injuries from a gas explosion.

Tracking the Smith lineage

Tracking down Smith’s family proved to be challenging at first. Frank Santin from Investigative Services said that he and his partner Sue Smith were up for the challenge and volunteered their time to help find the missing links.

The length of time that has gone by since Smith’s death and the common surname made finding Smith’s family difficult. Santin said that much of the time is spent eliminating false leads and isolating the correct leads.

“People have nicknames especially in the scheme of things women's names change with marriage and other circumstances so you have to spend some time kind of connecting the dots to isolate that you're chasing the right person” Santin said. “When you're talking about a 100-year-plus difference that's where the connecting of the dots really comes into play.”

When Hanna had the list of Smith's great-grandchildren he admitted looking at the phone numbers and thinking to himself ""What do you say how do you start that conversation and introduction?"" The family recalls being completely surprised but were eager to jump in on the effort.

What this means to the families

Smith’s great-grand-daughter Pam Phair brought a framed photo of Smith in uniform. Even though she never met him she’s always kept the photo on her mantle and held onto stories passed onto her by her mother.

“That's one of the reasons why we're so surprised for him to be remembered because so many years have gone by now” Phair said. “I remember when my mother used to take us to the cemetery to put flowers on his grave. Oh she would have been so so thrilled about this. She always honored him in her own way but she never got to know him.”

Smith’s great-grandson Stan Walker served as Stratham’s fire chief for 16 years. He recalled chasing fire trucks when they were little and hearing about Smith’s life.

“We never really thought about adding his name to a memorial but this is great” Walker said.

Earnest LeBlanc’s great-grandson Dennis Turgeon still lives in Dover. He recalls always looking for his grandfather’s photo in the fire station. The photo still hangs there today.

“As children we would come to the station as Cub Scouts or as grade schoolers and we were always told ‘Make sure you check for your grandfather's picture on the wall.’ And then when our kids grew up and we always said ‘Make sure you check your great-grandfather's picture on the wall.’”

Raymond Turgeon said that he had spent a considerable amount of time researching his grandfather and microfiche scans of newspaper articles painted a pretty clear picture of what happened and “how tragic it was.” He said that when he saw Hanna’s research aligned with his they were able to connect some dots.

“We didn't have any loose ends because we didn't really know our grandfather so it wasn't a sense of closure but it did bring things full circle. It feels like the right thing to do to finally pay tribute to his years of service” Raymond Turgeon said.

After sharing different recorded accounts of the lives of both Smith and LeBlanc Hanna looked at the families and said he hoped it brought them closer to their ancestors despite having never met them.

“Their names will be forever memorialized on the wall in Concord” Hanna said. “It’s just been incredibly rewarding from my perspective to find both families and help fill in the gaps of our department's history.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdHVybnRvMTAuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZnJpZW5kcy1vZi1tYW4tZmF0YWxseS1zdHJ1Y2std2l0aC1hbHVtaW51bS1iYXQtaW4td2FycmVuLXBsZWFkLWZvci1qdXN0aWNl0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly90dXJudG8xMC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZnJpZW5kcy1vZi1tYW4tZmF0YWxseS1zdHJ1Y2std2l0aC1hbHVtaW51bS1iYXQtaW4td2FycmVuLXBsZWFkLWZvci1qdXN0aWNl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Friends hold vigil for man fatally struck with aluminum bat in Warren,"One month after a man suffered a fatal blow to the head by an aluminum bat in Warren friends of the victim are calling for an arrest.

This weekend friends of Richard Raymond gathered at the scene on Market Street where it happened to hold a vigil.

""He loved to ride his bike go to the beach just paint. Happy all the time"" said Justin Silvia a friend of Raymond.

""He would just give"" said John Moitoza another friend of Raymond. ""If he saw you hurting he would give.""



But it's Raymond who was hurt on Aug. 26 when Warren Police said the 54-year-old was involved in a fight with another man.

Raymond's friends said the dispute was over money.

RELATED:

Moitoza who said he witnessed the altercation told NBC 10 News it was escalated by the other man's dog and 16-year-old son who intervened with an aluminum bat.



""From what I saw the dog started getting a little aggressive. So automatically Rich took out his knife and put it to his side and said 'What's going on?'"" Moitoza recalled.

According to Moitoza Raymond -- who regularly carried a knife -- took out the weapon in fear that the other man's dog may viciously attack him.

Reached by NBC 10 Monday the other man involved in the incident James Nicholson said Raymond was the aggressor and defended his son's actions that night.

""Richard Raymond came at me with a knife and I was in fear for my life. Every second I stood there in fear for my life"" Nicholson said. Nicholson refuted that his dog an American Bulldog was aggressive or vicious toward anyone. ""There was no attack"" he said.

Moitoza said Nicholson's teenaged son charged at Raymond with a bat.



""From what I saw the kid just came out of the house with the bat and just cracked him right in the back of the head"" said Moitoza. ""I don't know -- I'm not going to get that 'tink' sound out of my head for a long time. It was horrible.""

Authorities said the injured Raymond was taken to the hospital but died more than two weeks later.

Now friends want the teen to face charges.



""The kid had no right to do what he did"" said Moitoza.

The teen's mother told NBC 10 that Raymond's death has been a tragedy on both sides.

""I don't know what happened -- I wasn't here. All I know is that my son is 16 years old and for the rest of his life he has to pay -- just like everybody else has to pay"" said Stacy Bruno. ""He did not do any of this on purpose. We are not malicious people. None of this should have happened.""



Raymond's friends however want the teen to be held accountable.

""It doesn't matter how old he was"" said Moitoza. ""He killed that man.""

Warren police said they turned their investigation of the incident over to the Rhode Island Attorney General's Office for review.

Make no mistake Intel is supremely interested in competing at the high end of the gaming graphics card market and being a viable contender not just an also-ran. Intel also plans to target the mid-range and entry-level segments as well the latter of which has been overlooked (so far) by AMD and NVIDIA with their latest generation lineups. So what is actually in store from Intel? The latest chatter suggests it has three Alchemist cards on tap.





The information comes from leaker Moore's Law Is Dead and several of what he deems to be some of his ""best sources."" And they all seem to agree that the top model will feature 512 execution units (EUs) . That is a specification we have seen in previous leaks and it appears to be unchanged as Intel gets closer to finalizing its designs.





To that end Intel had recently confirmed that its first desktop graphics card for gamers  Alchemist will not come out this year as previously anticipated but sometime in 2022. So there is still time for things to change though at this point it's probably more about refinements than sweeping design alternations. But only Intel knows for sure obviously.







Source: Moore's Law Is Dead







Looking at the above slide a very rough estimate of performance would have Intel's flagship Alchemist SKU coming in ahead of the GeForce RTX 3060 and 3060 Ti and settling in around the level of a GeForce RTX 3070. That's just looking at the raw specifications—Alchemist in 512 EU form would come in a little lower in TFLOPs while offering superior memory bandwidth.





As we know TFLOPs is nowhere near the end-all-be-all particularly when comparing two completely separate architectures. But until Alchemist launches leaked data of this sort is the best we have to go. In terms of what supposed insiders are expecting those aforementioned sources pretty much say the same thing—better than GeForce RTX 3060 and 3060 Ti performance but they're not sure how far above the 512 EU model will land.





Which brings us to the next slide...

Intel Arc Alchemist To Be Split Into Three Tiers Initially





From the information he has received to date the expectation is that a 512 EU version of Alchemist might even reach performance levels of a GeForce RTX 3070 Ti  saying Intel has even gotten close to GeForce RTX 3080 performance levels on some ""golden samples"" here and there.





MLID's information is fairly consistent with past leaks that suggested (before the Ti variant came out) that Alchemist would land somewhere between a GeForce RTX 3070 and GeForce RTX 3080. How it actually works out will depend on both the hardware and what Intel can do on the software side in terms of driver optimizations.





There will also be two other main SKUs according to the leaked information. At the mid-range level it's said there will be a version with 384 EUs. As currently planned this is essentially a cut-down version of the top die. Incidentally there has also been some chatter of the mid-range part having 448 EUs but there is not a high level of confidence in that spec (for the final design).





The mid-range offering is said to offer performance levels in the range of a GeForce RTX 3060 and GeForce RTX 3060 Ti.









Finally the low-end die is said to feature 128 EUs and wield 4GB or 8GB of memory tied to a 64-bit bus. This card will come in at under 75 watts. And physically they are said to look like the early DG1 cards that manifested but without the ridges. As to performance think GeForce GTX 1650 and 1650 Super levels but with dedicated hardware to handle real-time ray tracing. That's actually not a bad place to be at the lower end of the spectrum.





There are obviously a lot of variables at play. Is the leaked info accurate? Will the designs and performance goals change between now and when Intel's Arc cards arrive? How will drivers affect things? And what impact might custom-cooled and factory-overclocked cards from add-in board partners have on all this?





Those are not questions we can reliably answer just yet. However we should finally find out within the next six months as it is said these cards will launch in the first quarter of 2022. Here's hoping that timeline sticks and that Intel is able to put some competitive pressure on AMD and NVIDIA. Which by the way both will be launching new cards of their own next year (RDNA 3 and Ada Lovelace) so buckle up and enjoy the ride.

In comparison to direct real estate investment here one can start investment with low amount and can buy or sell any time as liquidity is quite high in comparison to direct real estate investment. In REITs an investor has an opportunity to invest in direct equity or in non-equity REITs. However if we go by the income tax norms an investor investing in REITs keeping long-term time horizon he or she would be able to get indexation benefit which is not available in direct real estate investment.

Speaking on how long-term investment in REITs help an investor earn more; Pankaj Mathpal Founder & CEO at Optima Money Managers said ""REIT investment is comparatively better than direct real estate investment as it gives more liquidity to an investor. Apart from this if invested in REIT shares then there is indexation benefit to the investor on long-term investments which is not available in direct real estate investment. In long-term REIT investment appreciation of cost is applied on one's income and hence the net income tax outgo becomes lesser while in real estate one's income is just the difference between one's properties buy or sell price.""

Highlighting the income tax benefit on long-term REIT investment; Vishal Wagh Research Head at Bonanza Portfolio said ""The interest and dividends received by the REIT from the SPVs are exempt from tax. The REIT is also exempt from tax on its rental income which it may have earned if it owned property directly. Rental income of the REIT is exempt in its hands but taxable in the hands of the investors. With appreciated stock you can sell your shares over a number of years to spread out the capital gains. Unfortunately investment in real estate is not granted the same luxury; the entire gain amount must be claimed on your taxes in the year the property is sold.""

Asked about income tax benefit on dividends and interest earned; Amit Gupta MD at SAG Infotech said ""It is to be noted that the tax applicability to the REIT investor is only concerned with the cash flow part which is also the income from interest of the REIT by the SPVs (SPVs exempted from that too) and the income from rent of REIT (exempted for the REIT). If anyway the SPVs opts for discounted rate on income tax the tax applicable on the cash flow dividends and rest all the cash flow received is entitled to be tax exempted. This is a significant advantage of a REIT as compared to a normal company structure where the company pays tax on its profits and the shareholders are subjected to tax on the dividends irrespective of the rate of tax paid by the company. A REIT can therefore effectively give investors a higher post-tax return as compared to a normal company structure.""

Speaking on how income tax rule is applied on REIT investment; Vishal Wagh of Bonanza Portfolio said ""As REITs are listed in case an investor sells it before 3 years the gains will be considered as short-term and will be taxed at 15 per cent while long-term gains (after 3 years) above ₹1 lakh will be taxed at the rate of 10 per cent (without indexation).""

However Pankaj Mathpal of Optima Money Managers said that in long term REIT investment an investor has an option to choose indexation benefit paying 20 per cent on the net income after deducting appreciation in cost over the period of time. Mathpal also said that REITs are bound to pay 90 per cent their rental income as dividend to the REIT investors.

The bank reportedly plans to shift its Asian investment banking division into its global advisory business a move that would signal the end of the regional strategy pioneered by former CEO Tidjane Thiam.

In 2015 Thiam carved out Asia-Pacific as a dedicated business division with its own investment banking and advisory arm. The intention was to supercharge growth by offering more trading and capital markets products to its Asian billionaire client base.

There are a number of reasons why Credit Suisse is now looking to put its global investment banking business back together. Firstly it’s the next logical next step after CEO Thomas Gottstein created a global investment bank in July 2020 bringing together the former Investment Banking and Capital Markets (IBCM) and Global Markets (GM) divisions as well as Asia Pacific (APAC) markets. The markets division was the investment banking powerhouse in Asia so bringing IBCM into the fold completes this process.

The move will centralize and simplify the bank’s operations. Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio is currently undertaking root-and-branch review of the group’s operations following the losses associated with the collapse of Greensill and Archegos Capital. Horta-Osorio has already revamped and strengthened the risk management function and has hired executives including David Wildermuth from Goldman Sachs Group in July to become chief risk officer.

Change in Asia is long overdue. Thiam’s convoluted structure was both unique among big western banks and difficult to understand. Putting the investment banking and advisory operation back on a global footing will make it easier to manage and also should boost collaboration between regions.

The Asian power-base at Credit Suisse

Dismantling Thiam's structure may not be popular with everyone at Credit Suisse however. The man with the most to lose would seem to be Helman Sitohang the Indonesian group CEO for Asia Pacific who has a big power base and considerable clout.

Sitohang was promoted to run Credit Suisse's Asian business in 2015. He has been a strong advocate of Credit Suisse’s ‘One bank’ strategy using his links with the region’s billionaires to scoop lucrative underwriting and advisory mandates. Sitohang’s rainmaking credentials are widely acknowledged – he is credited with is credited with more than $200 billion in deals and capital-raising in 22 years at the Swiss bank according to Swiss website finews.

But he’s also been close to recent controversial clients of the bank and was one of Lex Greensill’s biggest advocates seeing him as an ideal client – an entrepreneur with touchpoints throughout the bank.

In 2020 the bank generated revenues of Sfr3.1bn in APAC a 4% increase on 2019 but some way short of its best ever performance of Sfr3.8bn which was delivered in 2015 the inaugural year of the new structure. Headcount has risen to 6890 from 6590 over the same period according to the bank’s annual report.

Credit Suisse doesn't provide a break-down of revenues in APAC purely derived from IBCM but has a reporting line called ‘transaction-based revenues’ which covers trading underwriting and M&A advisory. That generated Sfr1.6bn of revenues last year just over half of the total revenues generated in the region.

The bank was ranked fourth by M&A revenues in APAC in the first half of the year compared with first a year ago. In investment banking it was ranked eighth by fees from underwriting and advisory for international business in China down from second a year ago according to data from Dealogic

It's conceivable that very little will change under the new structure. Credit Suisse operates the same matrix structure in Asia Pac as it does other regions with dedicated industry and country heads overseen by regional management –Zeth Hung and Ed Low are co-heads of IBCM for the Asia Pacific region and are expected to continue in their roles. Credit Suisse has also just conducted a revamp of its investment banking line-up in the region making a raft of promotions in a move seen as the bank promoting its next generation of bankers. It is also committed to a big expansion in mainland China where it became a majority shareholder in its joint venture in June 2020 and appointed Janice Hu as CEO in July 2021.

However there will no doubt be savings to be made from stripping out operational management roles. And depending on whether the plan is approved and what is looks like CS’s investment bankers in APAC could have less latitude when it comes to backing clients if the depend on the balance sheet of the investment bank rather than that available in the region.

It remains to be seen what this will mean for pay. As part of a standalone Asia Pacific group IBCM’s bonus pool is dependent on the performance of the regional entity and will have performance criteria linked to the region. Shifting it into the global investment bank could mean bonuses could be measured by different criteria.

Overall the biggest winner from the proposed strategic revamp will be Christian Meissner the CEO of the Investment bank. With Asia added Meissner will have a bigger and more clearly-defined empire. As for Sitohang who along with Gottstein is the only surviving member of the executive board appointed by Thiam at the time of the 2015 restructuring it remains to be seen whether his role will shrink along with his responsibilities.

The finance minister directed lenders to get their act together and open either a full-fledged brick-and-mortar branch or an outpost rendering banking services.

For over a decade policymakers have been focusing on financial inclusion and also had set a target of ensuring banking presence in every village with a population of over 2000 people.

Sitharaman who was speaking at the 74th annual general meeting (AGM) of the industry lobby group Indian Banks' Association (IBA) said ""Even today there are very many districts in which even big panchayats don't have a physical bank...there are very many districts in which not even one banking institution is physically present.""

She directed IBA members to digitally map all the districts to find out which areas have low coverage and accordingly make provisions for either a physical branch or an outpost.

She questioned ""You should be able to see the centres of economic activity. Be it a completely rural pocket but if the economic activity is strong there wouldn't you think there should be some kind of presence?""

Applauding the work done by the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana in which millions of new accounts were opened she pointed out her wish for higher quantum of loans to be given in eastern India and added that lenders have to move beyond looking at such regions as a source of low-cost deposits.

In a statement released after the finance minister's speech largest private sector lender HDFC Bank said it will be doubling rural reach to 2 lakh villages in the next two years and hire 2500 people in the next six months.

Meanwhile Sitharaman asked all to desist calling the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARCL) as a 'bad bank' as similar institutions are called in other countries like the US.

She also said that the banks' books are much cleaner now and this will help the government as the recapitalisation requirements go down.

Reminding the ambitious target of USD 2 trillion in exports by 2030 and USD 400 billion for the ongoing FY22 she said meeting this aim is possible only if banks are nimble and understand the needs of every business.

The unveiled stained glass windows commemorate the history of Polish children who at the invitation of the Prime Minister of the South African Union (now South Africa) Field Marshal Jan Smuts found help and a safe haven in Oudtshoorn during World War II. One of the Oudtshoorn’s children Felix Vaskys was among the gathered guests.

The whole world witnessed the tragedy of the events of World War II and the tragic history of about 1.7 million Poles deported from their family homes to Eastern Siberia. A large proportion of these people were orphaned children who were forced to look for a new home. In April 1943 after a difficult and long sea voyage a group of 500 of them reached the shores of the South African Union where they were warmly welcomed by the local population. A camp was established in Oudtshoorn in which 500 children and about 60 caregivers created their ""little Poland"". Polish children who arrived at the camp and decided to stay in the Union of South Africa after its closure in 1947 actively contributed to the building of this country had an impact on social life and its development in every aspect. They are the foundations of the Polish community in South Africa which we estimate today at 10000-15000 citizens. The Oudtshoorn’s children have left behind a legacy the commemoration of which is our common good and duty.

In the cathedral in Oudtshoorn one can see the icon of the Black Madonna (a copy of the painting ""Black Madonna"") painted in 1993 by one of the Oudtshoorn’s children the late Stefan Adamski. On the other hand in the local museum ""CP Nel Museum"" the time of the camp is commemorated by the Polish section with photos and documents from that period.

The Embassy of the Republic of Poland in Pretoria and the Polish Association of Siberian Deportees in Africa are planning to fund a monument commemorating the history of a group of 500 Polish Oudtshoorn’s orphans who survived the deportation to Siberia and then went a long way in searching for a new safe home.

The unveiling ceremony was recorded and the video is available on the following site: https://youtu.be/S-sIx7K1qgg; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-sIx7K1qgg

Now he and his family told the Daily Press they want changes at SoFi Stadium the newest venue for National Football League games after they say negligent management enabled serious injuries to him and “traumatized” his 5-year-old grandson.

Robert Read has become a prominent local figure in the decades since he completed a three-year stint with the Army’s 101st Airborne Division in 1965.

Read led the founding of the Spring Valley Lake Veterans Club won a county Teacher of the Year award in 2001 and received “Veteran of the Year” in 2018 from the leaders of California’s 33rd Assembly District.

Read’s son Chad served in the Air Force on tours in Afghanistan and Iraq during the early stages of the wars that followed the U.S.’ invasions of both countries.

Robert Read said that he is “50% DAV” which stands for Disabled American Veterans. Chad Read’s son Michael “is a football nut already at 5 years old.”

To give his son and young grandson something they could mutually cherish in their adult lives Robert Read said he spent $4000 to secure a 49-year lease on four seats in SoFi Stadium. The seats are in a handicap section where accommodations such as extra space are provided for fans with disabilities.

Buying the lease means that for decades to come season tickets for Chargers games in those seats will be reserved for Robert Chad and Michael Read to buy or sell as they choose instead of becoming open to anyone on the competitive buyers’ market before each new season.

Robert Read did not hesitate to shell out the cash for the seats this season.

“We got the DAV handicap seats on section 331 there” he said. “Beautiful section. Great view.”

'Shaking like a leaf'

The Sept. 19 Chargers’ game against the Dallas Cowboys marked the first time the three-generation trio would get to watch a regular-season game from within the dazzling new stadium.

SoFi Stadium’s first year hosting NFL games came during the 2020-21 season but fans were barred due to the coronavirus pandemic. The experience started strong as a stroll through the stadium’s interior revealed what the Reads say is a marvelous facility.

Despite SoFi serving as the home stadium to both the Chargers and Los Angeles Rams Robert Read said opposing fans made up roughly two-thirds of the crowd an estimate that sports media outlets also covered.

As a result he said things turned unwelcoming quickly for him Chad and Michael all of whom donned Chargers gear.

“We got to our seats which had already been taken by a bunch of dopes and we had to have security remove ’em” Robert Read said. “Then all through the first half there was just mobs. I mean out-and-out mobs. Roaming the stadium opening beer cans and shaking ’em up foul language.”

A portion of those “mobs” eventually moved into the open standing area of their disabled seating section he said even though “they’re not supposed to be there.”

“One of the guys got a really foul-mouth(ed) and my son asked him ‘Hey you know go ahead and cheer but watch the language I got my son here’” Robert Read said.

Shortly before the end of the game’s first half Robert Read said he asked a nearby security guard to remove the rowdy group.

“They keep bumping our chairs and stuff like that and we’re disabled you know we can’t take this crap” he recalled saying to the guard.

The guard he continued responded only that “We don’t know what we can do” even after Robert Read asked if security could make the “mob” show their tickets and move back to their assigned seats.

With that approach having failed they left to get food at halftime. When they returned the rowdiness worsened to levels that Robert Read said he has never seen at a sports venue.

Early in the third quarter “there must have been 50 60 people behind us and the other people in that section” he said. Chad proposed at this point that the trio “not make a scene” and just try to focus on the game.

Then around the start of the fourth quarter “all I remember is — bam — flying out of my chair” Robert Read said.

“I hit the Plexiglass that was in front of us. If it hadn’t been there I would’ve gone over the edge” he continued which would have sent him falling around six to seven feet onto the concrete ground.

The 81-year-old said he does not have any guess as to who hit him or why. He said he went “lights out” before having any chance to glimpse a face from behind.

Robert and Chad Read have a protocol for dealing with emergency situations when they are with 5-year-old Michael. Chad later informed his father that he too was shoved from behind by the “mob” right after Robert Read went down.

But the shove did not have the same effect.

“He’s a big dude — six-two 207 pounds” Robert Read said of his son “and I’m just a shrimp.”

Chad Read said that following their protocol he immediately grabbed Michael pulled him to the corner of their section and stood in front of him to shield him from the mayhem.

He “pushed a couple guys back” and when someone else in the section came over to help he noticed his father was gone. Chad Read said he then grabbed Michael and escaped to go searching.

Following his face-first plunge into the Plexiglass Robert Read said the next thing he remembers is laying against a wall in a corridor of the stadium as some people asked if he was OK while others walked past him. He estimates that the corridor he regained consciousness in is 40 to 50 feet away from his seat.

“I’ve been trying to really think and strain what’s left in my head” he said. “For all I know I may have taken off after somebody while I was out cold. I don’t know how I got there OK. Somebody could have picked me up and thrown me there for all I know.”

He added that he does not have any bruises “except the bruise in the back of my head where I was hit.”

When he regained consciousness in the corridor Robert Read said he “was going in and out” and his vision was blurry. “Next thing I know” Chad and Michael had found him he said.

Then Robert Read said he remembers “the stadium paramedics” finding him in the corridor kneeling to check his blood pressure and pulse and telling him that Los Angeles medics were on their way. He said he knows at least 20 minutes passed before those city paramedics arrived.

“So I had been laying there that whole time” he said. “You’re saying you have to wait for the L.A. medics to show up to take someone down to your first-aid station?”

Robert Read said he was then placed on a gurney and wheeled to a first-aid room. It was in the basement level of the stadium though he said he did not realize that at the time.

“They’re just completely disorganized” he continued. “It’s not really the employees’ fault. I mean they’re just doing what they’re told. But when you’re shaking like a leaf and your heart’s going bananas and your head’s pounding I mean you take a little different viewpoint.”

Chad Read said the stadium denied him and Michael entry to the basement alongside his father. Instead the son and grandson were made to wait outside the stadium.

Josh Rupprecht vice president of public relations for the Chargers and R. Otto Maly the registered officer of StadCo LA Manager LLC an entity created to own and operate SoFi Stadium did not return requests for comment for this article.

'You can just leave'

In the basement first-aid room Robert Read said a paramedic told him he may be nearing a heart attack and needed medical attention at a hospital.

Robert read pushed back though arguing that he has a good heart and it was only his head that hurt. The paramedic reaffirmed that it was more serious than that according to Robert Read and told him his blood pressure was above a level of 200/100 and his pulse was above 110 beats per minute.

This he said convinced him of the need for a hospital. He asked to be taken to a nearby facility run by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

Robert Read normally visits the Jerry L. Pettis Memorial VA Medical Center which is part of the VA Loma Linda Healthcare System. It has been his facility of choice ever since the VA provided “amazing” treatment and rehab to Chad Read which was direly needed upon his son’s service in both Afghanistan and Iraq he said.

But the VA Loma Linda facility takes hours to reach from SoFi Stadium so Robert Read said he asked to be taken to nearby West Los Angeles VA Medical Center. That facility is roughly 11 miles north of SoFi Stadium according to Google Maps.

Yet Robert Read said the stadium paramedic told him they would only take him to a civilian hospital — no rides to any VA-run facilities were being offered.

“I said ‘I’m not going to another hospital. That’s where my records are’” Robert Read recalled “and they said ‘Well if you wanna go there you can just leave.’”

Robert Read said he then asked for a disability cart so he would not have to walk out. Stadium staff he said told him to wait and see if they could find one. After 15 to 20 minutes — “and like I said I’m having a really hard time staying awake” — he said he asked stadium personnel if any cart was actually coming.

“Oh we don’t have carts” they responded according to Robert Read who said he then began “staggering” into the main hallway on his own. That he said was when he learned he was in the basement of SoFi Stadium.

“So I found somebody a maintenance guy and I asked him I say ‘How do I get to Gate 8?’”

The worker’s response as Robert Read paraphrased it: “Man that’s clear on the other side of the stadium. Just follow the railing and people will tell you.”

For about 30 minutes Read staggered with blurred vision through the stadium by gripping handrails or pressing on walls and asking janitors along the way how close he was to the exit he needed.

“I mean I walked through the ESPN people and all the big buses for the football players and all that stuff. I don’t know where I’m at” he said.

Read eventually found his way to Gate 8 he said where Chad and Michael were waiting. Another 20- to 30-minute walk in the parking lot was needed from there to reach his son’s car.

During he and Michael’s wait Chad Read said he tried to file a report about the ordeal with SoFi Stadium and was told by a staff member to “just give us your name and phone number.”

According to Chad Read a woman called who said she was from Human Resources and would “clean up this mess and get back to you” but did not ask about his father’s condition and as of Thursday had not called back. Robert Read said he has not received a call from officials with the stadium or the Chargers.

The Cowboys-Chargers game ended roughly 20 minutes after 4 p.m. Robert Read said he exited the stadium around 5:30 p.m. The Reads finally made it out of the stadium parking lot around 6:15 p.m.

From there perhaps out of a mutual desire to just escape the city Chad Read drove his father to his usual hospital closer to home.

'Still traumatized'

The Loma Linda VA hospital “took me in right away” Sunday night Robert Read said.

Luckily a doctor said his scans did not reveal any internal bleeding; however he had suffered a moderate-to-severe concussion and his neck was “really screwed up” Robert Read said.

“I told the doctor I was really pissed because being bruised like this not bad but I didn’t get a chance to get a hit or two in” he said with a laugh. “These guys just took me out cold. I’m supposed to be protecting the family.”

The doctor told him that because his wife Debra is a retired cardiac care nurse Robert Read could temporarily head home with some specific instructions like remaining in bed and having his wife consistently check his blood pressure and pulse.

“Keep being that way and come Thursday or Friday. I want you back” Robert recalled the doctor telling him.

On Thursday afternoon Robert Read told the Daily Press he intended to return to the Loma Linda VA center after dinner when the same doctor would be working and the hospital would likely be less crowded.

“I’m not doing good” he said. “I’m dizzy. I can’t bend over of course and I’m dizzy when I walk. I bounce off the walls. I’m supposed to be laying in bed all the time but you lay in bed your back aches your butt hurts and everything hurts.”

He said he is drinking lots of water and following the doctor’s orders “but the dizziness keeps coming and I still get foggy at times.”

Robert and Debra Read said the experience has left an impact on their grandson too.

“He’s still traumatized” said Robert Read said who teared up when he recalled Michael handing him flowers that the boy had plucked outside the stadium while he waited with his father.

“Monday Night Football he wouldn’t even watch it” Robert Read continued. “You can’t usually get him away from the TV when a football game is on. But he wanted nothing to do with it Monday.”

SoFi Stadium only hosted its first NFL game with fans in the stands a little more than a month ago on Aug. 14.

Yet the Read family’s self-described experience is not the first to raise questions about the new stadium’s security and preparedness for rowdy and often-inebriated fans. Multiple other fights were filmed or reported to have occurred during the same Chargers-Cowboys game.

At least one brawl broke out at SoFi’s first game with fans last month despite it being only a preseason match-up. Onlookers filmed and shared the melee on social media.

“A woman who appeared to be a SoFi Stadium employee tried unsuccessfully to break up the fights but was pushed away several times” at that preseason game CBS Los Angeles reported.

Robert Read said his anger over his experience at the stadium’s first regular-season game has only intensified with what he believes has been a disrespectful silence in the days following the incident.

He emphasized that he does not blame the workers who interacted with him even if their responses to his situation were frustrating.

“No one from management even came to the incident. Nobody” he said.

Robert Read does not know if the stadium has done anything about the people who knocked him out and he worries they could cause similar problems at future games.

He said SoFi Stadium should raise its standards for disabled fans. He specifically said they need to purchase more electric carts tighten security and make every entry-gate to the stadium handicap-accessible.

He also thinks the stadium should acknowledge veterans more in both presentation and aesthetic.

“It just really upsets me that here we are we paid good money to get good seats we’re disabled veterans enjoying a game together” he said “and they allow this crap to go on and don’t care about what happened to the people that got hurt.”

The 78-year-old actor has always celebrated his Irish heritage. De Niro is actually more Irish despite his name woud suggest.

Of De Niro’s four grandparents three were of Irish ancestry.

Three of Robert De Niro's grandparents were Irish. In 1962 as a teenager he hitchhiked from Dublin to Galway and travelled by ferry to the Aran Islands. #IrishFact pic.twitter.com/8RYhy04IvS — Dublin Airport (@DublinAirport) November 26 2017

Below he recounts how he even traveled around Ireland as a teenager in the 1960s. His father Robert Sr was half-Irish his mother was Helen O’Reilly and all of her side of the family are Irish.

However until the film he’d struggled to track down any actual distant living relatives that could help him fill in the blanks when it comes to his family’s long-lost life in Ireland.

It’s a situation that has left De Niro searching for answers but so far unable to find them.

“Yeah I have Irish roots. My mother’s Dutch French and German. And my father was Irish and Italian” he told the Irish Sun.

“I hitchhiked around Ireland when I was about 18 19.

“I’ve been trying for years to find relatives there.

""For some reason it’s not easy. Italy was easier.”

De Niro lifted the lid on his search ahead of the release of The Irishman Martin Scorsese’s latest crime opus centred on the real-life exploits of mob enforcer Frank Sheeran.

Based on Charles Brandt’s book I Heard You Paint Houses.

The book is based on the death bed testimony of Sheeran himself who claims to have had a role in the death of labour union leader Jimmy Hoffa.

More significantly still Sheeran claims to have played a part in the assassination of John F. Kennedy and claims Hoffa’s threats of going to the press or police with information about JFK was what got him killed.

Speaking to the Irish Sun De Niro explained what drew him to the part.

""It was fascinating and simple” he said. “I liked the character: how he was introduced to this world and slowly saw how it worked.”

The Irishman runs for exactly 210 minutes or three-and-a-half hours and streaming on Netflix started on November 27 2019.

It is still availalbe across Netflix today .",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmaW5hbmNpYWxjYXJlZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDkvaGVsbWFuLXNpdG9oYW5nLWNyZWRpdC1zdWlzc2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What next for Helman Sitohang's Asian empire at Credit Suisse?,"Credit Suisse’s Asian business in for a shakeup and it could have significant implications for senior management and internal power structures in the region.

The bank reportedly plans to shift its Asian investment banking division into its global advisory business a move that would signal the end of the regional strategy pioneered by former CEO Tidjane Thiam.

In 2015 Thiam carved out Asia-Pacific as a dedicated business division with its own investment banking and advisory arm. The intention was to supercharge growth by offering more trading and capital markets products to its Asian billionaire client base.

There are a number of reasons why Credit Suisse is now looking to put its global investment banking business back together. Firstly it’s the next logical next step after CEO Thomas Gottstein created a global investment bank in July 2020 bringing together the former Investment Banking and Capital Markets (IBCM) and Global Markets (GM) divisions as well as Asia Pacific (APAC) markets. The markets division was the investment banking powerhouse in Asia so bringing IBCM into the fold completes this process.

The move will centralize and simplify the bank’s operations. Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio is currently undertaking root-and-branch review of the group’s operations following the losses associated with the collapse of Greensill and Archegos Capital. Horta-Osorio has already revamped and strengthened the risk management function and has hired executives including David Wildermuth from Goldman Sachs Group in July to become chief risk officer.

Change in Asia is long overdue. Thiam’s convoluted structure was both unique among big western banks and difficult to understand. Putting the investment banking and advisory operation back on a global footing will make it easier to manage and also should boost collaboration between regions.

The Asian power-base at Credit Suisse

Dismantling Thiam's structure may not be popular with everyone at Credit Suisse however. The man with the most to lose would seem to be Helman Sitohang the Indonesian group CEO for Asia Pacific who has a big power base and considerable clout.

Sitohang was promoted to run Credit Suisse's Asian business in 2015. He has been a strong advocate of Credit Suisse’s ‘One bank’ strategy using his links with the region’s billionaires to scoop lucrative underwriting and advisory mandates. Sitohang’s rainmaking credentials are widely acknowledged – he is credited with is credited with more than $200 billion in deals and capital-raising in 22 years at the Swiss bank according to Swiss website finews.

But he’s also been close to recent controversial clients of the bank and was one of Lex Greensill’s biggest advocates seeing him as an ideal client – an entrepreneur with touchpoints throughout the bank.

In 2020 the bank generated revenues of Sfr3.1bn in APAC a 4% increase on 2019 but some way short of its best ever performance of Sfr3.8bn which was delivered in 2015 the inaugural year of the new structure. Headcount has risen to 6890 from 6590 over the same period according to the bank’s annual report.

Credit Suisse doesn't provide a break-down of revenues in APAC purely derived from IBCM but has a reporting line called ‘transaction-based revenues’ which covers trading underwriting and M&A advisory. That generated Sfr1.6bn of revenues last year just over half of the total revenues generated in the region.

The bank was ranked fourth by M&A revenues in APAC in the first half of the year compared with first a year ago. In investment banking it was ranked eighth by fees from underwriting and advisory for international business in China down from second a year ago according to data from Dealogic

It's conceivable that very little will change under the new structure. Credit Suisse operates the same matrix structure in Asia Pac as it does other regions with dedicated industry and country heads overseen by regional management –Zeth Hung and Ed Low are co-heads of IBCM for the Asia Pacific region and are expected to continue in their roles. Credit Suisse has also just conducted a revamp of its investment banking line-up in the region making a raft of promotions in a move seen as the bank promoting its next generation of bankers. It is also committed to a big expansion in mainland China where it became a majority shareholder in its joint venture in June 2020 and appointed Janice Hu as CEO in July 2021.

However there will no doubt be savings to be made from stripping out operational management roles. And depending on whether the plan is approved and what is looks like CS’s investment bankers in APAC could have less latitude when it comes to backing clients if the depend on the balance sheet of the investment bank rather than that available in the region.

It remains to be seen what this will mean for pay. As part of a standalone Asia Pacific group IBCM’s bonus pool is dependent on the performance of the regional entity and will have performance criteria linked to the region. Shifting it into the global investment bank could mean bonuses could be measured by different criteria.

Overall the biggest winner from the proposed strategic revamp will be Christian Meissner the CEO of the Investment bank. With Asia added Meissner will have a bigger and more clearly-defined empire. As for Sitohang who along with Gottstein is the only surviving member of the executive board appointed by Thiam at the time of the 2015 restructuring it remains to be seen whether his role will shrink along with his responsibilities.

Quantum of the Seas Protocol Changes

With a surge in cases in Singapore the government has announced further restrictions that will be in effect from September 27 through October 24 2021. As a result Royal Caribbean has tightened its protocols to ensure it falls in line and keeps guests protected for Quantum of the Seas.

As reported by the Singapore Cruise Society a letter was sent to guests covering updates on group capacity restrictions in restaurants and the introductions of ART testing at the terminal before the cruise. The new onboard protocols are as follows:

All guests are required to remain in groups of 2 while enjoying onboard public spaces including restaurants and theatres

Families from the same household may have more than 2 guests in their stateroom but must adhere to groups of 2 while in public spaces

Dining in restaurants is only available if all guests are vaccinated

Unvaccinated children under 12 may be included in the group of 2 if from the same household

Dining in our restaurants is not available for unvaccinated guests over the age of 12 years. Room service and takeaway options will be provided

In addition to a negative PCR test for Covid-19 the cruise line has implemented ART testing at the terminal as part of the check-in process. This provides an additional layer of safety which is also deemed as PET testing (Pre-Event Testing) to enable unvaccinated guests to dine in restaurants in the first night of the cruise

Quantum of the Seas sailings are only available to residents of Singapore which has been the case ever since the cruise ships restarted operations from the country at the end of 2020. Cruises have been available for guests who are not fully vaccinated but there are different protocols on board depending on the status.

All guests must provide their vaccination status via the ‘TraceTogether’ app or provide a hard copy of their vaccination card supplied by the authorities. It is essential to know that the wristband that differentiates vaccinated and non-vaccinated guests will still be used onboard.

With the new limit of groups onboard guests do have the option to cancel their voyage and receive a future cruise credit to be used on sailings departing through December 31 2022.

The previous protocols on testing continue along with the additional ART testing. Guests must undergo a test at the Raffles City Shopping Centre in Singapore within 48 to 72 hours before departure. The cost of the test is included in the cruise fare for sailings departing on or before February 21 2022.

Quantum of the Seas is offering three- and four-night ocean getaways and was the first Royal Caribbean cruise to begin sailing in December 2020. The cruise line later extended the vessel’s season from Singapore through February 2022.

When it comes to Asia the cruise line is dealing with changes beyond just Singapore. Spectrum of the Seas was scheduled to restart from Hong Kong on October 5 but due to elevated restrictions the Quantum Ultra-class cruise ship won’t resume until October 14 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXRyYWRlLWNydWlzZS5jb20vc2hpcC1vcGVyYXRpb25zL2xhbmRyeS1rbGluZy1hbmQtaW5jaGNhcGUtc2hpcHBpbmctc2VydmljZXMtZm9ybS1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Landry & Kling and Inchcape Shipping Services form a partnership,"This expands ship charter service offerings for both companies.

We’ve got your cruise news update to make sure you haven’t missed a thing from the past week.

Lots going on this week as we’ve got updates from many of the major cruise lines and how about that epic 14-day cruise from Carnival which will to Canada and Greenland? We’ll get into all that along with Norwegian Cruise Line’s upcoming new ship more cancellations down under a delayed restart for Royal Caribbean An Alaska senator working hard to protect cruises and of course an update on the Carnival Radiance transformation.

Carnival Cruise Line Releases Greenland Voyage

Carnival Cruise Line Ambassador John Heald already teased it on Wednesday but then on Thursday the cruise line released a one-time 14-day voyage that will include calls to Canada and Greenland. Carnival Legend will be the lucky ship to be offering the epic cruise out of Baltimore Maryland. However there is just one chance to go on this cruise!

The Spirit-class vessel will depart on September 2 2023 from Baltimore on a 14-day voyage. The ship will first sail five sea days in a row before arriving at Nanortalik in Greenland on September 8. Carnival Legend will then make a call at (K)Qaqortoq also in Greenland on the following day. Both calls to the country are located on the southern coast.

The cruise ship will sail another full day at sea before arriving at St. Anthony in Newfoundland on September 11 2023. The following day there will be a call at Corner Brook also in Newfoundland. The final port of call will take place on September 13 in Sydney Nova Scotia. Following the last two sea days the Carnival Legend will arrive in Baltimore on September 16 2023.

The voyage is part of Carnival Journeys special sailings that are offered by the cruise line. Guests will be able to experience the cultural aspect of the ports the ship will visit. The cruise is even more special as Carnival’s Brand Ambassador will be onboard offering guests the chance to meet and mingle during the one-of-a-kind voyage.

Carnival Legend has not yet resumed cruise operations but is scheduled to restart on November 14 out of Baltimore. The ship will replace Carnival Pride sailings as that ship will head down to begin cruises out of Tampa Florida.

Cruise Cancellations Down Under

Princess Cruises P&O Australia and Carnival Cruise Line have announced further suspensions in Australia. The Carnival-owned cruise lines had multiple ships operating in the area and planned to resume with fully vaccinated Australian guests and crew members soon.

However uncertainty regarding protocols government guidance and public health requirements has put the cruise lines in a spot where further cancellations are the only option.

P&O Australia Cruises that have been affected include cruises scheduled to depart from December 18 2021 through to January 14 2022 for cruises sailing from Brisbane and January 18 2022 for cruises sailing out of Sydney. The cruise line has also cancelled Melbourne’s summer cruise season the latest extension making it no longer feasible to operate.

Princess Cruises has cancelled all voyages until January 27 citing the uncertainty of cruises returning to the region as the main reason. There are three Princess cruise ships impacted by this.

Voyages on board Coral Princess through January 17 have been cancelled and cruises onboard Royal Princess and Sapphire Princess through March 2022 are also cancelled.

For Carnival Cruise Line Carnival Splendor and Carnival Spirit will now remain on hold through January 16 2022. Previously the two Carnival cruise ships were suspended through December 16 2021. As the situation in the country has not moved forward to reopen the cruise line has continued to extend its suspension since first starting in March 2020.

Norwegian Prima From Galveston & Features

Big news from Norwegian Cruise Line with the announcement that Norwegian Prima will homeport in Galveston Texas in 2023 and 2024 following the ship’s inaugural season.

The company also announced a massive amount of entertainment options that will feature onboard including the first-ever three-level 1378-foot long racetrack with the Prima Speedway and its first-ever freefall drop dry slides.

The new three-level racetrack called The Prima speedway will go around and through the vessel’s funnel feature 14 turns for 15 drivers in go-karts that will reach 30mph.

The racing doesn’t stop there though; the ship will have the world’s first freefall dry slide called The Drop where users will experience a 10-story plunge reaching the highest G-forces of any cruise line and two more dry slides called The Rush where passengers can race each other down the slides.

Making its splashing first appearance on Norwegian Prima as part of the ship’s Aqua Park and Main Pool area will be the Brand’s first Tidal Wave waterslide featuring gushing surfs where guests can ride an innertube to catch the perfect wave. Guests looking to relax can do so in either one of two infinity hot tubs or under the area’s cascading water feature.

Onboard entertainment comes in the form of “Summer: The Donna Summer Musical.” brought by the production team that introduced “Jersey Boys” to Norwegian Bliss guests. The Musical will feature a score of more than 20 of Summer’s mega-hits and will last for 75 minutes.

We could keep talking for hours about the 142500 gross ton vessel Norwegian Prima that’s currently in the final stages of outfitting will debut in August 2022.

Carnival Radiance Almost Ready

We’ve been reporting on the transformation of Carnival Victory into Carnival Radiance for years already. After delays due to the suspension of operations the ship is finally in the final stages of its dry dock. The cruise line has also announced that the ship is now finally named Carnival Radiance.

The ship is currently undergoing a $200 million bow-to-stern upgrade at the shipyard in Cadiz Spain. The vessel is receiving tons of new features including all the popular FUN 2.0 enhancements already seen across the fleet. Carnival Radiance is also receiving 110 new guest suites and staterooms along with expanded retail spaces.

Another highlight will be the new Big Chicken restaurant created by Carnival’s Chief Fun Officer Shaquille O’Neal that debuted on Mardi Gras earlier this year.

One of the biggest highlights of the transformation is the new name on the hull and the shiny new red white and blue livery which has already rolled out to five cruise ships during their dry docks.

Once complete the Carnival cruise ship will depart the shipyard in Spain on October 18 and begin a seven-week journey to her new homeport in Long Beach California to join Carnival Panorama.

Carnival Radiance will begin cruises from Long Beach on December 13 2021 and will become the final ship in the fleet to resume this year.

New Cruise Bill Introduced to Congress

On September 15 2021 U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski announced a new bill to help Alaska avoid a repeat of no cruise ships being allowed to visit the state due to the Passenger Vessel Services Act. That bill which is called ‘Cruising for Alaska’s Workforce Act’ has now been introduced to congress.

The bill aims to provide cruise ships sailing to Alaska from the U.S. a permanent exemption from the PVSA which would result in the vessels not having to call in Canada before heading to visit Alaska.

The Cruising for Alaska’s Workforce Act would then come to an end once there is a U.S.-built cruise ship that can carry more than 1000 passengers. Currently the only U.S. flagged cruise ship is the Pride of America operated by Norwegian Cruise Line based in Hawaii. All other cruise ships are flagged in countries such as Panama and the Bahamas.

The new bill introduced comes after the Senator was heavily involved in getting the Alaska Tourism Restoration Act (ATRA) passed through congress and signed by President Biden on May 24 2021. That bill came to light after Canada banned cruise ships for more than a year which resulted in cruises being unable to call in Alaska due to the Passenger Vessel Services Act.

We’ll just have to wait and see how the bill is received by congress so do keep checking on the website for all the latest developments.

Royal Caribbean’s Hong Kong Restart Delayed

Royal Caribbean’s Spectrum of the Seas scheduled restart for October 5 from Hong Kong has been cancelled along with the two following sailings. It means the October 5th 8th and 10th departures will no longer occur and the first cruise is now set to begin on October 14.

The cancellations came after the Hong Kong Government elevated restrictions and increased rules for passengers from Europe North America and Asia. It results in difficulty for crew members from their home countries to travel to the vessel.

Spectrum of the Seas is only sailing short four and three-night getaway cruises to nowhere out of Hong Kong. From January 12 2022 the Quantum Ultra class cruise ship will begin offering international cruises with a call to Japan.

The cruises from Hong Kong are for residents only and guests must be fully vaccinated at least 14 days before departure. A negative test result must also be shown before being allowed on board. The protocols are in place as required by authorities in Hong Kong and the details may differ from other countries such as the U.S.

So those were just a handful of the cruise news headlines from the week we’ve got even more including Royal Caribbean updating protocols from Singapore a business update from Carnival Corporation an update from Royal Caribbean Group CEO Holland America Line forgetting to inform guests about a cruise cancellation and many more.

Kennedy Jr. said got into his head.

Sarah Sherman had the honors of dressing up as a worm and took a jab at Vanderpump Rules star Tom Sandoval who became known as “the worm with a mustache” after co-star James Kennedy yelled that out during the Season 10 reunion.

“RFK’s body was a worm’s paradise” Sherman said as the brain worm. “Not a single drop of vaccine in sight. My whole parasite posse hung out in there. Shoutout to hookworm… that fish that swims up your pee stream and my man Tom Sandoval.”

Sandoval remains in infamy after his cheating scandal exploded into the mainstream. The Bravo star had been in an almost decade-long relationship with co-star Ariana Madix and was exposed to be having an affair with another co-star Rachel Leviss in what became known as “Sandoval.”

In February SNL had already called out Sandoval on Weekend Update labeling him a “narcissist.”

Weekend Update co-host Colin Jost also cracked a joke at his own expense referring to the Staten Island ferry he and former SNL co-star Pete Davidson bought.

Jost informed viewers that this year marked the first time since 2009 that a Marvel Studios production had not kicked out the summer movie season.

“[It] better be a one time thing because a lot of people rely on Marvel movies to pay for the ferries they bought” Jost joked.

Jost is married to Scarlett Johansson who portrayed Black Widow across the MCU.

He had reached the dying embers of Paris St.-Germain’s run in the Champions League. Yet again the dream of European glory that powered the club for more than a decade had been dashed.

Suddenly here he was clean through on goal: the best player in the world the hometown icon who has come to symbolize P.S.G.’s ambition prowess excess and hubris his flashbulb moment at his fingertips. And then as Dortmund’s defiant back line trailed helplessly in his blistering wake Mbappé slipped.

No tackle no foul no intervention whatsoever. He just fell over. He would not have his goal. He would not be the hero.

India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been focusing on enhancing domestic manufacturing in the last 10 years as there was a neglect of the sector before 2014 and it created many problems for the country Jaishankar told PTI in an exclusive interview.

He also suggested that lack of focus in the past to the manufacturing sector is linked to the upward trajectory in India-China trade notwithstanding New Delhi's position that normalisation of ties with Beijing is dependent on the resolution of the eastern Ladakh border row.

""We need to be confident. I am clear that international politics international relations are competitive. I have a neighbour like China. I have to learn to compete"" he said.

""By my complaining China is not going to stop doing things. If I do not build up my strength at home our foreign policy will be as good as our domestic policy"" Jaishankar said.

""It is a function of our domestic policy that if I can actually build up my economy if I can build up my manufacturing if I can create the kind of capabilities which today I am trying to do I think you are going to find foreign policy has much more resources and much more tool in its toolkit to actually influence the world"" he added.

His response came when asked why India's bilateral trade volume with China is going up when New Delhi has been insisting that ties cannot be normal if the border situation is abnormal.

Jaishankar suggested that such a scenario has arisen as adequate attention to the manufacturing sector was not given before 2014.

The Indian and Chinese militaries have been locked in a standoff since May 2020 and a full resolution of the border row has not yet been achieved though the two sides have disengaged from a number of friction points.

""I think it is common sense that if there is no peace and tranquillity in the border how can you have a normal relationship"" Jaishankar said.

""After all if somebody is at your front door in an unfriendly manner you are not going to go out there and act as though everything is normal. That to me is a straightforward proposition"" he said.

India has been consistently maintaining that peace and tranquillity along the LAC were key for normalisation of overall ties. However trade between the two countries is steadily expanding.

Since the beginning of the last decade bilateral trade between India and China recorded significant growth.

From 2015 to 2022 India-China bilateral trade grew by 90.14 per cent an average yearly growth of 12.87 per cent. In 2022 the overall trade with China increased by 8.47 per cent year on year to reach USD 136.26 billion crossing the USD 100 billion mark for a second time in a row according to official data.

However the trade deficit came at USD 101.28 billion as India's imports from China witnessed major increase.

In the last few years the government has been making efforts to expand manufacturing in a number of critical areas as part of an aim to de-risking from China.

""When you talk about trade what has happened is in many ways the fact that we actually neglected manufacturing in this country. That in many ways we did not give the kind of support to our manufacturers especially our small and medium enterprises"" Jaishankar said.

The external affairs minister listed various initiatives rolled out by the Modi government including the 'Make in India' and 'Production Linked Incentive' (PLI) schemes to enhance domestic manufacturing ""In fact when Make in India was started you have people who even laughed at it. Even now there are people like Rahul Gandhi who believe that we are incapable of manufacturing in this country and there are some economists who also have that kind of view"" he said.

""So the fact that our manufacturing fell behind I think has created many of the problems that today we are experiencing today. You cannot get an immediate fix but what you can do which we have been trying to do is actually to boost manufacturing"" he said.

Jaishankar said the government is rapidly modernising infrastructure and making it as efficient as possible as ""without efficient infrastructure you are not going to get competitive manufacturing."" ""You know 10 years ago how the environment was used as an argument to make business very difficult in this country"" he said.

Referring to the overall development trajectory of the country Jaishankar said he was more optimistic than ever about India's future.

""I am much more optimistic for our country than I have been all my life -- part of it is because I also see the abilities and talent of younger people; what they can do the kind of achievements they made"" he said. PTI MPB ANB DV DV

At Herold Flags in Rochester customers were snapping up Minnesota flags — plural.

""In all the years I've been in business I've never even come close to selling any flag more than the U.S. flag"" owner Lee Herold said. ""Now I've been selling more state flags than U.S. flags.""

The new state flag: bold blues and sharp angles. The old state flag: long ignored long derided suddenly in demand. And the North Star flag. The one Herold co-designed decades ago when he launched his long campaign for a flag all Minnesotans could get behind.

""Frankly I was astounded that people were still coming in to get it"" he said. The flag he designed to represent Minnesota is a golden star on a field of blue for Minnesota's lakes and rivers white for our winters green for our farms and forests.

There were probably more Minnesota homes flying North Star flags than the actual flag when the search for a replacement began last year. Some Minnesotans still make room for it in their hearts and on their flagpoles.

""I had someone come in this morning and they got both. They got the new [flag] design and the North Star"" said Herold who has also had several customers double up to purchase both the old state flag and the North Star.

When Minnesota launched its search for a new flag last year Herold submitted his North Star for consideration.

It wasn't the flag the committee chose. None of the thousands of flags Minnesotans designed quite match the version that now flies above the state.

But the flag competition brought out the best and weirdest in Minnesota. There were lady slippers and laser loons. There were flags that evoked Ojibwe beadwork or heirloom quilts. There were constellations of stars in a kaleidoscope of colors.

All of them represented Minnesota to somebody. That's a pretty great thing to represent.

Minnesota made its choice. And so did Minnesotans who have flocked to online and brick-and-mortar shops to buy whichever design says ""Minnesota"" to them.

Welcome to the second life of Minnesota's second-place flags.

A month before Statehood Day a new flag rose over the crowd at a Minnesota United game. A bright white flag with the image of a bag and the legend printed in letters big enough for the players to read and share the thrill of Minnesota pride: BAYG.

Bayg flag — beloved crowd-pleasing longshot in the state flag redesign contest — lives.

The State Emblems Redesign Commission for reasons that surpass all understanding declined to choose even one of the flag designs that feature loons shooting lasers out of their eyes. Yet laser loon lives — on flags on totes on stickers on any surface that could be improved by the addition of a laser loon.

Including your library card if you're lucky enough to live in St. Paul.

""One of the joys of my job is asking 'what if?'"" said Claire Huber marketing and communications specialist for the St. Paul Public Library. After watching social media collectively melt down with glee over the funniest state flag designs she wondered: ""What if we made a laser loon library card? Wouldn't it be funny if we did?""

After watching several ""how to draw a loon"" tutorials online Huber designed her own laser loon with the legend: ""READ.""

Suddenly a library card was the hottest ticket in town. The library gave away all 500 new cards — and 500 laser loon stickers for existing cardholders — in a matter of days and quickly printed a thousand more.

""One of the best things about this project has been to bring delight to people"" she said. ""To see something so silly but so community-driven. Everyone has an opinion about the flag … I think it taps into the innate pride of the North.""

Minnesota hasn't quite realized Herold's dream of one flag we can all rally behind.

""Reminder"" Gov. Tim Walz posted on social media on Friday. ""Minnesota's new official state flag will be raised for the first time tomorrow.""

Below the post was the image of a flag waving proudly as light broke through dark storm clouds. /On that flag were two words: Naz Reid.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vcGFja2Vyc3dpcmUudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvcGFja2Vycy1yb29raWUtcy1raXRhbi1vbGFkYXBvLXdpbGwtaGF2ZS10by1zdGF5LXVwLXRvLXNwZWVkLXdpdGhvdXQtcHJhY3RpY2UtcmVwcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Packers rookie S Kitan Oladapo will have to stay up to speed without practice reps,"Green Bay Packers rookie safety Kitan Oladapo will have the challenge of staying up to speed while being sidelined with a toe injury.

While participating in the on-field drills at the NFL Combine Oladapo suffered a broken toe. He had surgery on it a few weeks before the draft and the hope is that he will be good to go for training camp in August.

However in the meantime while Oladapo will still be involved in the team meetings he’s not going to have the opportunity to apply what he’s learning in the practice field.

“Just staying in the training room getting the swelling down getting my range of motion back” said Oladapo. “And then just staying locked in mental reps on the sideline and then meet with the coaches after make sure I get the game plan.”

Not that Oladapo will have the same fate as Grant DuBose – Oladapo’s path to contributing as a rookie is much more clear – but we saw just last offseason how an injury during this time of the year derailed any sort of roster push DuBose was hoping to make. He didn’t return to the practice field until mid-August and was playing catch up at that point.

At a minimum Oladapo figures to be a core special teams player for the Packers. Defensively while versatile like Javon Bullard and Evan Williams Oladapo fills more of the traditional safety role as GM Brian Gutekunst described it able to fill both the “free and strong safety role” who can also line up as the “big nickel Sam linebacker.”

“As we can move him around more” said defensive backs coach Ryan Downard “the walk throughs are going to become vital because these guys you teach them what you can but until you go out and do it and walk through it that’s to me where the real learning takes place.

“You can sit in a classroom and learn something but until you either have to teach it back or you take them out there physically let them walk through it that’s I think where the growth takes place.”

Downard added that Oladapo’s intelligence and football IQ will help him stay up to speed throughout this process. Downard liked what he saw from him during rookie minicamp and made sure to fire questions Oladapo’s way to keep him engaged.

The addition of Oladapo – along with Bullard and Williams – provides that interchangability that GM Brian Gutekunst was looking for at the position. Increased versatility at the position opens up the playbook for Jeff Hafley from a game-planning perspective and makes it more difficult for opposing offenses pre-snap not knowing who will have what responsibility.

Another element that these three players bring is speed and physicality. Along with finding the right players from a schematic standpoint there is a certain play-style that the Packers want to have under Hafley.

“I’m comfortable anywhere on the field” said Oladapo. “Whatever the team needs me to do: be in the box be in the post blitz guard tight ends guard slots. I can do it all. I feel comfortable just having my two feet on the grass.”"

Beyond any of the product or platform announcements at this week's Dreamforce Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff used the $280 cloud titan's annual mega-event to show off the strength of his team of top execs — and specifically their increased latitude and ability to steer the company even when Benioff himself isn't personally involved.

As Insider previously reported Benioff's strength in building up a strong executive bench has raised the possibility among those close to the company that he's planning an exit as CEO with chief operating officer Bret Taylor considered his heir apparent. But while Benioff this week declined to commit one way or the other to staying forever it's become increasingly clear just how much of the day-to-day work those top lieutenants are doing.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The first sign came at the main Dreamforce keynote where Benioff spoke at a high level about Salesforce's views on using technology for good before handing the microphone over to Taylor to discuss how new updates to Slack the workplace chat app recently acquired by Salesforce for $27.7 billion would tie into the company's vision for the future of work.

Later in the week at an investor day event held for Wall Street analysts on Thursday Benioff himself emphasized his executive team's ability to operate freely without needing his sign-off. He said that he trusts those execs to do right by everything that built Salesforce into the giant it is today calling them ""the best management team we've ever had.""

""The management team knows they can move ahead frictionless"" Benioff said. ""I think this has been very important. They know what the core values are. We operate by our values. And this has been a fantastic thing and that's why the culture is still in place today.""

Benioff even gave the example of Salesforce's recent stand on Texas' restrictive new abortion law as first reported by CNBC where the company pledged to assist in relocating any employee and their families who felt that their access to reproductive health was being limited.

At the investor day event Benioff said that the policy had been quickly conceived and implemented by Salesforce chief people officer Brent Hyder and his team in the wake of the controversial law's passage — without Benioff's approval. In fact Benioff said that the news reports on the policy were the first he'd heard of it.

""I wake up and take a shower get ready getting out my iPad reading my email my text I'm starting my day just like all of you do and I'm reading a story about how Marc Benioff says his employees can move out of Texas"" Benioff said at the event. ""And so I called Brent Hyder and I said this is fantastic but how — what happened?""

Benioff said that Hyder responded that the policy was based on the company's previous actions in states like Indiana and Georgia in cases where Salesforce protested laws that it saw as contrary to its corporate values.

""And that is the culture. There is a permission to our executives on how to operate freely"" Benioff said.

Whether this dynamic indicates any changes ahead at the highest levels of Salesforce Benioff is playing his cards close to his chest. When asked at Salesforce's investor day on Thursday how long he'd be CEO Benioff gave a non-committal answer.

Benioff said he himself had posed the question to Sanford Robertson a member of Salesforce's board and that Robertson had answered: ""Forever.""

""And I'm like 'that seems like a very long time.' So I don't know"" Benioff said.

Experts say Benioff is here to stay but so is his team

In a note to clients Wolfe Research analyst Alexander Zukin said that the decision to hold an in-person Dreamforce this year was a savvy move on Benioff's part: Not only did it let Salesforce show off its vaccine and testing tracking technology but it also let the chief exec show off ""his NEW A-team.""

Analysts praised Benioff's decision to play up the contributions of his C-Suite execs with chief revenue officer Gavin Patterson chief financial officer Amy Weaver chief marketing officer Sarah Franklin Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield and Taylor all playing major roles across the span of the Dreamforce event.

Notably Zukin and many of the other analysts who attended the event virtually or in-person largely seem to have interpreted Benioff's comments as a sign that he's not going anywhere at least not soon.

""The management bench has never been more stacked than it is today and will include Marc for the foreseeable future"" Wolfe Research analyst Alex Zukin wrote in a note Friday.

""We're going to keep dancing around this topic for a long time but what Dreamforce showed is that Marc is still involved with the company and passionate about it"" said Valoir analyst Rebecca Wettemann.

It's a sign of Benioff's unique knack for mentoring leaders Wettemann said and the company's success is proof that it's working. ""Marc has been cultivating this culture where execs can take decisions on their own and take responsibility"" Wettemann said.

JMP Securities analyst Pat Walravens said that apart from its product it would serve Benioff well to continue ""to elevate the next generation of leadership at Salesforce including COO Bret Taylor CRO Gavin Patterson and CFO Amy Weaver.""

For the marketing-savvy Benioff this show of managerial strength was likely no accident.

""This conference is kind of a manifestation I think of the last 18 months of work and the fundamental transformation of the entire organization how we run it how we think about it who is running it how it is run"" Benioff said at the event.

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%) the conglomerate headed by Warren Buffett owns a massive stock portfolio worth well over $300 billion today. From consumer electronics and financial services to automobiles and telecommunications Berkshire certainly owns a diverse range of businesses.

The Oracle of Omaha favors companies that are easy to understand have a strong brand and benefit from a competitive advantage. With this perspective in mind a team of Motley Fool contributors have identified Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG 0.19%) Costco Wholesale (COST 1.05%) and Salesforce (CRM 0.55%) as three outstanding businesses with features that Warren Buffett would love.

Popularizing the fast-casual dining experience

Neil Patel (Chipotle Mexican Grill): Buffett is very familiar with the restaurant industry having previously owned Restaurant Brands International. But the fast-casual pioneer Chipotle possesses some key characteristics that every investor should be looking for.

With 2853 total locations and trailing-12-month revenue of $6.8 billion Chipotle has developed a widely recognized consumer brand. Given that an estimated 30% of restaurants fail in their first year reaching this level of scale is no easy accomplishment. Chipotle has become adept at marketing leaning on social media channels and introducing celebrity-inspired burrito bowls to convey the real ingredients and simple cooking methods used. It wasn't until July 2021 that the business aired its first-ever national TV commercial which just goes to show that offering high-quality food at affordable prices speaks for itself.

Bolstering the brand even further is a focus on digital. In the most recent quarter orders via the company's website mobile app and third-party delivery services accounted for nearly half of all sales. And there are now more than 23 million Chipotle rewards members who have the ability to order their favorite items ahead of time. Of the 56 new locations the business opened in the second quarter 45 were equipped with a Chipotlane which is the drive-through option. Serving customers in whatever ways are most convenient for them is table stakes in today's hyper-competitive restaurant and retail environment.

Something Warren Buffett would really appreciate is Chipotle's proven pricing power. Following an increase to employee wages the company raised menu prices by up to 4% in June. But this had no adverse impact on demand. In fact Chipotle was able to register an impressive 24.5% restaurant-level operating margin in the quarter the highest since Q3 2015. ""Consistent with the past we saw very little resistance with the price increase in any of these channels"" CEO Brian Niccol mentioned on the recent earnings call.

The stock has soared nearly 400% over the past five years but based on a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 76 it is by no means cheap. Chipotle is a fantastic business and it has the traits Buffett seeks out in his investments. However the absence of a margin of safety would probably keep him away.

A bulk-sized moat

Jeremy Bowman (Costco): Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was a longtime owner of Costco Wholesale the membership-based warehouse retailer but the conglomerate sold the stock late last year. It wasn't clear why though it may have been for valuation reasons. However Costco shares have continued to gain since.

Though Buffett may have parted with Costco there are a number of reasons why Costco still looks like a classic Buffett stock.

First Costco is the clear leader in warehouse retail. The company only has two direct competitors Walmart's Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club and Costco is significantly ahead of both of those rivals in key metrics like sales per square foot and overall revenue. In fact Costco is the second-largest brick-and-mortar retailer in the U.S. behind Walmart with $196 billion in revenue last year.

The membership model offers a number of competitive advantages or economic moats as Buffett would put it. It locks in customers and encourages them to spend more money at Costco stores. Costco prices its products at near cost encouraging customer loyalty and creating a business model where membership fees which are $60 per year for most customers make up the bulk of its profits. Costco has a 90% customer retention rate in North America and it ranks near the top in customer satisfaction surveys a strong sign for the business's future growth.

The company continues to open new stores unlike many large retailers and invest in its e-commerce platform which surged during the pandemic.

As malls struggle and other brick-and-mortar retailers falter Costco's business model remains a winner and its rock-bottom prices will keep customers flocking to its stores. Costco even has a history of paying generous special dividends every few years.

In the retail industry only a few stocks look as bulletproof as Costco.

A force to be reckoned with

Eric Volkman (Salesforce): It's been said before but it's worth repeating and emphasizing -- if there's one thing Buffett loves in a company above nearly everything else it's a moat.

I feel that Salesforce has a wide one. It's very much the dominant company in the ever-expanding world of customer relationship management (CRM; not coincidentally the company's ticker symbol too). In fact its estimated market share of nearly 20% (as gauged by tech market researcher IDC) is higher than the four trailing competitors combined.

Another thing Buffett admires -- heck all investors admire -- is a business that continues to scale. Salesforce delivers growth in spades. In its most recently reported quarter a mix of organic improvement and well-considered recent acquisitions (corporate communications specialist Slack Technologies for one) lifted total revenue by a meaty 23% year-over-year to over $6.3 billion.

That wasn't a quirk or a one-off. Salesforce has posted very forceful top-line growth for years. From its fiscal 2017 to 2021 -- hardly a long stretch of time -- the company managed to more than double its total annual revenue from just under $8.4 billion in the former year to over $21 billion in 2021.

Profitability has jumped around some but in recent years the company has landed more consistently in the black and convincingly at that. The trailing four quarters of non-GAAP net income were respectively $1.4 billion $1.1 billion $975 million and $1.6 billion. Buffett would be well pleased with the double-digit net margins attached to those figures which range from 17% to 30%.

Granted some of this growth is due to the pandemic which kept employees at home and necessitated the kind of remote-teamwork solutions Salesforce specializes in. However it's likely we're shifting from a traditional office work regime to more of a hybrid model for a great many professions so the company has a very long runway in front of it.

It realistically believes that vaunted double-digit growth will continue to the tune of at least 23.5% for the entirety of 2021 and 20% for 2022. Those are consistent and strong improvements particularly considering how long Salesforce has been on the scene.

They are also the kinds of hard-to-ignore figures Buffett loves to see in his companies. He should really consider buying a stake in this one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpby5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xODkzMDkvaG93LWNvdmlkLTE5LWFjY2VsZXJhdGVkLXBob29uLWh1YXQtcy1tb3ZlLXRvLWUtY29tbWVyY2UuaHRtbNIBYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpby5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xODkzMDkvaG93LWNvdmlkLTE5LWFjY2VsZXJhdGVkLXBob29uLWh1YXQtcy1tb3ZlLXRvLWUtY29tbWVyY2UuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How COVID-19 accelerated Phoon Huat’s move to e-commerce,"Singapore-based Phoon Huat has grown into one of Singapore’s leading food suppliers specialising in the manufacture and supply of baking ingredients tools and services for food services consumer retail artisan and industrial bakeries.

Borthwick named Serving Seniors board of directors chairman,"Robert J. Borthwick

Del Mar resident Robert J. Borthwick has been named chairman of the board of directors for Serving Seniors a nonprofit organization. Borthwick will serve a two-year term from July 1 2021 to June 30 2022.

Borthwick a longtime volunteer and financial supporter has served on the board as Finance Committee Chairman since 2017.

“Rob Borthwick is the right leader at the right time for our organization” said Paul Downey CEO of Serving Seniors. “We face unprecedented need for our services but we also see exciting opportunities to support older adults threatened with the loss of housing and improve coordination among many agencies.

“Rob is a consensus builder with impressive legal and financial credentials. But more important to us he is a compassionate advocate for people in our community who cannot always speaks for themselves including older adults. Rob is truly their champion” said Downey.

Borthwick assumes his leadership role after an unprecedented year in the half-century history of the Serving Seniors organization due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. For the first time dining rooms and other congregate services were closed on March 12 2020. Staff needed to build a new delivery and takeout meal service from scratch in 24 hours and devise new remote programs and services to keep low-income and homeless older adults safe healthy and connected. During the closure Serving Seniors successfully delivered 2.1 million meals a 145% increase in service.

After 481 days the Gary and Mary West Senior Wellness Center is now reopened and both meals and other services are available at five remote locations. But tremendous new challenges remain ahead as economic forces continue to affect older adults at risk of losing housing.

“Serving Seniors and I share a commitment to supporting our community’s low-income and homeless older adults” said Borthwick. “The far reaching impact of this well-run organization is built on its efficiency dedication and financial solvency. Its impressive half-century of service provides the foundation for achieving even more ambitious goals in the years to come. I hope to contribute to this effort in my role as board chairman.”

Borthwick is deputy general counsel for Sempra. In this role Borthwick leads the litigation employment law law department operations and compliance functions.

Borthwick has served in various capacities since joining Sempra in 2003. Most recently from 2018 to 2019 he was general manager of Sempra Renewables leading all aspects of Sempra’s renewable energy business segment including commercial development finance and operations as well as supporting the sale of its U.S. wind and solar assets.

Prior to Sempra Borthwick practiced law at Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP in Los Angeles and served as a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles.

In addition to his role with Serving Seniors Borthwick serves as a court-appointed special advocate (CASA) for children in the foster care system.

Borthwick graduated with honors and holds a bachelor’s degree from Stanford University and graduated cum laude with a law degree from the University of Michigan.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The most recent outfit M&S shared on Instagram caught the eyes of shoppers for an unusual reason.

The high street giant shared an image of a woman wearing a gorgeous floral red maxi dress paired with chic sunglasses and brown boots.

A number of social media users were quick to compliment the dress.

“Love the dress” one user said.

Another added: “I love this dress. I always receive lovely comments when I wear it.”

However some users were less impressed and were quick to point out a potential problem.

A number of women in the comments appeared to have a problem with the length of the dress arguing that it would be too long for a shorter woman to wear.

“Why do you make all clothes so long what about 5 foot 2 inch ladies and what had happened to your Purina Range? Used to buy all my clothes from you not anymore” one disgruntled shopper said.

One Instagram user had very strong views on the dress: “I hate the whole thing. It's so puritanical. High neck long length full to hand sleeve. Just ugh.”

""I was on holiday with my sisters recently and it's not until you see from dawn to dusk what goes into it you really appreciate how mad it is and how great it is as well!

""And post Covid it was so lovely because Ailbhe had her baby Sean last August in the thick of Covid Aoibhin had Liobhan in November 2019 so only a few months before Covid started so to spend a full week with them was just absolutely fab."""

The venue this year was Silver Reef Brewing Company and it was the first drag show Pride of Southern Utah had hosted outside. A total of 189 tickets were sold said Lisa Wucherpfennig a Pride of Southern Utah volunteer and organizer and there were more than 200 people at the event including volunteers and servers.

The biggest differences in this year's drag show were the outside venue picked as a precaution because of the COVID-19 pandemic and a new rule that those wishing to donate could not just hand money to the performers during their routines.

“Just be open to the idea of having something like this"" said David Bithell one of the attendees when asked about what it was like to go to a drag event in St. George. ""If you’ve never been to something like this how do you know what it’s like? I grew up in the area-born and raised and I’ve never seen anything like this but it's also very exciting.""

Many of the performers were veterans of the drag show but there were a few newcomers according to Katie Perkins director of Pride of Southern Utah which advocates for the local LGBTQ+ community.

In what would raise hopes of avoiding Chinese debt trap in the developing world a consortium led by the German engineering multinational Siemens pipped the Chinese and has been awarded a 4.5-billion-euro contract to build a high-speed rail line in Egypt  a key state in the Arab world.The railway line will be built from Ain Sukhna at the southern end of the Suez Canal to Alexandria and the port city of Marsa Matruh – from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea in Egypt according to a special report in the leading German magazine Der Spiegel Siemens reportedly outsmarted a Chinese competitor for the project according to Der Spiegel report. “The project which is backed by a Hermes loan guarantee from the German government has broad political support in Berlin…” according to the report.There are millions of Egyptians who will benefit from this railway project. The line is scheduled for completion in 2027 and will later be extended upriver to Luxor and the resort city of Hurghada according to Der Spiegel.It will also provide economic stimulus and create jobs for around 15000 people in Egypt in the first stage according to estimates provided by project leader Siemens. Two Egyptian companies have been commissioned with the construction of the route and the project is progressing quickly according to the report.“The order is reminiscent of major infrastructure projects that German companies built in the region during the 1960s and 1970s traces of which can still be admired today in Saudi Arabia  Iran Iraq and Nigeria” Der Spiegel wrote. China has been investing in the Mediterranean region. Chinese companies operate port terminals in Haifa Israel Port Said  Egypt and in Piraeus Greece. The Chinese companies have built a mosque complex in Algeria and solar parks in Morocco. But a railway project in Israel by China never got off yet.",,,,,,

According to a report from CBS News “more than 1600 people have been banned by Delta Air Lines since the federal government has required airplane passengers to wear masks.”

According to the CBS report there are now over 4000 people in the US on various airline banned lists but that number does not include those from American Airlines and Southwest airlines as those companies do not release their data.

“We’ve also asked other airlines to share their “no-fly” list to further protect airline employees across the industry – something we know is top of mind for you as well. A list of banned customers doesn’t work as well if that customer can fly with another airline” said a Delta Air Lines memo reviewed by CBS News that was sent to flight attendants.

The US Federal Aviation Administration has received 4385 reports from airlines this year about unruly passengers including 3199 reports involving passengers refusing to comply with federal mask requirements.

CBS says that “representatives of the FAA met this week with representatives of the airlines to discuss ways to reduce unruly behavior and asked the airlines to commit to more action.”

CBS also reports that “airlines started enforcing federal mask mandates in June 2020 and the FAA implemented its zero-tolerance policy regarding unruly behavior in January. The agency has initiated 789 investigations into passengers so far in 2021 a sharp spike from the 183 investigations it initiated in 2020.”

The FAA announced last month that it had requested more than a million dollars in fines this year as part of civil enforcement actions against unruly passengers. Passengers can appeal the fines.

David Lee Boswell was flying the Cessna 172 with his instructor Martin Kazy the two undergoing a flying lesson on that fated morning. Boswell had completed several successful passes then decided to head back toward the Montgomery Field airport.

Boswell was told to keep his Cessna below 3500 feet altitude to avoid approaching Pacific Southwest Flight 1982 which was approaching San Diego. Boswell not only ignored the air-traffic controllers on that front but he also changed course without informing anyone.

The pilots of Flight 182 also failed to inform air-traffic controllers that they had lost sight of the Cessna.

In the air-traffic control center a collision alert system went off. It was ignored; the system frequently rang with false alarms. Because it was the last they’d heard air-traffic controllers assumed Flight 182 pilots could still see the Cessna. One minute later the flights collided bursting into a massive fireball upon impact.

All 144 people on Flight 182 were killed along with both Cessna pilots. The debris that fell on San Diego destroyed 22 homes and killed seven people on the ground in addition to those killed in the air. It remains the deadliest air disaster in California history and was at the time the deadliest commercial air disaster in the United States. It also renewed a longstanding controversy over the San Diego Airport’s location near heavily populated areas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hdXN0aW4tdW5pcXVlLWFtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Austin: A Unique Glimpse At The Future For American Airlines,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hdXN0aW4tdW5pcXVlLWFtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Peter Dukes is credited with being the man behind the coffee confection that came to define a whole season: Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte. It all began in the company's Seattle headquarters in 2001.

""You are the father of PSL?"" CBS News' Michelle Miller asked referring to the beverage.

""That's what some say. Yes"" said Dukes.

Dukes is now the director of Global Growth and Concepts. But he was once in charge of espresso drinks for the company. Fresh off the holiday success of Starbucks' Peppermint Mocha Dukes and other employees were asked to create a drink for the fall season.

""So we came up with a hundred different ideas and whittled it down to ten"" said Dukes. ""We had about 500 customers look at these ten concepts. When we got back the results chocolate and caramel 'Oh yeah I'll buy that for sure.' Cinnamon solid pretty well. This is something that people don't know or are not aware of. Pumpkin Spice Latte never had a chance that it was going to get to prototype.""

""So what you're saying it was the flavor that almost wasn't?"" asked Miller.

""It was the flavor that almost wasn't. And what saved it was it was a unique beverage"" said Dukes. ""What we didn't know at that time was whether or not it was something that our customers would wanna try.""

Peter Dukes is the inventor of Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte. Peter Dukes

So making that winning flavor would be no piece of cake although it did involve a slice of something else.

""We brought in pumpkin pies into our R&D lab and actually just poured shots of espresso on 'em and ate 'em"" said Dukes.

For 18 years customers have been eating them up with more than 500 million sold since their 2003 debut.

""This probably is something that psychology and economics and marketing classes could be studying for ages"" said Dr. Catherine Franssen of the Science Museum of Virginia.

She believes that all that success comes down to science.

""Pumpkin spice has the ability to really reach into the center of our memories at a very emotional level"" said Franssen. ""At the core of that is sugar. We actually encode the memories of what's associated with the sugar. For example the smell of pumpkin spice.""

But the high sugar content also drove complaints from health-conscious consumers along with the original recipe's use of artificial flavors and the absence of real pumpkin.

""I think it spurred us to think a little bit harder of how we could even make it better"" said Thomas Prather Starbucks' vice president of Brand and Product Marketing. Prather said this led to a recipe change in 2015.

Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte got a recipe change in 2015 Starbucks

""I think it actually woke up the industry a bit to look inside and say 'How can we have cleaner ingredients? How can we be more innovative in what we're delivering to our customers?' and it pushed us all forward"" said Prather.

The new recipe increased its popularity; PSL got its own Twitter handle and an official Instagram account in 2015. Two years later Starbucks live-streamed the early arrival of its PSL which debuted in late August. It logged more than 8 million hits.

""PSL brought fun to coffee and brought people that weren't purists into the café culture"" said Pather.

""Fun to coffee?"" asked Miller.

""Yeah. So if you think about coffee before PSL in the early 2000s it was you had a cappuccino. Or you had some just a doppio espresso"" replied Prather. "" And once we started making it more approachable people started kind of thinking of it 'This is more than just a utilitarian drink that I'm going to get before work.""

The drink has led to a profusion of products including seasonal beverages and the expansion of its spaces like the Reserve Bar and bistro in select cities.

""Would all of this be possible if not for PSL Pumpkin Spice Latte?"" asked Miller.

""I think Pumpkin Spice Latte and the success of that gave us the confidence that we can do whatever we wanted to do with coffee"" said Prather.

""It took off to a whole other level that again nobody ever could have predicted"" Dukes said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N0aW1lcy5jb20vbG9jYWwvYXJ0aWNsZS9UYXJnZXQtbG9va3MtdG8tZXhwYW5kLWFkZC1TdGFyYnVja3MtYmFyLXRvLTE2NDg1OTg0LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Target looks to expand add Starbucks bar to Bethel store,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newstimes.com/local/article/Target-looks-to-expand-add-Starbucks-bar-to-16485984.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N0aW1lcy5jb20vbG9jYWwvYXJ0aWNsZS9UYXJnZXQtbG9va3MtdG8tZXhwYW5kLWFkZC1TdGFyYnVja3MtYmFyLXRvLTE2NDg1OTg0LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vaWxvdmV0aGV1cHBlcndlc3RzaWRlLmNvbS9hbm5veWVkLXVwcGVyLXdlc3Qtc2lkZXJzLXdvbmRlci13aHktdGhlaXItc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWlzLWNsb3NlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Annoyed Upper West Siders Wonder Why Their Starbucks is Closed - iLovetheUpperWestSide.com,"About The Author

The Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Tokyo is a star attraction for various reasons. It serves not only as a coffee shop and roastery but as a monument to the Starbucks franchise itself and it’s also a font of exclusive flavors that the rest of the country must covet from afar.

One of these flavors was their Smoked Butterscotch Latte a flavor so popular that Starbucks saw fit to include a version of it in their regular stores last year. But as with all seasonal flavors the time for the Butterscotch Jelly Latte came and went…and according to the Starbucks Reserve Roastery website even they are no longer carrying those particular doses of sweet caramelized caffeine. The menu is prioritizing creme brulee and autumnal spice flavors instead. Pah!

But here’s the good news! As of September 21 customers can get their fix of sugary buttery coffee at convenience stores all over Japan. The Starbucks Butterscotch Latte is making its debut as a pre-packaged chilled coffee!

The drink is comprised of a flavorful base of syrupy butterscotch full creamy milk and of course hand-picked roasted coffee beans. Its bold invigorating sweetness is just the pick-me-up we need as the last embers of summer die out and invite the autumn chill inside. The drink is packaged gorgeously too with an abstracted blend of golden yellows and deep browns that evoke melted butter drizzles of caramel and Starbucks’ patented tasty coffee.

▼ Ah the comforting taste of grandma candy.

The drink will cost just 216 yen (US$1.97). If you need a quick blast of flavored caffeine and don’t have the time to stand in line for a roasted potato Frappuccino this little cup will sweeten up your day in no time at all!

The bank reportedly plans to shift its Asian investment banking division into its global advisory business a move that would signal the end of the regional strategy pioneered by former CEO Tidjane Thiam.

In 2015 Thiam carved out Asia-Pacific as a dedicated business division with its own investment banking and advisory arm. The intention was to supercharge growth by offering more trading and capital markets products to its Asian billionaire client base.

There are a number of reasons why Credit Suisse is now looking to put its global investment banking business back together. Firstly it’s the next logical next step after CEO Thomas Gottstein created a global investment bank in July 2020 bringing together the former Investment Banking and Capital Markets (IBCM) and Global Markets (GM) divisions as well as Asia Pacific (APAC) markets. The markets division was the investment banking powerhouse in Asia so bringing IBCM into the fold completes this process.

The move will centralize and simplify the bank’s operations. Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio is currently undertaking root-and-branch review of the group’s operations following the losses associated with the collapse of Greensill and Archegos Capital. Horta-Osorio has already revamped and strengthened the risk management function and has hired executives including David Wildermuth from Goldman Sachs Group in July to become chief risk officer.

Change in Asia is long overdue. Thiam’s convoluted structure was both unique among big western banks and difficult to understand. Putting the investment banking and advisory operation back on a global footing will make it easier to manage and also should boost collaboration between regions.

The Asian power-base at Credit Suisse

Dismantling Thiam's structure may not be popular with everyone at Credit Suisse however. The man with the most to lose would seem to be Helman Sitohang the Indonesian group CEO for Asia Pacific who has a big power base and considerable clout.

Sitohang was promoted to run Credit Suisse's Asian business in 2015. He has been a strong advocate of Credit Suisse’s ‘One bank’ strategy using his links with the region’s billionaires to scoop lucrative underwriting and advisory mandates. Sitohang’s rainmaking credentials are widely acknowledged – he is credited with is credited with more than $200 billion in deals and capital-raising in 22 years at the Swiss bank according to Swiss website finews.

But he’s also been close to recent controversial clients of the bank and was one of Lex Greensill’s biggest advocates seeing him as an ideal client – an entrepreneur with touchpoints throughout the bank.

In 2020 the bank generated revenues of Sfr3.1bn in APAC a 4% increase on 2019 but some way short of its best ever performance of Sfr3.8bn which was delivered in 2015 the inaugural year of the new structure. Headcount has risen to 6890 from 6590 over the same period according to the bank’s annual report.

Credit Suisse doesn't provide a break-down of revenues in APAC purely derived from IBCM but has a reporting line called ‘transaction-based revenues’ which covers trading underwriting and M&A advisory. That generated Sfr1.6bn of revenues last year just over half of the total revenues generated in the region.

The bank was ranked fourth by M&A revenues in APAC in the first half of the year compared with first a year ago. In investment banking it was ranked eighth by fees from underwriting and advisory for international business in China down from second a year ago according to data from Dealogic

It's conceivable that very little will change under the new structure. Credit Suisse operates the same matrix structure in Asia Pac as it does other regions with dedicated industry and country heads overseen by regional management –Zeth Hung and Ed Low are co-heads of IBCM for the Asia Pacific region and are expected to continue in their roles. Credit Suisse has also just conducted a revamp of its investment banking line-up in the region making a raft of promotions in a move seen as the bank promoting its next generation of bankers. It is also committed to a big expansion in mainland China where it became a majority shareholder in its joint venture in June 2020 and appointed Janice Hu as CEO in July 2021.

However there will no doubt be savings to be made from stripping out operational management roles. And depending on whether the plan is approved and what is looks like CS’s investment bankers in APAC could have less latitude when it comes to backing clients if the depend on the balance sheet of the investment bank rather than that available in the region.

It remains to be seen what this will mean for pay. As part of a standalone Asia Pacific group IBCM’s bonus pool is dependent on the performance of the regional entity and will have performance criteria linked to the region. Shifting it into the global investment bank could mean bonuses could be measured by different criteria.

Overall the biggest winner from the proposed strategic revamp will be Christian Meissner the CEO of the Investment bank. With Asia added Meissner will have a bigger and more clearly-defined empire. As for Sitohang who along with Gottstein is the only surviving member of the executive board appointed by Thiam at the time of the 2015 restructuring it remains to be seen whether his role will shrink along with his responsibilities.

Most of their money disappeared by 2018 after they entrusted it to a financial adviser who placed the funds in what was later found to be unsuitable volatile investments such as oil and gas and real estate limited partnerships.

Last month an arbitration panel of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) ruled for the Wards.

It found that financial adviser Steven Knuttila and Capital Financial Services (CFS) of Minot N.D. and its former president John Carlson breached their fiduciary duties by urging the Wards to invest the proceeds from the sale of their house inappropriately.

FINRA awarded the Wards $275000 in compensatory damages $150000 in punitive damages and $100000 in attorneys fees. It also told CFS which has since closed to pay $414000 in sanctions.

Chet Taylor a veteran Minneapolis securities lawyer who represents the Wards has gone to court to try to collect the money. On Friday Taylor asked Hennepin County District Judge Joseph Klein to confirm the FINRA award.

After testimony in a virtual hearing Klein said he would soon rule on Taylor's motion.

Knuttila 70 appeared at Friday's hearing and told Klein that he is destitute driving a bus and collecting Social Security. ""My financial status is bleak at best"" he testified.

Carlson who also appeared at the hearing had no comment.

Martin Fleischhacker the financial fraud ombudsman at the Minnesota Department of Commerce said the case is a proxy for elder fraud that the state agency has been fighting for nearly a decade.

The Minnesota Legislature in 2018 and again in 2020 passed bills that empowered banks financial and legal professionals to take measures and notify authorities if they suspect a ""vulnerable elder"" is being taken whether by a financial adviser family member or foreign-based ""dating"" or other scam used to fleece them.

The Wards are now living on $25000 in annual Social Security benefits.

""We are satisfied that we won"" Larry Ward said last week. ""But it doesn't appear that we are going to receive any of the money. We're worried. The majority of the money we invested [is gone].""

Taylor said he's more optimistic than the Wards.

""The brokerage firm is out of business claiming no money but that's yet to be tested"" Taylor said in an interview before Friday's hearing.

By 2019 FINRA and the Minnesota Department of Commerce had barred Knuttila from the securities business over numerous customer allegations.

Taylor said there were other arbitrations that CFS settled for nearly $3 million that alleged similar behavior and ended up putting the firm out of business by 2020. He said the Wards were the only claimants who took an arbitration all the way to a judgment. A former CFS compliance officer had warned Carlson of the inappropriate investments being sold to elderly clients according to testimony.

Fleischhacker said his office gets about 15 legitimate cases weekly to investigate from lawyers financial professionals banks and credit unions. Local police departments are overwhelmed with requests for help.

Often Fleischhacker or other authorities will respond to a credible report by telling a financial institution to put a hold on an account aside from regular living-expense withdrawals.

""It allows bank regulator and law enforcement to surgically go in and make sure they have money for living but block the huge wire transfers and others of $10000 or more. To stop what may be fraud. I can investigate who's getting the money"" he said.

Some fraud cases involve people from overseas. Fleischhacker said there are federal laws that apply to those cases.

Some online scammers are so brazen they've lifted Fleischhacker's official photograph from the internet and used it in their pitches.

Elder fraud is the fastest-growing category of financial crime because the elderly tend to make compliant victims regulators say.

However most financial fraud against elders goes undetected. It's a growth industry of greedy family members illicit telemarketers third-party caregivers wayward financial advisers and others. Prosecutors with limited resources pursue only the strongest cases brought to police and state investigators.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3d2FsbHN0LmNvbS9zcGVjaWFsLXJlcG9ydC8yMDIxLzA5LzI2L3RoaXMtaXMtdGhlLWJlc3QtcGllLXNob3AtaW4tZXZlcnktc3RhdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Is the Best Pie Shop in Every State,"This Is the Best Pie Shop in Every State jeffreyww / Flickr

Invented as a way to conveniently encase and transport cooked meat pie can be thought of as the original tupperware and was enjoyed by ancient Egyptians Greeks and Romans. Pie came to the New World with English settlers who often did not eat the crust but rather used it as a way to contain the filling during baking.

Although the pies of yesteryear were mostly of the savory sort — containing fowl or fish — the word pie in modern America has become synonymous with dessert.

24/7 Tempo has compiled the best pie shop in every state the majority of which specialize in sweet rather than savory pies. (Craving something sweet but not into pie? Check out these popular desserts you must try from every state.)

Some of these pie shops boast specialties featuring fillings made of ingredients plentiful in the area such as sweet potatoes and pecans in the South passion fruit in Hawaii and cherries in Michigan. On the other hand old stand-bys like apple chocolate mousse and coconut cream pie are widely available across the country not only in specialty pie shops but everywhere from high class restaurants to old-fashioned diners. Here are 25 retro restaurant dishes we might never see again.

To assemble a list of the best pie shop in every state 24/7 Tempo consulted reviews and rankings on a wide range of websites including Yelp Taste of Home Thrillist Fodors Food Network Spoon University Forbes Delish and The Daily Meal as well as numerous local and regional sites. While precedence was given to shops specializing in pies (often with “pie” in their name) in some cases bakeries with more general focus and occasionally places that are primarily cafés were included if they were highly rated for their pies.

The 4100 Group Inc. held positions in both Menlo Park Calif.-based Gauss Surgical Inc. and Ciitizen Corp. a genetics testing company in Palo Alto.

The two exits will generate “good returns collectively” for The 4100 Group said Scott Lancaster chief investment officer and managing director of private market investments. Both exits follow the East Lansing-based 4100 Group’s deployment of its initial capital allocation from Delta Dental. Additional plans involve the formation of a successor fund that could reach up to $150 million.

“Any time you stand up a fund with a single LP (limited partner) and they haven’t ventured off into the venture space getting everybody acclimated to the higher risk higher reward venture investing requires a little bit of time. Certainly getting these two across the goal line in under a year will help our cause internally” said Lancaster who’s based in Grand Rapids and called the exits “a great win” for The 4100 Group.

“We have essentially built out a complete portfolio with our initial tranche of capital from Delta Dental so I think this will give us a little internal street cred to be able to go back and ask for additional capital to deploy as we recycle the returns from those two exits” he said.

Health care tech focus

Kalamazoo-based Stryker Corp. this month closed on the acquisition of Gauss Surgical which developed a monitoring system known as Triton to provide clinicians an accurate estimate of a patient’s hemoglobin and blood loss during surgeries and births. Terms of the deal were undisclosed.

The publicly traded Invitae based in San Francisco plans to buy Ciitizen in a $325 million deal that was announced on Sept. 7. The stock-and-cash deal is expected to close this month.

The 4100 Group acquired positions last year in both companies from Spectrum Health Ventures LLC. Lancaster previously worked as clinical director at Spectrum Health Ventures and joined The 4100 Group in July 2020. He served on boards at both Gauss Surgical and Ciitizen following Spectrum Health Ventures’ initial investments.

His hiring brought expertise in venture capital to the investment team at The 4100 Group which Delta Dental of Michigan and Delta Dental of Ohio formed as a joint venture in 2018. The 4100 Group initially focused on making later-stage equity investments primarily in the financial services sector and has been seeking add-on or tuck-in acquisitions to complement those holdings said President and CEO Mike Gilmore.

“We have a couple deals right now related to that” Gilmore said. “We’re looking for things that might be able to help enhance their business processes.”

Grand Rapids institutional asset management firm Red Cedar Investment Management LLC is among The 4100 Group’s present portfolio companies. The 4100 Group also owns a wealth advisory firm in Cleveland as well as Lansing information technology solutions company Dewpoint Inc. which has an office in Grand Rapids.

With the addition of Lancaster last year and investment adviser Dr. Garrett Vygantas in February The 4100 Group also seeks to make investments in health care tech companies that are past the seed stage.

“In general we’re looking for technologies that impact the patient-provider ecosystem in a positive way to reduce costs and improve outcomes” Lancaster said.

More than capital

Like many investment firms The 4100 Group offers support to portfolio companies beyond the venture capital invested. Both Lancaster and Vygantas are doctors experienced investors in the sector and entrepreneurs who have started and sold companies.

“We can guide our management teams from mentorship and where to avoid the potential pitfalls in terms of laying out the path to profitability” Vygantas said.

The 4100 Group makes investments in companies slightly past seed stage and at any given time has a pipeline of about 95 prospects. The company likes to invest along with a syndicate of investors and expects to extend seven to 10 term sheets annually said Vygantas who is based in San Francisco.

The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a “big lift” in innovation in health care in areas such as telemedicine Vygantas said. As well The 4100 Group is looking at other areas in health care such as long-term and financial care planning therapeutics and unmet medical needs.

The pipeline of potential investment prospects “constantly refreshes faster than we can keep up with” Vygantas said.

The success of the two exits in Gauss Surgical and Ciitizen occurs as The 4100 Group pursues formation of its next venture capital fund. The 4100 Group will look at whether to bring in additional limited partners into the fund’s investor mix Vygantas said.

The timing of when the new fund can begin operating remains undecided. However Vygantas said: “We have early signals of momentum here and our goal is to strike while the iron is hot and build the value for our limited partners as rapidly as possible.”

Here’s what the experts say,"Despite many devices boasting 5G capabilities these days a recent study showed people in the U.S. spend less than 25% of their online time connected to a 5G network. This may be because 5G-enabled devices are outpacing 5G access. Last year 14 million users subscribed to mobile 5G services and the number was forecasted to grow to 554 million by the end of this year. Today more than halfway into 2021 T-Mobile has already connected 305 million people with 5G networks. Along with T-Mobile other major mobile operators like Verizon and AT&T were quick to roll out 5G in the last few months collectively covering 75% of the U.S.

On paper the numbers look great making it seem like 5G covers most of the country. In practice there’s a discrepancy with many people still not operating on 5G networks. What accounts for this discrepancy? We asked the experts.

The pandemic hurdle

Rollout of 5G capacity was speeding along until it slammed into a big wall in the form of the pandemic. “We’ve had to rely on telecommunications to connect with our friends family and colleagues. That’s caused a sudden emphasis on wireless connectivity — especially with remote work — which puts pressure on companies to accommodate increased demand” says Shawn Carpenter program director at Ansys a company that helps in the engineering of 5G hardware.

While 4G was enough during the pre-pandemic period when most things happened in person 4G was not designed to support our current demand level or to support non-smartphone applications such as the Internet of Things says David Witkowski IEEE senior member and founder and CEO of Oku Solutions.

To help solve the sudden connectivity crisis that came with the coronavirus spread 5G operators and 5G-focused startups also started to come up with unique solutions to provide efficient health care and educational services. For instance Unmanned Life developed a 5G autonomy-as-a-service platform that can provide autonomous drones to disinfect COVID-prone regions deliver essentials like medical supplies and food and monitor crowded spaces from a distance. These innovations are great but they also put more strain on the network.

Mobile 5G subscriptions for general consumer use are still lagging.

From a consumer standpoint more people have had time to spend on their phones for both work and leisure nudging them to prioritize their networks in a way that wasn’t necessary before.

With demand for 5G increasing you’d expect network providers to respond by boosting capacity. Yet despite these developments mobile 5G subscriptions for general consumer use are still lagging. The path to widespread 5G rollouts still has quite a few obstacles experts say.

The infrastructure challenge

Infrastructure is a challenge Carpenter says. “Fundamentally in order to get faster service and pump more data wirelessly we need more electromagnetic spectrum … As we enter the 5G spectrum we’re working with distances of a few city blocks or less. And buildings go from sponges to mirrors — signals bounce off of them as opposed to penetrating walls and reaching your cell phone.”

There’s also the issue of where to place all of these access points inside buildings so that we’re not overcrowding spaces with routers or leaving areas with no connectivity he adds.

Even if the infrastructure was managed somehow implementing consumer-use 5G in a broad capacity may be difficult.

“A key challenge is managing customer expectations: A lot of the anticipated benefits that would occur from a fully functioning 5G network – minimal latency network slicing advanced [augmented reality]/VR apps incredibly fast upload and download speeds fully autonomous driving with vehicle-to-everything communications (V2X) – won’t happen until 5G stand-alone (5GSA) comes to fruition (still a bit away)” says Dr. Paul Carter CEO and founder of Global Wireless Solutions (GWS) a wireless network testing and consumer research company.

“Consumers are being promised the moon with 5G. Without some level-setting it will be easy for their expectations to outweigh the current tangible benefits” he adds.

The rural-urban divide

With the growing presence of 5G networks the question arises: Will 5G bridge the rural-urban divide or will it make things worse?

It’s a mixed bag. There may be problems initially when the infrastructure is still being built but massive benefits await down the line experts say.

Dee Dee Pare’ senior product marketing manager of Cradlepoint says 5G will increase the reach of networks. “As 5G becomes a norm across business and consumer use cases 4G and LTE will become even more accessible. Rather than looking at 5G developments widening a gap think of it as elevating wireless connectivity as a whole. It’s a gradual evolution that will benefit businesses and their customers regardless of location — rural or urban” she says.

Some experts like Grant Castle vice president of device engineering and technology labs at T-Mobile believe it has already worked toward narrowing the gap. “With T-Mobile’s Extended Range and Ultra Capacity 5G we are reaching rural America where people for decades have dealt with subpar internet access” Castle says. “In fact we already have rural homes running their entire home on our 5G Home Internet router.”

Carter says the potential benefits would depend on how the 5G providers handle the rollouts. “Each of the three major operators are trying to find the right balance of launching 5G across the entire country” he says. “GWS has observed Verizon launching the mmWave in urban areas to start while T-Mobile is prioritizing deploying lower bands making 5G available in several rural markets.”

A fixable problem

Carter says the amount of available spectrum for 5G while 4G and 3G networks are still operating may be limited. “While 3G’s turn-off date is scheduled for early 2022 there has been some pushback by folks outside the industry to maintain that generation of wireless networks. It is a move that would hinder 5G’s rollout as freeing up that spectrum would allow operators to allocate it towards improving 5G’s rollout” he said.

Some solutions to common 5G problems are quite intuitive like Carter’s suggestion to manage consumer expectations from the start while others may require much more capital investment and time. The bottom line is that most issues cropping up can be managed to a large extent.

“Companies are solving the infrastructure problem known as the outside-in problem by placing an antenna on the outside of buildings to receive signals from a base station” Carpenter says. “Once that signal is received it’ll have to run through something like a fiber optic cable and be amplified within the building by another device like a Wi-Fi 6 router or interior 5G access point.”

For the issue of access points simulation could be a solution he continues. By simulating 5G signals and their propagation throughout the building companies can understand the coverage area and optimize the number of access points. That eliminates the need to have someone walking through your office building on the phone asking “Can you hear me now?”

These may seem to be daunting issues at first but Carter and most of the experts we spoke with believe they are solvable problems meaning 5G rollouts could continue to speed up or at least remain stable in the near future. For the first time consumers are making significant demands on 5G networks and where demand goes supply usually follows.

Just like the projection maps we’re all familiar with that inaccurately depict Greenland dwarfing South America the digital maps that orient our lives on smartphones and laptops are the result of a series of compromises or half-truths and don’t always accurately represent the world as it is.

As a result we too often misunderstand the true contours of the world and then make poor decisions based on misinformation. As our reliance on digital maps increases — for instance with the proliferation of driverless cars — the gap between the world as it is and the world as our maps represent it risks growing ever wider.

Maps have always been driven by other forces like economic or political interests and they represent the world as the mapmakers would like people to see it. But they can also be misused to push a certain agenda.

Examples abound. Electoral maps in the United States often conflate land area with the number of voters overstating the popularity of Republican candidates. Last year a scary map depicting the volume of global air travel went viral when it was mistaken for a map of coronavirus infection spread. Maps purporting to show the extent of wildfires in Australia were similarly inscrutable. And Zillow and Redfin’s home pricing estimates factoring in geographic features like school districts and walkability scores baffle home sellers and buyers alike by being both too low and too high.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vYXR0LXVubGltaXRlZC1lbGl0ZS1wbGFuLXdvcnRoLWl0LXdoeS1wcm9zLWNvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is AT&T Unlimited Elite Worth It?

What you need to know about the Nokia XR20

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

Nokia XR20 (6GB 128GB) US/UK: $549 / £449

$549 / £449 Nokia XR20 (4GB 64GB) EU: €499 The Nokia XR20 is a rugged-styled smartphone that boasts a respectable spec sheet and somewhat svelte looks. It aims for maximum durability without resorting to the bulky hardware so often required for full protection. Its pricing falls in line with other rugged devices which means it is an affordable way to buy into the market for tough phones. As its price point indicates it’s more of a mid-range device and sits at about the middle of Nokia’s range in terms of performance.

Nokia sells two RAM/storage combos which vary by region. The US and UK get the 6GB/128GB model while the rest of Europe gets the 4GB/64GB model. Both models support expandable storage. The phone comes in two colors: Ultra Blue (tested) and Granite. The device ships unlocked and supports the networks of AT&T and T-Mobile in the States including 5G. It’s already available online from retailers such as Amazon and B&H Photo in the US as well as Nokia direct.

What’s good?

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

There’s plenty to like about the Nokia XR20 starting with the hardware. Nokia did a commendable job designing a phone that looks good and acts tough.

The best way to think about the XR20 is as though it were a thin device with a tight case preinstalled. The phone has exposed aluminum side rails wrapped in a rubber coating around the outer edges and an aluminum chassis that’s covered in plastic on the rear. It’s big (171.64 x 81.5 x 10.64mm) and weighty (248g) but also reassuring. It comes across as much stronger than the average phone.

The phone meets the newer MIL-STD 810H for protection from drops vibration temperature extremes and more.

How strong is it? In addition to the aluminum chassis Corning’s top-grade Gorilla Glass Victus protects the display. The phone meets the newer MIL-STD 810H for protection from drops (from 1.8m) vibration temperature extremes salt humidity and more. Of course it scores an IP68 rating for protection against dust and water submersion (at a depth of 1.5m for up to one hour). These ensure that the phone should handle basic abuse with little worry. In order to test this I threw the phone around my backyard kicked it dropped it to concrete dunked it in the local river and tossed it down my cellar stairs. It came away from these trials and tribulations none the worse for wear.

All of this is very impressive considering it doesn’t look like a typical bulky rugged phone yet it combines some of the best protection ratings of any phone on the market.

You’d think a rugged phone would have minimum features but the Nokia XR20 has more to offer than most flagships. In addition to a dedicated Google Assistant button it has a user-programmable key as well as a fingerprint reader USB-C port a headphone jack a loop for lanyards and extra loud stereo speakers. Those loud speakers are great for hearing speakerphone calls and blasting music in outdoor spaces.

The display is really nice. It measures 6.67 inches and offers FHD+ (2400 x 1080) resolution in a 20:9 aspect ratio. The screen pumps out 550 nits of brightness which is enough for most scenarios though it was sometimes hard to see under direct sunlight. The selfie camera is centered at the top punch hole style.

The 4630mAh power cell pushes through two days of battery life with ease.

Battery life is outstanding. The 4630mAh power cell pushes through two days of battery life with ease. Screen-on time measured in excess of eight hours. Moreover the phone supports 18W wired charging (charger included) and 15W wireless charging. Re-charging times weren’t overlong coming in at 85 minutes from empty. The wireless charging is a nice bonus.

Wireless support is excellent. The Nokia XR20 packs a fair number of 5G bands for both the US and the EU/UK (though no mmWave support). I tested it on T-Mobile’s 5G network in the US and came away impressed with speeds. The phone does not work with AT&T’s 5G network but can access AT&T’s LTE network. Additionally the XR20 includes Wi-Fi 6 Bluetooth 5.1 (with aptX Adaptive aptX Voice) and NFC for mobile payments. That’s an impressive connectivity suite for this price range.

Then there’s the software situation. The phone ships with Android 11 which runs smoothly on the device. It’s a clean build of stock Android and it has only a few bloaty apps such as ExpressVPN and Spotify. More importantly HMD Global has committed to three operating system upgrades and four years of security updates for the phone. You can’t ask for much more than that.

What’s not so good?

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

The Nokia XR20 has a lot going for it but it’s not quite perfect. A few small things hold the phone back some and they are worth discussion.

First is performance. The XR20 ships with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G processor with an Adreno 619 GPU. HMD Global hasn’t specified what type of RAM and storage are on board. This is a SoC for entry-level phones. While the XR20 handled everyday tasks with relative ease it doesn’t excel at everything. It got a little bogged down when I had lots of apps running in the background or when I loaded up a dozen tabs in Chrome. It certainly didn’t impress when running benchmarks. This is the type of chip you expect to find in phones costing $250 to $400. While you don’t expect stellar performance from a rugged-like phone it’s a little disappointing for a phone that costs $550.

This is the type of chip you expect to find in phones costing $250 to $400.

Then there’s the camera. It’s not a bad system for the category but again it should be a little better for the price point. The main shooter has a 48MP sensor at f/1.79 with autofocus while the ultra wide-angle camera has a 13MP sensor with fixed focus lens at f/2.4. ZEISS optics are on board as are some ZEISS-branded shooting modes including ZEISS Portrait and ZEISS Cinematic Effects. The shots I collected with the phone were average at best and sometimes below average. I noticed a lack of detail here and there and colors were often washed out. The 8MP selfie camera gets the job done but delivers noisy results. Video capture is limited to 1080p at 60fps. The footage is just okay.

It should also be noted that unlike other rugged phones you don’t get any photography hardware extras here. Other devices feature dedicated night vision modes and professional-grade thermal sensors.

Last the fingerprint reader. The reader is built into the power button on the phone’s right edge. It’s simply not up to snuff. Not only is it hard to find but its accuracy and speed are sorely lacking. You’re better off using a PIN or pattern to protect the phone. There’s face unlock for those that prefer though it’s software-based so isn’t as secure.

Nokia XR20 review: Should I buy it?

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

HMD Global dialed in a good mixture of features and performance in the Nokia XR20 though it is not without its faults. The basic design is solid with appealing looks and capable hardware. Its MIL-STD 810H and IP68 ratings ensure that the phone handles a fair amount of abuse in unforgiving environments — and it lived up to that in our testing. The large display is bright and contrasty with the benefit of Gorilla Glass Victus protecting it. Other essentials including excellent battery life rapid charging speeds solid 5G wireless support and extra loud speakers round out the experience.

We didn’t expect the Nokia XR20’s camera to deliver pure gold results but we were hoping for sharper more colorful images especially considering there aren’t extra sensors for specialist workers. Perhaps most importantly the entry-level processor while enough to handle everyday tasks might slow down with age and software updates over time.

The Nokia XR20 is a relatable ruggedized smartphone that doesn’t look out of place in the boardroom or the boondocks.

All that said none of the rugged phones tested by Android Authority covers everything perfectly. Each has pros and cons that you have to weigh before making a purchase. The Cat S62 Pro ($649) is an excellent full-fledged rugged device with extras like a FLIR heat camera but you’ll pay for that specialization. Similarly the Kyocera DuraForce Ultra ($899) is a chunker of a device with better performance specs but a higher price tag to match and questionable software support. The Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro ($499) is the closest to the Nokia XR20 in terms of price features and design but packs an even more underpowered chipset.

The Nokia XR20 is a relatable ruggedized smartphone that doesn’t look out of place in the boardroom or the boondocks. If you want a normal-looking phone with excellent battery life that happens to be tough the XR20 covers the bases well. If you’re looking for camera extras better performance or an even more durable build take a look at the competition first.

""New World""/Amazon Game Studios



Amazon has struggled for years to break into the lucrative video game business.

That isn't stopping games VP Christoph Hartmann who has some very ambitious plans for the future.

Hartmann believes Amazon is capable of producing several landmark franchises in the next decade.

Visit the Business section of Insider for more stories.

Did you know that Amazon one of the biggest companies in the world launched and folded a big-budget video game last year?

The game was called ""Crucible"" and you're forgiven if this is the first you're hearing about it. Despite being free to play and available on the world's largest gaming platform Steam ""Crucible"" quickly came and went from the top-100 chart. And after years of development and tens of millions of dollars Amazon quietly killed ""Crucible"" five months after it came out.

It was emblematic of Amazon's years-long struggle to break into the lucrative video game market from its failed set-top box project to its current totally under-the-radar video game streaming service Amazon Luna.

That history going back to at least 2014 isn't deterring Amazon Gaming VP Christoph Hartmann.

""My personal goal is to create 2-3 AAA live-service games which capture millions of players and stay in the market for 10+ years"" Hartmann told The Verge in a recent interview.

That is a highly ambitious goal and one that few game makers manage to accomplish. There are only so many games like ""League of Legends"" and ""Overwatch.""

A screenshot from ""Overwatch 2"" the sequel to the long-running multiplayer shooter franchise from Blizzard Entertainment.

Blizzard Entertainment



He has reason to be optimistic: Amazon's latest game ""New World"" saw a very positive reception in a beta.

But Amazon is still miles away from the kind of games that Hartmann is talking about – games like ""Destiny"" and ""Fortnite"" that not only attract millions of players but also operate as ongoing ""live-service"" worlds with evolving content.

Those types of games are rare in the video game industry.

One of the industry's most prominent examples is ""Grand Theft Auto V"" which has crossed three console generations and continues to pull in millions of players despite having launched way back in 2013. Primarily through its multiplayer service ""Grand Theft Auto Online"" millions of people continue to engage with the eight-year-old game.

Hartmann's previous employer Take-Two Interactive publishes ""Grand Theft Auto V"" and the ""NBA 2K"" franchise – two games that operate as live services – so he assuredly knows just how difficult those types of games are to build.

It's an especially fraught proposition at Amazon given both the company's history in gaming and the fact that Amazon isn't fundamentally a video game company. Amazon is an ecommerce company a web storage company and a supermarket chain owner. It's even a major Hollywood production house at this point.







But outside of owning video game streaming service Twitch Amazon isn't really focused on the video game business. It's one of many things that Amazon does.

Hartmann appears to be aware of the issue and steadfast in his grand ambitions.

""At the beginning they tried to replicate the formula which made Amazon great"" he said. ""But making games is so much more complicated than it seems.""

Steel City Interactive may be seeking to add him to its anticipated boxing game. Per Lennox Lewis’ official Twitter account Lewis’ party is “Working on it. Almost there.” Accordingly Lewis could potentially join an impressive ESBC roster of over 150 fighters.

Details On ESBC and Lennox Lewis

Lewis competed from 1989 to 2003 with a record of 41 wins and 2 losses. 32 wins came by way of knockout. He is an orthodox fighter from London England and is nicknamed “The Lion.” Continuing the former undisputed heavyweight champion fought Evander Holyfield two times and defeated Mike Tyson in 2002. The six-foot-five boxer is regarded as one of the best heavyweight boxers of all time.

Previously Lewis made appearances for sports gaming in the Fight Night series. If the former champion does make an appearance in ESBC Ten24 Studios will take the lead role in scanning him into the game; Ten24 is a development studio specializing in face and body scans. Moreover ESBC’s reported intent to add Lewis is aligned with SCI’s track record of signing global boxing icons for the upcoming fight title.

ESBC’s roster is headlined by Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. The full roster can be found here. If ESBC can add Lennox Lewis to the roster the legitimacy of the upcoming indie boxing game will only grow.",,,,,,,,,

Developer Livv will start work on its Henderson luxury community Neo in October. This artist's rendering shows what the home will look like. (Livv )

A developer has announced plans for two luxury housing communities— one starting this fall in Henderson and another planned for 2022 in the southwest valley — as the demand for luxury new homes continues to escalate and builders are trying to capitalize on that demand.

The developer Livv even has plans to give buyers a Model 3 Tesla electric car which retails for about $40000 — building on its brand concept of smart and sustainable homes.

The timing is perfect.

Las Vegas-based Home Builders Research released data this week that shows luxury new-home closings of $1 million and higher rose 57 percent through August compared to 2020. There were 275 new home closings of $1 million and more during the first eight months of the year. There were 100 fewer through August 2020. In 2019 there 183 through the first eight months.

Calculating home closings of $750000 and above there were 635 through August. That’s 63 percent higher than the 389 in the first eight months of 2020. There were 450 closings of $750000 and above through August 2019 according to Home Builders Research.

Livv is spearheaded by Philippe Ziade the CEO of Growth Holdings which does business as Growth Luxury Homes.

It built the new $4.3 million home for Raiders head coach Jon Gruden in Southern Highlands. The co-founder is tech entrepreneur Alex Bouzari CEO at DataDirect Networks in Beverly Hills which touts the company as the world’s largest privately held information storage.

Livv’s Henderson project called Neo has government entitlements and has the ability to move forward. A second development called Magnus in the southwest valley hasn’t received its entitlements from Clark County and that process isn’t expected to be completed until next spring at the earliest.

Neo is on 60 acres and is adjacent to MacDonald Highlands southeast of Horizon Ridge Parkway and Stephanie Street according to Steve Escalante vice president of business development with Growth Holdings who has a similar title with Livv.

Livv has a dozen communities combined under planning and development in the U.S. Europe and the Middle East.

“It’s a brand new segment and brand that we will be taking nationally and looking at markets like Phoenix California Colorado Texas Florida and North Carolina” Escalante said. “Right now Vegas is going to be the flagship. This is the marriage of technology and real estate and taking it to the next level. These are Tesla-powered homes that are going to be net-zero positive-energy communities. It’s building a sustainable lifestyle and sustainable footprint.”

The founders wanted to shatter the status quo of how so-called luxury custom homes have been built for decades — too expensive inefficient in energy usage rigid and costly to maintain

“Livv embodies a philosophy and corporate culture that believes in breaking antiquated paradigms of technology in real estate development to further advance the living experience” Escalante said. “There has been so much advancement in technology and real estate currently is so far away from its potential. We consider ourselves tech and real estate trailblazers. Livv is a technology company that will not only set the bar of where real estate development should be today but where it will be tomorrow. It’s powered by AI (artificial intelligence). That’s the whole concept of what we’re doing.”

The plan calls for 84 home sites in the hillside guard-gated community where prices will start at $2.3 million and escalate to about $4 million. The semi-custom homes will be one and two stories and range in size from 3600 square feet to 5000 square feet with either three-car or five-car garages. There will be three to four bedrooms.

“They will have phenomenal unobstructed views of the Strip and city and mountains” Escalante said. “It’s panoramic. it’s beautiful.”

There are seven floor plans from which to choose with interior styles that range from “Euro chic bohemian and ultra modern.” Grading is scheduled to start in October. Deposits of $25000 are being taken for lots with closings set to begin in November and December with home deliveries in the fall of 2022.

The southwest valley development in the Rainbow Boulevard and Wigwam Parkway has about 37 acres with 94 semi-custom homes planned starting at $1.3 million to $2.8 million. Sizes haven’t been finalized but are expected to be between 3000 square feet and 4500 square feet for homes both one and two stories.

Escalante said it’s a great time to launch the development given the strong luxury market with new and existing homes and a lack of inventory to meet buyer’s demands.

“There’s a lack of inventory in the market but beyond inventory is the type people are looking for” Escalante said. “It’s going to serve a huge demand. This is filling a niche and providing a very high-level and high-end finishes and semi-custom niche. It’s going to have a custom-home feel through homes with the details going into the ceiling heights and hallways and so forth. It’s definitely something that’s unique. We want the consumer to feel like ‘hey I’m getting a $6 million or $7 million home for $2.5 million. That’s the feeling when you want to walk through the door with a Livv community.”

Escalante said their brand is technology driven and will evolve as technology evolves. There will be a lot of AI installed where the home gets to know the owner he said.

“There are sensors that exist but a lot of real estate developers aren’t technology people and a lot of technology people aren’t real estate developers. That’s why there’s such a big gap. This brand is bridging the gap between technology and bringing real estate into the next century.”

Escalante said the technology goes beyond controlling the home by the palm of your hand. It includes building management systems and efficiencies.

Livv optimizes lighting modes climate control curtain and shade settings intelligently delivers music movies and games when and where you want them and keeps your home low maintenance and fully sustainable Escalante said. Its smart security management provides child protection and pet safety indoors and outdoors he said.

“For example if you’re not in the house it will know you’re not there so why is the electricity or water running”

Escalante said. “It’s all about being sustainable. It has to react a certain way when you are there and a certain way when you are not there. This has to happen passively without you clicking a button. It’s the same for sensors in the house for particles in the air that cause allergies. The home should know what pollen you are allergic to and filter that so it’s a healthier environment. That’s how a home should work. it won’t just be wired for lighting or Cat 5 but the home will essentially have a brain. Once you live in the home it’s going to get smarter and smarter because of you. You’re waking up and do you want your cup of coffee today or do you want the air conditioning at this time. it’s having smart engagement with your home. This is where we see the future going in homes.”

As technology evolves homes will get an update just as happens with a Tesla model. It’s more than what people get today Escalante said.

As for the Tesla coming with the house Escalante said it fits the lifestyle.

“If you drive this car this is the type of home you should live in and if you live in this type of home you should be driving electric” Escalante said. “It’s reinforcing the whole concept.”

Escalante said Livv is creating a portal where buyers can build their own home like they do when picking a car. The consumer will pick their model finishes options garage sizes gym flooring wine cellar or next-gen setup. As they make modifications they will see their price.

There will be plush organic fabrics luxurious stones and marble custom wood floorings metal accents handcrafted cabinetry sophisticated fixtures precious inlays — all created designed and handpicked by their international design team to complement and enhance the home’s architecture setting and community Escalante said. Livv will be using European-designed stone marble and cabinetry for better quality he added.

“Even though it’s semi-custom essentially it could be customized in so many different ways and make it unique” Escalante said. “It’s not just the shape of the home but the design and style. We understand everybody lives differently and has different styles and we wanted to bring to the market three distinct styles to appeal to a broader audience.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8yNS90ZXNsYS1hcHBsaWVzLWEtZ2FtaWZpY2F0aW9uLXN0cmF0ZWd5LXRvLXNhZmUtZHJpdmluZy_SAV9odHRwczovL2NsZWFudGVjaG5pY2EuY29tLzIwMjEvMDkvMjUvdGVzbGEtYXBwbGllcy1hLWdhbWlmaWNhdGlvbi1zdHJhdGVneS10by1zYWZlLWRyaXZpbmcvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Applies A Gamification Strategy To Safe Driving,"Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

Tesla has released its Safety Score Beta system a system for assessing driving behavior and including a gamification element. Gamification usually refers to a marketing strategy — for example getting points for shopping at your favorite stores or coffee places. Whether it’s Uber Gold or Starbucks Stars the goal is to encourage you to spend more money to receive more points.

Tesla has taken this technique and applied it to safe driving and I think this is brilliant. This will encourage Tesla owners to become safer drivers and reward them with a high score.

How Tesla Determines Your Safety Score

Tesla will assess the behaviors of its FSD Beta drivers based on 5 safety factors. Then these will be combined to estimate the degree to which an FSD Beta driver’s driving could result in a future collision. Tesla will combine the daily Safety scores of up to 30 days to calculate the aggregated Safety Score.

In order to determine this it uses the Predicted Collision Frequency (PCF) formula to predict how many collisions may occur per 1 million miles driving based on the driving behaviors measured by an FSD Beta driver’s Tesla vehicle. An example of the PCF formula is below:

Tesla explained that the formula was derived based on statistical modeling using 6 billion miles of fleet data and that it will expect to make changes to the formal in the future as more customer and data insights are gained. The PCF is converted into a 0–100 Safety Score using another formula Safety Score = 115.382324 − 22.526504 x PCF.

The Safety Score will be displayed on the main “Safety Score” screen of the Tesla app and Tesla added that it intends to provide drivers transparency and feedback on their driving behaviors with the score. The five safety factors that impact a driver’s safety score are:

Forward collision warnings per 1000 miles. Hard braking. Aggressive turning. Unsafe following. Forced Autopilot Disengagement.

Tesla also provided tips on how to improve your Safety Score in each of the categories and also has an FAQ section here.

To answer that question he handed the Model S Plaid over to professional driver Kai Goddarn and as the car delivers no less than 1020 hp it should come as no surprise that it is possible to kick out the tail of it and this is made especially easy when the traction control system isn’t working. However actually holding a drift proved difficult to Goddarn because of the yoke.

While you may be sick of hearing about all the criticisms leveled against Tesla’s controversial decision to eliminate a traditional steering wheel and replace it with a yoke it’s hard to refute the fact that it makes drifting much more difficult.

Throughout the video Goddarn can be seen altering his driving style to work with the yoke but finds his hands in all manner of weird orientations as he tries to keep the Model S under control. If the car had a standard steering wheel we’re sure he would have been able to hold some impressive powerslides without issue. Good thing then that Tesla is offering it for those who’d rather not have the yoke."

However AR is finding a lot of applications outside of this including on your smartphone and even in your automobile.

Automotive AR heads-up displays (AR HUDs) are a key area of interest and research with many companies working to bring the technology to life. Last week two advances for the field were released one from Huawei and one from Infineon.

This article will dive into some challenges facing this new technology and what companies like Huawei and Infineon are bringing to the table.

Challenges with AR HUD

From an optical and electrical engineering perspective AR HUDs pose some significant design challenges.

One of the major challenges here is processing and graphics alignment. An AR HUD is a technology that aims to read in data from various onboard sensors which then processes that data generates it and finally displays graphics aligned with the rapidly changing environment all in real-time.

Doing all of this requires processing hardware like GPUs high-resolution display technologies adjustable mirrors for directing light eye-tracking cameras to follow the user and much more. On top of this things need to be integrated into a space-constrained fashion to fit in the dashboard.

A second design challenge is power consumption. In a HUD the lumens required are directly proportional to the field of view (FOV) and eyebox area (i.e. doubling either will require double the lumens). This challenge poses a tradeoff as a large eyebox area and wide FOV are desirable; however they come at the cost of increased power consumption and corresponding thermal challenges. This tradeoff has created the need for efficient imaging technology of which digital light processing (DLP) technology has become very popular.

Despite these challenges as the movement grows for AR HUD more companies are trying to find ways to make this technology a firmer reality.

Infineon’s AR HUD Chipset

In an effort for smaller and more efficient imaging systems Infineon released a new MEMS scanner chipset.

The new chipset integrates both a MEMS mirror and MEMS driver which allows the device to come in a small footprint and low power. Further the chipset integrates a novel tilting mirror which Infineon says could pave the way for entirely new laser beam scanner (LBS) technology.

Altogether the chipset hopes to enable AR micro-projectors which are small light in weight and low power. This would allow for more efficient imaging technology in AR HUDs for both automotive and head-mounted displays.

Infineon isn't the only company recently focusing on AR HUDs Huawei has just debuted its latest HUD technology.

Huawei’s Debuts New HUD

Last week the other big news regarding AR HUDs was Huawei’s debut of its newest automotive AR HUD solution at IAA MOBILITY 2021.

The new AR HUD offers a 13° x 5° FOV allowing for a 70-inch image to be displayed at a distance of 7.5 m in front of the driver.

Overall the system leverages a DLP technology to deliver an over 100 PPD (pixels per degree) full-HD display having a compact size of ~10 L. Further Huawei claims that its HUD uses a unique optical path design and algorithm technologies to improve image definition and eliminate dizziness caused by ghosting.

In terms of application and functionality Huawei’s HUD claims it can provide:

AR navigation information

Detection of surrounding vehicles and pedestrians

Vision augmentation in low-visibility environments (i.e. night rain)

All in all AR HUD technology is well poised to improve driver safety and reinvent how we drive our vehicles. While there are certainly challenges companies like Huawei and Infineon are working to overcome these and the results are certainly promising.

“The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining” said President John F. Kennedy in his 1962 State of the Union address. The metaphor rang true during the Cold War as an admonition to guard against complacency in times of prosperity. More broadly it registered as the kind of sensible advice that people during all times frequently ignore.

In brief The pharmaceutical sector emerged as a hero of the pandemic thanks to the rapid development and deployment of vaccines and therapies. The companies making headlines however succeeded on the backs of contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs)—the service firms that for the past 20 years have taken over much of the production and supply chain management for large drug companies and all of it for many smaller biotech firms. Read on to learn about how CDMOs’ preparedness for increased demand allowed them to withstand an early shock to the supply chain in 2020 and an extraordinary year and a half.

At its outset COVID-19 proved a case in point as a containable outbreak spread relentlessly despite years of warning from public health authorities of an imminent pandemic. Yet the crisis also went on to showcase instances of preparedness foremost of which was the rapid development and deployment of effective vaccines. The pharmaceutical industry emerged as a hero of the pandemic.

Less obvious but just as important was the rapid response of the pharmaceutical services industry which does much of the heavy lifting for drug companies working behind the scenes to coordinate the shipment of raw materials produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and formulate finished products within a complex international supply chain.

The sector had been on a 10-year profitability streak before 2020 and has done even better during the pandemic. It navigated challenges posed by COVID-19 on the strength of previous improvements to supply chain management and a yearslong campaign of diversifying services and expanding manufacturing capacity. Those proactive measures put the industry in a strong position when the storm hit early last year.

Indeed industry watchers say the drug services sector displayed enviable resilience over the past 18 months. “There were issues—I don’t think there were any questions about that. But I think we knew how to deal with it” says James Bruno president of the consulting firm Chemical and Pharmaceutical Solutions.

Unforeseen transportation holdups caused problems early on as did rattled production schedules when companies found they suddenly needed to produce large volumes of APIs such as remdesivir and dexamethasone on a very short timeline. But companies were able to work out the supply chain snags Bruno says.

Roger Laforce an industry consultant based in Switzerland notes that as vaccines advanced toward emergency approval last year several service companies often called contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) were in a position to make vaccines happen. The big Swiss firm Lonza for example relied on a 2018 investment in prebuilt manufacturing shells at its facility in Visp Switzerland to meet a tight deadline for bringing production of the active messenger RNA ingredient in Moderna’s vaccine on line.

“People who’ve invested in operational excellence—having good supply chain operations and good management practices around their inventory—have actually been able to do pretty well” says Wayne Weiner who heads the consulting firm PharmaTech Solutions. “The other thing CDMOs have done a good job at is managing protection for their workers—keeping them safe so they could actually come in and run the plants.”

The pandemic also served to illustrate a dilemma that CDMOs have been bringing to the attention of governments in the US and Europe to little avail—heavy dependence on China for antibiotics and other generic drugs. The global drug supply chain emerged as front-page news when the Donald J. Trump administration considered a “buy American” executive order for pharmaceuticals and the US government allocated funds to support domestic production of critical drugs. The European Commission also turned its attention to domesticating drug supply. And even as the Joe Biden administration attempts to undo much of the legacy of the Trump administration the focus on the drug supply chain remains.

Straight ahead Many contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) experienced strong sales growth in 2020. Almac Group 6.0% Dottikon 25% Lonza 12% Siegfried 4.5% Thermo Fisher Scientific’s laboratory product and services division 16% WuXi AppTec’s CDMO division 41% Sources: Companies that disclose sales figures.

Absorbing the shock

“The CDMO is the shock absorber for the pharmaceutical industry” says Guy Villax CEO of Hovione a Portuguese CDMO with facilities also in China the US and Ireland. “Whenever there is a problem they ask us to fix it.” When an unforeseen requirement for large-scale vaccine manufacturing emerged last year for example “the CDMOs got their act together” Villax says.

And they did so under duress. Villax says that 150 workers at Hovione facilities have tested positive for COVID-19 since the pandemic began. “Every single person has recovered” he says. There were transportation snags especially in China when the pandemic hit but those were sorted out before long.

And business is “very good” Villax says. “I remember in April and May of last year I had a torrent of calls from journalists really keen that I could give them evidence so they could write stories to show that the supply chain was a catastrophe and all the pharmacies would be empty in a short time” he says. “In fact none of that happened. I think the supply chain is somehow really resilient.”

One reason for the industry’s preparedness was its ongoing investment in new production capacity well before the pandemic hit. Hovione came into 2020 with a new research center in Lisbon Portugal and plans to open a manufacturing building in Loures Portugal with new reactor capacity Villax says. And the firm plans further capacity increases.

The Swiss CDMO Siegfried is among the firms that landed contracts serving vaccine makers. Marianne Späne chief business officer says Siegfried had to build a new production line from scratch at its site in Hameln Germany to fill and finish vials of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine.

While the company had fill-and-finish capacity “we had never done vaccines and in record time we were able to build it up to validate the process” she says. Bringing production on line was a matter of close collaboration with Pfizer and BioNTech Späne says adding that Siegfried also has a contract to provide Novavax with fill-and-finish services for the vaccine it is developing.

And as it did before the pandemic Späne says Siegfried is continually expanding capacity for small-molecule drug manufacturing at all its sites—in Switzerland Germany France Spain the US and China—often by debottlenecking or streamlining processes to increase output.

The CDMO is the shock absorber for the pharmaceutical industry. Whenever there is a problem they ask us to fix it. Guy Villax CEO Hovione

“Our supply chain is pretty stable at the moment” Späne says. “But that is because we had already been working on stability of the supply chain for 2 years” before the pandemic. The firm’s approach has been to establish multiple sources of starting materials to reduce dependence on Asia.

Markus Blocher CEO of Dottikon Exclusive Synthesis another Swiss CDMO says the sector was well prepared for shocks to the supply chain before the pandemic. “We started 5 years ago” he says detailing capacity expansion in response to the influx of new business from biotechnology companies and a steady migration of drug company contracts from Chinese manufacturers to European ones.

“Environmental policy became more strict in China and a shutdown of producers started 7 years ago” Blocher recalls. CDMOs in Europe responded to a loss of supply of intermediates from China by diversifying sources. “With COVID-19 coming in the industry was prepared” he says. “There was already a plan B.”

Unlike Siegfried’s approach Dottikon’s strategy is to operate entirely at one location—in Dottikon Switzerland where the company is at the beginning of a 7-year $700 million expansion project. Dottikon’s sales increased 25% in the fiscal year that ended in March and Blocher says the expansion could triple the company’s revenue by the time it’s done.

Dottikon’s one-site philosophy may be reflected in Blocher’s preference for keeping full staff on-site throughout the pandemic. The efficiency of virtual interaction is illusory Blocher argues. “If you are in an airplane and flying above the clouds the weather is always nice” he says. “In the next 1 to 2 years companies that have had their employees scattered at home and in different places will realize their strategy and their plans are not on the right track.”

Aslam Malik CEO of SK Pharmteco says business was “outstanding” last year with 25% sales growth. And 2021 is looking even better. The company’s efforts to establish a global service operation proved crucial to its performance during the pandemic he says.

“Things don’t happen overnight” says Malik former CEO of Ampac Fine Chemicals which the South Korean firm SK Holdings acquired in 2018 and then made part of SK Pharmteco. Through a series of acquisitions by Ampac and SK Holdings in recent years Pharmteco has amassed assets in the US (in Virginia Texas California) Ireland and South Korea. Most recently SK acquired a cell and gene therapy company in France and folded it into Pharmteco.

Pharmteco is also expanding across its facilities building a plant in South Korea a cell and gene therapy facility in France and two API production lines in California. The company is adding a kilogram-scale lab at its plant in Petersburg Virginia. The plant will also produce APIs in a partnership called Phlow that launched last year with $354 million in US government funding to manufacture medicines at risk of shortages.

“The sector was prepared to take on this stuff” Malik says. “The pharmaceutical industry showed who we are.”

Almac Sciences had modest growth in the fiscal year ending this month says Denis Geffroy vice president of business development for APIs and analytical services but he sees improvement ahead. “We expect double-digit growth next year” he says. “We’re very busy so far—our biggest limitation is capacity as it has been for the last 2 or 3 years.”

The company is about to open an expansion at its headquarters in Craigavon Northern Ireland and it is building another plant next door—a $30 million investment that will increase capacity threefold Geffroy says.

Almac Sciences and its sister division Almac Clinical Services have over the past year picked up business with customers working on COVID-19-related therapies. “At one point we had 50 different projects in one shape or another” Geffroy says. “Some very small lab-scale research; some bigger in clinical supply. I think most of the CDMOs have had to play a role to support all these pharma companies looking for extremely fast solutions.”

Mark Griffiths CEO of the Swiss firm Carbogen Amcis says the biggest supply chain challenges occurred in the company’s business of producing finished drugs because of a COVID-19-related spike in demand for materials. “Go try to buy 2R glass vials. You have to purchase them 2 years in advance” he says. The chemical manufacturing side of the business though has weathered the storm.

“I think the pandemic has taught us one thing” Griffiths says “which is to put the same amount of effort into ensuring you have some basic commodities that you would put into making sure you have a drug intermediate. Attention to detail is I think what it’s taught us.”

Customer flexibility

Andreas Meudt vice president of exclusive synthesis at Evonik Industries says his company managed to get through the disruption to the supply chain in 2020 only with a great deal of effort and heightened coordination of production schedules with customers.

“From one day to the next we had severe issues with getting raw materials from qualified suppliers and then there is the significant impact of being able to deliver the final API on time” Meudt says. “That is something we had to spend a lot of time and effort on because in some cases there was only a very short list of raw material suppliers.”

The pressure was even higher when Evonik was the only qualified API supplier for a customer. “We had to qualify completely new suppliers in record time to be able to deliver” Meudt says. Evonik managed to solve problems and make deliveries Meudt says and the company ended up with a more stable supplier base as it qualified new sources of raw materials.

Conditions have improved Meudt says. And the past year and a half has brought a welcome increase in customer flexibility and willingness to plan ahead. “People have learned their lesson and are willing to commit contractually earlier” he says. “In the old days you had 9 months for production. Now you have 12 to 15.”

Citing increased demand for local production Evonik announced last year that it would spend $27 million to increase its capacity to make APIs and advanced intermediates at its sites in Dossenheim and Hanau Germany. The company also increased lipid production in Germany to supply raw materials needed for the lipid nanoparticles that deliver the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine. “This was done in a record time only months after getting the order” Meudt says.

Michael Stanek head of commercial operations for small-molecule APIs at Thermo Fisher Scientific agrees that the pandemic brought increased collaboration with customers. “The most important things we learned are that the global ecosystem is much more resilient and clients more flexible than we’d thought” Stanek says. “Clients are willing to do their part to contribute to the global scale-up for COVID-19.”

Stanek says Thermo Fisher’s capacity expansions and establishment of second sources of supply for chemicals made in Asia predated the pandemic but were the keys to getting through the past 18 months. “You have to look to the future” he says. “You have to plan for the worst case before it happens.”

At the Italian CDMO Flamma Kenneth Drew vice president of North American business development says the company is operating at peak capacity and requires long lead times. Capacity is generally tight in the sector and many drug companies are learning the hard way about the plant scheduling concerns of their contractors and the need for flexibility.

CDMOs have been taking a close look at their sources of supply and at their customers’ requirements over the past 18 months Drew says. And they have been reacting quickly. Last year when Gilead Sciences asked Flamma to supply two intermediates for the antiviral remdesivir that it had manufactured in 2015 during the Ebola outbreak capacity was tight Drew says. But Flamma was able to reschedule other contracts and begin work on the intermediates in a matter of weeks.

From Asia to the world

Asian CDMOs say they have managed well during the pandemic despite efforts in Europe and the US to domesticate supply. Recognizing the trend though they have been working to globalize operations to better serve Western markets.

Porton Pharma Solutions based in Chongqing China began establishing itself as an international service supplier with the 2017 purchase of J-Star Research a contract research firm in South Plainfield New Jersey. Porton has since invested $20 million in the site adding a kilo lab and crystallization services and doubling the staff to about 110 CEO Oliver Ju says. Porton plans to spend another $50 million on a pilot-scale plant at a site it opened in Cranbury New Jersey shortly after purchasing J-Star.

Porton is also scouting for opportunities to build or acquire assets in Europe Ju says.

WuXi STA the CDMO division of the big Chinese drug services firm WuXi AppTec continued its international expansion program with the acquisition of a finished-drug production site in Couvet Switzerland earlier this year and the recent announcement that it would build an API manufacturing facility in Middletown Delaware. That plant is scheduled to open in 2024 and expected to create about 1000 jobs. Despite the pandemic the company managed to complete projects and start new work on drugs under development for COVID-19 says Minzhang Chen co-CEO of WuXi AppTec.

And the Chinese market remains strong Chen says. The company recently broke ground on a project to expand API production in Taixing China and opened a finished-drug formulation R&D center in Wuxi China. Large-scale peptide plants are planned for Changzhou and Taixing over the next 2 years.

The Indian firm Sai Life Sciences is in the middle of a $150 million investment cycle that includes a new research center in Hyderabad India. The company achieved sales growth of about 30% last year according to CEO Krishna Kanumuri.

Sai has picked up work related to COVID-19 therapies and vaccines including adjuvant and lipid production Kanumuri says. And the company plans to increase capacity to keep up with a steady growth in customers. Sai added twice as may customers in 2020 as it did the year before he says.

Drug companies’ efforts to move production out of China or establish alternate sources of supply work in India’s favor given capacity constraints outside China says Kanumuri. “You go where the capacity is” he says. “If Europe is full you go to India.”

Hikal another Indian CDMO achieved 19% revenue growth last year according to Manoj Mehrotra president of the company’s pharmaceutical business. Hikal is investing $50 million in an expansion that by 2024 should increase the company’s capacity by about 40% over 2020 levels.

The company is experiencing a lag in supply of raw materials from China Mehrotra acknowledges. Shipping lines are still disrupted because of COVID-19-related port shutdowns and typical 25-day delivery times have been extended to 6 weeks Mehrotra says. “But we have dual sourcing for most of our intermediates” he says.

The new normal

Managers across the CDMO sector note that the pandemic is not over yet and that the postpandemic “new normal” is still not in focus. Questions remain about the legacy of a year and a half of virtual business communication. And government efforts to secure local supply chains for critical drugs will continue.

The Biden administration outlined actions it will take to secure supplies to key sectors of the economy including the pharmaceutical and API sectors in a review released earlier this year. Echoing themes from the previous administration the review notes that China and India control a substantial swath of the US drug supply chain.

The administration announced that the US Department of Health and Human Services will establish a public-private consortium for manufacturing essential medicines. The consortium will begin by selecting 50–100 drugs from the US Food and Drug Administration’s essential medicines list as priorities for reshoring.

Despite lingering uncertainties CDMO managers agree that the current situation is familiar enough to be characterized as business as usual—with a number of improvements especially in the arenas of supply chain management and customer engagement.

Dottikon’s Blocher says the pandemic heightened public and government understanding of the drug supply chain and the geopolitical balance between China and US and its allies.

Hovione’s Villax concurs that the world has become much more aware of how the pharmaceutical industry is structured and operates. As 2020 and early 2021 played out he says the sector’s pandemic response provided a reputational boost. “For years we were worse than oil and gas and the lawyers” Villax says. “I think maybe we’ve got a better reputation now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMzc4NTE3MzIxMDA4MjE40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Risk analysis of leachables in cell and gene therapy using a CAR-T model process,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378517321008218 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMzc4NTE3MzIxMDA4MjE40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Sept. 25 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Farm Aid 2021 marked the organization's return to a live festival today highlighting farmers who have withstood economic operational and policy challenges and stand determined to create a better farm and food system — one that embraces diversity sustains our natural resources and nourishes generations to come.

""So much has changed since we last gathered at Farm Aid in 2019"" said Farm Aid President and Founder Willie Nelson. ""We've all seen the pain brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic but our family farmers endured growing the food we needed and offering solutions that are so essential to our country.""

At a virtual town hall gathering Friday U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Tina Smith (D-MN) the Agriculture Commissioners of Connecticut Massachusetts and New York along with farmers partners and other policymakers kicked off the festival weekend with a robust discussion about core issues including corporate concentration and consolidation racial equity debt relief and climate change.

Nelson was joined Saturday on the Farm Aid stage by fellow board members John Mellencamp Dave Matthews and Margo Price along with Tyler Childers Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats Bettye LaVette Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real Jamey Johnson Allison Russell Particle Kid Ian Mellencamp the Wisdom Indian Dancers and the Horse Hill Singers who donated their time and talents for the nearly 10-hour show. On the video screens festivalgoers were introduced to farmers from the Northeast and beyond who represent the diverse people and practices that make up a healthy sustainable agricultural system. Featured farmers include immigrants who are finding innovative ways to access land and farm in community with each other; producers using regenerative practices to build soil and teach new generations to find joy in working the land; and entrepreneurs creating new paths to build local and regional food systems.

Throughout the day artists and farmers joined together on the FarmYard stage to discuss challenges and opportunities in agriculture including Black land loss climate change and the solutions that family farmers bring to the table and the day-to-day realities of being a farmer in an increasingly-consolidated farm and food system. Farm Aid reaffirmed its solidarity with BIPOC farmers who are advocating for fairness across the system and highlighted the innovative progress in agriculture in the Northeast including local and regional food systems organic production and regenerative agricultural methods that mitigate climate change and build soil.

Farm Aid's HOMEGROWN Village featured hands-on activities to celebrate the culture of agriculture and give festivalgoers a chance to meet farmers in person and learn how they enrich our soil protect our water grow our economy and bring us good food for good health. Local and national organizations participated and attendees learned about gleaning and re-localizing food systems in the United States to prevent avoidable food waste; discovered Connecticut local farms markets and farm products; and tested their food and farm knowledge in a game while learning about the dangers of corporate consolidation.

Farm Aid's trademarked HOMEGROWN Concessions® offered food with ingredients produced by family farmers who utilize ecological practices and are paid a fair price for their products. Legends Hospitality local community vendors and Farm Aid's perennial food suppliers served menu items showcasing Connecticut and the region's outstanding farms. Food choices included local fish and chips crispy oyster tostadas hot dogs and sausages from Meatworks of southern New England roasted brussels sprouts beet sandwiches portobello burgers grass-fed beef burgers stuffed sweet potatoes with local smoked beef brisket pretzels made with organic flour grains beans and greens bowls plank fries and chicken tenders with homemade sauces and much more. Vendors brought local flavors including Soul de Cuba Café Whey Station Villa of Lebanon DORO Restaurant Group Maple Valley Creamery and Ben & Jerry's.

Restrictions linked to the on-going coronavirus pandemic have devastated the taxi industry in Thailand. Many drivers left big cities to return to the villages they come from so one Bangkok-based taxi company has transformed its fleet of idle cars into a giant vegetable garden.

""This is our last option. We need to grow vegetables on the roof of these taxis. We still have loans on some taxis sometimes amounting to [about $21000] that we took out in 2019 or 2020. These cars are just sitting here so we figured we'd grow vegetables on them"" explained Thapakorn Assawalertkun the man who helps run the vegetable-growing Ratchaphruek Taxi Cooperative in an interview with France 24.

Bangkok's taxi companies are heavily dependent on tourism and the industry stalled as restrictions kept travelers at home throughout most of 2020. Some countries are gradually easing coronavirus-related travel bans but the recovery has been slow and many drivers left to find work elsewhere usually in the countryside. Assawalertkun said that the remaining employees all contributed money to start the garden.

The taxi fleet in Bangkok primarily consists of late-model Toyota sedans. Workers turned a Camry into a garden by spreading a plastic tarp over a bamboo frame and placing it on a flat panel like the hood and the roof. Their crops include chili peppers eggplants and zucchini. They're raising frogs as well; putting an old tire on a tarp and filling it with water creates a makeshift aquarium that frogs can develop in.

Vegetables grown and frogs raised by the taxi company will be used to feed its employees. Assawalertkun hopes to sell the surplus to local food markets to help keep his company and its workers afloat until tourism resumes. In the meantime the garden keeps everyone occupied.

""You know from a young age I kind of knew that that isn't something we're going to be able to experience.""



""You never thought that that would happen"" said Caleb's mom Janet Trimble.



Caleb and his brother Jacob are taking their unique relationship to the field this year.



""We thought about it; and we're like you know what let's get him on the team let's get him a jersey"" said Pendragon's football coach Cody Volk.



It's something the Trimble family never thought was possible because Jacob is autistic.



""Never thought you see him standing on the sidelines so it's just a true blessing for our family"" said Janet.



Pender Public Schools paraprofessional Kim Hofmeister works with Jacob and was a big reason he's able to help out on the team.



""Just being able to interact with the kids the kids acknowledging him that helps out a lot"" said Hofmeister.



Though the gear and manager title are perks of the position being on the team with his brother is the best part.



""Still have that really good brotherhood with him even though we can't communicate you know probably like most brothers could.""



A bond years in the making.



""You could always tell that Jacob relied on Caleb that he was his security blanket"" said Janet.



""A lot of people can't understand him but living with it at home and stuff I'm able to pick up on his tendencies and stuff"" said Caleb. ""You know I understand him amazing. I know exactly what he's thinking at all times.""



This is Caleb's last year in Pender before college.



""I know he's definitely going to miss his big brother"" said Janet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8yNDA2NjkzL2Fncml0ZWNoLW1hcmtldC1tYXktc2VlLWEtYmlnLW1vdmUtZ2FtYXlhLXdlZmFybS1taWNyb3NvZnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Agritech Market May See A Big Move | Gamaya Wefarm Microsoft,"Agritech Market May See A Big Move | Gamaya Wefarm Microsoft

GREENSBORO N.C. — North Carolina A&T football fans filled Truist Stadium Saturday for the team's first home game in nearly two years after the 2020 season was canceled; but before entering the game zone fans had to show proof of a COVID-19 vaccination or a negative PCR COVID-19 test.

“This was the first run. So far so good from what I’ve seen what I’ve observed. It seems like it was great"" said Teresa Davis the Associate Vice Chancellor for Alumni Relations at NC A&T. ""We had a great communication plan getting the information out to everyone as they prepare to enter the game zone.""

Fans were required to go to one of the 14 verification check stations on campus to show their vaccination card or proof that they received a negative COVID-19 test result within 72 hours of the game. They were then given a wristband to enter the stadium.

""It was very efficient"" said student Amber Artis ""and it’s kind of keeping everybody safe and at the same time having fun.""

NC A&T reported fourteen positive covid-19 cases among students between September 17th and 23rd. Seventeen students have tested positive in September so far. The school also requires masks indoors but they are only recommended outdoors. For on-campus students or those who take at least one in-person class COVID-19 vaccination or regular testing is required.

""I feel like we're doing good"" said student Halle Turner. ""I'm a vaccinated kind of girl. It's free! Why not do it? And It's better for everybody! Why not get it?""

NC A&T students like Turner were ready to be out and cheering on their team as they faced off against North Carolina Central University.

""It’s been 700 plus days since we’ve been in the stadium and it’s so exciting to see everybody out here"" said student Logan Thomas. ""The energy is up the sun is out.""

University leadership was also out enjoying Saturday's game.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1sYi5jb20vYnJhdmVzL3ZpZGVvL2JyYXZlcy12cy1wYWRyZXMtaGlnaGxpZ2h0cy14MjE2NtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Braves vs. Padres Highlights | 09/26/2021 | Atlanta Braves,"add-reel-260502 Reels share-square-2-260503 Share

The Texas offense could not be stopped especially in the first half when all five Longhorn drives resulted in touchdowns. Four of the five drives were 75 yards or longer and Texas averaged 7.7 yards a play.

At the end of the game the Longhorn offense put up 63 points and 639 yards in the 70-35 win over Texas Tech Saturday at Royal-Memorial Stadium.

The Texas defense contributed to the point total with a first-half pick-six off of Texas Tech starting quarterback Tyler Shough. Shough was injured on the play and back up Henry Colombi played well leading the Red Raiders to 28 points while he was in the game.

Takeaways from today's game:

Bijan Robinson should be a top Heisman candidate

The sophomore from Arizona topped the 100-yard total offense mark by the middle of the second quarter. After scoring the Longhorns' first touchdown with a 38-yard pitch and catch on fourth down Robinson dazzled the home crowd with bursts in the hole spin moves and showed his strength with a couple stiff-arms.

By halftime Robinson had 150 yards off of offense and one lead block on a Roschon Johnson wildcat keeper for the last score of the first half.

Robinson's final numbers on the day: 18 rushes for 137 yards plus two catches for 54 yards and one touchdown.

It was the sixth time in the past eight games that Robinson has rushed for more than 100 yards.

Casey Thompson sealed his name as the starter for the season

The redshirt sophomore from Oklahoma had his first start of his career last week versus Rice which offered no resistance to the Longhorns in the 58-0 rout. Thompson looked comfortable all afternoon for Texas versus Tech going through his progressions sometimes hitting his third or fourth read. When a play broke down in the second quarter he picked up 11 yards on a third-and-7.

Thompson made a mistake in the third quarter – throwing an interception in the end zone on a covered Jordan Whittington but other than that he played a clean game and seems to have a grasp of Sarkisian's potent offense.

Thompson completed 18 of 23 passes for 303 yards and five touchdowns. He gave way to back up Hudson Card at the end of the third quarter with the game out of hand.

Longhorns' offensive line is going to be OK

After not being able to move an Arkansas defensive front three weeks ago in Fayetteville Casey Thompson and all of the Texas running backs looked really comfortable behind the starting five of Christian Jones Jake Majors Denzel Okafor Junior Angilau and Derek Kerstetter.

In run blocking Texas bulled its way to 336 yards 137 of them coming from Robinson. Johnson finished with 64 and two touchdowns. And this was all done against a Red Raider defense that had only been giving up 57 yards per game coming into the matchup.

Thompson had ample time to find his second and third reads during most passing plays.

Up next for Texas football

TCU.

Last year's 33-31 loss to the Horned Frogs at DKR sent the Longhorns spinning. Texas was ranked ninth in the country heading into that game but dropped to No. 22 the following week. Keaontay Ingram infamously fumbled the ball at TCU's goal line with 2:32 left essentially sealing Texas' fate; he eventually lost his starting job to Robinson and then transferred to USC. And Texas followed this heartbreak with an even bigger heartbreak the following week an overtime loss to Oklahoma.

It's another 11 a.m. kickoff next Saturday at venerable Amon G. Carter Stadium in Forth Worth — where Texas hasn't won since Mack Brown's final season. Texas is 1-6 vs. TCU since that 2013 win including three straight losses in Fort Worth.

It'll be on ABC again as well. Other Big 12 matchups: Kansas at Iowa State Oklahoma at Kansas State Texas Tech at West Virginia and Baylor at Oklahoma State.

Texcetera

Former Manor running back Tahj Brooks picked up an injury and was not able to play for Texas Tech in his homecoming to Austin. He was the Red Raiders' leading rusher after three games.

Josh Thompson's touchdown was also Texas' first pick-six for a touchdown since DeShon Elliott went the other way against Baylor in October 2017.

How the scoring went:

1st quarter — Texas 14 Texas Tech 0

Texas: After receiving the opening kick off and driving to the the Texas Tech's 38-yard line through a variety of passes coach Steve Sarkisian called Bijan Robinson's number on fourth-and-4. Robinson caught a swing route and went the distance. Quarterback Casey Thompson had 77 yards passing on the drive.

Texas: Ground and pound for Texas' second scoring drive. After a dump-off pass to Robinson for a first down to start the drive Texas used a mix of Robinson Roschon Johnson and Casey Thompson on the ground that was capped by a Johnson 3-yard touchdown run.

2nd quarter — Halftime: Texas 42 Texas Tech 14

Texas Tech: The Red Raiders were stopped near midfield and decided to punt on a fourth-and-7. Texas blocked the punt and returned it for a score but the Longhorns were flagged for lining up in the neutral zone. Tech decided to roll the dice on fourth-and-2 and converted. A mix of runs and passes finished the drive that ended in a 6-yard Tyler Shough quarterback keeper for a touchdown.

Texas: Roschon Johnson picked up a first down on a fourth down attempt at Texas Tech's 45-yard line to keep the drive going. Casey Thompson squibbed out of the pocket on third-and-7 to pick up a crucial 11 yards and a first down to set up a Thompson 1-yard keeper for a touchdown a few plays later.

Texas: Cornerback Josh Thompson timed the route correctly as he slipped inside Tyler Shough's pass to Erik Ezukanma in the flat nabbed the interception for the Longhorns' 27-yard pick-six.

Texas: After Texas Tech fails to convert on fourth-and-7 at its own 40-yard line the Longhorns cap off a touchdown off of a turnover with a 23-yard Casey Thompson to Xavier Worthy strike.

Texas Tech: Taking only four plays after the Texas score back up quarterback Henry Colombi uncorked a 40-yard touchdown strike to Myles Price to finish off an easy 75-yard drive.

Texas: Roschon Johnson took a 7-yard direct snap followed the block of Bijan Robinson and broke the plane of the end zone. The touchdown capped a nine-play (seven runs two passes) 84-yard drive to essentially end the half

3rd quarter — Texas 63 Texas Tech 28

Texas: After a 43-yard punt return by D'Shawn Jamison the Longhorns only needed two plays to punch it in from the Texas Tech 7-yard line as Jordan Whittington took a jet sweep 5 yards in for the score.

Texas Tech: Colombi hit wide receiver Loic Fouonji down the right side of the field with a 69-yard pass where two Texas defensive backs ran into each other to take them out of the play.

Texas: Another drive another one dominated by the running backs. After a 33-yard rush from Robinson and an 11-yard tote by Johnson the Longhorns capped off another touchdown drive with a 3-yard pass from Thompson to Worthy.

Texas Tech: One play one touchdown for the Red Raiders. Colombi hit Kaylon Geiger in stride down the left sideline for 75 yards to inch 7 points closer.

Texas: Three plays three passes. One touchdown. Texas' offensive line gives Thompson all the time he needs to hit Worthy in the middle of the field as he breaks a couple of tackles for a 62-yard touchdown.

4th quarter — Final: Texas 70 Texas Tech 35

Texas: Hudson Card took over quarterback duties at the end of the third quarter and marched the Longhorns. Six runs 60 yards capped by a 1-yard Keilan Robinson plunge pushed the Longhorns to 70 points.

Texas Tech: Colombi led the Red Raiders down the field against a Texas defense that was playing soft connecting on a bunch of 7- and 8-yard passes before hitting Dalton Rigdon for 38 yards on fourth down that took the Raiders down to the 2-yard line. Third-string quarterback Donovan Smith ran it in from the 1-yard line to cap the drive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvb2tlbS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2Zvb3RiYWxsLzIwMjEvMDkvMjUvdGV4YXMtZm9vdGJhbGwtbGl2ZS11cGRhdGVzLXV0LXZzLXRleGFzLXRlY2gtcmVkLXJhaWRlcnMvNTg1MzczNDAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Longhorns vs Texas Tech football final score key plays,"Texas defeats Tech 70-35. Revisit the games' key plays below:

Points piling up for Texas (4th 13:32)

Keilan Robinson gave Texas its fourth rushing touchdown against Texas Tech when he scored from one yard out. An Alabama transfer Robinson scored his first touchdown as a Longhorn last week.

Robinson helped UT set a single-game record for points scored against Texas Tech. Last year in Lubbock Texas put up 63 points. Texas last scored 70 points in the 2005 Big 12 Championship Game. If Texas doesn't score again today's effort will be tied for the ninth-most points in school history.

The UT record for points scored in a single game is 92. Back in 1915 Texas recorded a 92-0 win over Daniel Baker.

So far seven Longhorns have scored a touchdown against Texas Tech. During one of the breaks even Santa got into the end zone.

— Danny Davis

X marks the spot (end of third quarter)

The third quarter belonged to the wide receivers on Texas and Texas Tech's rosters. Five touchdowns were caught over the quarter's 15 minutes. Those touchdowns covered a total of 214 yards.

The third quarter's final touchdown was scored by Texas freshman Xavier Worthy who broke a Red Raider tackle en route to a 62-yard score.

More:With hype aplenty Texas football turns to Xavier Worthy to 'add a lot of explosion to the offense'

Worthy now has a trio of touchdowns. Texas has a 63-28 lead. With one quarter to go Worthy has already set career-highs for receiving yards (100) and touchdown catches.

On the last drive of the third quarter Hudson Card replaced Casey Thompson as the Longhorns' quarterback.

— Danny Davis

Tons of touchdown tosses aplenty (3rd 5:02)

After an end-zone interception ended UT's first possession of the second half Texas made up for that turnover with Casey Thompson's third touchdown pass of the game. Jordan Whittington's 5-yard touchdown was set up by D'Shawn Jamison's 42-yard punt return to the Texas Tech 7.

Texas Tech responded to UT going up by a score of 49-14 with Loic Fouonji's 69-yard touchdown catch. Texas had its lead dwindle to 28 points for less than two minutes as Thompson connected on a 3-yard touchdown with Xavier Worthy on the ensuing possession.

On the play after Texas took a 56-21 lead Kaylon Geiger hauled in a 75-yard score for Texas Tech. Both Fouonju and Geiger beat Jamison in coverage.

— Danny Davis

Longhorns up 42-14 and in control at halftime

Texas and Texas Tech traded passing touchdowns — Casey Thompson's 23-yard toss to Xavier Worthy for Henry Colombi's 40-yard strike to Myles Price — in the second quarter's second half. With nine seconds left Roschon Johnson then added a 7-yard score out of the wildcat formation.

Texas last held a halftime lead of at least 20 points in a Big 12 game in 2014. In what turned out to be a 33-16 win over West Virginia in Austin on Nov. 8 2014 the Longhorns took a 24-3 lead into halftime.

Texas running back Bijan Robinson ended the first half with 150 yards of total offense. Robinson rushed for 96 yards on 13 first-half carries. Thirty-eight of his 54 receiving yards were recorded on the day's first touchdown.

— Danny Davis

Touchdowns for Texas' Thompson and Thompson (2nd 9:49)

Texas is now leading 28-7 after cornerback Josh Thompson intercepted Tyler Shough and returned the turnover 27 yards for a touchdown. The interception was UT's second of the season. It was also the first touchdown scored off an interception for the Longhorns since DeShon Elliott did that deed at Baylor in 2017.

Thompson's touchdown was scored 27 seconds after Texas quarterback Casey Thompson added a 1-yard run to UT's scoring summary.

Senior Henry Colombi is now at quarterback for Texas Tech.

— Danny Davis

Texas Tech gets on the scoreboard (2nd 14:00)

Texas Tech was last shutout by Texas in 1982 and history won repeat itself this weekend. Texas Tech quarterback Tyler Shough's 6-yard run on a third-down attempt has pulled the Red Raiders within 14-7 at Royal-Memorial Stadium

Texas almost took a 21-0 lead on the series. On the drive Keilan Robinson blocked an Austin McNamara punt and Morice Blackwell returned the loose football for a touchdown. But Robinson who blocked a Rice punt last week was called offsides by the officiating crew. Texas Tech then converted a 4th-and-2 at the Texas 43 to keep the drive alive.

— Danny Davis

Roschon vs. the Red Raiders (1st 5:22)

Texas extended its early lead to 14-0 after Roschon Johnson capped the Longhorns' second drive with a 3-yard touchdown run. A junior Johnson has now recorded five touchdown runs against Texas Tech in his career.

Two years ago in Austin Johnson rushed for 105 yards and three touchdowns in a 49-24 win over the Red Raiders. He had a 1-yard touchdown run in last year's overtime thriller in Lubbock.

— Danny Davis

Texas strikes first (1st 11:07)

After receiving the opening kickoff Texas covered 75 yards in less than four minutes to take a 7-0 lead. Facing a 4th-and-3 at the Texas Tech 38 Texas kept its offense on the field. Casey Thompson found an open Bijan Robinson out of the backfield and Robinson avoided three attempted tackles as he streaked to the end zone.

Texas Tech wins coin toss Texas receives opening kickoff

Are you ready for some football? After calling tails and winning the coin toss Texas Tech deferred and Texas will receive the opening kickoff. Casey Thompson Anthony Cook and Keilan Robinson served as the captains and representatives for Texas.

The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal also reported before the kickoff that running back Tahj Brooks would miss today's game with ""a small leg injury."" Brooks attended high school in nearby Manor. Over Texas Tech's first three games Brooks had recorded two 100-yard performances and was averaging 8.1 yards per carry.

Some notes about today's crowd at Royal-Memorial Stadium:

— Danny Davis

Texas and Texas Tech to meet for the 71st time

At Royal-Memorial Stadium this Saturday both Texas and Texas Tech will be looking to open Big 12 play on a high note.

Texas is 2-1 this season. The Longhorns blew past Louisiana and Rice but those wins were bookends for a 19-point loss at Arkansas. Having beaten Houston Stephen F Austin and Florida International Texas Tech is 3-0 for the first time since 2017.

This will be the 71st game in the Texas-Texas Tech series. All-time Texas is 53-17 against its rivals from Lubbock. The Longhorns also own a three-game winning streak over the Red Raiders.

Dating back to 2015 five of the last six meetings between the Longhorns and Red Raiders have been decided by eight points or less.

2015: Texas Tech 48 Texas 45

Texas Tech 48 Texas 45 2016: Texas 45 Texas Tech 37

In the Big 12 opener the Red Raiders' optimism got crushed and they lost their starting quarterback to boot.

Junior quarterback Casey Thompson threw a career-high five touchdown passes and the Longhorns scored nine TDs on their first 10 possessions Saturday beating the Red Raiders 70-35 at Royal-Memorial Stadium. The Longhorns' point total was a record for the 71-game series.

""They dominated the line of scrimmage right from the get-go"" Tech coach Matt Wells said. ""It wasn't so much scheme. It was we couldn't get off blocks we were fitting things up wrong and they owned the line of scrimmage.""

Texas cornerback Josh Thompson returned an interception for a touchdown in the midst of a 28-point second quarter that helped the Longhorns build a 42-14 halftime lead.

It was a rough day on the scoreboard and everywhere else for the Red Raiders. Tech quarterback Tyler Shough will be out for an extended period with an injury to his non-throwing shoulder and starting defensive backs Marquis Waters and DaMarcus Fields also left the game with injuries.

Tech rushing leader Tahj Brooks didn't play because of a leg injury that also could sideline him for next week's game at West Virginia.

Shough got hurt early in the second quarter when he dove into the end zone for a 6-yard touchdown on third-and-goal. He landed on his left shoulder and had his arm in a sling later in the day.

""He's going to be be out for a few weeks"" Wells said. ""We'll evaluate him when we get back to Lubbock.""

Shough stayed in briefly after he got hurt. He threw the pick-six on the second play of the Red Raiders' next series firing a quick pass for Erik Ezukanma that Josh Thompson swiped and returned 27 yards for the TD.

No. 2 quarterback Henry Colombi played the rest of the game and threw a career-high three touchdown passes: for 40 yards to Myles Price 69 yards to Loic Fouonji and 75 yards to Kaylon Geiger. Those narrowed deficits to 35-14 49-21 and 56-28.

Colombi set up another touchdown with a 38-yard pass to Dalton Rigdon to the UT 2. That came on fourth-and-14. Two plays later No. 3 quarterback Donovan Smith ran it in from the 1 making the score 70-35.

Colombi finished with 324 yards also a career-high on 17-for-23 passing. Shough was 9 of 11 for 68 yards.

Now for the time being the job is Colombi's.

Wells called the senior from Hollywood Florida ""a winner"" and ""a competitive dude.""

""He's a fearless competitor and I know we can win games with Henry"" Wells said. ""I've got confidence in Henry. Henry's won Big 12 games for us last year. I believe he can win again this year. He brings a competitive edge I think to that position.""

Wells didn't have an update after the game on his defensive backs.

Fields was injured in the third quarter on a 36-yard pass play to Jordan Whittington. Fields was chasing the Longhorns' receiver from behind and Adrian Frye came up from deep in the secondary and crashed into his teammate while going for the tackle. Fields rolled over in pain grasping his helmet with both hands.

Waters left early in the game and was on the sideline later with his right arm in a sling.

That opened up nearly a full game's worth of playing time for Dadrion Taylor-Demerson who made five tackles broke up two passes and picked off one. The junior safety intercepted a Casey Thompson pass into the end zone on the first series of the second half. That ended Texas' stretch of TDs on its first five possessions.

The outcome made both teams 3-1. Texas outgained Tech 639 yards to 520 and 336 of the Longhorns' total came on the ground.

It was quite a jolt for the Red Raiders who came in ranked No. 9 in the FBS in rushing defense and No. 31 out of 130 in total defense.

""They did a really good job running the stretch taking shots and we just couldn't get them on the ground"" Tech nose tackle Jaylon Hutchings said ""so all credit goes to them for executing.""

Texas running back Bijan Robinson carried 18 times for 137 yards. He capped the game's first series taking a short pass 38 yards for a touchdown on fourth-and-3.

Roschon Johnson carried 13 times for 64 yards and two first-half touchdowns. On the latter he lined up in the wildcat formation and took a direct snap 7 yards making it 42-14 at 9 seconds before halftime.

Casey Thompson finished 18 of 23 for 303 yards. Two of his touchdown passes went to slender freshman Xavier Worthy for 23 and 62 yards. The latter came with 4:09 left in the third quarter and increased the lead to 63-28."

Two-thirds of low-wage workers do not have sick days despite the ongoing pandemic according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Overall paid sick days have a positive benefit to employers as it reduces employee turnover.

There has been a recent push by Democratic politicians and workers in the US to secure paid leave for low-wage workers.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Two-thirds of low-wage workers do not have sick days even during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Over three-quarters or about 77% of private-sector workers in the US have the ability to earn paid sick time at work but the benefit is mostly available to higher-wage workers according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Only 33% of the lowest-paid workers are able to earn paid sick days in the US the data found.

Low-wage workers such as people working in education restaurants and manufacturing are typically working in positions where they have more direct contact with the public putting them at a higher risk for developing a contagious disease like COVID-19 falling ill and subsequently being forced to miss work the Economic Policy Institute points out.

Access to paid sick days has positive benefits to employers as it reduces employee turnover with no impact on employment according to EPI.

Depending on where workers live can also impact their access to paid sick days the EPI reported. 95% of private-sector workers living in the Pacific Region (California Oregon and Washington) have access to paid sick leave while only 67% in East South Central states (Alabama Mississippi Kentucky and Tennessee) have the same access. Alabama Mississippi Kentucky and Tennessee all have preemption laws prohibiting cities and counties from requiring local employers to offer paid sick leave or other forms of paid family or medical leave according to the EPI.

There is no federal law requiring employers to provide paid sick leave.

Recently Tyson Foods the world's second-largest processor and marketer of chicken beef and pork granted workers fully vaccinated against the coronavirus 20 hours of paid sick leave a year to incentivize employees to get the vaccine Insider Reported.

However Amazon which currently employs every 1 out of 153 workers in the US does not offer its warehouse workers paid sick leave. Amazon has come under scrutiny from its employees and labor activists for offering unsafe working conditions for its warehouse workers and delivery drivers.

The company has repeatedly said the safety of drivers and communities is its top priority and it invests millions of dollars in safety protocols for workers.

House Democrats are currently drafting a bill that includes 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for American workers. The proposed $3.5 trillion infrastructure plan called the Build Back Better Act would guarantee workers time off to raise newborn children or deal with a medical emergency Insider reported.

""This is our historic opportunity to support working families and ensure our economy is stronger more inclusive and more resilient for generations to come"" Chairman Richard E. Neal a Massachusetts representative previously told Insider.

Lenders have been slow to adopt the official substitute for the scandal-tarred Libor interest-rate benchmark but derivatives traders are now giving it an enthusiastic welcome.

Action in futures options and swaps markets tied to the new secured overnight financing rate — Sofr — has shot up since the summer. These derivatives enable users to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates.

Industry representatives picked Sofr in 2017 as an alternative to the London interbank offered rate or Libor the borrowing benchmark that was tarnished by a rate collusion scheme. Banks will be barred from underwriting new loans using Libor starting in 2022.

Shifting market participants off US dollar Libor the biggest and most important Libor rate has been slow in part because Sofr had not been market-tested. The first Sofr-backed leveraged loan was not offered until earlier this month more than three years after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began to publish the rate.

By comparison the use of Sofr-linked derivatives is perking up. Last week $240bn of US dollar interest rate swaps based on Sofr were traded equivalent to about 13.5 per cent of the total dollar Libor and Sofr market according to data from the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. In June Sofr-linked swaps accounted for only about 3 per cent of the market.

Volumes increased in part because of a regulatory initiative from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission in July called Sofr First aimed at the derivatives market. The programme switched derivatives pricing on some traders’ screens from Libor to Sofr.

“[Sofr First] was a big deal in terms of driving Sofr volumes across the Street. It’s more specific to swaps but it no doubt has also generated more hedging activity in futures” said Mark Cabana head of US rates strategy at Bank of America.

At CME Group the biggest US futures exchange operator the number of outstanding contracts in listed derivatives based on Sofr has risen 90 per cent since the start of the year.

“The market has made far more progress in adopting Sofr and is much larger than we appreciate” said Sean Tully CME’s head of financial and over-the-counter products. “In the lending and the cash markets it is taking a bit longer. But in the derivatives markets much more has happened.”

Libor is based on the interest rate at which banks say they would lend to other banks. Sofr is based on market transactions and represents the overnight cost to borrow cash backed by US Treasury debt.

While Sofr may become popular in derivatives markets its uptake in the loan market is not assured. Cabana said that bank lenders as well as some companies had indicated they didn’t believe Sofr was well suited for them.

Unlike Sofr credit risks are incorporated into Libor. When the risk associated with lending money increases during bouts of market volatility Libor rises while Sofr moves less. Banks could therefore face the prospect of lending money at a steady Sofr rate while their own funding costs which are linked to credit risk are rising.

“We believe we are going to be in a multi-reference rate environment where Sofr will initially be dominant but the persistence of that dominance is unclear to me” Cabana said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25mbC9nYW1lL18vZ2FtZUlkLzQwMTMyNjM3Ni9zZWFoYXdrcy12aWtpbmdz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vikings 30-17 Seahawks (Sep 26 2021) Final Score,"Cousins Vikings cruise 30-17 end skid vs. Seahawks

— After two narrow losses to start the season Kirk Cousins and the Minnesota Vikings found a foolproof way to avoid the type of harrowing finish that has haunted them more often than not.

Sep 26 2022 09:37 pm - AP",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vbmUtd2Vlay1hZnRlci1iaWctbWlzcy12aWtpbmdzLWtpY2tlci1ncmVnLWpvc2VwaC1pcy1wZXJmZWN0LTYtZm9yLTYvNjAwMTAxMTcxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One week after big miss Vikings kicker Greg Joseph is perfect 6-for-6,"A week after missing a possible game-winning field goal in Arizona Vikings kicker Greg Joseph responded by making all six kicks including three second-half field goals during Sunday's 30-17 victory over the Seahawks.

Joseph outdueled Seahawks kicker Jason Myers who entered the game having made a Seattle franchise-record 36 consecutive field goals dating back to the 2019 season. He tacked on another a 53-yarder before missing a 44-yard attempt in the second quarter.

Myers' miss kept the Vikings within 17-14 before halftime. They took the lead on the next drive when quarterback Kirk Cousins found receiver Justin Jefferson for a 3-yard touchdown. Joseph tacked on the extra point and three field goals after halftime.

""Greg has done a great job for us"" Cousins said. ""There will be a lot of big kicks up ahead. It's a huge part of the game.""

Joseph has made six of seven field-goal attempts missing only the late 37-yard try in Arizona and nine of 10 extra-point tries through three games as the Vikings kicker.

'Waiting for that moment'

In his 19th NFL game Jefferson became the fastest in Vikings history to 100 career catches surpassing the mark with an 8-yard grab from Cousins in Sunday's first quarter. Jefferson who finished with nine catches for 118 yards and a touchdown said he didn't know about the record until he looked up at the jumbotron at U.S. Bank Stadium.

By his fifth catch of the afternoon Jefferson had his first touchdown — a 3-yard grab near the pylon — scored in front of fans at U.S. Bank Stadium which didn't allow any because of COVID-19 concerns in 2020 during Jefferson's rookie season. He celebrated with his trademark dance.

""It was crazy. It was so energetic"" Jefferson said. ""I was waiting for that moment for a long time now to finally score a touchdown in front of the fans and then hit the 'Griddy.'""

Secondary's rocky start

The Vikings defense overcame a rocky start plagued by issues in the secondary. Seahawks receiver D.K. Metcalf had catches for 21 and 28 yards before halftime the latter when Metcalf shook cornerback Patrick Peterson in coverage and safety Xavier Woods missed a tackle.

Metcalf's 10-yard touchdown followed when he beat corner Bashaud Breeland who was backed off in coverage in a foot race to the front pylon. Reserve corner Cameron Dantzler has only replaced Breeland because of injury in Arizona and he had a cryptic message on social media immediately after the game.

""I'm tired of biting my tongue about this whole situation [for real]"" Dantzler wrote in a since-deleted post on his verified Twitter account.

'Gave them a free play'

The Seahawks secondary had even more issues with Cousins who completed 30 of 38 passes for 323 yards and three touchdowns. Seahawks safety Quandre Diggs appeared livid on the field after tackling Jefferson on a 28-yard grab at the end of the third quarter. Jefferson was wide open as Vikings receivers were for much of the game.

Diggs spent the intermission before the fourth quarter talking through issues with Seahawks safety Jamal Adams and his teammates on the field.

""A couple plays where obviously we didn't communicate and we just gave them a free play"" Seahawks corner D.J. Reed said. ""You've got to make the offense work for it.""

Some people are fortunate enough to be able to cover all their needs and wants with just one primary income source. Others however have to stretch each paycheck to cover their basic expenses. And according to a report conducted by the TIAA Institute millennials are the generation most likely to face financial strain in areas such as paying down debt and saving money. Millennials — classified by the Pew Research Center as people born between 1981 and 1996 — have gotten a ton of attention as a generation struggling to balance their lifestyle costs with their financial goals. And a large part of that imbalance could stem from not earning enough money to float their costs. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau the median millennial household pretax income was $71566 in 2020. However a Sunmark Credit Union study on the spending habits of different generations found that millennials spend an average of $208.77 per day. This includes the average daily costs of groceries housing utilities insurance entertainment eating out and more. That number works out to be $1461.39 spent each week and $5845.56 per month. But at the end of the year the average person will have spent $70146.72 — just under the median millennial income. Spending almost as much as they earn each year means that there's less room to save for emergencies or invest for retirement. But with the average cost of rent — millennials' largest expense — weighing in at $1584 for a studio and $1636 for a one-bedroom in the U.S. many millennials find that their wages just aren't enough to allow them to keep up with the costs of day-to-day life.

Factors affecting millennial earnings

The 2008 recession took a huge financial toll on millennials. A lack of jobs meant that fewer millennials were able to earn income or advance their careers which set them back financially. In fact a report from a non-profit group called the Young Invincibles found that the 2008 economic downturn cost younger workers an estimated $22000 in lost earnings per person. Even after out-of-work millennials finally landed jobs in the years following the recession their salaries had decreased. The Hamilton Project an economic analysis from the Brookings Institute found that prior to economy-related job loss millennials earned around $3640 per month which works out to be $43700 annually. But two years after the recession hit those who landed jobs earned an average monthly income of only $1910 ($23000 per year). Millennials have had to work their way back up from this staggering difference in earnings. And while the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic had an effect that played out across all age groups it seemed as if millennials took yet another hit as they are the largest generation currently in the workforce. According to the Pew Research Center 30% of Americans between the ages of 30 and 49 say that they or someone in their household lost a job due to the pandemic. However it may still be too early to see the pandemic's full impact on millennial earning potential.

Bottom line

Millennials have already lost a lot of ground when it comes to their earnings thanks to the 2008 recession and now the Covid-19 pandemic. But by taking some small steps like using credit cards that let them save on interest investing and supplementing their income through side hustles millennials can start to strike a better balance between what they need and what they can afford.

The same can’t be said in Traverse City. Though Cherry Capital Airport (TVC) is coming off a record-breaking summer of visitors the airport is also facing a ground transportation crisis that has made it challenging for those visitors to get around town. And according to Airport Director Kevin Klein the laundry list of factors contributing to the problem means there is no silver bullet fix.

The biggest problem is how dramatically the local taxi industry has shrunk in recent years. It’s not just a local problem either: Klein says that “Michigan as a whole has seen over a 40 percent reduction in the number of cab companies” due to questions of business viability. According to the Passenger Transportation Coalition (PTC) a statewide group seeking legislative reform to address those viability concerns Michigan has lost “more than 100 transportation companies and more than 1000 vehicles.”

Dan White owner of the Traverse City-based Dan’s Airport Transportation says the biggest issue facing taxi limo shuttle and charter bus companies is commercial insurance.

“My insurance rates were $375 a month two years ago” White tells The Ticker whose business is classified as a limousine service. “They went up to $525 a month last year. And then in May when I re-up my annual contracts every year it was going to be $1000 a month. And that’s just not affordable. This is not a high profit margin business especially in the winter. So between the virus the shutdowns and commercial insurance tripling that’s why half the local cab companies are gone.”

The big casualty locally was Cherry Capital Cab which closed its doors before the pandemic even hit. In June 2019 Doug Dornbos – Cherry Capital Cab’s owner – posted on Facebook that he was ceasing operations of the business effective immediately. “Our fleet insurance was set to renew last night at midnight but when all of our options were counted we faced an insurmountable increase in insurance pricing” he wrote. “We did not feel it was financially feasible to continue so we officially closed our doors at midnight last night.”

In general Michigan has the highest car insurance rates in the country. Those costs are due in part to the state’s no-fault insurance law which requires drivers to buy expensive personal injury protection (PIP) coverage. Passenger transportation businesses are required to have PIP insurance too and if a passenger doesn’t have their own coverage – or isn’t named on a PIP policy held by a parent or other relative – that can leave insurers liable for huge medical costs in the event of an accident.

“And so commercial insurance companies they're trying to avoid Michigan because of the high PIP costs” White says. “If I got the crash with you in my car and I'm a taxi driver and you're injured my insurance provider could pay $20 million in medical expenses over 20 years for you. PIP has historically been unlimited in Michigan where in most states it’s capped at $500000.”

The PTC is lobbying for a legislative change that would remove for-hire passenger vehicle businesses from the order of priority that determines who pays PIP benefits. “This would immediately relieve insurance carriers of immense liability” the coalition has stated.

But the cab shortage isn’t the only problem. Klein says Uber Lyft and other ridesharing services have not yet taken root in Traverse City like they have in bigger metropolitan areas. Rides can be found during peak hours in the summer but are harder to come by late at night early in the morning or during the off-season. And several ridesharing drivers have said they've switched to more predictable and lucrative Door Dash or GrubHub.

Another factor this summer was the nationwide shortage of rental cars. “All the car rental companies sold off their cars to be able to survive the pandemic” Klein explains. “When things started to open up again they went to order new cars but the car manufacturers all had computer chip [supply chain] issues. So that delayed cars coming to the market all across the United States including for us.”

These factors are creating a perfect storm for local airport transportation. Klein says he sometimes sees passengers from New York or Dallas expect “an abundance of cabs on the curb out front.” Those visitors then have to scramble to find transportation to their hotels or Airbnbs.

In other situations passengers arriving late at night or leaving early in the morning learn the hard way that most of the ground transportation options available locally – from BATA to hotel shuttles – don’t run before 6am or after midnight.

So what’s the fix? For TVC one solution is to communicate to visitors that they need to plan transportation ahead of time.

The airport has also worked closely with BATA this summer to grow the adoption of BATA’s Link-On-Demand service among airport guests. Link-On-Demand is BATA’s answer to Uber and Lyft – an on-demand pickup service that users can book via web mobile or phone. Rides are available from 6am to 10:30pm during the week and until 11:30pm on the weekends.

Year-to-date BATA has provided some 500 rides to and from the airport between Link-On-Demand and its regular Village Loop Route 14 bus service which includes airport stops.

And then there’s the fresh approach Dan’s Airport Service took after White’s insurance bill tripled. He calls it a “moving cars business model.” The strategy allows locals to drive to the airport and park their car in short-term parking. White and a business associate then go to the airport pick up the car and take it back to the customer’s house. Alternatively White can pick up a car drive it to the airport and leave it in short-term parking so that someone flying into TVC can drive themselves home. The upside is that White doesn’t have to pay for fleet insurance. The downside is the service skews heavily toward local customers and doesn’t address the transportation problem for visitors.

For his part Klein is confident the market will find a way to solve the ground transportation issue. Already he says the rental car shortage has largely subsided for TVC. There are also new trends on the horizon – such as Turo.com which has been billed as “Airbnb for cars” – that could bring new options to the table.

“It’s one of those subjects that I think will always be cyclical” Klein concludes. “I've seen it throughout my career over the last 25 years in airports: Sometimes you have an abundance of ground transportation; other times it cycles down. Right now we’re in a down cycle for transportation for the various reasons of insurance the number of people available to drive and more. But I think that will change and things will improve. Hopefully as legislation changes and insurance requirements change you’ll see the market change too.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmV1L2FydGljbGUvZ2VybWFueS1lbGVjdGlvbi0yMDIxLWJ1bmRlc3RhZy1wYXJsaWFtZW50LXNlYXRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Achtung! The über-Bundestag is coming – POLITICO,"Confused? You’re not alone. The system is so arcane that few Germans understand the mechanics. But politicians can’t agree on a fundamental reform because no one wants to risk losing seats even though the parliament expanded to a record 709 seats at the last election. They tried last year but the changes will do little to halt the Bundestag’s bulge.

“Based on current polls my prediction is that the next Bundestag will have 860 seats” said Christian Hesse a mathematics professor at the University of Stuttgart who has been involved in the quarrel over a reformed electoral law for years.

Hesse’s estimate is not the most extreme scenario among those currently circulating in German media but it would still mean 151 seats more than the current total.

“The prescribed size of parliament is actually only 598 that is the number of constituencies — 299 — multiplied by two” continued Hesse.

But if a party wins more direct candidates via the first vote than it would be eligible to have via the second vote it has a right to so-called “overhang seats” which then have to be compensated through so-called “leveling seats” so other parties aren’t put at a disadvantage.

At the last election 65 overhang seats and 46 leveling seats were added to the Bundestag.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc25ld3lvcmsuY29tL2NyYWlucy1leHRyYS9jcmFpbnMtZXh0cmEtdWJlci1yaWRlcy1uZXctcGxhY2UtcHJvZml0YWJpbGl0edIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crain's Extra: Uber rides to a new place—profitability,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.crainsnewyork.com/crains-extra/crains-extra-uber-rides-new-place-profitability on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc25ld3lvcmsuY29tL2NyYWlucy1leHRyYS9jcmFpbnMtZXh0cmEtdWJlci1yaWRlcy1uZXctcGxhY2UtcHJvZml0YWJpbGl0edIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VzLW5ld3Mvc3R1ZGVudC1tdXJkZXJlZC1hZnRlci1nZXR0aW5nLXdyb25nLTI1MDYwNjU40gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWlycm9yLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdXMtbmV3cy9zdHVkZW50LW11cmRlcmVkLWFmdGVyLWdldHRpbmctd3JvbmctMjUwNjA2NTguYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Student murdered after getting into wrong car thinking it was her Uber,"Samantha Josephson 21 had got into Nathan Rowland's car thinking it was the Uber she had booked to take her from Columbia's Five Points entertainment district back to her apartment

Student murdered after getting into wrong car thinking it was her Uber

Student Samantha Josephson was just weeks away from her graduation and ready to make a difference in the world.

Originally from New Jersey the 21-year-old was reading political science at the University of South Carolina.

While there Samantha had spent time studying in Barcelona and she had won a full scholarship to Drexel University in Philadelphia where she would chase her dream of practising international law.

It was 2019 and the future looked bright for Samantha.

But on 28 March she was feeling a bit down after getting some bad news about a family ­member’s health.

She had planned to go out with her friends and her boyfriend who was away at the time told her she should go ahead and have some fun.

Samantha headed to the popular Five Points area in downtown Columbia.

She spent the night with her friends and then in the early hours of 29 March decided to leave The Bird Dog bar and go back to her apartment.

She ordered an Uber and headed outside to wait for it.

At 2.09am surveillance footage captured a black Chevrolet Impala pulling up beside her. She was pictured wearing an orange shirt and black trousers as she got into the vehicle and it drove away.

But not long afterwards the Uber that Samantha had called arrived. When the driver found she was not there they cancelled the journey. Samantha had mistakenly climbed into the wrong car.

The next day her roommates were worried when they realised she hadn’t returned home so they reported her missing.

A search began and tragically less than 24 hours later turkey hunters discovered a body in woodland some 65 miles away from Five Points.

It was Samantha and she had been subjected to a brutal attack. She had more than 120 stab wounds inflicted with a double-bladed knife. There were so many it was impossible to say exactly how many.

It was also clear that Samantha had put up a brave fight. While trying to shield herself one of the blows had gone straight through her right hand.

Her attacker had used so much force the knife had gone through her skull and into her brain on some strikes.

Many of the injuries especially to the neck were close together – which suggested rapid and violent stabbing. There were wounds from her face right down to her feet.

Almost all of her wounds were potentially fatal and she would have bled heavily dying within 10 to 20 minutes.

The human body usually has four litres of blood in it – Samantha’s only had 1.3 tablespoons left.

Investigators quickly determined that Samantha had accidentally got into her killer’s car thinking it was her taxi.

They believed that once she was inside the driver had triggered the vehicle’s childproof locks – meaning the doors could only be opened from the outside. Samantha would had have had no way of escaping.

The police had the description of the vehicle and in the early hours of 30 March it was spotted driving around the very same area Samantha was snatched in.

Police pulled it over and the driver tried to flee but was quickly apprehended.

His name was Nathaniel Rowland.

Rowland had once lived near the spot where Samantha’s body was discovered.

Officers found bleach and other cleaning products in his car. There was also a lot of blood on the seats and in the boot. And the child locks were activated – just as they had suspected.

In a search of his home cops found more cleaning supplies and a double-bladed knife with Samantha’s blood on it. Her blood was also on one of his socks and a bandana and her DNA was found under his fingernails.

Rowland then 24 had been arrested the previous year for allegedly trying to sell items stolen during a woman’s kidnapping in 2018.

The victim said two men carjacked her at traffic lights and forced her to withdraw cash.

Her abductors then made her take them to her home where they stole items.

Those belongings later turned up at a pawn shop and were traced back to Rowland.

He couldn’t be connected to the carjacking so he was just charged with obtaining goods under false pretences.

But now Rowland was arrested and charged with kidnapping and murder.

The shocking case attracted nationwide attention and put taxi safety in the spotlight.

The incident illustrated the importance of making sure the driver is registered before entering a taxi – highlighting the need for a clearer display of that information.

Samantha’s death brought several changes to the law in South Carolina which included all ride-share vehicles displaying a sign with their company’s name.

Meanwhile Samantha was awarded a posthumous political science degree in May 2019 at what would have been her graduation ceremony.

Rowland’s trial began in July this year. Prosecutors said Samantha had got into her killer’s car believing that it was her ride home. Rowland’s mobile placed him at the scene.

They said he had used child locks to trap her but they couldn’t determine a motive – although there was evidence he’d tried to withdraw cash from her bank account.

In court Rowland’s former girlfriend said she had seen blood in his car and saw him cleaning it with bleach. She said she also saw him cleaning a knife.

The prosecution held up the shirt Samantha was wearing that night. The original colour wasn’t visible due to the amount of blood that had stained it.

But the defence said scientists were not certain it was Rowland’s DNA on the knife and that there was none on Samantha’s body.

They also said while she had put up a fight he had no visible marks upon his arrest. However they had no witnesses and the accused did not testify.

After deliberating for just an hour the jury found Rowland 27 guilty of kidnapping murder and possessing a weapon.

At the sentencing the judge was in no doubt of his guilt. “There’s a thousand trails that led to you. All of the evidence each speck – not simply beyond a reasonable doubt but as the highest standard the law requires – points to your guilt” he said.

The judge called Rowland “totally heartless” and said the case was the “most severe” murder he had dealt with.

Samantha’s mum Marci read out an emotional statement. “Her dream was my dream and her death was my death” she said.

“I close my eyes and I feel what she endured at [Rowland’s] hands 120 times. Over and over and over fighting for her life locked in his car. I pray that when Sami closed her eyes she thought of beautiful things and his evil face was not the last thing she saw before she took her last breath.”

Samantha’s father Seymour said of the impact of her death “Do I tell you that I contemplated suicide several times over the past 28 months? To me the monster has stolen that bright light this enthusiasm for life out of me.”

Seymour added he could no longer look at photos of Samantha because they made him think of her fighting for her life.

The judge said Samantha’s bravery had led to her killer’s conviction. “She obviously put up an amazing fight and left a sufficient trail for the jury to see what you did” he told Rowland. The killer was sentenced to life in prison without parole and the judge said the decision had been “an easy one”.

Samantha’s parents set up the What’s My Name Foundation to educate on ride-share safety and support charities.

The student’s death seemingly at the hands of a man set on committing an act of random violence changed her loved ones’ lives forever.

It takes off and lands vertically is super silent and flies at 75 mph - Airbus has unveiled a ...,"

Airbus could be one of the first companies to introduce a fully functional flying taxi – a segment of urban mobility that’s evolving quickly. The leading European aerospace company revealed the new CityAirbus battery-electric air taxi at its first summit on “Pioneering Sustainable Aerospace.” Called the CityAirbus NextGen it’s an improved version of the company’s previous demonstrators CityAirbus and Vahana with better noise mitigation and upgraded performance figures.





“We are on a quest to co-create an entirely new market that sustainably integrates urban air mobility into the cities while addressing environmental and social concerns” said Bruno Even Airbus Helicopters CEO in a statement. “Airbus is convinced that the real challenges are as much about urban integration public acceptance and automated air traffic management as about vehicle technology and business models. We build on all of the capabilities to deliver a safe sustainable and fully integrated service to society.”



The CityAirbus NextGen gets a fixed-wing design like a traditional aircraft and a V-shaped tail. The eVTOL is equipped with a total of eight electric motor-driven propellers that are a part of its unique distributed propulsion system. The wing and the rotors are fixed and the air taxi has no movable surfaces and no tilting parts which makes it simple and efficient. The cabin has a capacity to seat four people and the company is also working on autonomous flying tech which will eliminate the need for a pilot. The CityAirbus NextGen has a range of 50 miles and has a cruising speed of 75 mph making it ideal as an urban transporter for short distances.



Airbus is also working hard to reduce the noise footprint of its air taxi to make it usable in cities. The company is working on optimizing the propulsion system to bring down its sound levels below 65 dB during flight and 70 dB during landing. Airbus hopes to build the first prototype of the CityAirbus NextGen by 2023 and get the necessary certifications by 2025 which might bring it to the market by the end of this decade."

Not sure if you have hooded eyes? You'll know you have them if an extra fold of skin covers the crease of your eyelid making your lid disappear when you open your eyes. Because of it your masterful eyeliner disappears as soon as you open your eyes normally.

But don't worry. There's a work-around and folks like Emma Stone Blake Lively and Jennifer Lawrence have figured it out.

The trick is tightlining.

Here's what you do: Apply eyeliner to the upper waterline (yes it exists). This helps to fill in the spaces between your lashes and gives you that full eyeliner look that otherwise disappears when your eyes are open. Your eyes will still look defined but it’ll leave your lids free of actual liner which means you won't get the smudges.

Finally dab some champagne-colored highlighter just over the tear ducts for an even bigger bright-eyed effect.

""I'm a huge stickler when it comes to having those pigments pop out the best that they can"" Doja Cat told Allure.

The singer has also found herself hoping to be able to create intricate designs within her makeup while performing but sometimes does not see the point in doing so because it's difficult for the cameras and crowd to pick up the finer details. ""You're so far away from everyone and those cameras need to catch everything"" she said. ""It's hard to do dots [thin] lines and little intricacies. They feel kind of pointless because they don't register.""

Doja Cat has remained busy in recent weeks. In addition to her new makeup line the singer hosted and performed at this year's MTV Video Music Awards.

Just check out these rave reviews from Sephora shoppers if you need a little more convincing to try out the product.

One review said ""I usually have a hard time finding a shade that doesn't make me look too young or too old. This shade is perfect and literally goes with everything. Tiktok was right  purchase it asap.""

A fan of the product wrote ""This is a classic for a reason. It's light flattering and easy to wear. I wear minimal make up and it works well for that!""

Another gushed ""seriously. best.thing.ever. i bought this since it was trending on tik tok and i love trying out new products but this is probably in my top 3 makeup things i own. it's the perfect colour for my skin tone and truly matches any skin tone. it's yet subtle but still beautiful and theres definitely a change on ur lips. also the TEXTURE!! SOOO SMOOTH!!""

""I am obsessed with this lipstick. It glides on like a gloss but has the staying power of a lipstick. The color isn't too dark or overdramatic but a nice light redness that compliments my Asian skin tone. I love the skinny tube because it makes it easy to put on. The formula isn't too heavy and has a nice creaminess to it. It's great"" one customer shared.

Another shopper who was persuaded by the TikTok community said ""This was a TikTok purchase! I love this color. I wouldn't have ever thought to try this if not for TikTok honestly. It really does bring out a natural beautiful color to your lips. It's not sticky at all. Im hopeful it's as conditioning as everyone says. It's a small tube but I think it's worth it because it's so unique. I've never tried anything like it and I love all things lips. I'll definitely purchase again. If you're on the fence I think you should try it. If you see it available jump on it. When I first tried to purchase it was sold out. Sephora make it so easy with an email letting me know when it was available.""

""The perfect color! I was intimidated at first when I opened the tube as the product looks so dark but it's the right amount of sheer color when applied. Highly recommend as a go-to for your purse for when you need a quick pick-me-up"" a shopper shared."

They’re back big time. Three of the big four banks are back – while Wells Fargo keeps getting slapped on the wrist – after all four were out of it last year due to pandemic-rated financial restrictions. Intel fell out of it. But the rest of Big Tech is in and Apple bigger than ever. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway after rightfully dissing share buybacks for years has become one of the largest share buyback queens. And Charter Communications has jumped into it massively.

The top 10 companies – ranked by their cumulative buybacks over the past five years – bought back more of their shares than ever in Q2: $85 billion according to S&P Dow Jones Indices this week accounting for 43% of the total share buybacks by all S&P 500 companies. Since 2014 these 10 companies bought back $1.13 trillion of their own shares.

The two surges in the chart below – first after the corporate tax cuts in 2017 and second after Q2 2020 – quadrupled the quarterly rate of share buybacks for these 10 companies from around $20 billion a quarter in the four years through 2017 to $85 billion in Q2 (data via YCharts.com):

The top 10 share buyback queens based on their share buybacks in Q2 2021:

Top 10 Companies Share Buybacks in Billion $ Q2 2021 12 months 5-year total 1 Apple [AAPL] 25.6 89.7 334.1 2 Alphabet [GOOG] 12.8 40.0 87.7 3 Facebook [FB] 8.4 19.2 51.1 4 Oracle [ORCL] 8.0 21.6 93.8 5 Microsoft [MSFT] 7.2 27.4 92.4 6 JPMorgan [JPM] 6.2 11.0 81.5 7 Berkshire Hathaway [BRK.A] 6.0 30.5 43.5 8 BofA [BAC] 4.2 8.1 78.5 9 Charter Comm. [CHTR] 3.5 14.9 42.8 10 Union Pacific [UNP] 3.1 5.2 28.1

Rounding out the top 20 are in that order: Lowe’s Home Depot Morgan Stanley P&G Citigroup Walmart HCA Healthcare Visa Chubb and Mastercard. Wells Fargo and Intel which used to be in the Top 10 have fallen off the list entirely.

In total 294 of the S&P 500 companies reported buybacks in Q2 of at least $5 million down from 335 companies in Q1 2021. But the top 10 did the lion’s share of buying.

Combined they bought back $199 billion of their own shares in Q2 the fourth largest amount ever behind the records in the three quarters through Q1 2019 following the corporate tax cuts (blue columns in the chart below).

Since the beginning of 2012 the S&P 500 companies have bought back nearly $5.5 trillion of their own shares with the top 10 share buyback queens accounting for 25% of it.

But in recent years this has gotten a lot more top heavy. In Q2 2021 the top 10 accounted for 43%.

But without the Top 10 share buyback queens the share buybacks by the remaining 284 companies amounted to only $114 billion (red line) roughly flat with Q1 and below most quarters in prior years – that’s how top-heavy this scheme has become:

Even today as crazy as this sounds the $5.5 trillion that the S&P 500 companies incinerated on buying back their own shares is a lot of money. They could have been invested in expansion projects in the US and in labor in the US rather than in cheap labor overseas and in training or god forbid the companies could have tried to somewhat less aggressively dodge US income taxes and pay a little more given that the US government deficit has been horrendous for years and has become more horrendous with the corporate tax cut of 2017 and has become a lot more horrendous starting in March 2020

Along with share buybacks comes the corporate debt and it has ballooned as many companies borrowed heavily to fund the share buybacks.

Nonfinancial corporate debt (bonds and loans outstanding owed by companies other than lenders) spiked in the first half of 2020 and in Q2 reached a new record of $11.2 trillion having soared by 73% over the past eight years. The $5.5 trillion incinerated on share buybacks played a large role in creating this debt:

The primary purpose of share buybacks is to undo the dilution of their EPS metric that occurs due to massive executive stock-based compensation packages. These share buybacks hide the cost of stock-based compensation on EPS; and many of those share buybacks are funded with debt but debt doesn’t impact EPS.

In terms of actually lowering the share count: Only 5.4% of the companies that did share buybacks reduced their share count by at least 4% year-over-year according to S&P. This 5.4% share was down from a 17.8% share a year ago and from the 28.2% share in Q1 2016.

Thomas Pallini/Insider

United Airlines has been hit with a $1.9 million penalty for long tarmac delays per Reuters.

A consent order cited 25 incidents that occurred between December 2015 and February of this year.

The airline breached federal rules by keeping passengers stuck on planes for too long.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

United Airlines has been fined $1.9 million by the Department of Transportation (DoT) for keeping thousands of passengers stuck on planes for hours in violation of federal rules Reuters reported.

It is the largest penalty of its kind according to the outlet.

The department said in a consent order that United failed to adhere to the assurances in its contingency plan for long tarmac delays for 20 domestic flights and five international flights at airports across the US. A total of 3218 passengers were affected.

A tarmac delay occurs when a plane on the ground is either awaiting takeoff or has just landed and passengers do not have the opportunity to get off the plane.

In one 2019 incident a United flight en route to Chicago was diverted to an airport in Wisconsin due to a winter storm. It was held on the tarmac for more than four hours.

In a statement to Reuters on Friday United said its ""committed to fully meeting all DoT rules and will continue identifying and implementing improvements in how we manage difficult operating conditions.""

United Airlines did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

In July 2021 airlines reported a total of 40 tarmac delays of more than three hours on domestic flights compared with 11 the month before per the department.

United is not the only airline to have faced sky-high penalties in recent years. In 2019 American Airlines and Delta Air Lines were fined a total of $1.75 million for long tarmac delays at US airports.

Delta said at the time that it provided customers with substantial compensation for the delays including cash reimbursements SkyMiles and travel vouchers.

About 70% of the total workforce took part reflecting the overwhelming support from TWU members.

See also StarTrack drivers vote to strike for job security

The strike at StarTrack which is wholly owned by Australia Post caused delays in parcel deliveries around the country. Australia Post claimed that only 750 workers took action but then admitted that there had been substantial hold-ups to parcel deliveries.

The TWU is pushing for equal pay and conditions for labour-hire workers caps on lower-paid outside hire contractors and for work to be offered to permanent employees ahead of labour-hire workers. Outsourcing is as high as 70% on some StarTrack sites the union said.

TWU national secretary Michael Kaine accused StarTrack of misrepresenting the scale of the protests saying the union’s delegates had seen members stopping work in droves.

Kaine also said that if StarTrack had been concerned about the strike’s impact on the delivery of vaccines or medical supplies “it would have worked cooperatively with the union to ensure provisions could be made”. “Instead of undermining workers’ voices in the media StarTrack management should listen to them get back to the bargaining table and guarantee good secure and reliable jobs.”

The union said Australia Post recently reported record revenues of $8.27 billion and a profit before tax of $100.7 million. StarTrack is the group’s most profitable arm with volumes up by 12.1% in the last year.

Job security is a big issue in the transport industry; workers at FedEx Linfox and Bevchain have all voted recently to take strike action.

For the past three years Andrews served as chief of staff and executive assistant to Mayor George Flaggs Jr.

“Working for Mayor Flaggs has been an honor and an educational experience of a lifetime” Andrews said. “I along with so many others look forward to the continued progress of Vicksburg because of Mayor Flaggs’ willingness to serve. I’ve seen it firsthand — this city is a better place because of his honesty integrity and leadership.”

Andrews now 26 was hired by Flaggs in July of 2018.

Mayor George Flaggs said “Sam Andrews has served the city well. I told Sam that if he hadn’t taken the job I would have killed him. Anytime you can get a great job like that you have to take it. Sam absolutely deserves and I am thrilled for him his family and his new fiance. This is a plus for Vicksburg too. Now we have a great connection to the Governor’s office in the State of Mississippi.”

Andrews said he had no plans to depart his position before the end of Flaggs’ third term as mayor but could not pass up the opportunity to serve under Reeves’ administration.

“I’m extremely grateful to Gov. Reeves and Chief of Staff Parker Briden for this opportunity and am looking forward to the work ahead” Andrews said.

People in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones but they should throw parties — especially in this glass house that sits outside of Joshua Tree National Park. Known as the Invisible House the elongated 22-story “horizontal skyscraper” is like a mirror-clad mirage in the desert. This once-in-a-lifetime stay is one of the most sought-after properties in Joshua Tree.

One reviewer called it an “inhabitable work of art in the middle of a completely unique landscape.” It has been seen in design and lifestyle publications like Architectural Digest Dezeen TMZ Business Insider and Apartment Therapy — here’s why.

Expertly Designed

The 90-acre property is owned by film producer Chris Hanley who is known for such films as The Virgin Suicides and American Psycho. He designed the building along with Tomas Osinski an artist architect and industrial designer. Osinski has collaborated with the likes of Frank Gehry (designer of the Guggenheim Museum) on several projects including the gorgeous Delft porcelain fountain at the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.

Mindfully Green

The all-electric house incorporates the most advanced materials and technologies available. With an environmental carbon footprint to near zero it’s also as green as can be.

Access To Joshua Tree National Park

The property has its own 4000-foot peak and is filled with hiking trails to explore. Half a mile of it is bordered by Joshua Tree National Park. Guests have direct walk-on access to the national park’s Desert View Conservation Area. While secluded the Invisible House is located just 10 minutes from downtown Joshua Tree.

Outside the Arteflame barbeque grill/griddle transforms into a fire pit for cozy desert stargazing.

Sleep Like A King

Three large luxurious suites with king beds sleep six. The guest beds are pure marble while the master suite’s bed frame is made of solid glass. Weighing in at two tons the glass bed was designed by Santambrogiomilano. Ligne Roset and Tempur-Pedic mattresses are draped with Frette linens and plenty of pillows. Each bedroom has remote-controlled blackout shades but who would want to miss that desert sunrise?

Play whatever music you want wherever you want on the Bose Portable Home Speaker. There’s also a massive 86-inch TV in the living room with streaming services as well as a Blu-Ray DVD with dozens of recent films.

World Patient Safety Day is marked annually on 17 September which provides a great opportunity to build partnerships promote all aspects of patient safety and identify priority areas to be addressed in the journey towards universal health coverage. This year the Day targets another facet of safety under the slogan ""Safe maternal and newborn care"".

To mark the day in Jordan the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the WHO country office and the Health Care Accreditation Council organized a round table discussion on 14 September among different stakeholders mainly service providers to discuss main challenges of patient safety with focus on safe maternal and newborn care and come up with recommendations to address the challenges.

Dr Randa Obeidat Institutional Development and Quality Control Directorate at the Ministry of Health said “The Mministry of Health considers patient safety as one of its top priorities and acknowledges the role of the community in addressing this issue.”

Ms Salma Al Jaouni Chief Executive Officer of The Health Care Accreditation Council added ""It is important to make concerted efforts to develop standards on maternal and newborn safety and include them within quality standards”.

“It’s time to act in solidarity with the Ministry of Health and decision-makers to curtail maternal and child deaths through developing policies and programmes on safe health care delivery and encouraging patient safety by abiding to best practices” said Dr Jamela Al-Raiby acting WHO Representative to Jordan during her opening remarks.

Celebrating the occasion WHO country office staff in Jordan supported the Ministry in illuminating landmarks and monuments in orange including the Arch of Hadrian in Jerash city the Ministry’s building and the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Department at AlBashir Hospital in Amman.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHA6Ly9hdXN0aW50YWxrcy5vcmcvMjAyMS8wOS9uYXRpb25hbC1yZWNvdmVyeS1tb250aC1pcy1wZXJzb25hbC1hbmQtdW5pdmVyc2FsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,National Recovery Month is personal and universal,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPConnectionPool(host='austintalks.org', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: /2021/09/national-recovery-month-is-personal-and-universal/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x000002A778998510>, 'Connection to austintalks.org timed out.

The goal of the day is to stimulate events that promote and advocate the pharmacists' role in promoting health infrastructure in every part of the globe.

They use their knowledge experience and skills to make the medical field a better place for everyone. Also they give access to medications and offer knowledge on their use. Pharmacists contribute among the third largest group of healthcare professionals globally.

Nearly 70 per cent of the Indian population is deprived of basic drugs due to non-availability of medical professionals lack of facilities and lack of advice about the usage of drugs. If the country has a sufficient amount of pharmacists access to drugs and their safe usage can be largely met.



On this occasion Samhita and Cipla jointly conducted a study among Indian pharmacists with an aim to improve Community Healthcare



Key Findings Of The Study Report

The study titled ""Future of Indian Pharmacies"" aimed to enable better business outcomes for pharmacists and enhance their relationships with the community to improve healthcare infrastructure. The study found that pharmacists want to improve their medical skills and knowledge to serve their customers in a better way and 76 per cent reported collaborating with healthcare players to improve outcomes in their localities.

This study was conducted among 1100 pharmacists across the country.



According to the Pharmacy Council of India it is estimated that there are about 657230 registered pharmacists in India.



A substantial proportion of the pharmacists saw themselves as 'supporters of people's health needs' (57%) and 'part of the medical community' (45%). Around 61 per cent of them stated that they wanted to prioritise improving their medical skill and knowledge to serve their customers better.



When asked about the awareness levels of their customers many of the pharmacists said that their 'customers are not very aware' (38%) and 'take guidance from me' (30%). The most common health challenge as reported by the pharmacists was non-communicable diseases (NCDs) mainly diabetes and hypertension.



In India as the daily disease burden of NCDs has risen from 30% in 1990 to 55% in 2016 with an expectation to rise further the pharmacist's role can go beyond providing guidance on acute illnesses to advocate for NCD prevention and management.



Only 9 per cent said that they would move to another business in the future making it clear that India's pharmacists are invested in improving their business outcomes as it is their primary long-term occupation.



In addition to providing medicines 41% of the pharmacies also offer basic medical guidance to their customers.

Nearly 80 per cent of pharmacists accessed information about healthcare and medicine through doctor's prescriptions and pharmaceutical companies while 40% used 'social media and internet' to learn about healthcare. This depicts their initiative to learn but can also be harmful due to rampant misinformation on the internet.



The report stated that the needs and potential of pharmacists can be understood. By supporting their capacity building (through training in advocacy recording-keeping customer relations etc.) they can leverage their skills and position to improve overall community health outcomes.



Drivers Of Better Community Health

""Pharmacists are deeply connected to the communities they serve and are often trusted by their customers for medical advice which uniquely positions them as champions and drivers of better community health. As demonstrated in the knowledge collaboration with Cipla there is a substantial opportunity for private and public sectors to effect positive outcomes in healthcare by strengthening and supporting pharmacies in their quest to learn more grow their business and gain the confidence and trust of their communities"" Priya Naik Founder and CEO of Samhita Social Ventures said in a press release.



Challenges Faced By Pharmacists



Despite being in potentially pivotal roles pharmacists face several daily operational challenges like unstable prices of medicines and FMCG products and inadequate access to supplies. A third of the pharmacists surveyed also report challenges with basic and effective record-keeping of their sales and inventory.



As one of the first specific knowledge pieces on pharmacy needs there is a requirement to support pharmacies to become stronger and more credited stakeholders in delivering affordable basic health care requirements.



""India is experiencing a rapid disease transition and chronic diseases are becoming more prevalent in the lives of Indians. Many health systems around the world have realised that to address this very large and growing problem healthcare will need to deploy multiple channels of engagement with people and that pharmacies are ideally placed to complement the efforts of other more traditional channels"" Nachiket Mor PhD and visiting scientist of the Banyan Academy for Leadership in Mental Health advised in the release.



""Pharmacies have a large presence even in the remotest parts of India and involving them in treatment and prevention efforts in a structured way offers the opportunity to create a large-scale impact and build a dense and ubiquitous multi-channel primary care network that is essential to universal health care"" he added.

No more ‘Poor care for poor people’

Rebecca Quaicoe Duho Lifestyle Sep - 25 - 2021  10:50

This was the sentiment expressed by a woman whose child died because she could not pay the insurance premium of GH¢15 which would have entitled her to free health care.

The crux of the matter is that Ghana needs a health policy that will adequately address the gap between the rich and the poor in terms of access to healthcare services at health facilities across the country.

This is where Universal Health Care (UHC) comes in.

The way out of this is captured in a paper titled: “Achieving a Shared Goal: Free Universal Health Care in Ghana” put together by the Alliance for Reproductive Health Rights Essential Services Platform of Ghana ISODEC and Oxfam.

Government’s efforts

Trumpeting the government’s success story in the implementation of UHC the Government’s Advisor on Health Dr Anthony Nsiah-Asare in an interview in Accra said the government was working to ensure that nobody travelled more than five kilometres to access health care or lacked access to health care because of financial constraints.

He said the government was using the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) to help take care of the financial problems of people; Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) compounds for places where the population was more than 5000 as the basic healthcare provider in communities health centres for the sub-districts and district hospitals as first primary healthcare referral centres.

He said it was making sure that every district had fit-for-purpose well-equipped district hospitals to ensure that people did not travel for health care or face any financial hindrances.

111 Hospitals

To that end Dr Nsiah-Asare said the government was also building 111 hospitals made up of six regional hospitals for the newly created regions 101 district hospitals two new mental health facilities the redevelopment of the Accra Psychiatric Hospital and an additional regional hospital for the Western Region.

Ghana’s situation

Financing health is seen as a major challenge that needs further discussion as the UHC strategy seeks to mobilise the equivalent of at least US$7 billion over 10 years in non-wage-resources including Gross Domestic Product (GDP) allocation.

According to the Minister of Health Mr Kwaku Agyeman-Manu Ghana’s definition of the UHC “implies all people living in Ghana should have timely access to high-quality health services irrespective of ability to pay at the point of use”.

Another addition to the international definition of the UHC as prescribed by the WHO is “irrespective of ability to pay at the point of use” and according to the Director of Policy Planning Monitoring and Evaluation at the Ministry of Health Dr Emmanuel Odame health was a human right issue and therefore the Ghanaian should not be denied care because he or she could not pay and that was why the NHIS came in.

He said the UHC document hinged on three main objectives — universal access to better and efficiently managed quality healthcare services reduced unnecessary maternal adolescent and child deaths and disabilities and increased access to responsive clinical and public health emergency services.

Among other things he said the objectives were looking at revamping primary health care since primary care was being looked at as “poor care for poor people”.

“How do we make it smart care for everyone?” he asked.

He said that was the real question that needed to be asked as the rich and the poor should be able to seek primary health care from CHPS compounds health centres and district hospitals.

He said Ghana was looking at a primary healthcare service that encompassed curative preventive rehabilitative palliative promotive emergency care and mental health and called for the recalibration of staff which encompassed incentives to ensure that there were doctors and nurses at all levels.

Reactions

A father of five Mr Rholand Adom said although the NHIS currently being practised under the UHC in the country had been beneficial to him especially as he had five young children much could be done about it for it to benefit the masses.

According to him although he and his family were covered by the NHIS he still had to cough out some money when he sent his children to hospital.

A steel bender by profession Mr Adom said recently he had to send one of his children for a laboratory test at a community hospital which accepted the NHIS card but he still had to find ways and means to pay for the service at the laboratory as it did not acceptthe NHIS card.

He said if there was a way that private hospitals and their laboratories could be made to accept the NHIS card then most people would be able to access quality care and live healthier lives.

Meanwhile he said in all the NHIS was a blessing to him as he was able to send his children to public hospitals for free.

A nurse by profession Mr Edmund Doudu who is currently based in Koforidua in the Eastern Region is of the view that not enough is being done to achieve the Agenda 2030 of the Abuja Declaration under UHC.

He said the declaration states among other things that at least 15 per cent of a country's budgeting should go into health financing but Ghana was currently doing about eight per cent.

A World Health Organisation Young Leader whose main focus is into UHC and Primary Health Care Mr Duodu also says there was still much to be done at the patients level as well as the level of medical personnel.

He said although UHC is supposed to be the main access to health care at the primary level access is most often not available. Almost 88 districts across the country he said do not have district hospitals and therefore most pregnant women do not have access to scan nor laboratory services.

Health practitioners he said also lack the needed incentives especially those at the district levels a situation which he said was preventing them from accepting postings to local hospitals.

Another barrier to UHC he said is the situation where as medical professionals they have to pay for their medical bills any time they fall sick and this he says needs to be addressed.

Health financing

Ghana’s UHC policy intimates that the government will work towards allocating at least an additional one per cent of GDP to primary health care and seek additional sources of financing with emphasis placed on optimising fiscal allocation and use.

The policy also indicates that the NHIS financing framework and management will undergo reforms to improve its efficiency as the scheme will prioritise primary health care and allocate at least 50 per cent of its resources to fund primary health care (PHC) expenditure.

The policy also states that all primary healthcare facilities will have their operational debts paid off and recapitalised using a fund-holding approach.

These funds will be considered operational credits based on signed performance agreements and ensuring long-term financial sustainability.

On donor funding the document says the health sector has over the years been co-funded by development partners and that donor finances were stable until recently when several development partners began transitioning out with the change in the development status of the country as a low middle-income country.

Grants and credits

Grants and credits will be contracted more strategically based on the development of a five-year health sector medium-term plan. Unsolicited technical assistance and assistance not directly linked to advancing the road-map agenda will be discouraged.

In aid and development partner management the principles of the ‘Paris Declaration and the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All’ will be followed.

All development partners will sign up to a compact in which they and the government will agree a mutual framework for engagement acceleration alignment and accountability.

This will serve as a management arrangement and commitment note to reduce fragmentation improve resource pooling matching and predictability. Partners will be required to align their resources with one another and with the government through models of co-financing or parallel co-financing arrangements. The aim is to improve synergies.

There will be de-emphasis of commercial loans. A commodities medicines supplements and vaccine phase-in/phase-out and sustainability framework agreement will be renegotiated with relevant partners and the private sector to improve long-term sustainability.

A deliberate attempt will be made to crowd in private sector investments and capital.

Global situation

Currently according to the WHO at least half of the people in the world do not receive the health services they need.

It also says about 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty each year because of out-of-pocket spending on health.

To make health for all a reality the world health body is calling for individuals and communities to have access to high quality health services so that they take care of their own health and the health of their families.

Skilled health workers are also urged to provide quality people-centred care while policy makers also commit to investing in UHC.

Universal health coverage the WHO says should be based on strong people-centred PHC adding that good health systems are rooted in the communities they serve.

It says UHC is focused not only on preventing and treating diseases and illnesses but also helping to improve well-being and quality of life.

Background

An article entitled: “Ghana’s Journey towards Universal Health Coverage: The Role of the National Health Insurance Scheme” in the European Journal of Investigation in Health Psychology and Education gives the history of Ghana’s health policies to include the fact that it gained political independence in 1957 and has since assumed its own public policies including health policies.

Ghana practised ‘free health care for all’ after independence but it was limited to public hospitals and clinics with less involvement of private health facilities especially private for-profit facilities.

It said the poor collaboration between public and private facilities in the provision of healthcare services was more serious in rural Ghana where few private health facilities were licensed to provide essential healthcare services.

This situation exposed rural folks to untrained and unlicensed service providers which affected accessibility and quality control.

Ghana’s health system at independence was highly centralised and that also affected rural areas as health services were far from them.

The ‘free health care for all’ was abolished during the military rule and replaced with ‘user-fees’. It was replaced with the ‘user-fees’ which started in 1969 under the Hospital Fees Decree which was later amended to Hospital Fees Act in 1971.

Most Ghanaians and persons resident in Ghana complained about the ‘user-fees’ as unfriendly and that they did not promote equity in healthcare services; the reason being that poor and vulnerable people had limited access to healthcare services and essential drugs.

By 1985 Ghana’s health system had changed from ‘user-fees’ system to ‘cash and carry system’ (CCS). The CCS is a practice where people must pay cash before they are attended to at health facilities.

The CCS created more health inequities among various groups rich and poor rural and urban workers and unemployed groups. Rich and privileged groups could pay and thus had more access to health services than poor and vulnerable groups."

El interés por estar al cuidado de sus hijos así como el amor por la cocina llevaron a Viridiana a emprender en 2017 un negocio de venta de lasañas que prepara desde su hogar y las envía a domicilio lo que le permite pasar más tiempo al pendiente de su familia.

Viridiana Rascón es licenciada en Publicidad y mercadotecnia pero considera que la mayoría de los trabajos convencionales suelen ser muy demandantes en cuanto a horario y tiempo hecho que no le resulta favorable pues sus pequeños llevan actividades extracurriculares que requieren de atención y tiempo y su esposo trabaja todo el día.

“Muchas veces los horarios de los trabajos son muy demandantes y yo quería estar al pendiente y al cuidado de mis hijos por lo cual necesitaba un trabajo donde pudiera tener una agenda propia y que pudiera programarme. Siempre me ha gustado la cocina y siempre me decían que tengo buen sazón y que las lasañas me quedaban muy ricas y pues un día me animé a emprender ese negocio”.

Comentó que en estos cuatro años que lleva con su emprendimiento su esposo la ha apoyado muchísimo; han logrado hacer un buen equipo pues él le ayuda con algunas entregas y también a la hora de ir a comprar los insumos para preparar las lasañas.

Contrario a lo que pensaba la llegada de la pandemia le benefició pues al estar en casa las personas comenzaron a realizar más pedidos logrando así incrementar sus ventas considerablemente.

“Yo creo que en este tiempo he tenido un incremento en las ventas de entre 50 y 70%. Diciembre también es un mes con mucha demanda” señaló Viridiana.

Un mercado diferente

Al principio de la pandemia en marzo de 2020 Viridiana pensó que quizá tendría una afectación considerable en su negocio; sin embargo y para su sorpresa no fue así pues mayo fue uno de los meses que mejores ventas logró principalmente por los festejos del Día de las Madres.

Otro detalle que abonó al incremento de las ventas fue que las personas comenzaron a reunirse en grupos mucho más pequeños de máximo cinco personas lo que para ella fue favorable ya que tiene un paquete especial para esa cantidad de comensales.

“Yo manejo un paquete de lasaña chico que es ideal para cinco personas aproximadamente y ese fue uno de los más pedidos al menos durante los primeros meses de 2020. Igual para diciembre cuando las personas decidieron hacer algunas posadas con poca gente me hicieron muchos pedidos de lasaña chica”.

Viridiana también decidió implementar los cobros por transferencia electrónica algo que les resulta muy útil a las personas pues así evitan intercambiar dinero en efectivo.

Con las actualizaciones que implementó en su negocio y los protocolos sanitarios que han seguido siempre a la hora de realizar las entregas la venta de las lasañas ha podido crecer y se ha diversificado. A la fecha maneja cuatro variedades del platillo: clásica de pollo de vegetales y keto.

“En promedio tengo entre 15 y 20 pedidos por mes. Diciembre es el mes con mejores ventas gracias a los festejos; durante las fechas decembrinas preparo de 2 a 3 lasañas por día. La verdad de 2020 a la fecha se ha incrementado mucho el número de pedidos y estoy muy agradecida por ello pues siempre recibo comentarios positivos de la gente”.

Local OCV Hermosillo apuesta a nuevos mercados para atraer turismo

El pasado 7 de septiembre Viridiana cumplió sus primeros cuatro años de negocio y para celebrarlo (como cada año) realizó una dinámica para regalar un paquete de lasaña entre sus clientes más fieles.

En ese sentido mencionó que las redes sociales han sido una plataforma muy buena para darse a conocer y obtener más ventas.

Durante la pandemia los llamados give away tomaron fuerza y tanto en Facebook como en Instagram Viridiana decidió realizarlos para consentir a sus clientes y seguir obteniendo seguidores.

“Los give away siguen siendo lo más solicitado y que más les gusta a mis clientes. Yo siempre a final de año realizo una rifa con todos mis clientes las personas que me estuvieron comprando en ese año y ellos me apoyan compartiendo las publicaciones y la página en sí. El Día Internacional de la Lasaña regalé una también en septiembre cuando es el aniversario del negocio igual regalo lasaña. He tratado de hacer muchas dinámicas de 2020 a la fecha”.

Por último comentó que desea en un futuro poder tener un establecimiento propio en donde pueda ofrecer sus lasañas así como otros productos quizá de comida italiana. Y para aquellas personas que están pensando en emprender su consejo fue que encuentren pronto el valor para aventurarse.

“Yo les diría que no le den tantas vueltas. En donde tienen miedos y dudas ahí es. Si lo estás pensando ahí es. Deben aventarse no hay un momento exacto o justo el mejor momento siempre será cuando decidas iniciar” concluyó.

Juan López Escamilla comerciante de materiales escolares comentó que el regreso a clases sonaba muy esperanzador para sus ventas este año luego de ser fuertemente golpeados por la pandemia por más de año y medio sin embargo no han sido así.

“Ha sido todo un fiasco nosotros invertimos lo que teníamos ahorrado para surtir mercancía porque esperábamos que mucha gente viniera a surtirse pero no ha sido así tenemos más del 50% de nuestros ahorros ahí invertidos y ya no sale”

“Primero pensamos que las primeras dos semanas serian tranquilas en lo que las familias se iban acomodando pero en la tercera nos íbamos a recuperar y nada ya va casi un mes y nada” comentó el comerciante.

El comerciante expresó que es un duro golpe para los bolsillos de los cientos de comerciantes que se arriesgaron a invertir con la esperanza de recuperar lo invertido o de sacar la mercancía que tienen estancada a casi dos años.

De acuerdo con el gerente de la Asociación Colombiana de Semillas y Biotecnología Acosemillas Leonardo Ariza “en Colombia en algunos cultivos principalmente en arroz  soya maíz y algodón se está afectando la producción de estos productos por el uso de semillas piratas que no son reconocidas ni certificadas por la autoridad sanitaria que en este caso es el ICA”.

El dirigente gremial señaló que “el problema es muy grave porque cálculos que hemos hecho nos arrojan cifras cercanas a $1 billón al año en ventas de estas semillas piratas eso es una cifra escandalosa”.

Ariza explicó que por ejemplo en el tema del arroz  “hay algunos grupos de productores que en vez de llevar el arroz a los molinos como debiera ser lo tratan como si fueran semillas y eso no debería ser así porque la semilla certificada se obtiene de un proceso de investigación de desarrollo que dura en ocasiones hasta cinco años para sacar una variedad al mercado y en esas investigaciones se alcanza la calidad genética física y resistencia a plagas necesaria para ofrecer garantía al mercado”.

Según la Asociación el uso de estas semillas piratas puede poner en riesgo la seguridad alimentaria del país.

“Cuando se venden semillas piratas no hay garantía porque el proceso ya se cumplió con la producción de ese cultivo del que salió. La semilla de buena calidad es la base de 40% del rendimiento del cultivo es decir que ya empezando la siembra del cultivo con una buena semilla se tiene garantizado ese porcentaje de éxito el resto depende de una buena práctica agrícola riego fertilización y control de plagas” comentó Ariza.

Ahora contrario a lo expuesto por Acosemillas el viceministro de Asuntos Agropecuarios del Ministerio de Agricultura Juan Gonzalo Botero afirmó que “el uso de semillas piratas genera una reducción en el rendimiento del cultivo pero tampoco para llegar a asegurar que está en riesgo la seguridad alimentaria del país”.

Por su parte el subgerente de Protección Vegetal del Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario ICA Herberth Matheus Gómez indicó que “cuando hacemos el control estricto a la ilegalidad de semillas a veces la queja es que no hay disponibilidad de semillas certificadas y eso sí afecta con la seguridad alimentaria del país.

LOS CONTRASTES

Juan Gonzalo Botero Viceministro de Asuntos Agropecuarios “El uso de semillas piratas genera una reducción en el rendimiento del cultivo pero tampoco para llegar a asegurar que está en riesgo la seguridad alimentaria del país”.

No obstante Gómez señaló que “desde el ICA hemos venido haciendo brigadas de detención de esas semillas piratas en el Valle del Cauca en los Llanos Orientales y la Costa Atlántica porque las mayores quejas están en algodón soya maíz y arroz”.

En ese sentido el subgerente del ICA comentó que “hemos estado mirando en qué empresas están acondicionando estas semillas y de hecho ya iniciamos algunos procesos sancionatorios en Cesar y Casanare”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGVzcGFub2wuY29tL2ludmVydGlhL2VtcHJlc2FzL2Rpc3RyaWJ1Y2lvbi8yMDIxMDkyNS9mYWJyaWNhbnRlLWNlcnZlemEtc3RlaW5idXJnLW1lcmNhZG9uYS1kaXNwYXJvLWJlbmVmaWNpby1jb3ZpZC82MTM5Mzg4NTlfMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,El fabricante de la cerveza Steinburg de Mercadona disparó sus ventas y su beneficio en plena Covid,"La compañía de envasado de refrescos y embotelladora de agua Font Salem proveedora de las marcas de cerveza de Mercadona El Corte Inglés o Lid aumentó su facturación hasta llegar a los 366 millones en 2019 un 19% más que un año anterior según sus cuentas depositadas recientemente en el Registro Mercantil.

La compañía también registró un aumento de los beneficios de un 40% de 218 millones a 306 millones en un año marcado por la Covid y que al negocio de la propia empresa no afectó.

Futuro tranquilo

Además de cara al futuro tampoco se esperan importantes impactos derivados de la pandemia. “La situación cambiante de los acontecimientos supone una incertidumbre sobre la actividad del próximo ejercicio que si bien se espera que siga creciendo dependerá de las restricciones que se establezcan durante 2021” añade.

La sociedad cuenta con un activo circulante de 64 millones de euros y una tesorería de 22 millones de euros. En consecuencia los administradores estiman que los impactos de la Covid no suponen en todo caso ninguna duda en relación a la aplicación del principio de empresa en funcionamiento.

Font Salem dispone de tres centros productivos situados en lugares estratégicos que permiten dar respuesta rápida a la demanda en la península ibérica con el menor coste posible. Asimismo su proximidad a los puertos de Valencia y Lisboa supone una ventaja competitiva para la exportación mercado éste por el que está apostando en su estrategia de globalización.

Así la sociedad asegura que continúa en su labor de potenciar dichos centros e incrementar la rentabilidad de explotación mediante el esfuerzo inversor necesario para disponer de la tecnología y los recursos más adecuados para continuar en la senda de crecimiento en la que se halla la compañía."

I’m not new to this stuff. I’ve owned every iPhone but the first one and while some upgrades have been rocky this one was particularly bad.

Frustratingly activating the iPhone 13 Pro took hours and time with Verizon’s tech support: the new eSIM card option Apple has implemented didn’t work off the bat as it should’ve. Even after pulling the old SIM card out from my previous iPhone 12 Pro the new device tried to force me into using two phone lines (probably helpful for certain business travelers or international users but unintuitive and unnecessary for most of us). Ultimately swapping the physical SIM card didn’t work and Verizon had to re-provision my account to get it online. It didn't come with directions and both Apple and Verizon's websites didn't offer much guidance. While I could jump through these tech hurdles I can’t imagine the frustration a less experienced user would encounter throughout this process.

Also despite Apple’s usually seamless phone transferring process none of my passwords carried over. Normally Keychain could handle this but within apps like Twitter Facebook Instagram and online banking Keychain doesn’t share this kind of data. So prepare yourself to spend time resetting them individually.

Apple was famous for telling us “it just works.” Well not this time. It’s stunning to me that the tech behemoth still hasn’t figured this out by now.

Early issues aside this is a solid phone and definitely the best iPhone ever. Here's what it's like:

In short it’s kind of a mixed bag.

Physically the iPhone 13 Pro looks almost exactly the same as its predecessor. The much maligned “notch” is still there just a little smaller. The three camera lenses protrude farther out which means when you set the phone on a table it rocks more awkwardly. That's a big bump. X

The screen is indeed brighter although holding the phone next to its predecessor it’s not much of a difference. For the very hyped increased “ProMotion” 120Hz self-throttling screen refresh rate I don’t notice a difference scrolling or swiping or in regular app usage.

At least on the first day I don’t notice many other changes. The speakers sound the same: excellent. I don’t feel a speed difference although I didn’t observe one upgrading from the iPhone 11 Pro to the 12 Pro either. MagSafe is great but that’s not new. And once again iOS 15 is the star of the show – but some of the cooler features like SharePlay didn’t make the cut for the initial release this week.

Still these are not the reasons that bougie power users like myself upgraded. This phone is all about the camera. Photos with good light look amazing as usual. X Portrait mode in night mode looks very sharp. X

In night mode all three lenses perform better than ever. Images are less muddy and noisy and the f/1.5 aperture for the main lens is excellent. Most importantly to me the iPhone 13 Pro comes with a 3x optical 77 mm lens instead of the 2x optical lens iPhones have sported for a few years. This makes a big difference in practical use because prior to this year’s phone anytime you zoomed it past 50 mm you were just basically cropping an image and decreasing its quality. You can shoot pretty good photos in almost pitch blackness but without a tripod it's still not perfect. X Portrait mode in the daylight makes any photo artistic. X

Macro photography will come in handy too when you use the ultra-wide angle lens – not just for snapping pics of bugs but for getting close up to documents that previous iPhones couldn’t focus on. Still when it works it’s great but I found it tough to keep the subject in focus. So if you are actually taking photos of bugs good luck convincing them to stand still while you get the perfect shot. Portrait mode in low-light situations is very good. Macro mode is cool but hard to focus. X There's only so much an improved front-facing camera can do. X

The front-facing camera is much better too. Selfies still use a weird unflattering aperture but they are much sharper (“TrueDepth” magic!).

The coolest new feature however is Cinematic mode for video which is sort of like Portrait mode for stills – the focus and depth of field changes automatically creating a more artsy effect that like Portrait mode will make ordinary video look much improved. Being able to change the depth of field for different types of bokeh after you shoot is some next-level wizardry. My only issue in my initial testing is that Cinematic mode was a little choppy and that detracts from its awesomeness. As always it can take a full day to finally sync up everything on a new iPhone so perhaps that lagginess will improve as this pocket supercomputer settles into itself.

Battery life is apparently improved with an extra 1.5 hours per charge on this model – it will take longer than a day for me to see if that’s true. The new graphite color looks good and I don’t intend to ruin the aesthetic with a case either.

Nonetheless this phone should’ve been called an “S” model. Except for the amazing camera – which is reason enough to upgrade for someone like me who has ditched my beloved Sony A6000 mirrorless camera to shoot everything on my iPhone – this is a very very subtle upgrade.

So should you buy it? That depends. Apple is running some insane upgrade offers right now that make it more attractive. After trading in a one-year old iPhone this one will only cost $360 and I’ve been saying this for years: these devices are not refrigerators or washing machines. They just don’t last more than a year or two with heavy use. For something that you use 12 hours per day (or at least I do) for work and for play even paying full price at about $42 per month make sense – though why drop a grand on this phone all at once?

But even taking out the hassle of upgrading if you don’t care about the best camera most of us have ever owned or the more powerful processor available or the increased battery capacity ... then no you still probably won’t notice much of a difference from the iPhone 11 or 12. Yeah this one has 5G (as did the 12) but in real-life it’s exactly the same as 4G in almost all locations.

Do I sound tepid? Because I am. However I find myself shooting in a lot of low-light situations and the improved camera makes a big impact. And that 3x telephoto lens will make a big difference in real-life situations too. More importantly I work more from my iPhone these days than I do from my MacBook Pro. I still edit video on my laptop and use it for writing. Otherwise my phone is my go-to device for most situations in 2021.

So yeah I guess I’m glad I bought this iPhone. Just not over the moon with this iterative upgrade. Honestly if your job isn’t like mine or unless your phone is more than two years old you could just skip this one and wait until next year for the iPhone 14.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaWJkZW0uY29tL25ld3MvbWljaGVsZS1tLWJlbmRlci13aG8tYW0taS9hcnRpY2xlXzRkNjU4ZGFjLTFlZmMtMTFlYy1hYmM5LWEzYWM5ZjU3MTk1OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michele M.

|

Looking for the best pet cameras for RV use to keep tabs on your pets in the RV while you are out and about? We have three to suggest.

Let's face it: traveling with our pets is great. But they are not welcome in all the places we may want to visit. There are many situations where you will have to leave them alone in the RV.

Why you may need a pet camera for RV use

Some examples:

Many national and state parks prohibit pets – leashed or unleashed – from being on hiking and nature trails.

Museums restaurants movie theaters visitor centers tourist attractions and other businesses almost all have pet prohibitions unless the animals are certified service dogs or pets.

It isn't practical or safe to bring your pet on a bicycle ride unless you tow a pet trailer or have a secure spot in a basket for very small pets.

Shopping in the quaint downtowns you visit on an RV trip is challenging at best with a pet even when leashed.

Pets are almost always not allowed on beaches where you may want to go swimming. Same with swimming pols in RV parks or community centers

Choosing a pet camera for RV use

There are several things to look for in choosing a pet camera for RV use.

Most important is how you can access it. You want to use an app that will connect with the camera in your RV so you can see your pet.

The camera should be of sufficient resolution to clearly see the interior of the RV. Look for one that is at least 1080p.

The camera should livestream either through a subscription that accesses a cellular network or one that connects with the Internet through your RV's Wi-Fi network

A microphone that lets you monitor the sound inside the RV is important. Is your pet whining or crying? Is the air conditioner on? Is an alarm or beeping sound happening because of a malfunction in a piece of equipment? When you call up the image you want to be able to hear all those things if they are occurring.

The audio should be two-way meaning you should have the opportunity to push a button on the app from wherever you happen to be and be heard by your pet inside the RV.

And finally the video should work in the dark offering infrared vision.

Now here are three pet cameras we suggest for your consideration.

Great Pet Camera for RV Use: The WaggleCam

The WaggleCam pet camera for RV

This camera is made by the same people who make the $199 Waggle RV/Dog Safety Temperature and Humidity Monitor which we use in our RV to send an alert to our smartphone if the temperature inside the RV gets too warm. It uses the Verizon 4g LTE network to connect to the Internet and requires a yearly subscription to use.

The WaggleCam instead of having its own cellular Internet connection it connects via whatever wifi network you already have in your RV. Thus it needs no subscription.

It's about half the size of a basketball which makes it way larger than other pet cameras for RV competing products.

It's big because it has a hollowed-out center part where you can dump in small treats for your pet. From the app you can then shoot out treats with the push of a button on the app screen.

This is a wired unit. There is no battery power. It needs to be plugged into a 110-volt receptacle.

And if you are just looking for a reliable video livestream of your pet when you leave it alone in the RV then read on.

Next Most Expensive Pet Camera for RV Use: The Furbo Dog Camera

The Furbo Dog Camera is loaded with useful features

At $159 this unit also tosses treats has HD live video two-way audio and even a barking sensor that sends you an instant text message when it detects a lot of parking from your dog.

You can then call up the live image see what's happening talk to assure your pet all is well and dispense him a treat. It works on your RV's wifi network. Furbo says this feature alone has saved hundreds of pets from fires and other disasters.

You can adjust the sensitivity to the bark detection.

Another really fun feature is the doggie diary. It makes a montage of clips from your dog's time alone that you can go back and review.

This unit at much less cost than the WaggleCam (unless you use the discount codes) has a lot more useful features.

Least Expensive but Best Value Pet Camera for RV Use: the Least Expensive but Best Value Pet Camera for RV Use: the Wyze Cam v3 Pet Camera

At $59 this is one terrific pet camera for RV use. It offers 2K Video Resolution

Wyze camera

It's mostly used as a home security camera – it can safely be used outside – but it is also very popular with RVers.

We were at the Hershey RV Show a while back and two of our followers Mike and Clarissa Shumaker of Chesterfield VA pulled out their smartphones and showed me the excellent quality video they had from the Wyze camera from their RV which was parked a half-mile away in the parking lot.

Here's a photo of the live image from their Wyze of their dog Louie seen in the lower right corner.

The Shumaker's dog Louie seen on their Wyze pet camera for RV

It needs to be plugged into a 110-volt current but offers live streaming and recording to the cloud.

For $30 this is a Pet Camera for RV use that I'd certainly recommend.

Pre-orders leading up to the launch seemed strong especially due to carrier deals and promotions. We hit the streets to get a firsthand look at what the latest launch event can tell us about the demand for these latest iPhones. Here are five key takeaways:

Store traffic is up again in Apple Stores. 2020 was a tough launch year for Apple and the iPhone 12. The launch was staggered over two months and COVID-19 restrictions made going into stores less appealing. This year however we have seen people line up again to pick-up orders or reserve an iPhone for a later time. It’s not like the massive lines for the iPhone 6 or iPhone 7 launch events but it’s still showing a return to brick-and-mortar to an extent. Online sales remain a key driver for Apple however.

Pre-order deals are strong this year. All carriers are offering up to $1000 for the iPhone 13 Pro models with trade-ins and select unlimited plans while the iPhone 13 models have promotions for $800 with in credit. Verizon was the most aggressive however offering an extra $500 Prepaid Mastercard for those who switch to its network for the iPhone 13 Pro model. Apple’s own trade-in value offers topped off at $790.

Demand for iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max were higher than the regular iPhone 13. This is not unusual especially for the launch day. Power users and those on Apple’s yearly iPhone Upgrade Program tend to upgrade first getting both the best performing iPhones and also going for higher memory configurations such as the 1TB option.

Apple Stores as well as carrier stores are already short on inventory. Shipment dates continue to be pushed out. This is especially true due to the high demand for the iPhone 13 Pro Max which Apple.com is estimating being shipped between October 25th and November 1st. Certain colors such as gold or pink seem to be lean on inventory as well. Apple continues to limit shipments to carriers during launch periods as it wants to drive customers to its own stores which creates additional shortages for carriers.

A minority of people are coming in for the iPhone 12 at this time. But this may change. Since the launch of the iPhone 13 the iPhone 12 received a $100 haircut. This is enticing some customers looking to upgrade to a 5G iPhone without needing to spend more money on the iPhone 13. While the iPhone 13 does have a longer battery and additional camera it may not be enough to convince some. We will likely see more people going with the iPhone 12 after this launch period as carriers move to update their “N -1” iPhone slot.

Joe Manchin’s (D-W.V.)’s daughter worked with Pfizer Inc. in 2016 to monopolize and raise the price of the EpiPen while the company gave generous campaign donations to Manchin.

Manchin’s daughter Heather Bresch was the president and chief executive officer of Mylan Inc. a pharmaceutical company that specialized in generic drugs. The company raised the price of a two-pack of EpiPen from around $124 in 2009 to $609 in 2016. Bresch left the company in 2020 after Mylan merged with Upjohn Pfizer’s generic division in November 2020 to form Viatris Inc. Bresch began working at the company in 1992 and became CEO in 2012.

Before it became Viatris Mylan was one of the largest campaign contributors to Manchin’s campaigns in five election cycles donating around $211000 to his campaigns since 2009 through PACs and employees. In 2010 the company’s PAC and its employees were the largest donors to Manchin’s first Senate run and Viatris is the number one career donor to Manchin including past donations from Mylan. In Manchin’s second Senate election in 2016 Mylan was the second highest contributor to the West Virginia senator.

And during the 2010 and 2012 election cycles the largest donor to Mylan’s PAC was Bresch donating the maximum amount ($5000) for a donor to a multicandidate corporate PAC both times. Manchin’s campaign also received the most money from Mylan’s PAC ($10000) in the 2010 election cycle.

In the 2016 and 2018 cycles Bresch again donated the maximum amount of $5000 to the PAC but no money from the PAC went to her father’s campaign. Her husband Jeff Bresch also donated the maximum amount to the PAC in 2018.

In 2016 complaints arose on social media about the high costs of EpiPens after the price of a two-pack rose 400 percent between 2009 and 2016. Bresch even gained the attention of the House Oversight Committee which asked her to testify and to hand over documents about EpiPen.

“Looking back I wish we had better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration of the rising financial issues for a growing minority of patients who may have ended up paying the full price or more” Bresch said to the committee in her testimony.

That same year Mylan settled a suit with the Department of Justice alongside other government agencies for $465 million over whether it overcharged the Medicaid program for EpiPens. Bresch was called in front of Congress again in December 2016 to explain the details of the settlement but refused to testify. At a Forbes event the day after she was supposed to testify Bresch stated that while she was apologetic for the company raising the price of the drug the higher costs were due to “improvements” to the design of the delivery mechanism.

Manchin stood by his daughter in 2016 and said that they had to keep the business parts of their lives “separate.” He also continued to accept campaign contributions from Mylan.

Manchin’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

“I think that they saw that I was a very hard worker and if I did struggle with things I would work to overcome them"" Goesl said. ""I was very glad for them to give me any input like any problems or any mistakes I would try my very best to fix it.”

He said he has been dancing ballet since he was 3 years old and lived in Texarkana. He is soon to graduate from WT and is proud to be able to have a career in a field he is passionate about.

“I love getting on the stage I love being in front of the audience and seeing my impact and seeing their reactions of us dancing” Goesl said.

He said he is grateful for the recognition of his hard work that led to him becoming a dancer in the Circle of Excellence this year.

“It's really like its own status"" Goesl said. ""It's just given me the opportunity to show the younger kids that they can look up to me.”

Sarah Gallagher of Canton Ga. and Jennifer Peng of San Diego Calif. all posted 2-under-par 70s on Saturday to share the lead after the first round of stroke play in the 34th U.S. Women’s Mid-Amateur Championship being conducted on the North Course at Berkeley Hall Club.

Buck 33 who was a quarterfinalist in 2019 Gallagher 48 and Peng the youngest competitor in the field after turning 25 and becoming eligible for the event on July 10 were among only four players to break par on Saturday. Shannon Johnson the 2018 champion finished one stroke back with a 1-under 71.

After turning at 3 over par Buck rattled off five consecutive birdies on holes 4 through 8. That birdie stretch included a 3 on the 370-yard par-4 fifth hole which ranked as the toughest hole during Round 1. She said her ball-striking dramatically improved over the closing nine.

“I really started to hit my irons better giving myself a chance at a couple short ones” said Buck a club fitter who played her college golf at Northern Arizona University. “It’s amazing to go on a hot run like that especially during the first day where you’re trying to post something good to move on.”

Gallagher’s round consisted of seven birdies against five bogeys. Starting on No. 10 she got off to a blistering start with birdies on her first three holes.

“After playing the practice rounds I knew that there were going to be a couple holes that were bogey holes ones that play a little longer for me” said Gallagher a sixth-grade social studies teacher in Roswell Ga. who played collegiately at the University of Florida. “I knew that if I made some birdies early that it would be a manageable round and fortunately [I] started out with three straight birdies.”

Peng posted the lone eagle on Day 1 as she made a 3 on the 519-yard par-5 15th.

“I hit a good drive and had 250 [yards] in and figured I wasn’t going to reach the green” said Peng. “It got a great kick and trickled nine feet from the hole while the group ahead of us was still putting. I felt so bad that I actually got it up there but making the putt was a nice feeling.”

Peng a senior financial analyst last played in a USGA championship at the 2014 U.S. Women’s Amateur. After graduating from Yale University in 2018 and moving to New York she took a short hiatus from the game before a move back home to San Diego last August got her back playing regularly.

Seven-time USGA champion Ellen Port was one of three players to card an even-par 72. Port 60 is playing in her 27th U.S. Women’s Mid-Amateur after finishing runner-up to Lara Tennant nine days ago in the U.S. Senior Women’s Amateur at The Lakewood Club in Point Clear Ala.

What's Next

Round 2 of stroke play will begin at 7:30 a.m. EDT on Sunday and the low 64 players will qualify for match play which begins on Monday. If necessary a playoff to determine the final match-play spots will take place on Sunday after the completion of Round 2.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53b25kZXJ3YWxsLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3doZXJlLWFyZS10aGV5LW5vdy90aGUtZmlyc3Qtd2l2ZXMtY2x1Yi1jYXN0LXRoZW4tYW5kLW5vdy13aGVyZS1hcmUtdGhleS1ub3ctNDkxMTc1LmdhbGxlcnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'The First Wives Club' turns 25: Where are they now?,"""The First Wives Club"" became a surprise box office hit when it landed in theaters in 1996 grossing more than $180 million at the box office and revitalizing the careers of lead stars Diane Keaton Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler. Despite mixed reviews at the time it became the biggest success of all three stars' careers that decade and built a loyal following that can still recite Lesley Gore's classic tune ""You Don't Own Me"" to this day. The comedy also spawned both a stage musical and a television series.

Academy Award winner Diane Keaton's schedule only got more hectic after the success of ""The First Wives Club.""

She made her directorial debut with 2000's ""Hanging Up"" which she also starred in and received a glowing response for her Oscar-nominated turn in the 2003 comedy ""Something's Gotta Give"" alongside Jack Nicholson. Next came parts in the popular holiday drama ""The Family Stone"" and the poorly received comedies ""Because I Said So"" ""Mad Money"" and ""Morning Glory."" The Los Angeles native spent the next decade continuing her run of romantic- and family-oriented films such as ""Darling Companion"" ""The Big Wedding"" ""And So It Goes"" ""Love the Coopers"" ""Book Club"" and ""Poms.""

Bette Midler plays Brenda Morelli-Cushman a wise-cracking Sicilian-Jewish single mother who helped set her husband on his feet financially before he left her for his younger money-obsessed and social-climbing employee.

Goldie Hawn rounds out the main trio as Elise Eliot-Atchison a former superstar actress who's now an alcoholic and a heavy smoker relegated to B-movies because of her age. Her husband leaves her for another woman and sues her for alimony insisting that all of their joint assets be sold and the profits be divided between them.

Goldie Hawn ruled the box office in the '80s and '90s with hits like ""Private Benjamin"" ""Overboard"" ""Bird on a Wire"" ""Death Becomes Her"" and ""Housesitter.""

She also nabbed Emmy statuettes for her work in the TV films ""The Matthew Shepard Story"" and ""Jack"" before joining ""The Good Wife"" in a recurring role as Julianna Margulies' character's mother from 2012 to 2016. The New York City-born actress has also built a solid theater resume hitting the stage for productions of ""The Lion in Winter"" ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" ""Pal Joey"" ""Other Desert Cities"" and ""Apologia.""

Leading the villainous husbands is Victor Garber as Bill Atchison a successful film producer who rises to fame through his wife Elise's connections and eventually leaves her for a young starlet.

After ""7th Heaven"" came to an end he had roles on shows such as ""Private Practice"" ""No Ordinary Family"" ""Falling Skies"" ""Devious Maids"" and ""Revolution."" Stephen separated from his wife of 30 years actress Faye Grant in 2012 and they divorced in 2015; the former couple share a daughter. In 2014 his acting career came to an end when an audio tape of a male voice — reportedly his — admitting to past sexual abuse of a minor under 14 was leaked to the media. In a People magazine interview later that year he admitted to ""inappropriate sexual conduct with three female minors"" in 1973 1982 and 1994. Stephen has not worked since making the shocking revelations.

Sarah Jessica Parker plays Shelly Stewart Morty's dim-witted and manipulative fiancée. She uses her new partner to finance her extravagant tastes and fuel her social-climbing attitude as the First Wives Club exploit her desire to join high society in their revenge efforts.

Not long after ""The First Wives Club"" hit theaters Sarah Jessica Parker landed the defining role of her career: sex columnist Carrie Bradshaw on the long-running HBO comedy ""Sex and the City."" The groundbreaking series won the star multiple Emmys SAG Awards and Golden Globes and remains one of the most popular shows in television history.

The up-and-coming actress lives with Bill and initially makes Elise jealous before the veteran actress befriends her ex's new partner and discovers she's actually a 16-year-old high school dropout. Elise then uses that information as blackmail to get what she wants out of her ex-husband.

""The First Wives Club"" came on the heels of Elizabeth Berkley's star-making turn as Jessie Spano on the hit teen sitcom ""Saved by the Bell."" However she soon starred in the infamous box office bomb ""Showgirls"" which made it a struggle for her to secure big acting gigs for the rest of her career. Yet the Michigan native has remained busy despite the hurdles taking roles in films like ""The Real Blonde"" ""The Taxman"" ""Roger Dodger"" ""Any Given Sunday"" and ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion."" In the '00s she made her Broadway debut in the comedy ""Sly Fox"" and has enjoyed guest parts on numerous shows such as ""CSI: Miami"" ""NYPD Blue"" ""Without a Trace"" ""The L Word"" ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" ""Titus"" and ""New Girl.""

Editor’s note: A previous version of this story and headline incorrectly stated that Walmart had not recently hired any people of color to fill executive management roles or board of director vacancies. Walmart has in fact hired several people of color for those roles in recent months. A previous version of this story also incorrectly stated that Dacona Smith was the most recent executive African American to join Walmart’s executive leadership team. In fact at least two African-American officers including John Wigneswaran and Jennifer R. Jackson were hired more recently. The story and headline have been corrected and updated with additional context.

People of color made up more than 55% of new hires at Walmart between February and July of this year and now occupy more than 25% of the retailer’s officer positions according to the company’s website and its latest diversity equity and inclusion report released Friday.

That includes at least two African-American officers who joined the company this summer the company confirmed on Saturday. Chief medical officer Dr. John Wigneswaran in July became one of the latest Black senior or executive level manager to be hired by Walmart.

In June Walmart also hired Capitol One Canada president Jennifer R. Jackson who became Walmart’s newest senior vice president of enterprise strategy mergers & acquisitions and strategic partnerships. In November Walmart hired Dr. Cheryl Pegus to serve as executive vice president of health & wellness.

Walmart says it has worked harder in recent years to increase diversity at its highest ranks. The company’s president and CEO Doug McMillon took on the issue of racial inequality during one of Walmart’s virtual employee meetings in the wake of George Floyd’s murder more than a year ago.

“The murder of George Floyd is tragic painful and unacceptable” McMillon told Walmart’s global employee population in June 2020. “Words and feelings matter but they are not enough. More action is required. We will find new ways to accelerate the desired changes inside our company and we will also find the ways that our business can influence real change in our country.”

Walmart is America’s largest private employer by far with more than 2 million employees on its global payroll 1.5 million of them in the United States alone according to the company’s latest diversity equity and inclusion report. Amazon is a distant second with 798000 employees as recently as 2019 according to Fortune.

McMillon said in June 2020 that roughly 340000 of Walmart’s employees are Black. The company’s latest report confirms that as recently as July more than 20% of its employees were Black. African Americans also make up the largest non-White employee segment of Walmart’s workforce despite comprising just 11.9% of the US population in 2020 according to the latest US Census.

Around 9% of Walmart’s corporate officers are African American the company’s latest demographic data confirms but Walmart says that’s about a 2.3% increase from this time last year.

“While we are encouraged by the growth of our Black and African-American representation across our leadership team we recognize that we are on a journey and have more work to do” Walmart spokesperson Jami Lamontagne told CNN Business on Saturday.

Black members of Walmart’s executive leadership team also include executive vice president of neighborhood markets Kelvin L. Buncum senior vice president and chief global culture diversity equity & inclusion officer Ben Hasan and Dacona Smith executive vice president and chief operating officer for Walmart US.

Latinos make up nearly 18% of Walmart’s employee population but just 5.5% of the company’s officers according to the report. Asian people who represent more than 4% of the retailer’s employees comprise more than 10% of its managers and 9% of its officers. In August Anshu Bhardwaj was promoted to senior vice president of technology strategy & commercialization on Walmart’s global tech team.

White people make up more than 53% of Walmart’s workforce and they represent more than 63% of its managers and 74% of its officers.

The DEI report also says people of color make up more than 46% of Walmart’s workforce but the company’s website shows Black and Brown Americans comprise only about 16.7% of Walmart’s 12-member board of directors.

Retired AT&T chairman and CEO Randall Stevenson who is White joined Walmart’s board of directors in March. He’s the only director on Walmart’s board appointed since the police murder of George Floyd on May 25 2020 which motivated Walmart’s leaders to create a $100 million center on racial equity program less than two weeks later.

AT&T is the parent company of WarnerMedia which owns CNN.

NBCUniversal News Group Chairman Cesar Conde is the only Latin American on Walmart’s board of directors. He and Morgan Stanley Vice Chair of Wealth Management Carla A. Lewis who is Black are the only people of color on Walmart’s board.

People of color saw a slight uptick in promotions from hourly employees to management positions which increased more than two percentage points between January and July according to Walmart’s 2020 end-of-year DEI report.

Last October the Executive Leadership Council a nonprofit that works to increase the number of black executives in Corporate America gave Walmart its 2020 Corporate Award honoring “companies that value and reward contributions talents and leadership of Black employees.”

In its most recent DEI report Walmart pointed out marginal gains women have made at the officer level as well as the May launch of its Accessibility Center of Excellence which is designed to advance equity and inclusion for people with disabilities.

Walmart also was one of 24 companies that commissioned global consulting firm McKinsey & Co. to research challenges Black Americans face in the private sector.

“It further reinforces the importance of addressing these complex systemic issues through our internal people processes” Walmart executive vice president and chief people officer Donna Morris said in the report.

The study determined “educational attainment has an outsized impact” on the employment gap facing African Americans. Walmart announced that it would cover 100% of its workers’ college tuition about six months after the McKinsey study was published.

“Although we have made progress we still have more work to do” the company told CNN Business Friday via email.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3lvcmsvbmV3cy9rZWFybnktd2FsbWFydC1zdGFiYmluZy_SAUFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3eW9yay9uZXdzL2tlYXJueS13YWxtYXJ0LXN0YWJiaW5nLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police: Man Stabbed In Head With Machete After Argument At Walmart In Kearny N.J.,"KEARNY N.J. (CBSNewYork) -- There was chaos inside a Walmart in Kearny New Jersey when a man was stabbed with a machete during an argument Friday police said.

Police got to the store on Harrison Avenue around 10:30 a.m. after someone called 911 to report an assault CBS2's Jenna DeAngelis reported.

Police said they found a 43-year-old man inside the store with a deep cut and blood streaming down the back of his head.

As CBS2's Jessica Layton reports police say the two strangers had an argument while standing in line and punches were thrown before the machete was swung.

""It was an altercation between two people and then they one guy pulled out it was like a sword and he cut it. People see him laying on the ground and one guy was bleeding from the head. It was terrible"" witness Thomas Underwood said. ""It was just a stampede of people who were running. One girl got trampled. She ended up going to the hospital. She got hurt she hurt her leg.""

The suspect left the store before officers arrived police said.

The victim was taken to University Hospital in Newark. He was released after having the wound stapled closed.

Watch Jenna DeAngelis' report --

Investigators said they do not believe the suspect and the victim knew each other.

Shoppers were let back inside the store around 2:30 p.m.

""It was just total chaos. I was scared for my life"" said a shopper.

She described the terrifying moments when she was trampled and hurt while running out of the Walmart.

""I was knocked to the floor instantaneously. At this moment I don't know what's going on. I just saw dozens of people running towards the exit. Someone screamed he had a gun"" she told DeAngelis.

""I just started seeing people screaming and running and I'm like 'What's going on?'"" said Ray Martin who saw the suspect swinging the weapon.

Martin believes the victim jumped in to stop the suspect but police dispute his account. They say the men were throwing punches before the machete came out.

""It was crazy. Everybody just grabbed their kids and everybody ran"" a Walmart employee said.

Chopper 2 video showed the line of fire and police vehicles outside the store.

Shoppers were left concerned.

""How did he even bring the machete in? Something so large so visible. To even bring that in is beyond me"" another shopper said. ""It's a scary world out there and you just have to watch what we do and be aware of our surroundings.""

Police said the suspect brought the machete into the store. It appeared to be hidden under his clothes.

""This is the first time we ever seen something crazy like this and I don't know if I'm coming back to this Walmart"" another woman said.

Late Friday night police said a suspect was arrested in Newark. Further details including the suspect's identity have not yet been released.

Kearny detectives just arrested the suspect from today's Walmart machete assault. He was taken into custody moments ago in Newark. More information to follow when available. — Kearny Police (@KearnyPolice) September 25 2021

""We are shocked by Friday's incident and are hopeful the injured customer recovers quickly. We are grateful to law enforcement for their quick response and are helping them in any way we can"" a Walmart spokesperson said.

Not only in the metaphorical “dominate the American imagination sense’ but in the literal sense. The Walt Disney Company owns more land in Central Florida than they’ll likely ever be able to develop.

Don’t believe us? Well in the five decades since WDW opened to the public the company has built four theme parks three (one defunct) water parks the entire Disney Springs complex nearly 30 resort hotels and a bevy of backstage infrastructure over half of the land they own is still undeveloped land and at their disposal.

So why did Disney buy so much extra land in Florida? To paraphrase it all started with a man… the man in fact: Walt Disney himself.

To understand why Walt Disney insisted on so much land for the Florida Project that would eventually morph into Walt Disney World one must understand Disneyland. Walt poured his heart soul and pocketbook into building The Happiest Place on Earth buying as much land in Anaheim as he could afford for the theme park. Famously Walt couldn’t even afford to build an on-site hotel at the time instead entrusting businessman Jack Wrather with the rights to build the Disneyland Hotel.

Suffice to say Walt’s money problems quickly evaporated when Disneyland opened to rave reviews and astonishing success in 1955. The Disneyland hotel which opened a few months after the park was also a smash hit and the Wrather Corporation had a successful partnership with Disney until the 1980s when “the Mouse” acquired the company to gain control of the Hotel property.

However while Walt and Jack Wrather enjoyed a warm partnership the same couldn’t be said for the majority of Disney’s neighbors. After the park’s successful opening land around Disneyland skyrocketed in value and was quickly gobbled up by entrepreneurs eager to ride Walt’s coattails. All manner of hotels motels and tourist traps sprouted up literally steps from the park many of which didn’t live up to Disney’s standards. Furthermore much to Walt’s chagrin these establishments encroached on the park audibly and even visually at times.

As Disney began planning to open a second theme park in the early 1960s he searched everywhere from St. Louis to New York to find the perfect site. Given what happened in Anaheim it’s perhaps unsurprising that buying and controlling a large amount of land was at the top of Disney’s list when searching for sites and in fact was a deciding factor in ruling out several areas. Of course in addition to the desire to control the land around his park Walt also had an ulterior motive for looking for such a large piece of land: his dream of the original version of EPCOT AKA the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow.

This search eventually led to approximately 25000 acres of land in Central Florida near Orlando. According to Disney legend Walt saw the eventual WDW site from above during a scouting flight and immediately knew that that’s where what-was-then-called simply Disney World (and EPCOT) needed to be built.

Not wanting to call attention to themselves and in-turn lead to an Anaheim-esque spike in land value Disney went about acquiring the land somewhat surreptitiously. The company set up numerous dummy corporations (the pun-names of which are immortalized on several Main Street U.S.A. windows at the Magic Kingdom) to acquire different pieces of land.

Despite Disney’s best efforts rumors quickly began to spread that all of the land was being purchased by one entity with speculation ranging from Disney to NASA to the Ford Motor Company. Eventually Disney was exposed as being behind the land purchases by the Orlando Sentinel in the fall of 1965 forcing Disney to reveal their initial plans for Disney World earlier than Walt had planned.

Roughly a year after the news of Disney World was confirmed Walt spoke about the land purchase in Florida in relation to some of the issues the company had faced with Disneyland:

“The one thing I learned from Disneyland was to control the environment. Without that we get blamed for the things that someone else does. When they come here they’re coming because of an integrity that we’ve established over the years and they drive for hundreds of miles and the little hotels on the fringe would jump their rates three times. I’ve seen it happen and I just can’t take it because I mean it reflects on us. I just feel a responsibility to the public when I go into this thing that we must control that and when they come into this so-called world that we will take the blame for what goes on.”

Furthermore Walt uttered a famous phrase which is still used by Disney to describe WDW to this very day. “Here in Florida we have something special we never enjoyed at Disneyland…the blessing of size. There’s enough land here to hold all the ideas and plans we can possibly imagine.” (1966 Forum Special)

While Walt Disney would pass only months later and many things about Disney World would change (including the name being changed to “Walt Disney World” in tribute as well as the abandonment of EPCOT’s original incarnation) the concept of the “Blessing of Size” is still a fundamental part of Walt Disney World.

Do you think Walt Disney was right to push to acquire so much land in Central Florida or did he go overboard? Let us know in the comments below.

The festivities officially begin October 1st but many of the items were released early. We’ve been updating this article with new items as they are released.

Walt Disney World’s 50th Anniversary merchandise was created with five festive collections in mind. The Celebration Collection includes merchandise featuring Mickey and the gang dressed up in fancy get-ups for the special occasion along with other colorful items. The Disney Castle Collection utilizes Magic Kingdom’s Cinderella Castle as its central motif. The Vault Collection reimagines merchandise that was originally released around Walt Disney World’s opening day. As the name suggests the merchandise in the EARidescent Collection shimmers and shines. And finally the Luxe Logo Collection offers the most upscale merchandise created for the 50th anniversary.

This article focuses on the Celebration and Castle Collections but we’ll link you to the other lines at the bottom of this article. And it is important to remember that Walt Disney World still has a purchase limit in place of a maximum of two of each item per guest.

Can’t Visit Walt Disney World for the 50th Anniversary?

If you are unable to make it over to Walt Disney World but still want the opportunity to purchase some lovely merchandise all hope is not lost. Some items of these items will be available for purchase on shopDisney. On October 1 merchandise from the Celebration and Vault Collections will be listed. Some of the collections will arrive at a later currently unannounced date.

Celebration Collection

Clothing

This sweatshirt combines a nice big screen-printed graphic of a Tuxedo’d Mickey Mouse with a smaller metallic 50th logo on the chest. The combination of the two styles works well together.

This camp shirt has an ‘”it’s a small world” vibe to it don’t you think?

Minnie and Cinderella Castle are printed on the chest of this women’s V-neck shirt.

Man Disney sure loves their crop tops. Here we see a cropped hoodie and matching lounge pants sold separately.

As we can see from the graphics on this sweatshirt T-shirt and kid’s raglan shirt Mickey is getting his tux all neat and pretty for the big party.

A similar graphic of Mickey with Donald Goofy and Pluto is seen on this sweatshirt and this tie-dyed shirt.

This kid’s zippered jacket is eye-catching.

If your littlest one loves Minnie you might want to give this onesie a look.

This new Minnie Mouse costume dress resembles the outfit Minnie is wearing for the 50th celebration.

This ringer T-shirt may not have Mickey and Co. on it but it highlights some of Walt Disney World’s beloved attractions.

Accessories

If you are going to Walt Disney World the odds are good that a Magicband is in your future (though they are no longer required). And if you are heading there for the 50th anniversary you can snag one of these beauties.

I think we can all agree that the Florida sun is brutal but there are two new themed hats to help provide some relief from the harsh rays.

Nothing says “Disney Parks merchandise” quite like a Mickey Ear Hat and this one is extra-special. It has iridescent stuffed ears with a matching Mickey patch on the front.

Ear Headband party! We’ve got one with a foam bow that is remarkably similar to something released for Disneyland’s fiftieth celebration (with a different color scheme) a design from Loungefly covered with Mickey and his pals and one that lights up. The last one is especially notable because it is charged via USB cable which is included with the Ear Headband. I would love to see this feature incorporated into more light-up items in the future.

This light-up bow would be perfect paired with the Minnie Mouse costume dress for kids we saw earlier.

This Loungefly Mini Backpack not only matches one of the Ear Headbands seen earlier but it even has a special pocket to hold them! You can unzip the designated pocket to reveal straps with metal snaps used to secure the Ear Headband.

It is not a celebration until commemorative Crocs are released for it. These shoes are decorated with art of Mickey and friends and come with a special Walt Disney World 50th charm attached to them.

Baublebar contributed this festive (and likely very heavy) pair of earrings featuring Mickey and Minnie Mouse with fireworks.

If you don’t fancy wearing your Ear Headband on your head but still want to show your love for the accessory Alex and Ani have this beaded bracelet with an Ear Headband charm.

And while this beaded bracelet may not have a fancy pedigree it is still a lovely accessory.

Toys

You can purchase plush toy versions of Mickey Minnie Pluto and Chip n’ Dale (the pair are a set) in the same outfits seen on other 50th Anniversary merchandise. My favorites are Pluto and Chip n’ Dale. What about you?

There is also a mini plush keychain of Mickey in a similar outfit.

If you are a fan of those posable stuffed nuiMOs Walt Disney World guests will find a themed Spirit Jersey sized just for the toys. The back says “Walt Disney World” and the front chest has a little “50” on it.

While not as huggable as a stuffed friend this 50th Anniversary Cinderella Castle playset is incredibly impressive. It includes figures of Mickey Minnie Donald Daisy and Goofy along with an interactive Cinderella Castle with Monorail Dumbo the Flying Elephant and Mad Tea Party elements. One of my favorite details is that the playset’s castle is decorated with the same sign and anniversary ribbons as the real one.

Decor and Home Goods

This item is going to sell like hotcakes I guarantee it. It is a foaming hand soap dispenser that magically creates a hidden mickey out of soap when pushed down.

You’ll find magnets adorned with Mickey and company as well including a magnetic clip!

For all your beverage consumption needs there is a character-filled mug and an attraction-covered water bottle.

On one side of this spinning ornament you’ll find Mickey’s smiling face. On the other are tons of attractions found at Walt Disney World.

I love that Disney is incorporating reusable utensils into more of their merchandise collections. This set has a reusable plastic fork knife and spoon all packaged in this fun carrying case. I do wish the utensils were made of bamboo as opposed to plastic but this still a step in the right direction.

Make a far-off friend insanely jealous and send them one of these lenticular postcards. Use the new pen seen below as well for double the fun.

Sweet treats like a tin of mints packaged flavored popcorn a fancy chocolate truffle box a giant lollipop and a milk chocolate bar with popping candy on the inside are all themed to the occasion. There is even a special coffee blend by Joffrey’s crafted especially for the celebration.

Are there pins? Yes there are pins! And starter sets lanyards and lanyard medallions too!

I must confess I did not know that a “souvenir booster pack” was a thing but I do now. It contains magnets buttons a keychain and such all in one convenient package.

Disney Castle Collection

Apparel

Do you wear women’s shirts and like castles? Here are two shirts just for you.

In terms of layering options from the Castle Collection include a hoodie and track jacket.

This special polo shirt was created by Nike.

This camp shirt is a lot less busy than the multicolored one from the Celebration Collection.

The Partners Statue gets some love on the chest of this T-shirt.

Accessories

I absolutely adore this Loungefly Mini Backpack. It has gorgeous art of Cinderella Castle on the front complemented by lovely golden accents on the from and embroidery on the side. It has one compartment compared to the typical two-pocket model seen more frequently in Disney Parks. I would buy this one in a heartbeat.

This tote bag has a good capacity and padded handles to boot.

Nike gets in on the Partners Statue appreciation with this hat.

Thanks to Baublebar this collection also has earrings a charm bracelet and a necklace.

Alex and Ani add an simpler layer of golden glamor to Cinderella Castle with this bangle and matching necklace sold separately.

Toys

Over the past few years I have come to appreciate puzzles as family activities. However I do think that with all that similar-looking sky this one might be tricky.

Decor and Home Goods

Cinderella Castle looks just like an old-time photograph on this tasseled dish towel set.

The delicate castle art looks great on ceramic as we can see from this mug and jewelry box.

Whether as a magnet or on top of an ornament the figures of Cinderella Castle are almost as striking as the real thing.

For optimal results I suggest you stick a photo of your loved ones in front of Cinderella Castle inside this castle-themed magnet frame.

Thanks to this throw blanket you can wrap yourself in a large woven image of the Partners statue.

Here are the rest of the lines (or when we expect them to be released):

Here’s Why That’s a Mistake (Column),"“Dune” has the potential to be the biggest movie of the year. But however well it does or does not do at the box office it’s undeniably the biggest grandest slice of movie in a long time. Big as in vast. As in images and sounds that fill the screen and fill the senses. Big as in: The movie transports you to the desert planet of Arrakis and for 2 hours and 35 minutes you live there.

So why would this overwhelmingly epic visually spectacular one-of-a-kind sci-fi popcorn movie be opening Oct. 22 on a television set near you?

We know the answer and there’s a kind of petty spreadsheet logic to it. “Dune” is opening simultaneously in movie theaters and on home screens because Warner Bros. the company that Wikipedia now describes as “an American diversified multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate” also owns HBO Max the streaming service where “Dune” will be made available (for no extra cost) to subscribers. Warner Bros. is owned by AT&T and will be merging probably next year with Discovery. The revamped company will have many interlocking priorities. In the first year of the pandemic which was the year of HBO Max’s ostensibly game-changing launch it became a transcendent corporate goal for Warner Bros. to do all it could to put its new streaming service into orbit. And since people for most of last year couldn’t go to the movies it was decided that each of the studio’s 2021 films would be made available the same day it’s released in theaters on HBO Max.

The pandemic is still with us of course. But the year when people couldn’t go to the movies is over. Moviegoing has returned in force. And at a moment when many have begun to question the wisdom of opening a film simultaneously in theaters and at home (day-and-date as it’s known) “Dune” now stands as the apotheosis of an issue hovering over the entertainment industry and defining it. The question is: Does it really make sense to take one of the most feverishly anticipated movie extravaganzas of the decade and give it away to folks in their living rooms?

Popular on Variety

I think there are two basic potential scenarios for how the release of “Dune” could play out. One is that on opening weekend the film crashes and burns making back just a small fraction of the $165 million it cost to produce (which of course doesn’t include the huge sum it cost to market). The whole world pronounces it a disappointment and a bomb. If that happens the HBO Max release will be seen to have been a disaster — but I don’t think that’s a very likely scenario. There’s simply too much anticipation for “Dune” on the part of three generations of sci-fi fans who are devotees of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel (not to mention its daisy chain of sequels).

Far likelier is the following scenario: that on opening weekend “Dune” does… okay. The highest opening-weekend gross earned by a movie so far this year is the $94 million made by “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” over the long Labor Day weekend followed by the $80 million made by “Black Widow” and the $70 million made by “F9: The Fast Saga.” (Sorry but when did “The Fast Saga” becomes part of that movie’s title? They should really lose that.) Of course “Shang-Chi” opened exclusively in theaters. But let’s say that “Dune” manages to post receipts in that range. If so a qualified victory will be declared and we’ll be left speculating about how much the movie might have made if it weren’t competing with itself on TV. We’ll also speculate about what it would have made on opening weekend in pre-pandemic times. So if it makes say $50 million three weekends from now how much of that shortfall will be pandemic-related and how much will be HBO Max-related?

Warner Bros. will take all that speculation — the lack of certainty — and use it as cover for its decision. The studio would say in essence “We’re fine with a $50 million opening. Under different circumstances who can say how well the movie would have performed?” And of course they’ll double down on making the argument for how much it helps the company’s bottom line to offer the film on HBO Max. A movie like “Dune” is a subscription magnet; that’s the whole point. And for entertainment conglomerates imitating the model invented by Netflix subscriptions have become the coin of the realm. Winning massive numbers of subscribers is the new “It opened huge!”

Or so goes the reasoning. But it’s amazing how much common sense “sophisticated” business rationales can leave behind. It’s now too late for Warner Bros. to reverse its day-and-date decision about “Dune” — commitments have been made logistics have been locked in — but here are a few reasons why I think it will prove to be a mistake.

1. The film will be less profitable. If “Dune” opens with $50 million it will be clear that the studio left a lot of money on the table. Especially if the grosses seriously decline in the weeks ahead. The movie has already opened in international markets (exclusively in theaters) where it is doing well but using its domestic take as a yardstick let’s say it winds up matching “Shang-Chi’s” total receipts which are closing in on $200 million. That sounds like a lot of money but this is “Dune” we’re talking about. It’s being marketed as the new “Star Wars” meets “Lord of the Rings.” It should be far and away the biggest movie of the year.

2. Making “Dune” a day-and-date release radically cuts down on the film’s event status. It does so in two ways. If “Dune” were available in theaters only the revenues would probably spike — but those numbers would also become a billboard a way of saying “Here’s the movie you have to see.” More important is that you’d feel you have to go to the theater to see it because it belongs in a theater. The bigness of movies is primal. It’s been a key aspect of cinema for 100 years going back to silent films like “Intolerance” stretching into the widescreen sagas of the ’50s and ’60s (“Lawrence of Arabia” “The Greatest Story Ever Told” “2001: A Space Odyssey”) into the Lucas/ Spielberg ’70s (“Star Wars” “Close Encounters of the Third Kind”) and beyond. In an age when even the “Star Wars” universe has been successfully shrunk down to TV size I would argue that the gargantuan quality of “Dune” is almost its key selling point. The film is something to gawk at like “Lawrence of Arabia” with Mayan design and insect helicopters. It’s something you don’t see every day or every year. But the awesome singularity of “Dune” is compromised when you tell your audience “Okay the bigness isn’t essential. It’s fine to watch it at home.”

3. It’s going to play a lot less well on television. Growing up I once watched “2001: A Space Odyssey” on a 16-inch black-and-white TV set and it actually worked. That’s how great a movie it is. “Dune” is a lot less great. I would argue that it’s a reasonably commanding sci-fi parable that begins to run out of gas in its last hour. That’s because Frank Herbert in the “Dune” books may have been a better world-builder than he was a storyteller. (I would say that’s true of J.R.R. Tolkien too but we can debate that another time.) The world of “Dune” like the world of “Lawrence of Arabia” or the original “Blade Runner” needs to overwhelm and envelop you. But if you watch it at home the film’s narrative — is Paul Atreides the Messiah? Watch the House Atreides go down to defeat… and look out for that sandworm! — is going to stand revealed as the rather patchy affair it is. When you shrink the grandeur of “Dune” you shrink its appeal.

4. The entire industry has a vested interest in the success of “Dune.” It used to be that if a major movie turned out to be a commercial disappointment the only people who suffered were those connected to it including the executives at that studio. (In the rest of the industry there was schadenfreude.) But thanks to the karmic double whammy of the streaming revolution and the pandemic the whole world is suddenly asking if movies in theaters have a future. I think they do but it’s not foregone. And part of it is that we need to see the enthusiasm of movie-theater audiences to be reminded of what a potent force they are. Last summer “Tenet” was supposed to be the movie that jump-started moviegoing; for various reasons (notably the stubbornness of the pandemic) that didn’t work out so well. But movies in the last six months have indeed been jump-started and that makes “Dune” the right movie at the right time. It’s a film that could remind us of the primacy — and profitability — of the theater experience. You wouldn’t want every movie to be like “Dune.” But you want “Dune” to be “Dune.” If it turns into the commercially compromised lagging version of itself that becomes a gigantic blown opportunity. And everyone suffers.

Of course there’s another possibility in all this. “Dune” opens on Oct. 22 people watch it on HBO Max and it still goes on to be a massive theatrical hit. It breaks the bank. That would be a happy ending one that might help rewrite the rules of what’s coming. But I’m not holding my breath.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWduYXNpYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS93YXJuZXJtZWRpYS1jb25zb2xpZGF0ZXMtc2l4LWFzaWEtb2ZmaWNlcy13aXRoLXNpbmdhcG9yZS1odWIvNDcyODM20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WarnerMedia consolidates six Asia offices with Singapore hub | Media,"Building on the restructuring of its Asia business announced in November 2020 and the appointment of Clement Schwebig to lead this recast business WarnerMedia has opened a hub in Singapore. This new facility which employs 300 people--with more people being hired currently--integrates six offices in the region (four in Singapore and two in Hong Kong) and consolidates the presence of multiple businesses including Warner Bros HBO and Turner.

In addition WarnerMedia expects to substantially increase additional roles in Singapore in the coming years including those in the technology field as the company increases focus on its direct-to-consumer streaming business led by Amit Malhotra managing director for HBO Max in Southeast Asia India and Korea. The streaming service's Asia headquarters will be at this hub.

WarnerMedia did not indicate if there were any job redundancies as a result of this consolidation in APAC and the opening of this 40000 square foot facility across two floors at Solaris in Fusionopolis the city state’s media and tech business park.

“As we get ready to launch HBO Max in our first Asian markets we’ll build on WarnerMedia’s legacy of incredible stories and introduce a brand-new streaming experience for our fans in the region” Malhotra said. “Our new office space in Singapore as a regional HQ will be the perfect backdrop for the innovative work to be done in the lead up to our launch.”

“Here in Singapore we have long supported a sizeable ecosystem for the entertainment broadcast production and licensing industries"" added Schwebig. ""From our new Singapore hub we will continue with our ambitious plans for the region.”

You made Empower Field feel like Empower Field again. Loud. Proud.,"Man he missed the pizza. The pizza and the smack.

John Ayala and his family parked the family’s gorgeous three-wheel trike in lot E4 at Empower Field a few hours before the Broncos’ home opener on Sunday as if the pandemic never happened.

About 20 yards away a large tailgate of about 50 or so New York Jets fans had gathered hoping for the best but with a rookie quarterback on the road knowing better.

Every few minutes the gang in green launched into their beloved cheer in unison:

“J-E-T …

And every time before those 50 got to the “S” in “Jets” John or his brother or a cousin would walk over to the trike and pull a lever that set off the mother of all horns.

“This is beautiful” Ayala said of Sunday’s home opener. “It’s being able to share a camaraderie with others who are the same as you — blue and orange.”

“J-E-T …”

Honnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnk!

“You listen to music get a beer and a shot have a good time” John continued. “It’s beautiful man.”

Especially because like most Broncos fans Ayala couldn’t do this last year. And for a guy who grew up partying in the south stands it hurt like Hades.

His wife works for the Department of Public Health. With a newborn due in August 2021 John got every vaccine shot he could. And when Ayala put down a deposit on his Broncos season tickets for 2020 realizing that the odds of actually getting into the building were slim he took the option to push those seats into 2021.

“I was looking at some of the (first two) games we played away and I was amazed by how many Broncos fans (there were) — the orange was just unbelievable” Ayala said. “So Broncos Country is hard core. And having Teddy Bridgewater and maybe (general manager) George Paton that’s gonna be the new chapter in these games.”

The weather was perfect even if the traffic flow wasn’t. Shutout? Check. 3-0 start? Check. First place? Check. Postseason momentum? Check. The first Broncos game at full capacity since December 2019 managed to squeeze in a little bit of everything live music included.

A few lots down from John and his family Sergio Gomez a native of Barnum West danced and swayed behind a giant grill in C11 while local band El Pollo Y Su Pandilla — The Chicken And His Gang — played with gusto just over his left shoulder.

“This is Denver Colorado right here” Garcia shouted over the music.

“This is what Denver is all about. It’s about the Broncos. It doesn’t matter who you are or where you’re from. We can all unite for the same thing: The Denver Broncos.”

Scale of 1-10 how much did you miss this last fall?

“Oh an 11” Gomez shouted this time with a grin. “An 11.

“Going in that stadium win or lose you’re there supporting the team supporting the city supporting the state. It’s about diversity. Everyone comes together when it comes to the Denver Broncos.”

And when it comes to giving grief to visiting fans.

“J-E-T …”

Honnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnk!

That’ll show ’em.

“There are only eight of these in Colorado” Ayala said of The Bronco which features a 454 big-block Chevy engine and Broncos-themed airbrushing from front wheel to back bumper. “The frame is from New Mexico. Everything else is custom.”

All the way to the storage box in the back a cabinet lovingly adorned with a painting of Empower Field and the numbers from the Broncos’ Ring of Fame.

“I think (normalcy) is going to take a little bit because people aren’t so sure that this is the real deal” Ayala reflected. “The past five years we’ve had some bad decisions and quarterbacks.”

With that someone handed him a plate with two steaming pizza slices on top. Old habits in E4 they die hard.

So do old friendships.

“This is my boy right here” John laughed. “They make their own pizza. You just meet people from all over the place here. You get to know each other. It’s like a family. It’s a community. It’s beautiful.”

Almost 20 years after the Harry Potter franchise made its big-screen debut several Potterheads on social media have stumbled upon a shocking discovery - that Draco Malfoy Harry's arch-nemesis and a major antagonist throughout the series appears on screen throughout the whole saga for as little as 31 minutes.

31 minutes?! Are you serious? That's barely longer than an episode of Friends!

Advert

Instagram/t22felton

Apparently though it's true and a quick glance at the official Harry Potter IMDB page confirms that Felton's character does indeed have just over half an hour of screen-time throughout all 19 hours and 40 minutes of the eight films - around 2.5 percent of the entire run to be specific.

Where does the time go?

To break it down even further Malfoy's longest appearance is in The Half Blood Prince during which the silver-haired bully enjoys a grand total of eight minutes of screen-time.

Advert

In contrast his shortest spell can be found in the fifth instalment of the franchise The Order Of The Phoenix in which he manages to appear on-screen for just one minute and 15 seconds.

Warner Bros

Understandably fans were pretty peeved at the revelation.

One Twitter user said: ""The fact Draco Malfoy was only in 31 minutes throughout the WHOLE of the Harry Potter franchise (19 hrs & 40 mins) jus doesn't sit right with me.""

Advert

Another wrote: ""Are you telling me that 14 years old me celebrated the birthday of a character that had 31 minutes on screen?""

However before you start moaning about Felton's apparent shafting by the film's editing crew let's back up for a moment and clear things up. You see screen time in a film is literally - the time an actor is visibly on the screen.



This means that even if Malfoy was in the same room as other characters if the shot was not showing him it wouldn't count as screen time.

Advert

Likewise if he was interacting with someone and the camera switches between characters while they're talking to each other Malfoy's screen time is only counted when it's on him.

In actuality the 31 minutes (and 30 seconds) that Malfoy appears in the films is comparable to several other characters you might consider as prominent. Voldemort for example was on screen for 37 minutes and 15 seconds while Hagrid appeared for 45 minutes and 45 seconds.

Meanwhile Malfoy himself managed to bag more camera time than other long-running Potter mainstays such as Ginny Weasley Neville Longbottom and Professor McGonagall so maybe it's worth taking a step back and putting these things in perspective.



Advert

Still at the end of the day this whole episode just goes to show that screen time isn't everything.

Anthony Hopkins famously only needed 25 minutes of it to win an Oscar for his portrayal of Hannibal Lector in Silence Of The Lambs after all. And judging from the number of passionate fans Felton still has after all these years it's safe to say that his somewhat minimal screentime in Harry Potter certainly didn't diminish his success.

WM,Waste Management,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsb3JpZGF0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIxLzA5LzI2L2NvbW1lcmNpYWwtcHJvcGVydHktb3duZXJzLXBheS1wcmljZS1pbGxlZ2FsLWR1bXBpbmcvODMyNTc2NTAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waste Management Florida: Brevard commercial properties fight illegal trash,"Ralph Perrone Sr. has started doing a little bit of sleuthing and what amounts to dumpster-diving to discover who has been putting their trash into the large bins outside his commercial properties.

It might be a receipt with someone's name on it a cardboard box that has a packing label with a mailing address some construction material that matches a project being done at a nearby property.

It does more than just fill up his dumpsters. It's illegal and it's costing Perrone money.

So he has enlisted the help of the Brevard County Sheriff's Office and the State Attorney's Office to help crack down on illegal dumping — including making law enforcement more aware of the issue and the illegality of putting trash in someone else's commercial dumpster. State Attorney Phil Archer said he will prosecute such cases.

Perrone said when he tracks down the alleged offenders and follows up with a visit or call most had no idea what they were doing was illegal.

But it is. Illegal dumping can subject violators to third-degree felony charges — if they are caught.

Regardless of that Waste Management Inc. charges commercial property owners a surcharge that it calls an ""overage fee"" if their dumpsters are overflowing meaning trash is over the rim of the dumpster or if trash is piled up next to the dumpster.

And Perrone says he has been nailed to the tune of $100 to $200 a month for the overflowing dumpsters that are the result of other people's trash deposited at his properties on Merritt Island and in Cape Canaveral Cocoa and Rockledge.

""When a business dumps their litter in your dumpster in order to save money and avoid paying the proper disposal of that litter they are committing a third-degree felony"" Archer said in a letter to Perrone. ""It does not matter how much litter as any amount for a commercial purpose is a felony.""

Perrone said he has no problem with the rules — but he does have a problem with people illegally dumping their trash.

""We are all having a big issue with illegal dumping in our front-loader dumpsters — for which we are responsible for"" Perrone said. ""Contractors lawns services tree services area residential neighbors area commercial business that do not have dumpster service or have too small of a dumpster continue to illegally place their trash and debris into other business and property owners' front-loader dumpsters.""

He said anything sticking out over the rim or if the lid won't close can result in a fee to the property owner.

""Waste Management drivers snap photos and you get an extra charge on your next invoice"" he said.

Perrone said on one recent occasion he found queen palm logs inside one of his dumpsters. On another occasion he found concrete. In both instances Waste Management would not empty the dumpsters until the material was removed and Perrone was changed an extra fee to have the waste truck return for an unscheduled pickup he said.

At another location Perrone and his staff caught employees of a nearby business dumping trash into a Perrone Properties-owned dumpster.

""The employee stated 'the dumpster their landlord had provided is always full so we use your dumpster. We didn't think you would mind' "" Perrone recalled.

Perrone did mind. He decided to call the Brevard County Sheriff's Office for assistance. Perrone said the manager of the nearby business got a visit from two sheriff's deputies who explained the illegality of what the business was doing.

Perrone has attached yellow signs with red lettering to the dumpsters on his commercial properties warning people that putting trash in the dumpsters is illegal if they are not a tenant of the commercial complex. He also is installing surveillance camera pointed at the dumpsters to catch violators.

Just this past week security footage captured someone putting an old mattress in one of Perrone's dumpsters.

And at another location that has a locked dumpster someone dumped old chairs and other refuse adjacent to the dumpster.

Keeping it 'CLEAN' in Brevard

Amy Boyson community affairs manager for Waste Management Inc. of Florida said it is nothing new that her company enforces its rules about overflowing commercial dumpsters.

""Customers have to take some responsibility for their container"" Boyson said. ""It's just a way to keep our community clean"" with trash not blowing around the neighborhood or unsightly mounds of trash bags overflowing from the dumpsters.

Boyson said a Waste Management program it calls CLEAN (an acronym for community litter environmental-protection awareness notice) addresses this issue. The program is in effect locally in unincorporated Brevard as well as Cocoa Beach Indian Harbour Brach Melbourne Satellite Beach and West Melbourne as part of Waste Management contracts with those jurisdictions. The program also is being added in Cocoa and Indialantic she said.

The contract language that allows for an overage charge varies slightly in each community. The language on the contract in unincorporated Brevard County for example has parameters of trash being ""12 inches or more over the top of the container"" or ""solid waste placed on the ground"" as triggering the overage charge.

Boyson said Waste Management drivers use a onboard computer to take a digital photo of the waste material that is either overflowing or on the ground.

In a letter that goes out to Waste Management commercial customers found in violation the company says: ""Overfilled containers are unsightly and create an environment attractive to unwelcome critters. The mess in your waste area may give the wrong impression of your business to your customers.""

Boyson said customers have several options if their bins are overflowing including getting a larger dumpster; adding recycling containers; scheduling more pickups per week; or having a special ""lock bar"" installed on the dumpster that provides access only to tenants and the trash hauler.

""The goal of a charge is to get the customers' attention to 'right-size' their service to meet their needs"" Boyson said.

Archer said he wants to get the word out to the public that his office will prosecute in cases of illegal dumping into trash receptacles — as it has in seven felony cases and seven misdemeanor cases locally since 2017.

In cases of non-commercial dumping there are various provisions in state law. Depending on the volume of trash involved it can be a third-degree felony a first-degree misdemeanor or a noncriminal infraction with a civil penalty Archer said.

But in cases of commercial dumping it always is a third-degree felony.

Archer said his office will work with local law enforcement officials who have questions about the details of the littering statute or the sufficiency of a particular investigation.

But Archer added that he would prefer the offenders know that their actions were illegal and they wouldn't do it in the first place.

The problem was the toilet,"New York CNN Business —

As Jared Isaacman and his three fellow crewmates were freeflying through Earth’s orbit shielded from the unforgiving vacuum of space by nothing but a 13-foot-wide carbon-fiber capsule an alarm started blaring.

The SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft’s systems were warning the crew of a “significant” issue Isaacman said. They’d spent months poring over SpaceX manuals and training to respond to in-space emergencies so they leaped into action working with SpaceX ground controllers to pinpoint the cause of the error.

As it turned out the Crew Dragon wasn’t in jeopardy. But the on board toilet was.

Nothing in space is easy including going to the bathroom. In a healthy human on Earth making sure everything ends up in the toilet is usually a matter of simple aim. But in space there is no feeling of gravity. There’s no guarantee that what comes out will go where it’s supposed to. Waste can — and does — go in every possible direction.

To solve that problem space toilets have fans inside them which are used to create suction. Essentially they pull waste out of the human body and keep it stored away.

And the Crew Dragon’s “waste management system” fans were experiencing mechanical problems. That is what tripped the alarm the crew heard.

Scott “Kidd” Poteet an Inspiration4 mission director who helped oversee the mission from the ground tipped reporters off about the issue in an interview with CBS. Poteet and SpaceX’s director of crew mission management later confirmed there were “issues” with the waste management system at a press conference but didn’t go into detail setting off an immediate wave of speculation that the error could’ve created a disastrous mess.

When asked directly about that on Thursday however Isaacman said “I want to be 100% clear: There were no issues in the cabin at all as it relates to that.”

But Isaacman and his fellow travelers on the Inspiration4 mission did have to work with SpaceX to respond to the problem during their three-day stay in orbit during which they experienced numerous communications blackouts highlighting the importance of the crew’s thorough training regimen.

“I would say probably somewhere around 10% of our time on orbit we had no [communication with the ground] and we were a very calm cool crew during that” he said adding that “mental toughness and a good frame of mind and a good attitude” were crucial to the mission.

“The psychological aspect is one area where you can’t compromise because…there were obviously circumstances that happened up there where if you had somebody that didn’t have that mental toughness and started to react poorly that really could’ve brought down the whole mission” Isaacman said.

SpaceX did not respond to CNN Business’ requests for comment.

The toilet anecdote also highlights a fundamental truth about humanity and its extraterrestrial ambitions — no matter how polished and glitzy we may imagine our space-faring future biological realities remain.

Excreta in space a history

Isaacman was — as numerous astronauts before him — bashful when it came to discussing the “toilet situation.”

“Nobody really wants to get into the gory details” Isaacman said. But when the Inspiration4 crew talked to some NASA astronauts they said “using the bathroom in space is hard and you’ve got to be very — what was the word? — very kind to one another.”

He added that despite the on-board toilet issues nobody suffered any accidents or indignities.

“I don’t know who was training them but we were able to work through it and get [the toilet] going even with what was initially challenging circumstances so there was nothing ever like you know in the cabin or anything like that” he said.

Figuring out how to safely relieve oneself in space was however was a fundamental question posed at the dawn of human spaceflight half a century ago and the path to answers was not error-free.

During the 1969 Apollo 10 mission — the one that saw Thomas Stafford John Young and Eugene Cernan circumnavigate the moon — Stafford reported back to mission control on Day Six of the mission that a piece of waste was floating through the cabin according to once-confidential government documents.

“Give me a napkin quick” Stafford is recorded as saying a few minutes before Cernan spots another one: “Here’s another goddamn turd.”

The feces collection process at the time a NASA report later revealed was an “extremely basic” plastic bag that was “taped to the buttocks.”

“The fecal bag system was marginally functional and was described as very ‘distasteful’ by the crew” an official NASA report from 2007 later revealed. “The bags provided no odor control in the small capsule and the odor was prominent.”

In-space toilets have evolved since then thanks to strenuous efforts from NASA scientists as journalist Mary Roach author of “Packing for Mars” told NPR in 2010.

“The problem here is you’ve got this very elaborate space toilet and you need to test it. Well you’ve got to you know haul it over to Ellington Field board it onto a zero-gravity simulator — a plane that does these elaborate up-and-down arcs — and then you’ve got to find some poor volunteer from the Waste System Management Office to test it. And I don’t know about you but I mean to do it on demand in 20 seconds now that is asking a lot of your colon. So it’s very elaborate and tricky.”

And Roach writes in “Packing for Mars” astronaut potty training is no laughing matter.

“The simple act of urination can without gravity become a medical emergency requiring catheterization and embarrassing radio consults with flight surgeons” she wrote. And because urine behaves differently inside the bladder in space it can be very difficult to tell when one needs to go.

Adapting to space

The human body is evolutionarily designed for life on Earth with its gravity oxygen-rich air and predictable ecological cycles. It is specifically not designed to float disoriented in weightlessness a fact that has caused numerous astronauts to experience a sickening queasiness especially during the first couple of days in orbit.

“I vomited 93 minutes into my first flight” NASA astronaut Steven Smith a veteran of four Space Shuttle missions told one journalist. “That was the first of 100 times over the four flights. It’s odd going to a job where you know you’re going to throw up.”

NASA has a formal term for the illness — Space Adaptation Syndrome which in one paper it estimates about 80% of astronauts have experienced.

Isaacman said that during the Inspiration4 mission he didn’t feel the urge to vomit. But adjusting to microgravity can be uncomfortable.

“It’s just this pooling in your head like when you hang upside down on your bed” he told CNN Business. “But you have to kind of find a way to just ignore it and work through it…About a day later it kind of balances out and you don’t notice it as much.”

Not all of his crewmates were as lucky. Hayley Arceneaux a 29-year-old cancer survivor who served as Inspiration4’s medical officer had to administer Phenergan shots — an antihistamine used to treat motion sickness to combat nausea Isaacman said.

The inescapable fact is that humans will be battling maladies for as long as we continue to look at space and see it as place we should be going. That’s why many journalists including Roach have questioned our tendency to romanticize space travel and downplay the harsh realities and risks.

But despite the discomfort Isaacman said he has zero regrets about his decision to spend roughly $200 million on a three-day spaceflight.

“I hope that this is a model for future missions” he said adding that he believes in SpaceX’s mission to eventually support entire colonies of people living in outer space.

During his flight “I just felt really charged up and energized about the idea that we just have to keep pushing and going further and further.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd2h5eS5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZXMvcHVibGljLXByZXNzdXJlLW1vdW50cy1hZ2FpbnN0LWNoZXN0ZXItaW5jaW5lcmF0b3ItYXMtZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC1yYWNpc20tY2xhaW1zLXBpbGUtdXAv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93aHl5Lm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlcy9wdWJsaWMtcHJlc3N1cmUtbW91bnRzLWFnYWluc3QtY2hlc3Rlci1pbmNpbmVyYXRvci1hcy1lbnZpcm9ubWVudGFsLXJhY2lzbS1jbGFpbXMtcGlsZS11cC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Public pressure mounts against Chester incinerator as environmental racism claims pile up,"The incinerator has been in Chester since 1992 and residents have criticized its presence since its inception.

In addition to the DEP permitting process opponents see an opportunity to reduce pollution at the plant by pressuring county officials to reject Covanta’s attempt to renew a contract that ends on April 30.

The county’s Solid Waste Authority — with some members appointed by former Republican-held county governments — will decide the fate of the contract renewal.

The next public hearing on solid waste management in the county is planned for 6 p.m. on Sept. 30 when a representative from Covanta will be among the panelists.

‘Not fair to this community’

At Wednesday’s virtual permit hearing before DEP public commenters did not pull punches criticizing Covanta.

Nearly two dozen people registered as speakers for the two hour hearing that was accessible via phone and the internet. Various townships boroughs and municipalities across Delaware County were well represented.

Speakers were given three minutes to state their opinion with the DEP.

Mike Ewall founder and executive director of the Energy Justice Network believes the company is not being properly regulated for harsh pollutants. Smokestacks are monitored daily for four specific pollutants but others are not checked by regulators nearly as often.

“That is not appropriate way to monitor what’s really coming out of the stack of these facilities and the technology exists to continuously monitor over 50 different pollutants including many different metals particulate matter other acid gases dioxins and furans and more” said Ewall who has been sparring with Covanta since 1994.

He likened the existing regulation to allowing people to drive all year on the road with no speedometer or rules except on one day.

Ewall wants DEP to require Covanta to continuously monitor its output of particulate matter pollution and other emissions.

WHYY News reached out to Covanta for a response and Nicolle Robles a spokesperson for the company attributed the near unanimous criticism that it received to artificial uproar and scare tactics.

“Covanta is a strong advocate of public discourse and believes it is important residents be part of any dialogue concerning their community. It’s unfortunate that a special interest group has commandeered many of these public hearings with a script that serves only to fear monger” Robles said.

Erica Berman of Media who works in Chester at the Delaware County Historical Society doesn’t accept that.

“Studying the history of Chester I’ve learned the depth of corruption and systemic racism that allowed for the waterfront to be transformed into a hub of industry pollution and waste.” She says it was not an accident that the nation’s biggest incinerator landed in the middle of a low-income Black and brown community.

She believes that allowing the incinerator to continue to operate perpetuates a cycle of racism. She and others on the call cited Chester’s high rate of asthma among residents as evidence of the lifelong harm being done.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbmluc3VsYWRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9qdWRnZS1lbnN1cmVzLXJlY3ljbGUtcGlja3VwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge ensures recycle pickup,"Yvette Stepp of Sequim places cardboard in a recycling bin on Friday at the Port Angeles Regional Transfer Station. (Keith Thorpe/Peninsula Daily News)

PORT ANGELES — Curbside recycling and yard waste collection for 9300 city households and businesses will continue past Thursday.

So will operations at the regional and Blue Mountain waste transfer stations — used by residents throughout Clallam County — while Port Angeles and Waste Connections of Washington Inc. (WCI) officials arbitrate a permanent split Clallam County Superior Court Judge Brent Basden ruled Friday.

Basden granted a temporary restraining order — without a fixed end-date — sought by the city to prevent WCI from discontinuing waste collection as of Oct. 2 and ordered the binding arbitration sought by Waste Connections so the city and company can devise a termination agreement.

Matt O’Connell the Rainier Division vice president of Texas-based Waste Connections Inc. said that almost immediately after the Friday morning ruling company workers began returning about 2000 yard-waste bins that were collected last week in anticipation of the company’s departure.

“They should be back in time for the following week when yard waste will be in service” he said.

Public Works Director Thomas Hunter said Friday after the ruling that the arbitration process would begin this week.

“We look forward to having this process” he said.

“The community shouldn’t have to suffer because someone doesn’t want to follow the contract and contracted service as it’s precisely spelled out and as the judge ordered this morning.”

O’Connell said he is looking forward to resolving the dispute.

“Clearly we are pleased that the judge ordered both of us to move forward toward arbitration” he said.

“Our goal through all of this as we were told in March was to come to a termination agreement as it’s laid out in the contract. We look forward [this] week to working with the city and working with the arbitrator to accomplish that goal.”

The city is taking advantage of a 15-year opt-out clause in a 20-year contract it signed with WCI in 2005 and will go back to doing what it did before contracting with the company.

Hunter said he expects the city can provide better service at a lower cost to residents.

“Our plan is to take over services as they currently stand” he said.

“The numbers showed the time was now and I think that it’s likely had the city chosen to continue with the remaining five years we probably would have made the same decision based on how the industry has evolved over time.”

Waste Connections also built the 18th Street transfer station which it operates and took over operation of the Blue Mountain facility.

WCI employs two drivers four workers at the regional station and one worker at Blue Mountain.

“We are committed to continuing to employ them” O’Connell said. “We will find a spot for them and we want them to remain part of the Waste Connections and Olympic Disposal family.”

WCI was paid $6.1 million in 2020 under the contract a total that increases every year subject to the Consumer Price Index and the Fuel Price Index Hunter said.

Thee are 6058 recycling accounts and 3192 yard-waste accounts.

The Port Angeles City Council voted in March to terminate the agreement effective Friday.

Waste Connections sued the city in July claiming $4.8 million in unpaid fees citing breach of contract and a a depressed global recycling market.

The company filed a complaint Sept. 14 to compel the city to engage in binding arbitration which Basden said both sides had agreed on in July.

WCI also wanted the city to pay $3.2 million in termination costs.

Basden ordered the city to pay an $80000 bond to cover costs subject to review by him or the mediator former King County Superior Court Judge Laura Inveen of Hillyer Dispute Resolution in Seattle.

In arguing for the temporary order Chris Cowgill of the city attorney’s office said the company was insisting the city follow WCI’s terms and was withholding information such as that dealing with employee and transport operations necessary for the city to determine what constitutes a satisfactory termination agreement.

“When actual negotiations happened you probably read from the declaration of Mr. Hunter negotiations began with ‘we will not discuss anything unless the city is willing to attach a $3 million check’” he said.

“The issue is both ways there has been poor communication” Cowgill said.

“Quite frankly the Oct. 2 date is not doable and I can’t imagine it would be doable for either party because in refusing to meet and refusing to exchange information WCI hasn’t received information from the city” he said.

“Negotiations require an exchange of information and not a demand and all the city’s been receiving from WCI is a demand” he said adding that the city cannot get enough information from WCI to come up with a counter-proposal.

In arguing against the order Waste Connections lawyer Alexander Wu of Seattle said the city was dragging its feet over preparing for the company’s departure had not responded for two months to a proposed termination agreement and had avoided setting an arbitration date.

“Waste Connections has been preparing for termination since the city supplied notice in March and set this termination date” Wu said.

“The reason that we’re here is because the city’s not ready to take over services” he said.

“That’s why they haven’t agreed to arbitrate before Judge Inveen this week that’s why they haven’t agreed to arbitrate with Judge Inveen next week.

“And that arbitration in its scope is relatively narrow. It’s an arbitration over what goes in the termination agreement” he said.

“Waste Connections proposed this termination agreement back in April. The city has not made any counter-proposal to that. They haven’t made any revisions to Waste Connections’ proposal and they haven’t put forth their own contract.”

Basden said arbitration was provided for in the contract and that the city did not respond to Waste Connections until the company selected one among four choices.

“It seems relatively clear that the problem here is that the city isn’t prepared to take over collection of yard waste and recycling” Basden said.

“Whose fault that is is not going to be decided by this court at this point.

“I don’t think I need to make that determination because your agreement provided for arbitration.

“It seems to me at this point since July when everyone agreed to go to arbitration that presumably people have been preparing for that arbitration.”

Mountains of garbage are piling up in cities towns and makeshift dumps and persons say they are being sickened by garbage pollution.

The inability of the National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) to effectively collect and dispose of tons of waste generated by households and businesses has resulted in residents being confronted by the stench of rotting animal flesh along with infestation of flies rats and other vermin that feed on fetid garbage. The public-health implications are enormous.

Not only is the NSWMA not effective at collecting trash it has not been able to successfully educate citizens on recycling composting and other waste-mitigating action and strategies. Years of talk and clean-up campaigns have yielded negligible results.

The municipal dumps are not properly managed and as we have seen from time to time methane-filled plumes of smoke emanating from these sites are released into the atmosphere to the detriment of the people and the environment.

NSWMA executive director Audley Gordon has all but admitted in media interviews that the agency is unable to cope. Although if one listened to the glowing report card presented by Minister Desmond McKenzie in his contribution to the 2021 Sectoral Debate one may be convinced that the agency is on solid footing.

Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters.

After bragging about the mobile app meant to identify those who litter and dump garbage illegally and the training of environment wardens he said: “The NSWMA continues to demonstrate sound management by earning its own revenues amounting to $440 million over the last fiscal year.”

He continued: “The agency continues to be an outstanding example of what can be achieved with major investment from central Government bold and innovative leadership and a dedicated workforce.”

NOT ENOUGH TRUCKS

But a chastened Mr Gordon confronted by images of garbage heaps all over the country enumerated the problems faced by the agency. First he said there were not enough trucks. They were promised 120 trucks in 2020. They got 20 with no indication of when the others will be delivered.

Added to that the NSWMA is unable to pay in a timely fashion the contractors whose trucks are used to move garbage. In some cases there are reports that contractors have not been paid in months.

Then there is another factor: the recklessness of citizens who wantonly discard their garbage anywhere only for it to contaminate the waterways around us. This is happening despite the creation of the app and hefty fines for littering and illegal dumping.

If the Government is serious about enforcement it could consider setting up special courts to deal with environmental crimes. It could also consider imposing a cess on households with the funds being earmarked for improving collection and disposal of trash.

When will Jamaica a country that depends on visitors for its survival get to the point where it can be ranked as a clean and environmentally friendly destination? That question takes on additional weight because more and more tourists are considering environmental metrics when they make vacation decisions.

The kind of smugness displayed by the minister in reporting on the performance of the NSWMA sadly smacks of short-sightedness. What hope is there for meaningful change if an agency such as the NSWMA is not held accountable for its stewardship?

The problem of garbage is a global concern and developing countries face grave difficulties in resolving the problem. Yet there exists a slew of new technologies that are being used to transform waste disposal into a profitable business with generation of electricity among them. There are in fact companies that have developed a sustainable business model using new technology.

We acknowledge that it is an expensive activity and that there are not enough tax dollars available to make the adjustments to monetise waste. Government has demonstrated that it is incapable of devising the proper systems to fund and manage this activity. It should do the right thing and divest the service."

But one Left-winger has not attended – due to fears for her own safety. Even more extraordinary is that she’s a Labour MP.

Sir Keir Starmer is doing his best to pour oil on troubled waters. But his problem is simple and fundamental: Labour is a coalition of interests that no longer works. The latest flashpoint for the party’s collapsing coalition is trans rights.

Not long ago it was accepted common-sense that some spaces should be single-sex in the interests of safety or privacy.

But Labour has been racked by bitter arguments over whether or not male-bodied people who identify as women should be treated as women in all circumstances – including single-sex spaces.

Sir Keir Starmer is doing his best to pour oil on troubled waters. But his problem is simple and fundamental: Labour is a coalition of interests that no longer works. The latest flashpoint for the party’s collapsing coalition is trans rights

Activists within the party led by the Labour LGBT+ group say trans women should always be treated as women.

Not only this but the law should be changed so self-identifying your gender is a simple matter of paperwork with no need for medical assessment or any medical changes.

Others such as Rosie Duffield the MP who refuses to attend this weekend’s party conference take a more moderate approach arguing that there are still some settings where biology matters more than identity.

Early this month Duffield made clear her support for trans people being treated with justice and dignity but said this didn’t mean a free pass for males to self-identify as women for all purposes.

Self-identifying as a woman she argued should not be ‘a passport for male-bodied biological men to enter protected spaces for biological women’ such as domestic violence refuges women’s prisons single-sex wards and school toilets.

Opinion polls show this moderate view to be mainstream among the British public.

But for voicing it Labour activists branded Duffield ‘transphobic’ and ‘an incredibly hateful person’ who one angry activist on Twitter claimed is ‘campaigning to make trans people’s lives worse’.

Others such as Rosie Duffield the MP who refuses to attend this weekend’s party conference take a more moderate approach arguing that there are still some settings where biology matters more than identity

Following a months-long barrage of threats and abuse Duffield decided to stay away from her own party conference.

And this isn’t the first time in recent years that Labour’s radical wing has threatened and abused those they see as their enemies.

First they came for the Tories. In 2015 even then-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was forced to condemn the rabble outside the Tory Party conference who harangued and spat at those attending the event.

In 2017 controversy erupted again when effigies of Conservatives were hung from a bridge during their conference in Manchester.

Next the targets were liberal-Left women with political views deemed ‘problematic’. They included the BBC’s political editor Laura Kuenssberg. Though hardly a byword for reactionary conservatism she was given a bodyguard to ensure her physical safety at Labour’s conference in 2017.

Then the following year at the peak of Corbyn’s antisemitism crisis Jewish Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Ruth Smeeth brought bodyguards to protect them at the Labour conference.

The Labour Party conference has been in full swing this weekend with every brand of Left-wing visionary crank and dreamer setting out their stall and seeking support (pictured leader Sir Keir and deputy leader Angela Rayner at the conference today in Brighton)

Being on the ‘right side of history’ it seems makes activists feel they are entitled to behave in ways most of us would consider well beyond the pale.

Commendably Starmer has stamped down on the ugly antisemitism that menaced these women.

After being elected leader he suspended the worst offenders from the party and has prompted howls of activist outrage by refusing to return the whip to Corbyn.

But the aggressive brand of self-righteousness that forced Smeeth and Berger to hire bodyguards hasn’t disappeared.

Instead it’s hopped from ‘anti-zionism’ to a new pet cause: trans rights. And so far Starmer has been noticeably lacking in backbone when it comes to tackling the new face of Labour’s revolutionary vanguard.

After figures as diverse as the Archbishop of Canterbury London mayor Sadiq Khan and Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle condemned the harassment of Duffield a Labour spokesman managed only a disingenuous and feeble: ‘We believe debate should always be held in an atmosphere of respect for all points of view.’

Meanwhile the party’s messages on self-declaration for trans people are still muddled with it insisting it’s committed both to making it easier to self-identify gender – but also insisting it’s committed to the Equality Act.

Critics point out that Labour can’t really have it both ways.

The Equality Act allows for single-sex spaces meaning transgender people may be excluded if it’s a proportional means to a legitimate end. But there’s little guidance on how this conflict should be managed in practice.

As a result this vagueness means that under activist pressure the single-sex provisions in the Equality Act are often not worth the paper they’re written on.

Commendably Starmer has stamped down on the ugly antisemitism that menaced these women. After being elected leader he suspended the worst offenders from the party and has prompted howls of activist outrage by refusing to return the whip to Corbyn

Meanwhile a Bristol University feminist group called Women Talk Back was sanctioned by their own student union for excluding transgender women from some events despite invoking their right to do so under the Equality Act. The group is now taking legal action.

If this all seems arcane think of it as just the latest fissure between the two halves of the increasingly fractious pantomime horse that the Labour Party – and the Left in general – has become.

The back half of that strange beast is the still-large although dwindling part of the electorate that still sees Labour as the party of ordinary people. And the bit in front is a revolutionary vanguard that will stop at nothing – not even reality – in pursuit of its own vision of utopia. And the different parts want contradictory things.

The back part wants decent jobs affordable housing law and order and a social safety net.

The front part hates the West and the nation state (especially Israel) wants to abolish borders and the police applauds statue-smashing and thinks normal families are an oppressive bourgeois construct.

And they’re really really passionate about all of it: so passionate they’ll spit at Tories and harass even their own MPs.

So that leaves Starmer not so much spineless as stymied. Because his most enthusiastic activists belong to the front part of the pantomime horse. And he can’t really do without their energy and commitment.

But that enthusiasm comes part and parcel with their opinions – opinions that horrify even ordinary Labour voters let alone the rest of the country.

Ever since Starmer became Labour leader his facial expression has made me think of a man with terrible gas: terrified to move a muscle lest he make a humiliating noise

Ever since Starmer became Labour leader his facial expression has made me think of a man with terrible gas: terrified to move a muscle lest he make a humiliating noise.

His latest attempt to smooth over the roiling digestive issues in his own party was a 12216-word treatise already widely-mocked for containing absolutely no new ideas. But no new ideas is surely the point.

Starmer’s soothing centrist babble is designed to drown any alarming gurgles (or worse) from below.

He might have saved his breath because it’s not working. The moderates find it devoid of inspiration while his party’s radicals have not left off accusing him of being a power-crazed closet Tory.

How much longer can Starmer hold together a coalition that isn’t even on speaking terms with itself?

They’re back big time. Three of the big four banks are back – while Wells Fargo keeps getting slapped on the wrist – after all four were out of it last year due to pandemic-rated financial restrictions. Intel fell out of it. But the rest of Big Tech is in and Apple bigger than ever. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway after rightfully dissing share buybacks for years has become one of the largest share buyback queens. And Charter Communications has jumped into it massively.

The top 10 companies – ranked by their cumulative buybacks over the past five years – bought back more of their shares than ever in Q2: $85 billion according to S&P Dow Jones Indices this week accounting for 43% of the total share buybacks by all S&P 500 companies. Since 2014 these 10 companies bought back $1.13 trillion of their own shares.

The two surges in the chart below – first after the corporate tax cuts in 2017 and second after Q2 2020 – quadrupled the quarterly rate of share buybacks for these 10 companies from around $20 billion a quarter in the four years through 2017 to $85 billion in Q2 (data via YCharts.com):

The top 10 share buyback queens based on their share buybacks in Q2 2021:

Top 10 Companies Share Buybacks in Billion $ Q2 2021 12 months 5-year total 1 Apple [AAPL] 25.6 89.7 334.1 2 Alphabet [GOOG] 12.8 40.0 87.7 3 Facebook [FB] 8.4 19.2 51.1 4 Oracle [ORCL] 8.0 21.6 93.8 5 Microsoft [MSFT] 7.2 27.4 92.4 6 JPMorgan [JPM] 6.2 11.0 81.5 7 Berkshire Hathaway [BRK.A] 6.0 30.5 43.5 8 BofA [BAC] 4.2 8.1 78.5 9 Charter Comm. [CHTR] 3.5 14.9 42.8 10 Union Pacific [UNP] 3.1 5.2 28.1

Rounding out the top 20 are in that order: Lowe’s Home Depot Morgan Stanley P&G Citigroup Walmart HCA Healthcare Visa Chubb and Mastercard. Wells Fargo and Intel which used to be in the Top 10 have fallen off the list entirely.

In total 294 of the S&P 500 companies reported buybacks in Q2 of at least $5 million down from 335 companies in Q1 2021. But the top 10 did the lion’s share of buying.

Combined they bought back $199 billion of their own shares in Q2 the fourth largest amount ever behind the records in the three quarters through Q1 2019 following the corporate tax cuts (blue columns in the chart below).

Since the beginning of 2012 the S&P 500 companies have bought back nearly $5.5 trillion of their own shares with the top 10 share buyback queens accounting for 25% of it.

But in recent years this has gotten a lot more top heavy. In Q2 2021 the top 10 accounted for 43%.

But without the Top 10 share buyback queens the share buybacks by the remaining 284 companies amounted to only $114 billion (red line) roughly flat with Q1 and below most quarters in prior years – that’s how top-heavy this scheme has become:

Even today as crazy as this sounds the $5.5 trillion that the S&P 500 companies incinerated on buying back their own shares is a lot of money. They could have been invested in expansion projects in the US and in labor in the US rather than in cheap labor overseas and in training or god forbid the companies could have tried to somewhat less aggressively dodge US income taxes and pay a little more given that the US government deficit has been horrendous for years and has become more horrendous with the corporate tax cut of 2017 and has become a lot more horrendous starting in March 2020

Along with share buybacks comes the corporate debt and it has ballooned as many companies borrowed heavily to fund the share buybacks.

Nonfinancial corporate debt (bonds and loans outstanding owed by companies other than lenders) spiked in the first half of 2020 and in Q2 reached a new record of $11.2 trillion having soared by 73% over the past eight years. The $5.5 trillion incinerated on share buybacks played a large role in creating this debt:

The primary purpose of share buybacks is to undo the dilution of their EPS metric that occurs due to massive executive stock-based compensation packages. These share buybacks hide the cost of stock-based compensation on EPS; and many of those share buybacks are funded with debt but debt doesn’t impact EPS.

In terms of actually lowering the share count: Only 5.4% of the companies that did share buybacks reduced their share count by at least 4% year-over-year according to S&P. This 5.4% share was down from a 17.8% share a year ago and from the 28.2% share in Q1 2016.

Some people are fortunate enough to be able to cover all their needs and wants with just one primary income source. Others however have to stretch each paycheck to cover their basic expenses. And according to a report conducted by the TIAA Institute millennials are the generation most likely to face financial strain in areas such as paying down debt and saving money. Millennials — classified by the Pew Research Center as people born between 1981 and 1996 — have gotten a ton of attention as a generation struggling to balance their lifestyle costs with their financial goals. And a large part of that imbalance could stem from not earning enough money to float their costs. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau the median millennial household pretax income was $71566 in 2020. However a Sunmark Credit Union study on the spending habits of different generations found that millennials spend an average of $208.77 per day. This includes the average daily costs of groceries housing utilities insurance entertainment eating out and more. That number works out to be $1461.39 spent each week and $5845.56 per month. But at the end of the year the average person will have spent $70146.72 — just under the median millennial income. Spending almost as much as they earn each year means that there's less room to save for emergencies or invest for retirement. But with the average cost of rent — millennials' largest expense — weighing in at $1584 for a studio and $1636 for a one-bedroom in the U.S. many millennials find that their wages just aren't enough to allow them to keep up with the costs of day-to-day life.

Factors affecting millennial earnings

The 2008 recession took a huge financial toll on millennials. A lack of jobs meant that fewer millennials were able to earn income or advance their careers which set them back financially. In fact a report from a non-profit group called the Young Invincibles found that the 2008 economic downturn cost younger workers an estimated $22000 in lost earnings per person. Even after out-of-work millennials finally landed jobs in the years following the recession their salaries had decreased. The Hamilton Project an economic analysis from the Brookings Institute found that prior to economy-related job loss millennials earned around $3640 per month which works out to be $43700 annually. But two years after the recession hit those who landed jobs earned an average monthly income of only $1910 ($23000 per year). Millennials have had to work their way back up from this staggering difference in earnings. And while the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic had an effect that played out across all age groups it seemed as if millennials took yet another hit as they are the largest generation currently in the workforce. According to the Pew Research Center 30% of Americans between the ages of 30 and 49 say that they or someone in their household lost a job due to the pandemic. However it may still be too early to see the pandemic's full impact on millennial earning potential.

Bottom line

Millennials have already lost a lot of ground when it comes to their earnings thanks to the 2008 recession and now the Covid-19 pandemic. But by taking some small steps like using credit cards that let them save on interest investing and supplementing their income through side hustles millennials can start to strike a better balance between what they need and what they can afford.

OUR VERDICT

The first SSD with 128-layer NAND SK hynix’s Gold P31 delivers great performance and power efficiency for the money.

Comparison Products

As the SK hynix Gold P31 touts high-performance we find it fitting to compare it against the best SSDs going. From the company's arch-nemesis we include the Samsung 970 EVO Plus  as well as the 2-bit MLC V-NAND-based 970 PRO. We also threw in one of our favorite SSDs Adata’s XPG SX8200 Pro and Seagate’s super-fast PCIe Gen4-based FireCuda 520 . Crucial’s P5 and MX500 were included as were WD’s Black SN750  Blue SN550  and WD Black 7200 RPM HDD .

Game Scene Loading - Final Fantasy XIV

Final Fantasy XIV Stormbringer is a free real-world game benchmark that easily and accurately compares game load times without the inaccuracy of using a stopwatch.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

SK hynix’s Gold P31 delivers exceptional game load performance. With the fastest load time in the comparison pool it goes unmatched. Not only did it beat Samsung’s 970 EVO Plus and 970 Pro it even bested Adata’s SX8200 Pro one of the most responsive SSDs we have tested thus far.

Transfer Rates – DiskBench

We use the DiskBench storage benchmarking tool to test file transfer performance with our own custom blocks of data. Our 50GB data set includes 31227 files of various types like pictures PDFs and videos. Our 100GB set includes 22579 files with 50GB of them being large movies. We copy the data sets to new folders and then follow-up with a reading test of a newly written 6.5GB zip file and 15GB movie file.

Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

With a PCIe 4.0 x4 interface Seagate’s FireCuda 520 outscores the test pool eclipsing the performance of SK hynix’s Gold P31. However the Gold P31 still offers up the second-fastest performance we have seen in our read tests. With a 4-channel controller it comes up short of fourth place in the the 50GB and 100GB copy tests. Both the Samsung SSDS and the Adata XPG SX8200 Pro take the lead in the smaller transfer while the WD Black SN750 replaces the Adata on the boards at 100GB. Still the SK hynix Gold P31 delivers very respectable results overall.

Trace Testing – PCMark 10 Storage Tests

PCMark 10 is a trace-based benchmark that uses a wide-ranging set of real-world traces from popular applications and common tasks to measure the performance of storage devices. The quick benchmark is more relatable to those who use their PCs for leisure or basic office work while the full benchmark relates more to power users.

Image 1 of 6 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Both high bandwidth and low latency random performance are needed to do well in PCMark 10’s quick and full system drive benchmarks. Fortunately for SK hynix the company’s Gold P31 offers up both scoring third place in both benchmarks. It clearly is superior in performance to Samsung’s offerings under light use cases but it fell behind both the Phison E16-powered FireCuda 520 as well as the insanely responsive Adata.

Trace Testing – SPECworkstation 3

Like PCMark 10 SPECworkstation 3 is a trace-based benchmark but it is designed to push the system harder by measuring workstation performance in professional applications.

Image 1 of 5 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

While SK hynix’s Gold P31 scores third place once more this time under a bombardment of prosumer workloads it delivers very strong performance. It completed the benchmark over a minute faster than the Adata XPG SX8200 Pro two minutes faster than the 970 EVO Plus and absolutely leaves the Crucial P5 in the dust. Although even with all the SLC caching and tuning and tweaking the company could do the TLC NAND still can't sustain heavy writes or respond as well to heavy abuse as Samsung's 3D MLC V-NAND on the 970 Pro which scores first place in this benchmark.

Synthetic Testing - ATTO / iometer

iometer is an advanced and highly-configurable storage benchmarking tool while ATTO is a simple and free application that SSD vendors commonly use to assign sequential performance specifications to their products. Both of these tools give us insight into how the device handles different file sizes.

Image 1 of 10 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

In ATTO we tested SK hynix’s Gold P31 at a QD of 1 representing most day-to-day file access at various block sizes and it performed very well. In sequential reads  the Gold P31 maintained a strong lead over the competition from the 4KB file size up to 512KB. However similar to the Crucial P5 at the 1MB file size there was a significant decline in performance falling just below 2 GBps. Sequential write performance was strong regardless of the file size and final sequential performance figures peaked at 3597 / 3408 MBps.

Additionally random performance from the SK hynix is phenomenal. Not only does it offer up random read speed that is nearly on par with the Adata XPG SX8200 Pro but also it’s random write performance is a bit better. Not to mention when hammered with a high QD workload it delivers the second-highest random read result of 505910 IOPS and a very competitive 519201 write IOPS.

Sustained Write Performance and Cache Recovery

Official write specifications are only part of the performance picture. Most SSDs implement a write cache which is a fast area of (usually) pseudo-SLC programmed flash that absorbs incoming data. Sustained write speeds can suffer tremendously once the workload spills outside of the cache and into the ""native"" TLC or QLC flash. We use iometer to hammer the SSD with sequential writes for 15 minutes to measure both the size of the write cache and performance after the cache is saturated. We also monitor cache recovery via multiple idle rounds.

Image 1 of 5 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

At 1TB the Gold P31 delivers some very-strong write performance from empty outperforming some top competitors. SK hynix’s Gold P31 absorbed roughly 90GB-92GB of data at a rate of 3.4 GBps before degrading in performance. The SSD’s initial after cache performance averages a rather inconsistent 1570 MBps before finally degrading to a more consistent 1475 MBps until full.

After letting the SSD idle over multiple idle rounds ranging from 30 seconds up to a half an hour only a 6GB SLC write cache recovered each time. That’s in contrast to the behavior of Samsung Crucial and Phison SSD controllers but similar to the Silicon Motion SM2262EN’s behavior that takes longer idle periods to recover the remaining dynamic cache.

Power Consumption and Temperature

We use the Quarch HD Programmable Power Module to gain a deeper understanding of power characteristics. Idle power consumption is an important aspect to consider especially if you're looking for a laptop upgrade. Some SSDs can consume watts of power at idle while better-suited ones sip just milliwatts. Average workload power consumption and max consumption are two other aspects of power consumption but performance-per-watt is more important. A drive might consume more power during any given workload but accomplishing a task faster allows the drive to drop into an idle state faster which ultimately saves power.

We also monitor the temperature of the drive via the S.M.A.R.T. data and an IR thermometer to see when (or if) thermal throttling kicks in and how it impacts performance. Bear in mind that results will vary based on the workload and ambient air temperature.

Image 1 of 5 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

With just a four-channel controller LPDDR4 DRAM and some very efficient high-speed flash SK hynix’s Gold P31 is the current champ to beat when it comes to file copy efficiency. With an efficiency score of 350 MBps per watt consumed it blows past the competition.

It consumed under 2.43W on average and peaked at just a tad over 4W under our 50GB copy workload and at idle it consumes fairly little power especially in its active state with ASPM disabled. When ASPM is enabled the Gold P31 could use a bit more idle optimization; Adata’s SX8200 Pro sips just 10mW in its lowest idle state on our desktop test bench.

And because it consumes so little power the SK hynix Gold P31 can sustain being written to continuously without much concern of thermal throttling. With an IR thermometer we measured peak controller package temps of 75 degrees Celsius near the end of a 350GB write transfer with no airflow in a 24 degrees Celsius environment. And at idle it measured 35 degrees Celsius.

The benefits of staging is that cramped messy and older-looking homes can have their interior quickly transformed for photographs and home opens to raise the selling price – however this comes at a cost not every seller is able to afford.

For a cheaper option staging has now gone virtual.

Although not a new concept Arcadia Group Sales Manager Brett Hancock said digital staging technology had drastically improved.

“I’ve been using digital staging for probably the last six or seven years but in the last two or three years it’s certainly gotten a lot better and it’s just getting better as technology progresses” he said.

“In the early days of digital staging it was very basic and probably did more damage than anything I would say but it does give a much better perspective of the property.”

Mr Hancock said digital staging was specifically useful for apartments – as moving furniture was a lot more difficult – and was more affordable in comparison to physical staging which could cost upwards of $3000.

“Real staging is quite expensive but it’s obviously the best option because when people do come to look at the property they can actually see the furniture in the home and sit on it feel it see the sizes and how it works in the space” he said.

“But this is the next best thing – to stage virtually you can do it for $300 to $500.”

Century 21 Advance Realty Principal and Director Paul Duffy said his team started incorporating digital staging at a time when there were no physical services in the South West.

“It was quite an expensive ordeal to stage a property” he said. “Back then it was over $5000 a house for four weeks to stage.

“It was a lot cheaper to pay $100 to stage a house with virtual furniture than it was for physical staging.”

Mr Duffy said the online interest of a home increased tenfold when the property was staged – whether physical or digital – compared to an empty home.

“They’re seeing a dream” he said. “Buyers go through hundreds of houses on the internet and if it has been staged you will get more views with potential buyers clicking through every image to really study the house which is more likely to lead to a phone call.”

Mr Duffy said technological advancements meant even he struggled to tell the difference between physical and virtual furniture on his own listings.

“Everything like coffee tables flowers on benches and pictures on walls – when we first started five years ago some of that looked a little bit tacky and it just wasn’t quite right” he said.

Mr Hancock said using digital staging was a balance of exposing the potential of the home without overdoing it and misleading buyers.

“It definitely is an effective tool as long as it’s used correctly” he said. “You don’t want to put a king-sized bed with bedsides into a property that can only fit a single bed so it needs to be done effectively and we need to be accurate in the way it’s presented.

“That’s something that you do need to have an understanding of because it can give people the wrong impression of the size of the property if it’s not used correctly.”

According to Mr Hancock the ability to quickly shift between different styles to better suit potential buyers is another big advantage not available in the past.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXJlbmRyYW1vZGkuaW4vcHJpbWUtbWluaXN0ZXItbmFyZW5kcmEtbW9kaS10by1sYXVuY2gtcHJhZGhhbi1tYW50cmktZGlnaXRhbC1oZWFsdGgtbWlzc2lvbi1vbi0yN3RoLXNlcHRlbWJlci01NTc1MjPSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmFyZW5kcmFtb2RpLmluL2FtcC9wcmltZS1taW5pc3Rlci1uYXJlbmRyYS1tb2RpLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1wcmFkaGFuLW1hbnRyaS1kaWdpdGFsLWhlYWx0aC1taXNzaW9uLW9uLTI3dGgtc2VwdGVtYmVyLTU1NzUyMw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PM to launch Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission on 27th September,"Your government did not announce any major populist schemes in the interim budget before the elections perhaps confident in its own delivery record? How has this played out in the campaign especially with the Opposition focusing significantly on freebies?

People realise that we have worked hard for them in the last 10 years. People have seen the difference in their lives. Due to our track record we did not need any populist measures going into elections. People also see this as a sign of our government’s earnest behaviour.

The people have seen the speed and scale with which we deliver our promises. They saw that this government inherited a country that was one of the ‘Fragile 5’ economies at the time and scaled it up to become the fastest-growing economy of the world. We have kept the average inflation at its lowest in one decade. Our unemployment rate is the lowest in the world.

The work that has taken place in the last one decade is more than the work done in seven decades since Independence. We have more than doubled the number of airports from 74 to more than 150 in 10 years. The length of national highways has gone up from 91000 km to 145000 km within a decade. India was once a cash dependent economy. Today we are dominating the real time payments globally with a lion share of 46%. Our defence exports have crossed the ₹21000 crore mark.

We have liberated the country from legacy issues. Be it huge NPAs endangering the Indian banking system or abrogating Article 370 ushering a new era of peace in Jammu & Kashmir.

Today we’ve built a strong economy that will serve as the base for India’s next 25 years. In fact our Sankalp Patra isn’t just about the next five years. It’s about making long-lasting changes and outlining the roadmap that will lead to a Viksit Bharat by 2047.

In these 10 years we’ve shown the world that true progress is about empowering every citizen and giving them the tools they need to succeed. Our focus has been on empowering the poor creating opportunities for them to thrive.

We’ve made sure that 80 crore people have access to free ration more than 50 crore people have their own bank accounts 11 crore toilets are built and 60 crore people have access to quality health care without shouldering the immense financial burden.

Our policies are centered around uplifting the poor ensuring that they’re at the heart of everything we do. In fact in the last 10 years 25 crore people have come out of poverty in India.

The Opposition’s agenda is either to snatch people’s wealth or ensure faith based reservations by denying the rights of SC ST and OBC communities. All they want is ‘Modi Hatao’. People will not fall for such regressive and communal politics.

Which are the states where you can see the BJP making gains from its 2019 tally? And why?

It is the overwhelming will of the people across India to bring us back with a historic mandate. I have held public meetings and roadshows across the country and wherever I go I see a tsunami of ‘Jan Samarthan’ (popular endorsement) for our party. Across India people have witnessed how a strong decisive and sensitive government has secured the nation and solidified its position in the world. People are fed up of corruption dynastic politics minority appeasement ruining state after state wherever there is (a) INDI Alliance (government). Therefore they want NDA again. Our gains will come from all parts of the country and some of the gains will come from areas that will surprise political Pundits.

You will see Uttar Pradesh West Bengal Odisha Telangana Andhra Pradesh Tamil Nadu and Kerala register a significant increase in our seats.

You focused a lot on the southern states this time. Especially Tamil Nadu and Kerala are seen as the last peak remaining for the BJP to conquer. What do you think needs to be done?

We do not subscribe to a mindset of conquest. We are working with a feeling of service towards 140 crore Indians. For us every part of India has to be served.

Our connection with the people of South India including Tamil Nadu and Kerala is not new. We’ve dedicated ourselves to serving the people there regardless of whether we are in government or not. Our karyakartas have been working selflessly for decades many even sacrificed their lives in the process.

People are tired of the corruption appeasement and family-first politics of the INDI Alliance seen in various southern states. In Andhra Pradesh there is a breakdown of governance threatening the future of the youth in the state. In Telangana and Karnataka too a nexus of corruption has been established with Congress in the lead. In a matter of a few months Congress has managed to hollow out the public treasury and bring the states closer to a state of bankruptcy. Same is the case in Tamil Nadu where there is corruption and dynastic politics.

On the other hand people have witnessed how effectively Modi ki Guarantee works. They have seen our work our commitment to their well-being and our dedication to bring inclusive development clean governance and transparency. This time around our performance will be unprecedented.

I see a strong sense of positivity and enthusiasm for the BJP. Our message of development and progress is resonating strongly with the people of South India.

The BJP is going into the 2024 elections as a clear favourite. How are you ensuring that there is no complacency within your ranks?

Our party was born out of years of struggle and with only one ideology i.e. of Nation First. It grew from a party which only had two members in the Lok Sabha to a party that won full majority twice and is now going to come back for a third term with an even bigger mandate.We did not build the party thinking that we have won one election and now we can relax till the next election. We treated every win as our duty to live up to the trust people bestowed on us. Our karyakartas are always on a mission-mode to serve the person at the last mile. Our vision is crystal clear i.e. 24x7 for 2047.

Therefore there is hardly any scope of complacency within the BJP. We are here to fulfil the vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047.

Let me explain to you in cricket terminology. If in a test match a team has a massive lead over the other in the first innings still the team with advantage plays the match with full spirit to create new records. Similarly we know that the opposition has conceded defeat and has given a kind of walkover to us but still our karyakartas are energised and our party is fighting this election with full sportsman-like spirit.

For us elections are a festival of democracy. Every citizen gets the opportunity to be part of this celebration and hence as a party we try to reach out to each and every one. It is also a time for people to evaluate our performance and our karyakartas make sure that people have all the information and awareness on the kind of work that has taken place in the last decade.

In this election the energy and liveliness in BJP booths is palpable. I tell our party karyakartas that on the day of election take everyone along while going out to vote and create a festive and jubilant atmosphere. The world should see how joyfully and collectively India celebrates its democracy.

There’s been a lot of controversy over the Prajwal Revanna tapes in Karnataka. While the law will take its own course and the elections are over there as the PM is there something you wish to say on this controversy especially since the JD(S) is your ally and you addressed an election meeting in Hassan.

I firmly believe that every Indian citizen is equal in the eyes of the law. Be it Sandeshkhali or Karnataka whoever committed such heinous acts whether they belong to any party must face severe consequences must face the strictest punishment. And it’s the duty of the state government to ensure law and order whichever part of India it is.

Do you think our election campaigns have failed to keep pace with the times? We are still talking about religion and caste and freebies and reservation when there are far more important issues that need to be discussed.

Please do a detailed analysis of the speeches by people from all parties and you will see who is speaking progressive points and who is only focussing on regressive issues. Today in the world of Artificial Intelligence you can do this comparative analysis very quickly.

If the Congress party’s agenda is to take away the reservation of SCs STs and OBCs and give it to their vote banks unconstitutionally on the basis of religion then it will have to be questioned. In such a situation being silent would be incorrect.

It is the Congress party that is bringing religion and divisive issues agendas into the picture.

The people of these communities are raising questions about their dangerous agenda and as a party that represents the people’s aspirations we will also reflect their concerns.

These are important questions that need to be answered by the Congress.

As for keeping pace with the times if you observe our party’s manifesto or the speeches of our leaders it is clear that we are the only party speaking about creating a developed India about a net-zero future about becoming the third largest economy etc.

In some states the BJP is also fighting against parties that have been supporting your legislative agenda in Parliament. How different is it from fighting an ideologically hostile Opposition?

Ours is a strong and vibrant democracy with many different ideas ideologies and schools of thought. They are all welcome.

There can be differences in ideology but I do not think there should be hostility. And there must always be a consensus on some basic issues affecting the unity and integrity of our nation.

Non-Congress parties especially those like the BJP have been in the Opposition benches for a long time at both Centre and state levels. So these parties have a certain level of maturity pragmatism and constructive attitude.

For most such parties fighting elections against each other but agreeing on certain issues in terms of legislation and governance has been a common experience. This has been the norm for most of our democratic history not an aberration.

The aberration is the behaviour of the Congress party in recent years. It is only when the Congress party went out of power and into the Opposition that they resorted to creating a bitter hostile and unrelenting atmosphere. Even some Congress leaders themselves feel this is not correct but do not express it out of fear for their political future within the party.

I think it is mainly because the top leadership of the Congress has not yet come to terms with being out of power. They have not been able to accept the fact that the country has moved on from them. But the more time they spend in Opposition hopefully they will also learn.

The BJP has been very open and welcoming of leaders from other parties including those whose ideologies were once very opposed to the party’s. Do you think this is in some way weakening your own ideological core?

See in 2019 the BJP got nearly 23 crore (230 million) votes. This is far more than we ever got in history. Many of these people would perhaps have voted for us for the first time in 2014 or 2019.

Earlier there used to be a lot of misconceptions about us and our ideology. But in the last few years more and more people are seeing our work and finding our ideology and mission appealing.

So there is a general movement towards the BJP in larger society itself. The political sphere too is not immune to this. So we welcome anyone who wants to come with open arms as long as they believe in our vision and mission.

Given that the Communists have become just a shell of their past self we are perhaps the only ideological and cadre-driven party in India. Therefore today young people are attracted towards our party and BJP is their first choice. They also know that in dynasty based parties their talent gets strangled and to get ahead in the party they have to indulge in sycophancy while in BJP even a normal Panna Pramukh can become Prime Minister of the country. Being cadre-driven means that no one group or family decides the party’s future. So anyone who is in our party will have to win the trust of the cadre by working with the principle of ‘Nation First’.

What next for Narendra Modi?

I am nothing but a sevak of Ma Bharati. I never think about what is next for me. I am thinking what all I can do to fulfil the dreams and aspirations of my family of 140 crore Indians. The last 10 years have only been a trailer. There is a lot that I want to do.

Before entering the election fray I had asked all the government departments to prepare a 100-day plan. Our Sankalp Patra provides a roadmap of the next five years. We are also laying out the vision for Viksit Bharat by 2047 the foundation for which has already been built. So we have our task cut out.

Having filled the gaping holes left by 60 years of Congress rule in our first term and putting India on a fast track of growth in our second term our third term will be an era of accelerated development at a scale never seen before.

I am committed to strengthening and structuring the GYANM model that empowers our Gareeb Yuva Annadata Nari Shakti and Middle Class in such a way that they become the architects of Viksit Bharat.

Most analysts predict a third term for your government with the only question being the size of the majority. What would be the big theme of this third term? Alternatively what do you see as the biggest task remaining to be done after two terms in office?

When we came to government in 2014 we had to make sure that the mistakes of the past were rectified and a strong foundation was built.

Whether it is the poor or farmers or the banking sector or the economy each of these were in deep trouble.

On the one hand we took basics like toilets bank accounts gas connections electricity etc to the poor and on the other hand we rescued our banking sector and economy with multiple reforms.

Our country raised crores of people out of poverty and also became the fastest growing economy.

Due to our reforms many sectors have attained a life of their own – from manufacturing to start-ups to space.

Due to our good work the people gave us a second term with an even bigger mandate in 2019.

In the second term the people saw India becoming the fifth largest economy in the world.

Whether it was in terms of action against Article 370 in Jammu Kashmir and Ladakh or successful management of Covid-19 or sending vaccines and medicines to various countries or the foreign policy successes in the post-pandemic world order many such developments have given the people of India a new-found confidence in themselves and the country’s future.

Earlier the people of our country were shackled due to poverty corruption and misrule. Due to their daily battles with these problems they could not aspire towards a larger vision for their future or the country’s.

But our work of the last few years has given wings to the people’s aspirations and organically given rise to the vision of building a developed India by 2047.

The big theme of our third term is about imparting momentum across sectors towards the realisation of this vision.

From plans for the next five years to the plan for the first 100 days of the government we are ready with many targets and are raring to go.

A lot needs to be done and will be done. This is going to be one of the most exciting periods in the history of independent India.

Your third term is going to see the delimitation exercise that will serve as a precursor to the redrawing of seats in the Lok Sabha and also the implementation of the women’s reservation. Both are going to be challenging with there being a lot of insecurity about what the changes could mean. How do you plan to tackle these?

Delimitation is not happening for the first time in our nation. These are established processes which have happened on various occasions. I do not think it needs to be seen with the lens of politics. I was the chief minister of Gujarat when the last delimitation exercise happened. Not once did we raise any issue. In fact whatever was required from us as a state government we cooperated to the fullest.

In any case taking people into confidence winning their trust and building consensus is something that is part of our track record.

GST was brought in through consensus by taking everyone’s views into account. Going above partisan considerations we addressed everyone’s concerns. Today the GST Council is a wonderful example of how different stakeholders work together.

Since you mentioned women’s reservation remember that this was a topic that had seen a lack of consensus for decades. But we showed the ability to take everyone into confidence bring about a consensus and pass this historic bill.

I can give you many such examples. I am sure our clean intent and clear track record will help us in many such issues even in the future.

You gave a sharp response to the Sam Pitroda comment last week. The issues of Prajwal Revanna the unbelievable amounts of money recovered from aides of Jharkhand minister Alamgir the issue of the mangalsutra mandir-masjid have all been raked up. Don’t they distract from real poll issues?

Everyone knows that this person (Pitroda) is very close to the shahi (royal); first family of the Congress. Hence if the Congress reaches close to power then the approach of looking at inheritance tax or appearance of Indians using a divisive and racist lens will be dangerous for the country. Hence these issues have to be brought to the public and discussed.

They have reached the stage of giving reservations on the basis of faith and insulting the Constitution. Shouldn’t there be a discussion on this conspiracy to snatch reservation from SCs STs OBCs and give it to others?

The Congress’s track record of vote bank politics its prominence and its statements are in public. When they say that they will X-ray people’s property and redistribute it what does it mean? Shouldn’t there be discussion on the dangers of such a mindset

Actually I am surprised that the media has not delved deeply into the dangerous statements of Congress’s prince and the destructive thoughts in its manifesto. Hence I had to raise these issues.

Look at their hypocrisy. On the one hand the Congress’s prince is talking about X-raying ordinary people’s property and on the other trucks full of cash are being recovered from people close to their party. These issues are connected to the elections and I have to raise them.

Now that you have raised Prajwal Revanna’s issue let me make it clear we have zero tolerance for such issues. There is a need to take such allegations extremely seriously and there should be strict legal action against such criminals.

But tell me one thing have these reprehensible incidents happened now? These happened over many years and during this time the Congress also tied up with Prajwal Revanna’s party. This means that they knew everything and they kept quiet for years. Now they are using these only for the elections even though the state government is theirs and they could have acted against this earlier but didn’t.

This shows their severe lack of commitment towards women’s safety and dignity. It is despicable that for the Congress such an important issue is just a political game.

The Opposition may have failed to stitch together a national coalition but regional parties and the Congress have fielded joint candidates in more than 300 seats. Do you sense any challenge from this?

For many decades India saw the problems arising from unstable governments where there was no common agenda other than power. The Congress was at the centre of all that instability.

The scams of that era the policy paralysis surrendering to terrorism the poor state of the economy are all fresh in the public’s mind.

Other than this people are seeing that the INDI alliance has no common vision other than ‘Modi Hatao’. Day and night they abuse each other in a way even opponents don’t. But they’re sharing a stage for opposing Modi.

In contrast for the last 10 years the nation saw the benefits of a strong and stable government. In a rapidly changing and challenging world people know that India needs to be stable secure and strong. Hence I don’t think that the Congress and the INDI alliance can win people’s confidence no matter how many seats they may contest.

Many observers feel there is no worthy discussion on unemployment and inflation. What is your opinion?

Our government’s track record on controlling inflation and creating employment is excellent. Everyone knows that during the second term of the UPA government yearly average inflation was in double digits. Where the UPA gave the public double digit inflation the NDA government controlled inflation despite the churn of the Covid pandemic.

If we talk about employment generation there has been very good work on this too.

Take the example of government jobs. The employment fairs that we are conducting are ensuring the creation of lakhs of jobs. I had earlier mentioned that this campaign is to create 10 lakh government jobs. I am a part of many such employment fairs myself.

You also focus on the development work done in the last 10 years.

Earlier we were nowhere in mobile manufacturing but today we are the world’s second-largest mobile maker. The most important thing is that we have become an exporter of mobile phones from being an importer.

Whether you talk of Vande Bharat trains or toy manufacturing many things are being made in India.

In this time many sectors such as start ups and electric vehicles have taken flight. Today we are the world’s third-largest start-up ecosystem. In 2014 we only had 100-or-so start ups today the figure is close to 100000. In all these sectors there has been large-scale employment generation.

Apart from this we have run the biggest mission of infrastructure development in independent India. Every year there has been record investment in the infrastructure sector. The number of airports has doubled. Highways are being constructed at a record pace. The number of cities with metros has quadrupled during our government’s tenure. The expansion of infrastructure at this large scale has boosted employment generation in several sectors.

We have also encouraged small and medium industries. Crores of people have used the benefits of Mudra loans to start their business for the first time.

Yearly PLFS data shows clearly that between 2017 and 2023 the number of workers increased by 56%. At the same time unemployment remained at a historic low of 3.2%.

Today our country is the world’s fastest-growing major economy. And this growth is due to sectors that are generating employment.

I am only sharing some facts and figures. I also want to remind you that if you look at the tenure of the Congress government before 2014 there was neither any sign of growth nor any jobs.

You have done several experiments in politics and administration. In your third term what will be your first step?

This is an interesting question. But does anyone who runs a successful restaurant tell you what his recipe for success is? It’s always a surprise. So you wait a bit. The moment our government is back we will be back to work and not just the first step but our every step will be dedicated to the public the poor and the benefit of humankind.

One more thing you have acknowledged that in the last 10 years we have done several innovations and experiments with great results. But as I have said before this is a trailer. We have to take many big decisions in realising the dream of a developed India. A glimpse of that may be visible in the first 100 days of the third term

Back in December The New York Times reported that just 1% of the businesses that received federal COVID-19 relief raked in over a quarter of the total loan amounts disbursed. ""The money"" the Times wrote ""was shared unevenly with the biggest sums going to a sliver of the companies in need."" Roughly 600 large businesses received maximum loans amounts of $10 million. Even public companies with massive cash reserves – like Ruth's Chris Shake Shack and AutoNation – took in PPP loans casting doubt over the program's ability to fairly distribute aid.

The program however faced it's perhaps worst reputational blow even months before that report when it was revealed that scores of lawmakers (and their families) received millions in loans for their own personal businesses even when these same lawmakers may have had a hand in writing the program's provisions. To boot some of these lawmakers opposed legislation that would have added to the program's transparency potentially allowing them to benefit from undue federal aid behind the curtain.

Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter Crash Course.

According to a Sludge report  at least 28 members of Congress (or their spouses) benefited from some $27 million in small business loans. Some of these members include Reps. Dean Phillips D-Minn. Kevin Hern R-Okla. Greg Pence R-Ind. and Carol Miller R-W.Va.

One of these lawmakers Rep. Mike Kelly R-Pa. received federal loans ranging between $150000 and $350000 for his various car dealerships according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. Kelly who voted ""no"" on the TRUTH Act – which would have required the SBA to disclose all of the PPP's recipients in addition to their loan amounts – is tied to four businesses that benefited from the program including Mike Kelly Automotive Group Inc. Mike Kelly Automotive LP Mike Kelly Hyundai Inc. and Kelly Chevrolet Cadillac.

A spokesperson for his office told the Inquirer that Kelly is ""not involved in the day-to-day operations of his auto dealerships and was not part of the discussions between the business and the PPP lender."" However The Post Gazette found last July that he was still named as the president of Mike Kelly Hyundai Mike Kelly Automotive and Kelly Chevrolet Cadillac on one of his recent House financial disclosures with his wife reporting a salary from Kelly Chevrolet Cadillac.

Kelly is the 39th wealthiest member of Congress according to a 2018 analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics with a net worth of $12.4 million.

Other lawmakers who benefited from the PPP program include Reps. Roger Williams R-Tex. and Vern Buchanan R-Fla.

According to Sludge Williams who boasts a net worth of $27.7 million took in over $1.4 million for his JRW Corporation valued $50 million back in 2019. The conservative legislator also reaped federal aid for his Roger Williams Chrysler Dodge Jeep dealership in North Texas.

""I didn't personally benefit from [the loan]"" he told Fox Business Network last year. ""I've got hundreds of employees – they benefited from it.""

Earlier that year in March of 2020 Williams painted a very different picture of government subsidies telling The Epoch Times that ""a socialist wants you to get a check from the government...a capitalist wants you to get a check from the place that you work.""

Williams who voted against the TRUTH Act also came under scrutiny from the House Ethics Committee back in 2016 when he tucked an ostensibly self-serving provision into President Obama's Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act. The line item which he himself authored effectively ensured that his own dealerships would be able to skirt a federal prohibition on renting out cars under safety recalls.

Rep. Buchanan the third wealthiest member of Congress as of 2018 engaged in similar conduct with his various car dealerships. The Bradenton Herald reported that the Florida lawmaker worth roughly $74 million accepted loans totaling anywhere from $2.7 million to $7 million for three of his personal businesses. The largest went to Sarasota Ford his Sarasota-based car dealership in which he reportedly owns a $50 million stake.

Like Kelly Buchanan downplayed the significance of the federal aid arguing that he himself does not manage the dealerships. But many government accountability advocates have speculated that Buchanan's move was an abuse of power.

""While small businesses in Sarasota and Bradenton struggled to get federal aid Buchanan cut in line and got a loan in the earliest days of the program – after the Trump administration exempted members of Congress from going through a normally mandatory ethics review before getting a loan"" Sarah Guggenheimer DCCC Regional Press Secretary wrote .

Buchanan did not vote on the TRUTH Act. His past campaign finance practices have been marred with accusations of corruption as well as subsequent investigations by the Department of Justice the FBI the FEC and the House Ethics Committee.

During the program's administration which ended back in May there was no rule barring federal lawmakers (or their families) from applying for a PPP loan and no one has explicitly argued that such legislators broke any laws.

However ""it certainly looks bad and smells bad"" Aaron Scherb a spokesperson for Common Cause told Fortune suggesting that their participation in the program poses a significant conflict of interest. According to a Politico report from last year Congress mandated no specific disclosure rules around PPP loans for its own members.

""There likely are several other cases of family and friends of public officials receiving bailout funds"" echoed Craig Holman Public Citizen's Capitol Hill lobbyist to Roll Call. ""However the general lack of disclosure of most recipients of PPP funds prevents the public from knowing all the lawmakers who benefited from their legislative actions.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vb3poYXdrLmNvbS9mcmFua19iX3dpbGxpYW1zX29mX3NhbnRhX2JhcmJhcmFfMTk0Mi0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frank B.

He is survived by his loving wife Parmele “Parm” of 53 years; sister Dorothy; brother Steven (Mary Ann); nephews Nick (Taylor) and Chris; sister-in-law Cheryl Dunn (Stephen Dunn deceased); nephew Roger (Amiee); and numerous cousins and their spouses.

Frank was born in Dallas Texas in 1942 the first son of W. Nicholas Williams Jr. and Elizabeth Bellows Williams. He graduated with honors from Highland Park High School which led him to Stanford Uniersity where he was a member of SAE fraternity and graduated with a bachelor of science in engineering.

Frank’s passion for learning and his boundless curiosity about people and the world beyond him was ignited by his six months at Stanford-in-Germany followed by studies at the Goethe Institut and the University of Vienna before returning to pursue his MBA from Harvard Business School.

Frank then joined Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto California where he soon met Parm when she tried to recruit him away from HP to her company. While she may have lost out on Frank as a recruit she quickly won him over as a loving partner for life.

Frank spent 20 years at HP but his greatest joy was spending the rest of his life with Parm. His career at HP spanned positions in personnel manufacturing and international including his favorite assignment of two-and-a half years in Singapore where he helped establish factories both there and in Penang Malaysia.

Following HP Frank was vice president at three other high-tech companies before he and Parm settled in Santa Barbara in the early 1990s where Parm started an Asian antique business greatly aided by Frank’s keen eye for finding treasures (and a strong back for carrying them).

Not yet ready to retire Frank bought a small office equipment company (sales service and supplies) which he owned for eight years before retiring to enjoy playing golf volunteering in the Santa Barbara community and traveling together with Parm through the US Asia Europe Africa and multiple trips to Mexico.

Frank was deeply committed to helping people and serving his community. He was president of the Visiting Nurses Association of Santa Clara County and board member of the VNA of Santa Barbara; president and Paul Harris Fellow of the Rotary Club of Santa Barbara; and a volunteer with Meals on Wheels the United Way and the Santa Barbara Foundation.

In 2014 Frank and Parm moved to their new home in Valle Verde.

Frank enjoyed reading spectator sports (including UCSB Gaucho Women’s Basket- ball!) wine-tasting and most recently walking his rescue dog Tigger (the Terror) who became an important addition to their lives vying with Parm for Frank’s love and attention.

His life-long friends remember Frank for his kindness wit integrity intellectual curiosity his great love of family and especially his courage during his recent illnesses. Frank always had a warm and welcoming smile for everyone. He lit up any room he entered.

A celebration of Frank’s life will be held at a later date.

Joe Manchin’s (D-W.V.)’s daughter worked with Pfizer Inc. in 2016 to monopolize and raise the price of the EpiPen while the company gave generous campaign donations to Manchin.

Manchin’s daughter Heather Bresch was the president and chief executive officer of Mylan Inc. a pharmaceutical company that specialized in generic drugs. The company raised the price of a two-pack of EpiPen from around $124 in 2009 to $609 in 2016. Bresch left the company in 2020 after Mylan merged with Upjohn Pfizer’s generic division in November 2020 to form Viatris Inc. Bresch began working at the company in 1992 and became CEO in 2012.

Before it became Viatris Mylan was one of the largest campaign contributors to Manchin’s campaigns in five election cycles donating around $211000 to his campaigns since 2009 through PACs and employees. In 2010 the company’s PAC and its employees were the largest donors to Manchin’s first Senate run and Viatris is the number one career donor to Manchin including past donations from Mylan. In Manchin’s second Senate election in 2016 Mylan was the second highest contributor to the West Virginia senator.

And during the 2010 and 2012 election cycles the largest donor to Mylan’s PAC was Bresch donating the maximum amount ($5000) for a donor to a multicandidate corporate PAC both times. Manchin’s campaign also received the most money from Mylan’s PAC ($10000) in the 2010 election cycle.

In the 2016 and 2018 cycles Bresch again donated the maximum amount of $5000 to the PAC but no money from the PAC went to her father’s campaign. Her husband Jeff Bresch also donated the maximum amount to the PAC in 2018.

In 2016 complaints arose on social media about the high costs of EpiPens after the price of a two-pack rose 400 percent between 2009 and 2016. Bresch even gained the attention of the House Oversight Committee which asked her to testify and to hand over documents about EpiPen.

“Looking back I wish we had better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration of the rising financial issues for a growing minority of patients who may have ended up paying the full price or more” Bresch said to the committee in her testimony.

That same year Mylan settled a suit with the Department of Justice alongside other government agencies for $465 million over whether it overcharged the Medicaid program for EpiPens. Bresch was called in front of Congress again in December 2016 to explain the details of the settlement but refused to testify. At a Forbes event the day after she was supposed to testify Bresch stated that while she was apologetic for the company raising the price of the drug the higher costs were due to “improvements” to the design of the delivery mechanism.

Manchin stood by his daughter in 2016 and said that they had to keep the business parts of their lives “separate.” He also continued to accept campaign contributions from Mylan.

Manchin’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

Chandran brings a wealth of local and international HR consulting experience to the role including previous stints at KPMG Ernst & Young McKinsey and Willis Towers Watson predecessor Towers Perrin. He will take over from Monica Vagg in the second week of October.

“I am pleased to welcome Dharma to the ABC to lead the People & Culture division” said ABC Managing Director David Anderson. “Dharma’s substantial human resources expertise will be invaluable to the national public broadcaster particularly as we emerge from the ongoing challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. The ABC’s workforce is its most important asset and Dharma will play a key role in supporting and advising our people.”

Kicking off his human resources career with TASA Executive Search in Sydney in 1991 Chandran would then join Cullen Egan Dell (later part of Mercer Management Consulting) before crossing to McKinsey & Company on the back of a Masters of Commerce in organisation and management with the University of New South Wales (complementing an earlier law degree with the same institution with a focus on corporate commercial and tax).

At McKinsey Chandran served as Staffing Performance & Reward Manager for Oceania before taking up a position as the Southeast Asia director of HR based out of the management consulting firm’s Kuala Lumpur office. Stints as Asia Pacific M&A practice leader for Hewitt Associates (now Aon Hewitt) and Financial Services practice leader for Towers Perrin followed before a return to Australia as a HR and Strategy leader with Westpac.

Since then Chandran has served in senior leadership roles with two of the Big Four; as Managing Partner of EY’s Far East Area Performance & Reward practice based out of Hong Kong and as National Partner in Charge of KPMG’s Australian People Advisory Practice. He also served as a senior advisor on strategic initiatives for the practice including on the firm’s acquisition of leadership and executive remuneration advisory 3 Degrees Consulting.

He joins the national broadcaster after the past two years as a partner with the Australian leadership consulting practice of international executive search firm Boyden. “I am privileged and honoured to be appointed to this role within the ABC an organisation I have admired for a long time” Chandran said of his fresh challenge. “I am looking forward to working with all of my new colleagues and to making a significant contribution to our future success.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Postponed by the pandemic fundraising galas are back — and not a moment too soon for many Southern Nevada nonprofits.

Thursday night’s auctions brought in thousands of dollars to benefit the Collaboration Center Foundation’s capital campaign. The nonprofit wants to build out a 5-acre campus with services for people with intellectual developmental or physical disabilities and their families.

It was a relief for CEO Lynda Tache to finally debut the new nonprofit’s major fundraising event the Night En Blanc gala. The coronavirus pandemic had added hurdles to the first two years of operations including how to put on an event so crucial to supporting its growth.

The fundraiser was important to get the center off the ground and help families sooner Tache said.

“We can’t wait because we all know that regardless of the health condition or autism or neurodevelopmental (disability) the earlier the intervention the better” she said. “Every year that we wait it is determining their level of independence and also the cost to our state and society.”

Nonprofits — already hard-hit by the financial effects of the pandemic — have spent months dealing with uncertainty in event planning during the public health crisis. Organizers of these glamorous philanthropic events are forced to weigh overall safety with the need to fundraise once again.

Funding the work

Nonprofits often rely on fundraising events for programming and capital support. Last year’s lockdowns and coronavirus-related uncertainty caused many in the sector to cancel planned events. A 2021 survey of Nevada nonprofits from University of Nevada Las Vegas researchers found 86.3 percent of respondents lost some revenue due to event cancellations — 40.5 percent of which said those cancellations had impacted revenues “to a great extent.”

They came at a time when programming costs increased for some organizations. Baby’s Bounty an infant care nonprofit started a diaper and formula bank during the pandemic when clients called asking for resources while awaiting unemployment checks. It grew from a temporary program funded with a $10000 grant to an integral part of the organization’s mission executive director Kelly Maxwell said.

“That’s kind of your perfect storm right there” Maxwell said. “Your programming expands tenfold and your main fundraising event can’t happen. That definitely put a lot more strain on the necessity for grant writing and corporate sponsorships to fill that void.”

For the Tyler Robinson Foundation losing event revenue was significant. The foundation — co-founded by Las Vegas-grown music superstars Imagine Dragons — holds an annual gala to support its grants to families of children with pediatric cancer. The gala is the organization’s main fundraiser bringing in more than $3 million in 2019.

That was the goal for 2020 as well executive director Kim Gradisher said. Without the fundraiser the foundation received about $1 million less in contributions in 2020 compared with contributions in 2019 according to the foundation’s tax records.

Masked tested or vaccinated guests?

Organizers must choose the level of precautions to take. Changing understanding of the virus and evolving health guidelines can feel “like a moving target” Maxwell said.

“Masks outdoors are good. Masks indoors should be required. Maybe once you’re vaccinated not so” she said. “There’s been so much back and forth and it’s tough to balance the safety of our guests with what will make for the best most comfortable most successful event. I think those are not always the same thing.”

At the Nevada Donor Network’s Inspire Gala in late August organizers stuck with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for the event that promotes its “End the Wait” capital campaign to develop a transplant institute in Nevada. The 370 attendees were required to wear masks when not eating or drinking during the event in a Waldorf Astoria ballroom.

The gala raised more than $450000 toward the $35 million needed to expand the current kidney transplant program and create a liver transplant program at University Medical Center in the first two years.

Kelley McClellan director of community engagement for the network said organizers began seriously planning the gala in the spring believing the August date to be a safe option given the high rates of vaccination at the time of planning. But when the delta variant triggered a new mandates the hope of hosting a pre-pandemic-like event faltered.

McClellan said one takeaway she noticed from the network’s gala was some people sponsored tables but donated back the tickets instead of attending themselves.

“They may not quite be comfortable yet and that’s OK” McClellan said. “But we filled the tables and sold all the seats. No one had a problem wearing a mask. I think everyone was just so excited to be together.”

Some taking extra steps

Others however are taking precautions further by hosting events outdoors reducing capacity switching fundraisers to an online setting or requiring proof of vaccination for attendance.

For instance the Nathan Adelson Hospice Foundation is taking two approaches to fundraising events this year. Its first event the Serenades of Life-Doctors in Concert featuring Daniel Emmett is one of its largest fundraisers to support a complementary therapies program. Organizers continued with the concert because of the vaccination requirement at The Smith Center where the concert will be held on Oct. 2 said Stephanie Forbes the foundation’s development manager.

“Everybody has to wear their mask it’s not a lot of eating and drinking at this event and so we felt like at this current moment we can continue to plan to hold the concert” Forbes said.

But a fall wine and food tasting will stay virtual this year she said. The tasting normally brings up to 600 people to eat drink and mingle — something organizers felt was off the table regardless of vaccination status.

It’s unclear if the restrictions will turn away attendees Forbes said.

“We’ve kind of accepted that we may have a little bit of a revenue loss in some areas” she said. “But then at the same time we may pick up some new revenue and new sponsors because there are people who would say ‘They’re doing everything they’re supposed to be (doing) like other nonprofits are doing and we want to continue to support the needs of Nathan Adelson.’”

The Tyler Robinson Foundation’s Rise Up Gala will allow only vaccinated guests. Gradisher the foundation’s director said the charity ultimately decided on the policy because of the population it serves.

“We have kids at our events every year” Gradisher said. “We’re planning to have a few of our families out again. That’s what it’s about because these kids are compromised even more so than your average person.”

‘People were ready to make an impact’

The gala on Oct. 22 at the Wynn Las Vegas’ pavilion will look different than usual: outside with 30 percent less than the typical size and video equipment prepared to live-stream the marquee Imagine Dragons performance. Despite the changes tickets — ranging from $950 for an individual to $100000 “dragon level” sponsorship — sold out within four hours the foundation said.

“For so many nonprofits in-person events and galas specifically are the biggest pinnacle of their fundraising efforts and it’s certainly for us as well” Gradisher said. “It’s important from an awareness standpoint it’s important to get our sponsors and supporters together to make a meaningful impact together. I think that that’s a big reason why we sold out so quickly. People were really ready to get out there to make an impact.”

Not only were they the faces of the franchise they were both longtime alternate captains for the organization.

That void has now been filled by the biggest vocal leaders on the roster. After months of speculation from the fan base the Wild officially named Matt Dumba and Marcus Foligno the new alternate captains on Saturday afternoon. They join captain Jared Spurgeon to form a solid leadership group.

This move makes a lot of sense considering the role Dumba and Foligno play in the locker room. Though there’s no doubt that Spurgeon is the unquestioned leader of the bunch he has a somewhat quiet demeanor and does most of his leading by example.

That’s where Dumba and Foligno come in. If the Wild ever need a spark they can count on both of those guys to provide it.

For Dumba 27 that often manifests itself in the locker room before games. He’s the hype man that gets everyone fired up. He also curates the pregame playlist that plays over the loudspeakers.

ADVERTISEMENT

For Foligno 30 that often manifests itself on the ice during games. He has dropped the gloves countless times to stand up for his teammates. He has also been known to lay a big hit at a moment’s notice.

While this is a big honor for both players for Dumba specifically it seems to carry some extra weight. He has long been the epicenter of trade rumors — something he has talked openly about — and this is an example of the Wild committing to him in a big way.

As for the rest of the team coach Dean Evason has always said the Wild have a lot leaders on the locker room and that won’t change even with Dumba and Foligno now wearing letters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5obC5jb20vd2lsZC9uZXdzL2R1bWJhLWZvbGlnbm8tYWx0ZXJuYXRlLWNhcHRhaW5zLTA5MjUyMS0zMjYzMjg1NDLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wild names Dumba and Foligno alternate captains | Minnesota Wild,"Dumba is in his ninth NHL season all with the Wild after being selected by Minnesota in the first round (seventh overall) of the 2012 NHL Draft.

Minutes later police were dispatched to a crash involving the same vehicle along the 500 block of University Drive South. According to the North Dakota Highway Patrol  the Jeep crashed into a 2016 Mazda 6 driven by 22-year-old Bismarck man Braxton Schmidt. The vehicles then crashed into trees and power lines.

Prior to officers' arrival the driver fled the scene.

Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management

Larry Robbins is a hedge fund manager and CEO of Glenview Capital Management. He is also well known for his quarterly letters to investors.

He began his career as an analyst at Gleacher and Company an M&A firm. Later Robbins spent six years running long/short strategies for Leon Cooperman at Omega Advisors.

In 2001 Robbins started Glenview Capital Management. The firm runs several hedge funds and long-only funds. The Glenview Capital Partners fund invests in equities and bonds and holds both long and short positions. The Glenview Opportunity funds invest opportunistically in equities only. In 2015 the firm launched a long-only fund to invest in healthcare stocks. Despite several losing streaks the flagship fund returned 15% annually between 2000 to 2013.

Robbins is a former ice hockey player and captained the University of Pennsylvania club team for three years. He is now the owner of the Chicago Steel of the United States Hockey League.

Robbins has built a personal fortune of $2.3 billion and often uses his vast resources to support several education-focused charities. Robbins is on the boards of the Knowledge is Power Program The Robin Hood Foundation and Teach for America.

Thematic Investing

Robbins has been described as a ‘Growth at a Reasonable Price’ (GARP) investor and as a ‘multi-strategy investor’. He’s said that he backs companies with predictable cash flows and recurring revenue streams.

Larry Robbin backs himself and often holds positions for significant periods even when those positions move against him. As a result he has earned a reputation for experiencing persistent winning and losing streaks.

When one looks at the stocks he has invested in over the years it’s clear that Robbins follows themes. Healthcare stocks have increasingly dominated his portfolio over the years. He has also invested in technology and consumer discretionary stocks and to a lesser extent utilities.

While Robbins is not an activist investor he does voice his opinions when it comes to some of his largest positions. In fact he has said he would rather be ‘suggestivist’ than activist. In this way he has been instrumental in bringing about corporate action at Tenet (NYSE: THC) and Community Health Systems (NYSE: CYH).

Robbins began building positions in healthcare stocks after President Bush signed the Medicare Modernization Act in 2004. His bets in the healthcare sector increased again with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act. Unlike many on Wall Street Robbins was a supporter of Obamacare.

Over the years he has held large positions in Tenet Healthcare Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO) Humana (NYSE: HUM) McKesson Corporation and Community Health Systems. On the whole these stocks have generated strong returns but have also contributed to losses and underperformance along the way.

In 2008 the long/short fund lost 50 percent in 2011 it lost money again and in 2015 it was down more than 18%. Robbins felt so bad about the 2015 losses that he vowed not to take any fees until he had made the money back.

The fund does tend to bounce back from these losing periods with strong returns. In 2009 it was up 82% and in 2013 it returned 84%. Robbins appeared to be back on a winning streak as his fund was up 14.8% in the first half of 2017.

Glenview Capital Management's Latest Form 13F Filing

On November 14th 2017 Larry Robbins' firm Glenview Capital Management filed their quarterly Form 13F regulatory filing. I reviewed the 13F filing to review holdings in Glenview Capital Management's large portfolio.

The hedge fund's stock portfolio totals $15.5 billion according to the latest filing. The list value of stock holdings is up 0.7% when compared to the last quarter. As a benchmark the S&P 500 was up 3.9% over the same period.

Quarter-over-Quarter Turnover (QoQ Turnover) measures the level of trading activity in a portfolio. Glenview Capital Management's QoQ Turnover for the latest quarter was 25.9% so the firm appears to trade a significant percent of its portfolio each quarter.

Glenview Capital Management's Largest Holdings

The Ideas section of finbox.io tracks top investors and trending investment themes. You can get the latest data on the holdings discussed below at the Larry Robbins page. The following table summarizes his firm's largest holdings reported in the last filing:

Glenview Capital Management Largest Holdings Ticker Name Holding ($mil) % Of Portfolio HCA HCA HEALTHCARE INC $1206.3 7.8% DWDP DOWDUPONT INC $1124.2 7.2% FMC FMC CORP $1046.8 6.7% SHPG SHIRE PLC $898.8 5.8% IQV IQVIA Holdings Inc. $848.2 5.5% ANTM ANTHEM INC $722.0 4.7% DXC DXC TECHNOLOGY CO $671.6 4.3%

The seven positions above represent 42.0% of the hedge fund's total portfolio. Four of the seven largest positions are also in the healthcare sector making up 23.8% of the portfolio. The most recent filing showed a total of 49 positions.

Glenview Capital Management's 5 Largest Purchases

I also used finbox.io to find Glenview Capital Management's largest buys last quarter. Here's the list of the biggest stock purchases determined by comparing the last two filings:

Glenview Capital Management 5 Largest Purchases Ticker Name Purchased ($mil) % Of Portfolio SHPG SHIRE PLC $634.9 5.8% ZBH ZIMMER BIOMET HL... $279.1 2.4% MCK MCKESSON CORP $235.5 2.7% CVS CVS HEALTH CORP $111.3 0.7% DNB DUN & BRADSTREET... $93.7 1.4%

Three of the hedge fund's 5 biggest stock buys in the quarter were in the healthcare sector.

Glenview Capital Management's Most Undervalued Holdings

To determine which stocks are trading below their intrinsic value aka ""fair value"" I used the finbox.io Fair Value estimates. I also wanted to blend in some indication of which stocks might be ready to make a move up soon because they're popular with Wall Street analysts.

I calculated an average using the finbox.io fair value upside and analyst upside to create a blended upside which I then used to rank the most undervalued holdings.

Here are the top 7 stocks based on my calculations:

Glenview Capital Management Most Undervalued Holdings Ticker Name Upside (finbox.io) Upside (Analyst Target) Blend Upside BKD BROOKDALE SR LIV... 63.1% 41.8% 52.5% SHPG SHIRE PLC 25.5% 45.1% 35.3% VER VEREIT INC 33.1% 23.3% 28.2% MTOR MERITOR INC 33.3% 14.9% 24.1% RLGY REALOGY HLDGS CORP 21.9% 23.8% 22.8% HCA HCA HEALTHCARE INC 43.5% 1.1% 22.3% CBS CBS CORP NEW 25.0% 17.3% 21.1%

Note that Shire plc (NasdaqGS: SHPG) is one of Larry Robbins' largest positions and one that he's most recently been adding to. This is most likely because the current share price appears to be trading a large discount to intrinsic value.

source: finbox.io

Shire is a biotechnology company focused on serving people with rare diseases and other specialized conditions worldwide. The company offers products in therapeutic areas including hematology genetic diseases neuroscience immunology internal medicine ophthalmology and oncology. The company markets its products through wholesalers distribution centers and pharmacies. Shire was founded in 1986 and is based in Dublin Ireland.

Shares of the company are down -7.6% over the last month implying that there may be a buying opportunity. The stock last traded at $147.78 as of Friday January 26th and 10 separate valuation analyses imply that there is 25.5% upside relative to its current trading price. Wall Street's price target of $213.93 is even more bullish implying +40% upside.

Steven Cohen is also a notable investor in the company. His fund currently holds a position worth $32.1 million. If you haven't heard of billionaire Steven Cohen you may already know a little about him if you've watched Showtime's hit series Billions. Investing morality aside Cohen's real-life results are undeniable. He was the third highest-earning hedge fund manager of 2012 when he made $1.4 billion. No doubt Cohen is expecting big gains from his long position in Shire.

Illustrious money manager Leon Cooperman in another notable investor that currently owns 653977 shares of SHPG which represents 4.0% of his fund's stock portfolio.

Managers with more than $100 million in qualifying assets under management are required to disclose their holdings to the SEC each quarter via 13F filings. Qualifying assets include long positions in U.S. equities and ADRs call/put options and convertible debt securities. Shorts cash positions foreign investments and other assets are not included. It is important to note that these filings are due 45 days after the quarter end date. Therefore Glenview Capital Management's holdings above represent positions held as of September 30th and not necessarily reflective of the fund's current stock holdings.

However most can agree that with thousands of stocks traded on U.S. exchanges doing thorough research on each one is nearly impossible for smaller investors. Leveraging the resources of the largest hedge funds on Wall Street can be a powerful way to narrow down the list.

As of this writing I did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities and this is not a buy or sell recommendation on any security mentioned.",,,,,,,,,,,,
