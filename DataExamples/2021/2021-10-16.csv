Losing a £3 million lottery ticket led to 'Britain's unluckiest couple' launching law suits and getting divorced.

Martyn and Kay Tott were propelled into the headlines 20 years ago after begging the National Lottery to bolster their bank account.

It took the couple weeks to clock that their lucky numbers had been drawn but by the time they realised their winning ticket was nowhere to be found.

Despite being able to prove their purchase by obtaining computer records from their local Londis the Totts were caught out by Camelot's small print.

The couple who lived in a two-bedroom semi in Watford had breached a little-known National Lottery rule that states lost tickets must be reported within 30 days.

The Totts waited 45 gruelling days before being told they would not get their prize the Mirror reports.

The case gained national attention with public figures like Sir Richard Branson and Tony Blair urging the lottery to award the multi-million pound prize.

But Camelot didn't budge and the couple's misfortune put an incredible strain on their marriage The Sun reports.

Martyn also spent five years trying to get his hands on the payout in court.

He later said he was glad they never got the money.

""Having that money taken away was torture"" he told the Mail on Sunday.

""For a long time I lost sight of who I was and what I believed in. But I can honestly say I’m glad I didn’t get the £3million now.

""There is no guarantee it would have brought me happiness.""

Earlier this year a Hertfordshire couple lost out on a £182million EuroMillions jackpot.

Rachel Kennedy 19 and Liam McCrohan 21 were left “absolutely heartbroken” in March after claiming their ticket payment had not gone through.

The couple from Hertfordshire realised their usual numbers of 6 12 22 29 33 6 and 11 had come up but there was one major catch - their ticket payment hadn't gone through.

They had played the same numbers for five weeks in a row before all seven digits appeared in the draw.

Rachel explained how she had set up her account to automatically buy a EuroMillions ticket for each draw - but when payment for the winning ticket was attempted the lottery account did not have enough funds.

Checking her account after the draw she was greeted with a message saying her numbers were a ""winning match"" - however her heart sank when she realised the glitch The Sun reported.",,,,,,

ABT,Abbott,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ocmMub3JnL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2JyZWFraW5nLWh1bWFuLXJpZ2h0cy1jYW1wYWlnbi11cmdlcy10ZXhhcy1nb3Zlcm5vci1ncmVnLWFiYm90dC10by12ZXRvLWRpc2NyaW1pbmF0b3J5LWFudGktdHJhbnMtc3BvcnRzLWJhbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BREAKING: Human Rights Campaign Urges Texas Governor Greg Abbott To Veto Discriminatory Anti-Trans Sports Ban,"Today TX HB 25 discriminatory legislation aimed at banning transgender youth from participating in sports alongside their peers has formally passed both chambers. The bill now heads to Governor Greg Abbott’s desk for signature or veto. If the legislation is signed Texas would become the tenth state to enact anti-transgender sports ban legislation joining Alabama Arkansas Florida Idaho Mississippi Montana South Dakota (by Executive Order) Tennessee and West Virginia. Texas would become the state with the largest LGBTQ+ population and largest economy to enact discriminatory anti-transgender legislation after having introduced more anti-LGBTQ+ bills than any state in 2021.

During each of the four sessions this year the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) joined coalition partners including the Transgender Equality Network of Texas Equality Texas ACLU of Texas Texas Freedom Network Lambda Legal and others to oppose these measures. After HB 25’s Senate passage Human Rights Campaign Texas State Director Rebecca Marques said:

“If Governor Abbott signs this discriminatory bill he is putting the health safety and very lives of transgender young people in Texas at risk. These vulnerable kids are simply trying to navigate adolescence in an environment that lawmakers are making increasingly challenging.. There is no need for this bill and legislators have failed to provide examples of any problem in Texas related to trans kids playing sports alongside their peers. There is no appetite for this bill among the majority of Texans — it is simply designed to help Republican legislators win the votes of far right primary voters. A number of states that have passed similarly discriminatory and hateful legislation are already facing legal action. Signing this legislation would hurt families and make Texas a less competitive destination for companies and employees alike.

It is appalling that Governor Abbott repeatedly designated this a priority and legislators spent hundreds of legislative hours pushing a discriminatory bill targeting transgender youth. Bills that discriminate against LGTBQ+ people are opposed by the majority of Texans. And the majority of Texans support priorities that the legislature hasn’t addressed like fixing the electrical grid instead of relentlessly pursuing a politically motivated radical legislative agenda.”

Similar legislation was considered by the House during the regular legislative session and the first two special sessions. Because passage through the traditional committee of jurisdiction the House Public Education Committee could not be assured this session the bill was routed through the Committee on Constitutional Rights and Remedies a committee created by the Texas House Speaker in July expressly to address priority special session bills.

Texas transgender young people like 12-year old Adelyn and 11-year old Libby Gonzales and their families have spoken out against this dangerous legislation telling their stories and speaking to the harms these bills would pose to them directly if enacted.

In Texas and in states across the country legislators across the country have failed to provide examples of issues in their states to attempt to justify these attacks on transgender youth laying bare the reality that they are fueled by discrimination and not supported by fact. Collegiate and professional sports organizations have had trans-inclusive policies for years without incident.

Nationwide in 2021 25 anti-LGBTQ bills having been enacted including 13 specifically anti-transgender laws across 8 states. More than 280 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced across 33 states this session including more than 130 specifically anti-transgender bills. Each of these marks has set a new record for anti-equality legislation being introduced and enacted in a single state legislative session since the Human Rights Campaign began tracking legislation.

Wide range of business and advocacy groups athletes oppose anti-trans legislation

Trans equality is popular: Anti-transgender legislation is a low priority even among Trump voters

A PBS/NPR/Marist poll states that 67% of Americans including 66% of Republicans oppose the anti-transgender sports ban legislation proliferating across 30 states.

In a 10-swing-state poll including Texas conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group last fall:

At least 60% of Trump voters across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should be able to live freely and openly.

At least 87% of respondents across each of the 10 swing states say transgender people should have equal access to medical care

When respondents were asked about how they prioritized the importance of banning transgender people from participating in sports as compared to other policy issues the issue came in dead last with between 1% and 3% prioritizing the issue.

Another more recent poll conducted by the Human Rights Campaign & Hart Research Group revealed that with respect to transgender youth participation in sports the public’s strong inclination is on the side of fairness and equality for transgender student athletes. 73% of voters agree that “sports are important in young people’s lives. Young transgender people should be allowed opportunities to participate in a way that is safe and comfortable for them.”

States that pass anti-transgender legislation suffer economic legal reputational harm

Analyses conducted in the aftermath of previous divisive anti-transgender bills across the country like the bathroom bills introduced in Texas and North Carolina and an anti-transgender sports ban in Idaho show that there would be or has been devastating fallout.

These bills are solutions in search of problems that are driven by national anti-LGBTQ groups not local legislators or Texans’ concerns

These bills come from the same forces that drove previous anti-equality fights by pushing copycat bills across state houses — hateful anti-LGBTQ organizations like the Heritage Foundation Alliance Defending Freedom (designated by Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group) and Eagle Forum among others.

Abbott Hitler comparisons and a Brooklyn burial ground,"This bellwether is worth watching

Austin Tex.: Here are 10 things we have learned about Texas Gov. Greg Abbott all of which should be of concern to Republicans inside and outside of Texas.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott speaks during a news conference along the Rio Grande Tuesday Sept. 21 2021 in Del Rio Texas.

First Abbott has enacted controversial policies in response to COVID-19 and attempts by local officials to ignore and circumvent his executive orders. Second Abbott has become a symbol of how the Republican Party has been hijacked by Donald Trump and his acolytes. 3) Abbott is not a conservative; his actions on COVID show he has abandoned the conservative principle that the local level not big government should make decisions about how to respond to problems like COVID. 4) He doesn’t care about the health of people; his responses to the pandemic and the state’s power grid crisis last winter cost lives. 5) Abbott is not pro-business; his recent executive order forbids businesses from imposing requirements to protect their workers. 6) Abbott makes statements and implements policies that contradict what he previously said and did. 7) He is far from an example of what we desire of University of Texas at Austin alumni; to paraphrase UT’s mantra: What starts with Abbott changes the world — but in a negative way. 8) He disregards the truth erroneously blaming Biden for the border crisis when the current border policy was implemented by former President Trump. 9) Abbott is guided by fear rather than courage and conviction behaving in ways designed to not alienate Trump and Trump’s base. 10) One might correctly infer that Abbott lacks sufficient integrity and moral compass.

Voters should pay close attention to Abbott’s rhetoric and decisions — and what that portends for the future of our democratic republic. Richard Cherwitz

List of achievements

Toms River N.J.: Under Trump we became a self-sufficient energy producer and even a supplier to the rest of the world. Now Russia and the UAE get that title. We had the lowest unemployment in the history of our country in every category. We had curbed the border jumpers to a 15-year low. The wall was being built and agreements with Mexico made them protect their borders on the other side of their country. We tossed all that out for punishment for tweeting! Now we have the single worst brain-dead politician ever elected. Between him and his son there was a plethora of evidence proving corruption and no one gives a damn because he is just nice old Joe! George Lobman

Apt for the alt-right

Brooklyn: PBS recently ran a documentary that chronicled the rise of Hitler. It was aired in the midst of Trump’s constant complaints and assertions that the election was stolen from him. As one looks back on the rise of Nazism the similarities are frightening. As he rose to power Hitler installed bureaucrats throughout the government who would do his bidding. The Republicans in state after state have put their yes men and women in positions of tremendous influence if the next election is in dispute. It has long been considered in bad taste to compare current political figures to Hitler but the parallels are becoming clearer by the day. Meanwhile Attorney General Merrick Garland seems reluctant to investigate Trump and his associates. I do not understand how a man whose ancestors escaped the anti-Semitism of Czarist Russia could not see the obvious fascistic aspirations of a man whose administration bent the rule of law to the breaking point. Ed Temple

Hit close to home

Howard Beach: What if someone robbed a bank was caught by the police taken to the station and then released because the police said that no one got hurt? What if a drunk driver hit and killed a pedestrian but a jury of his peers said that he really didn’t mean to drink as much as he did and found him not guilty? What if someone committed adultery over and over again but religious people no longer considered this to be a sin? Around 30% of Americans do not hold Trump accountable for any of his unlawful and immoral actions and defend him over the same actions that they would hold someone else accountable for. Trump has shown many of us that we had no idea who our neighbors and friends really are. What a sad realization this has been. Barbara Berg

Bike bandits

Manhattan: NYC is looking more and more like a Third World city with each passing day. The lawless atmosphere that our mayor has created has degraded our quality of life to the point where living in the city has become genuinely dangerous. The latest symbol of this trend is criminals targeting the hardworking folks who deliver our food on electric bikes. These humble workers are getting beat up and having their bikes stolen. The cops are doing little to thwart this despicable and cowardly crime and now the delivery workers are forced to band together like posses to protect themselves. This cannot end well. When citizens can no longer rely on law enforcement to protect them from robberies and assaults a culture of vigilantism is sure to follow. Effective law enforcement is critical to a civilized society. As of now there isn’t much civility left. Peter Janoff

ADA abuse

Hillsdale N.Y.: To Voicer Joan L. Weisberg: NYC has become so increasingly lawless that one risks serious injury or worse taking a stroll on city streets these days. In my comments I was referring mostly to speeding e-bikes e-scooters and pedal bikes zooming by on sidewalks. Curb cutouts are used mostly by them and nothing is done to stop this dangerous and inconsiderate practice. Corner cutouts were designed for the disabled not for these e-bikes that also fail to stop at stop signs and red lights. I guess you don’t have these problems in Fort Lee. Phil Antico

Gifts denied

Bronx: The latest insane suggestion by our soon-to-be-gone mayor is to eliminate the specialized schools for talented and bright children. Thank goodness his son was able to go to one of the specialized schools but yours won’t be able to. Sadly I would imagine that the Earl Monroe Basketball School will fall under the specialized category and will go through dramatic change or closure. What a tragedy. New Yorkers are you listening and watching this dumbing down of our education system? Please be careful who you put in as mayor. Continuation of these policies will be a disaster for all our children. Lindy Friedman

Commentators only

Sayville L.I.: Voicer Bob Sterner was spot on when in response to Trumpers Bob Pascarella and John Gelormino he pointed out that Fox News successfully defended a lawsuit by stating that no reasonable viewer could take the network seriously. They actually went further saying that they do not deal in facts. Fox was 100% correct. The problem is that they have unreasonable viewers. Reasonable people recognize them for what they are and don’t watch. MAGA fools lap it up. Michael Hooker

Hidden history

Brooklyn: Lived all my life in Brooklyn and only now did I learn that the empty lot at Bedford and Church Aves. beside Erasmus Hall High School was an African burial ground (“Nope not in this backyard” op-ed Oct. 11). This site should be preserved! I’m glad the history of this site is getting more exposure. I did know that on this plot of land there stood a public school building known as Flatbush District #1 erected in 1878 which was later designated P.S. 90 and then served the Beth Rivkah Institute. That quaint but dilapidated red brick building was demolished in 2016. A thorough history of this site should be displayed here. Ellen Levitt

How convenient

Woodbury L.I.: Seriously! Are we honestly supposed to believe that a homeless man just happened to walk into a campaign stop for Curtis Sliwa? I mean really what were the chances that Sliwa was there to give a touch on the shoulder and a few kind words? A coincidence? I think not. Cindy O’Connor

Nudging 40 it is middle-aged. It does not make headlines with mega-mergers or have a swashbuckling chief executive. “I feel very comfortable not being out there pounding my chest” confesses its boss Shantanu Narayen in a rare interview. All the while Adobe has quietly managed to adapt to the age of cloud computing. It has done a better job of reinventing itself perhaps even than Microsoft the technology industry’s best-known comeback kid. Microsoft’s CEO  Satya Nadella is said to have examined Mr Narayen’s handiwork closely—and not just because he attended the same secondary school in India as Adobe’s leader albeit a few grades down. Since 2007 when Mr Narayen took the helm Adobe’s market capitalisation has swelled from $24bn to $276bn. In the past ten years it has outperformed both Mr Nadella’s Microsoft and Salesforce another rival business-software maker.

To most ears Adobe is synonymous with desktop publishing. Founded in 1982 it set key standards in particular PostScript which tells printers where to make the dots and PDF  the “portable document format” that allows printed documents to be distributed online. It also developed programs for editing digital content. One Photoshop became a verb. Adobe’s pricey software was installed on desktop computers and updated with new versions every year or so. By the late 2000s this model itself looked in need of an update. Smartphones unleashed people’s creativity far from their desks and cloud computing enabled software to be offered as a service over the internet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGV0ZXJjb2hhbi8yMDIxLzEwLzE3L2Fkb2JlLWFpbXMtYXQtMjItZXBzLWdyb3d0aC1mcm9tLW1hcmtldHMtd29ydGgtMTQ3LWJpbGxpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adobe Aims At 22% EPS Growth From Markets Worth $147 Billion,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2021/10/17/adobe-aims-at-22-eps-growth-from-markets-worth-147-billion/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvcGV0ZXJjb2hhbi8yMDIxLzEwLzE3L2Fkb2JlLWFpbXMtYXQtMjItZXBzLWdyb3d0aC1mcm9tLW1hcmtldHMtd29ydGgtMTQ3LWJpbGxpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy1hZG9iZS1hbmltYXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is Adobe Animate and What Can You Do With It?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vd2hhdC1pcy1hZG9iZS1hbmltYXRlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBzeWNob2xvZ3l0b2RheS5jb20vdXMvYmxvZy9ldmlkZW5jZS1iYXNlZC1saXZpbmcvMjAyMTEwL3RoZS1wcm9zLWFuZC1jb25zLXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS15b3V0aNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBzeWNob2xvZ3l0b2RheS5jb20vdXMvYmxvZy9ldmlkZW5jZS1iYXNlZC1saXZpbmcvMjAyMTEwL3RoZS1wcm9zLWFuZC1jb25zLXNvY2lhbC1tZWRpYS15b3V0aD9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A new review article looks at how social media affects well-being in youth..,"More than 90 percent of teenagers in the U.S. have a smartphone.

We have certainly heard about the downside of teens and smartphones: cyberbullying anxiety and a misrepresented sense of body image. Research demonstrates there are some benefits too including the ability to keep in touch with friends and loved ones – especially when the COVID-19 pandemic limited in-person social interactions.

A new systematic review published in the journal Adolescent Research Review combines the evidence from qualitative studies that investigate adolescent social media use.

The authors found in short that the links between adolescent well-being and social media are complicated and depend on a broad range of factors.

“Adults have always been concerned about how the latest technology will harm children” said Amanda Purington director of evaluation and research for ACT for Youth in the BCTR and a doctoral candidate in Cornell’s Social Media Lab. “This goes back to radio programs comic books novels – you name it adults were worried about it. The same is now true for social media. And yes there are concerns – there are many potential risks and harms. But there are potential benefits too.”

Reviewing 19 studies of young people ages 11 to 20 the authors identified four major themes related to social media and well-being that ultimately affected aspects of young people’s mental health and sense of self.

The first theme connections describes how social media either supports or hinders young people’s relationships with their peers friends and family. The studies in the review provided plenty of examples of ways that social media helped youth build connections with others. Participants reported that social media helped to create intimacy with friends and could improve popularity. Youth who said they were shy reported having an easier time making friends through social media. Studies also found social media was useful in keeping in touch with family and friends who live far away and allowing groups to communicate in masse. In seven papers participants identified social media as a source of support and reassurance.

In 13 of the papers youth reported that social media also harmed their connections with others. They provided examples of bullying and threats and an atmosphere of criticism and negativity during social media interactions. Youth cited the anonymity of social media as part of the problem as well as miscommunication that can occur online.

Study participants also reported a feeling of disconnection associated with relationships on social media. Some youth felt rejected or left out when their social media posts did not receive the feedback they expected. Others reported feeling frustrated lonely or paranoid about being left out.

The second theme identity describes how adolescents are supported or frustrated on social media in trying to develop their identities.

Youth in many of the studies described how social media helped them to “come out of their shells” and express their true identities. They reported liking the ability to write and edit their thoughts and use images to express themselves. They reported that feedback they received on social media helped to bolster their self-confidence and they reported enjoying the ability to look back on memories to keep track of how their identity changed over time.

In eight studies youth described ways that social media led to inauthentic representations of themselves. They felt suspicious that others would use photo editing to disguise their identities and complained about how easy it was to deliver communications slyly rather than with the honesty required in face-to-face communication. They also felt self-conscious about posting selfies and reported that the feedback they received would affect their feelings of self-worth.

The third theme learning describes how social media use supports or hinders education. In many studies participants reported how social media helped to broaden their perspectives and expose them to new ideas and topics. Many youths specifically cited exposure to political and social movements such as Black Lives Matter.

On the flip side youth in five studies reported that social media interfered with their education. They said that phone notifications and the pressure to constantly check in on social media distracted them from their studies. Participants reported that they found it difficult to spend quiet time alone without checking their phones. Others said the 24-7 nature of social media kept them up too late at night making it difficult to get up for school the next day.

The fourth theme emotions describes the ways that social media impacts young people’s emotional experiences in both positive and negative ways. In 11 papers participants reported that social media had a positive effect on their emotions. Some reported it improved their mood helped them to feel excited and often prompted laughter. (Think funny animal videos.) Others reported that social media helped to alleviate negative moods including annoyance anger and boredom. They described logging onto social media as a form of stress management.

But in nearly all of the papers included in the review participants said social media was a source of worry and pressure. Participants expressed concern about judgment from their peers. They often felt embarrassed about how they looked in images. Many participants expressed worry that they were addicted to social media. Others fretted about leaving a digital footprint that would affect them later in life. Many participants reported experiencing pressure to constantly respond and stay connected on social media. And a smaller number of participants reported feeling disturbed by encountering troubling content such as self-harm and seeing former partners in new relationships.

“As this review article highlights social media provides spaces for adolescents to work on some of the central developmental tasks of their age such as forming deeper connections with peers and exploring identity” Purington said. “I believe the key is to help youth maximize these benefits while minimizing risks and we can do this by educating youth about how to use social media in ways that are positive safe and prosocial.”

The take-home message: The body of evidence on social media and well-being paints a complicated picture of how this new technology is affecting youth. While there are certainly benefits when young people use social media there is also a broad range of pressures and negative consequences.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYnMuY29tLmF1L2xhbmd1YWdlL2hpbmRpL2VuL3BvZGNhc3QtZXBpc29kZS9mcm9tLXJhaWx3YXktc3RhdGlvbi1hbm5vdW5jZXItdG8tcmFkaW8tam9ja2V5LXNocmF2YW4tYWRvYmVzLXZvaWNlLWV4cGVyaW1lbnQtdGFrZXMtaGltLXBsYWNlcy8wZWtnOXE2dm7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From railway station announcer to radio jockey Shravan Adobe's voice experiment takes him places,"Listen to the podcast in Hindi by clicking on the audio icon in the picture above.

Semiconductor companies were among the beneficiaries of the COVID-19 pandemic. The work-from-home and study-from-home trends necessitated computers accessories gadgets and phones which are powered by chips.

The semiconductor shortage that ensued also worked in the industry's favor.

Meet The Chip Industry's Outperformer: Aehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR) which was founded in May 1977 is a supplier of semiconductor test and reliability qualification equipment. Its solutions are designed to reduce the cost of testing to perform screening and stress testing and burn-in or cycling of homogeneous and heterogenous logic and memory semiconductor integrated circuits sensors power and optical devices.

Strong Fundamentals And Order Flow Support Stock: After trading at sub-$2 levels for much of the latter half of 2020 the stock broke above the level in early December. It traded mostly between $2 and $3 until mid-July 2021 before taking off catalyzed by a strong quarterly result and a $10.8-million contract award.

In late August the company announced the receipt of a $3 million order to support the production testing and burn-in of silicon carbide power semiconductors for EVs. Shortly after it announced a first-time order from China for its FOX singulated die test and burn-in system for silicon photonics production.

In early September the company announced a $19.4 million order from a major automotive semiconductor supplier which it identified as a Fortune 500 company.

Aehr Vs. Industry Titans: Over the past year Aehr shares are up about 1330%. In comparison Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) shares are down 0.4%.

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have gained about 30% and 47% respectively in the same period. Teradyne Inc. (NASDAQ:TER) which manufactures semiconductor testing equipment is up about 26% over the past year.

Aehr shares closed at $21.15 on Friday up 2.22%.

Twitter tipster Ice universe (@UniverseIce) posted a tweet comparing the screen protectors on the Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S22+ with screen protectors for the Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S21+.





Even taking into consideration the different angles of both images the 2022 models sport more rounded corners than last year's models and the bezels remain razor-thin. Since companies that make accessories such as tempered glass protectors are first to obtain the dimensions of new phone models from the manufacturer checking out this product is a good way to see what Samsung has in mind for its upcoming flagship models.

The aspect ratio on the Galaxy S22 series is rumored to drop to 19.5:9 from the previous year's 20:9







There has been a tendency for larger-screened phones to be equipped with a larger aspect ratio which produces a taller and thinner screen making the device easier to use one-handed. Perhaps Samsung is saying that enough is enough. The aspect ratio on the Galaxy S21 line is 20:9. Ice Universe in a subsequent tweet says that the aspect ratio on the Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S22+ will be 19.5:9 which would dovetail with the idea that the screens will be shorter and wider in 2022.





The Galaxy S22 line which includes the Galaxy S22 the Galaxy S22+ and the Galaxy S 22 Ultra is expected to feature hole-punch front-facing selfie snappers on all three models instead of an under-display camera. Speaking about cameras the Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S22+ could sport a 50MP primary camera with both models equipped with Samsung's ISOCELL GN5 sensor with all-directional autofocus and big 1.0µm pixels.





The phones will be powered by the 4nm Samsung Exynos 2200 chipset built by Samsung Foundry. In the states the series should carry the 4nm Snapdragon 898 SoC also built by Samsung Foundry. Not that long ago the U.S. carriers were happy to have the Snapdragon chips powering their version of the Galaxy S models. But this year Verizon reportedly asked Samsung about having the Exynos 2200 installed inside the Galaxy S22 series units it will be selling in the U.S.

This year the Exynos 2200 will feature a GPU produced by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).







Negotiations between Verizon and Samsung are supposedly taking place. Part of the reason why Samsung might be more stingy than usual with its Exynos APs could have something to do with the global chip shortage. In addition there have been some issues with low yield and other production problems. Samsung Foundry is the world's second-largest independent foundry behind only TSMC which is the largest contract foundry on the planet.







The reason for Verizon's demand could have something to do with the Exynos 2200's use of a GPU made by AMD. The Snapdragon 898 will be using Qualcomm's latest Adreno GPU. Last year's Exynos 2100 SoC featured the Mali-G78 MP14 GPU designed by ARM Holdings.





The Galaxy S22 is rumored to carry a smaller 3700mAh battery compared to the 4000mAh battery on the Galaxy S21. The Galaxy S22+ is rumored to sport a smaller 4500mAh battery compared to the 4800mAh component on the Galaxy S21+. The only one of the three models not losing any battery capacity this year is expected to be the Galaxy S22 Ultra with its 5000mAh battery matching that belonging to the Galaxy S21 Ultra.





The Galaxy S21 line was introduced on January 14th 2021 and released on January 29th of this year. We could see a similar unveiling and release dates for the Galaxy S22 series.

Let’s take a closer look at the income tax and GST/HST considerations.

How to report Airbnb income

You need to report the gross rental income and related expenses on your tax return.

Usually you will be considered to have earned rental income when you rent space and provide basic services such as heat light parking and laundry facilities.

If on the other hand you operate more as a bed and breakfast and provide additional services to your guests—such as cleaning security and meals—you will more likely be considered to be carrying on a business.

Do I need to charge GST/HST?

Short-term housing rentals for periods less than 30 continuous days are taxable for GST/HST purposes.

Long-term residential rentals are exempt from GST/HST.

If short-term rental revenues (plus income from any other commercial activity you may have on an associated basis) exceed $30000 in a 12-month period you’re required to register and collect GST/HST on this income.

If you purchase a new or substantially renovated house that is subject to GST/HST and is for use exclusively in short-term rentals you may consider registering for GST/HST voluntarily before exceeding $30000 in income.

Considering registering for GST/HST before the closing date.

Mixed-use properties are subject to rules that are more complex.

As of July 1 2021 all supplies of short-term accommodation are subject to GST/HST when supplied through a digital platform with the tax being collected by either the property owner or an accommodation platform operator.

How to claim Airbnb expenses

The income tax treatment of the expenses that you incur as an Airbnb host may vary depending on whether the expense is considered a current or a capital expense:

Current expenses are ongoing-period expenses such as electricity or those that don’t provide a lasting benefit.

Capital expenses generally give a lasting benefit or advantage and must be deducted over a period of several years as capital cost allowance.

Calculating your current expenses

If you rent out your entire home you need to calculate the number of weeks or days of the year that you hosted guests as a percentage of the total time in the year that you owned the home in order to prorate your deduction.

If you rent out only part of your home you’re entitled to claim a deduction that relates to the rented area of the property.

Can I recover GST/HST?

If you register and collect GST/HST on the rental income you may be able to recover GST/HST paid on certain operating costs.

Capital expenses

Depending on the rental usage of the home you may be entitled to a recovery on all or a portion of the GST/HST paid on the acquisition or improvements to the home.

Caution: renting and the long-term tax impact

When you begin renting a personal property other than incidentally or occasionally you’re considered to have changed the use of that property for income tax purposes. As a result there are significant income tax consequences that must be considered.

And let’s not forget about the significant GST/HST consequences that may also arise if you rent out your home. If your home is rented 90 per cent or more of the time for rental periods of less than 60 days it may lose its status as a ‘residential complex.’ If this occurs any subsequent sale becomes subject to GST/HST if you later change it back to a personal residence (or exempt long-term rental) you will need to pay GST/HST to the CRA based on the fair market value of the home.

Keeping records

Make sure you keep detailed records of all the rental income you earn and the expenses you incur. It’s also beneficial to log your own personal use of the home throughout the year to support its use as a personal residence. You can validate your purchases and operating expenses with supporting documents such as invoices receipts and contracts.

While renting out your home may seem like an easy way to generate extra income the decision to become a host must be well informed and include a good understanding of the tax implications.

Upstairs is a townhouse - spread across two floors - featuring a kitchen bathroom three bedrooms and a living area that was previously used for pop-up dining and art exhibitions.

Guests will walk straight into their very own pub with a toasty open fire and an honesty bar - which means guests will be given full access but will be trusted to pay for what they drink.

Landlord Nigel Askew who has run the pub for 12 years says he was forced to put his pub on Airbnb so it does not shut for good.

""Even after lockdown we’re only half full and we can’t survive on that so we have had to diversify our income and run the pub as an Airbnb for two days a week"" he said.

""Obviously there was Covid but even before that the government beer tax was so high.

""A local pub with only a few customers can’t survive. The electrics and gas [prices] are too high - now they’ve gone up as well.

""The running costs are too big and that’s why they’re closing left right and centre.""

The Queen Charlotte is available for up to six people for £300-a-night for a minimum of two nights.

Larger groups can be hosted at the pub but a supervising bar person will be provided.

""People have come out of lockdown when they haven’t been allowed in a pub and now they can have their own"" Mr Askew added.

""Most of the bookings tend to be groups of girls it seems - and they’re not even on a hen night.

""Maybe they feel a bit more comfortable partying on their own. That is very relevant right now - they can relax and do what they like.""

The Queen Charlotte team have curated a ""quirky interior"" and vinyl collection with vintage Dansette's - but punters can bring their own records too.

They also have a modern stereo but all music has to stop at pub closing times and be at a ""reasonable level"".

The pub is also available to hire without access to the townhouse.

Or follow us on Google News

We’ve had our Tesla Model 3 SR+ for a bit more than 2 years now. I recently had a service visit for a couple of things but rather than write only about them I figured it would be useful for people to see our full service history with the car. I’m going to go backward from most recent to least recent since the recent stuff is more interesting. Here we go….

Opening Trunk

A few months ago I went to open the trunk and it wouldn’t open. After a day of not getting it to open and needing to get some tennis equipment out of it for my daughters I realized I might be able to go through the back seat and open it from the inside. Indeed that worked since there’s a manual latch in the trunk door. The trunk then worked so I figured it was just a temporary glitch.

At around the same time the backup camera didn’t work a few times. But then it came back and worked like normal.

We were going to Europe for a month and a half to spend time with my wife’s family so I didn’t want to mess with service appointments at the time and everything seemed to be back to normal.

After we returned though within a couple of days the trunk wouldn’t open again. And the camera acted up a few times just like before. I opened the trunk manually several times but it wouldn’t start working correctly again so I knew it needed service. I scheduled a mobile service visit and a few days later the ranger came and checked it out. He hadn’t seen this problem before but talked to a colleague who had seen it a few times in Texas. Here’s what it turned out the issue was:

There’s a wiring harness in the trunk door that carries wires from various things back there to the front (including from the cameras and trunk latch). If a wire or two gets damaged things stop working. In such a case the whole harness has to be replaced. Here’s a short video of me just showing that the trunk won’t open trying from either the touchscreen or the trunk itself:

This is not a mobile service task and Tesla had to order a part before providing the service. Eventually though 3 weeks after I put in the initial service request I had an appointment at the local Tesla service center and brought the car in for the harness to be replaced. It was all done under warranty so at no cost to me aside from the time.

Replacing Tires

When the mobile service technician visited to look at the trunk and also at a previous service visit when he came to replace the 12V battery (see below) he checked the tire treads and some other things and told me the tread level was low and should be replaced soon. Not wanting to bother with taking the car to a separate place for tires and trusting that Tesla would give me a good deal since Tesla’s aim is to not make a profit on service and to treat customers well I decided to just go with Tesla’s recommendations and not stress. I have since been told by another Tesla owner to just buy tires through Tire Kingdom and that I paid way too much. Next time I will shop around a bit more and have more faith in local tire shops….

In any case after two years and fewer than 17000 miles I replaced all four tires at a cost of almost $1700 ($1671.64 to be exact). Yikes. More than I expected.

It seems I’m on the worse end of tire wear and tear. I was told that the normal range is between 15000 and 25000 miles. I hardly ever drive on the Interstate and I drive quite calmly (see my Safety Score below) so I was surprised to be on the low end of this window. Though I have been known to enjoy a good blast-off at almost every chance (red light) that I get. I’ll also admit that I’m almost 40 but do still often feel like a kid (when I’m not thinking about my bum knee or growing belly). Perhaps I am having too much fun. I have committed to trying to be a bit more calm at traffic lights. Sort of.

12V Battery Replacement

As I reported a few months ago I had to have my 12V battery replaced just after 15000 miles and nearly two years of ownership. The cost was $0 since it’s included under warranty but once you’re out of warranty you may want to keep the cost of a 12V battery in your long-term Tesla Model 3 maintenance budget. You can read more about all of that here.

Tire Rotation

After a few months more than one year of ownership and 8 months before replacing the tires I had the tires rotated by Tesla. That came at a cost of $35.00.

Cabin Air Filter Replacements

At the same time as the above-mentioned tire rotation I had the cabin air filter replaced. The specific description from Tesla on the invoice is “A/C Odor Removal (Using Evaporator Foam Cleaner Replace Cabin Filters).” The cost was $50.50 for parts and $39.75 for labor so $90.25 in total.

That was the second time I had the cabin air filter replaced. The first time was a year before and just a few months after buying the car. We bought the car right around the time Tesla implemented a software update to better lengthen the life of the air filter since in humid climates (like Florida) it was getting stinky too quickly. As a result of all of that Tesla replace the filter as a complimentary service (no charge).

Tesla Model 3 Maintenance Summary

So in summary (and going from oldest to newest this time) in two years of ownership and 17000 miles (actually two years two months and 18728 miles as I write this) I’ve had the air filter replaced twice ($0 goodwill service the first time $90.25 the second) the tires rotated once ($35) the 12V battery replaced once ($0 under warranty) and all 4 tires replaced once ($1671.64). That comes to a total cost of $1796.89 for just over two years of Tesla Model 3 maintenance — which compares pretty favorably to other premium brands.

During the various service visits above I also had them check out a few things that ended up being nothing or unidentifiable matters that went away (truly little things). Additionally they refilled my windshield wiper fluid during service center visits and I’m yet to buy any myself.

I also spent $0 charging for almost two years of ownership but a few months ago moved into a home with a garage and have spent some amount of money (I haven’t kept track) charging at home.

The focus of this article was Tesla Model 3 maintenance service visits and total cost of ownership. For more of a “long-term review” see the full archives for that and see this article in particular: “16 Months With Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus (Video Summary).”

Or follow us on Google News

The US auto industry has had a tough year. Sales are down notably despite the fact that the country is creeping gradually out of the COVID crisis. In the 3rd quarter US auto sales were down 13% compared to the 3rd quarter of 2020 and were down 22% compared to the 3rd quarter of 2019. Given the disruption caused by the shutdowns and then the semi rebound last year the much more notable comparison in my mind is Q3 2021 compared to Q3 2019. Nonetheless both are noteworthy and intriguing.

Interestingly as you may have gathered by now Tesla bucked the trend. Tesla sales in the US were up 67% compared to the 3rd quarter of 2020 and were up 104% compared to the 3rd quarter of 2019.

Tesla wasn’t the only company that had its US sales go up but it was one of few and it was far above the others. Here are the changes from Q3 2020 to Q3 2021:

As you can see BMW Lexus and Kia had sales go up 9% 8% and 7% respectively. Hyundai and Volvo were up 4% each.

In terms of volume Tesla was up by nearly 40000 sales. (Also note that these sales are actually deliveries note sales and timetables for deliveries have been getting pushed off more and more due to high demand and limited supply. A Model Y ordered today has an estimated delivery month of April 2022). Kia was up 12000 Hyundai nearly 8000 and BMW and Lexus about 6000 each. If you actually add up the sales increases of every automaker that was up rather than down the surprising thing is they didn’t even total the estimated Tesla sales increase.

Meanwhile … a lot of automakers were very down and very very down year over year. On a volume basis Chevrolet and Ford (down 162392 and 140437 respectively) suffered the brunt of the pain. On a percentage basis Fiat and Chrysler (sister companies) had the biggest drops (down 64% and 51% respectively). But there’s a long list of companies that were in the red.

What about Q3 2021 compared to Q3 2019?

The results are more extreme in this comparison. Tesla is up 104% in Q3 2021 compared to Q3 2019 Volvo is up 16% Kia 12% Lexus 10% Porsche 9% Alfa Romeo 5% and Hyundai 3%. Every other automaker was down with the most extreme losses on a percentage basis going to Fiat again (-83%) Infiniti (-57%) Dodge (-53%) Chrysler (-48%) Cadillac (-44%) and Chevrolet (-43%).

Ending with an overall look the kind of data many headlines focus on is captured in the following two charts:

As you can see the overall US auto market was down 13% in Q3 2021 versus Q3 2020 and down 22% compared to Q3 2019. Of course what is lost in those charts is that some auto brands were up significantly despite the overall market being down significantly — with Tesla standing out in that regard.

Check out last quarter’s report as well for deeper historical perspective: “US Auto Sales: Tesla Had Highest % Increase From Q2 2019 To Q2 2021 5th Highest Volume Increase.”

Shepherd Chimururi – Interactive Youth Correspondent

The Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education should consider a policy shift on infant learners’ hand writing to align it with the technological advances taking place in the e-learning and online inspired education system. This noble plea comes in light of the complications the infant learners are facing when learning how to type. Typing as an educational experience is now regarded worldwide a new ‘literacy’ alongside reading numeracy and writing.

These complications are the reason why most schools are not teaching computers to infants largely considered as pre readers despite being mandated to do so by the syllabus.

The complications stem from the fact that infant learners are taught to write the print handwriting in their books yet on the keyboard the shapes of letters appear differently.

On the keyboard the letters are styled using the aerial font yet in the books the letters are taught to write the print type of handwriting. The font closest to this type of handwriting is century gothic.

For example children are taught to write ‘a’ which is century gothic font but on the keyboard the letter appears as ‘A’ and when typed in lower case it appears as ‘a’. This confusion is hurting infant learners and their computer teachers who end up skipping the practical lessons.

Capital letters that have a different shape from small letters confuse learners who do not know the difference between small letters and capital letters.

Another source of confusion is the similarity between some letters and numbers which look identical like ‘o’ and ‘0’.

Besides that when teachers are introducing letters to infants they start with lower case letters yet on the keyboard the letters are in upper case.

This confuses the kids to the last degree.

In addition the arrangement they see on alphabet charts on classroom walls is different from the arrangement they see on the keyboard.

Trying to teach a child to recognise a ‘y’ always comes with resistance from the learner because the ‘y’ on the keyboard has no loop like the ‘y’ they write in the books. Actually there are 15 letters on keyboard that confuse infants. The confusion arises from the fact that in class infants are initially taught in lower case but on keyboard they appear in capital case.

These complications are not just limited to learning typing on the computer.

The same happens when the little learners want to use other information communication and technology based

learning mediums like tablets computers and mobile phone.

The default font on these gadgets is different from what the learners are used to in their books.

The million dollar questions now are is it still worth it to continue teaching children something that is being phased out?

What if 10 years from now writing by hand on paper is as outdated as filling a withdrawal slip in a banking hall?

It might sound unthinkable but given the current rapid trajectory of e-learning and online learning handwriting could be history to typing as technology dominates the way students communicate learn and live every day.

For infants keyboard is the window to the fascinating passport to the digital world of typing letters words sentences numbers and punctuation marks. Teaching infants keyboard skills is a complex task that requires the teacher to have a clear understanding of the physical and intellectual challenges infants face at their age.

Teaching infants typing is a two dimension challenge — physically at this stage they still struggle with fine motor skills and eye hand coordination. Intellectually they struggle with recognising shape of letters identifying the letter by name as well as proper pronunciation of the sound of the letters in a phonetic way – a latest way of teaching children to read. The major challenge is the majority of IT personnel turned infant teachers did not learn phonics at school.

So far no clear explanation has been offered in academic books why two different variants of letters are being used in hand writing and typing and the supposed advantages.

Maybe someone at Ambassador House must explain the advantages of recommending teachers to teach infants to use a hand writing that is different from fonts on the keyboard.

At this juncture it is prudent for the education ministry to set up a commission that will look into the problems inhibiting the learning of computers by infants the impact of different letters used in books and computers.

Maybe the ministry has to make it mandatory for schools to use customized keyboards which have infant friendly letters that are styled the way they are taught to write in the book.

It does not need a rocket scientist to see that education is evolving rapidly as digital gadgets are making their way through the educational system bit by bit replacing conventional books.

Scholars must begin to wonder about how best teachers can teach a handwriting that aligns with the ICT gadgets.

The above screenshot image shows a child who wanted to type the name Portia. Instead of typing ‘o’ the child used ‘Q’ which is similar to ‘O’ and then went on to use ‘1’ instead of ‘i’ as she could not locate it on the keyboard as it is not there on the key board",,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic that prevented fans from attending the Wolves played their home games during an abbreviated 2021 season at Triphahn Community Center & Ice Arena in Hoffman Estates. Now the Wolves are back home and eager to skate in front of supporters instead of mostly empty bleachers and fan cutouts at their practice facility.

While Triphahn is a nice venue and serves the Wolves well it’s not meant to host regular-season games in one of the top hockey leagues in the world. The lack of fans added to the unusual feeling and defenseman Cavan Fitzgerald is looking forward to a more normal setting.

“It will mean a lot to us as players finally playing in front of fans because last year we were just at a practice rink” said Fitzgerald who skated in 30 games for the Wolves last season. “Usually we get to feed off the crowd a little bit here and there so it will be definitely awesome to see everybody back in those seats and cheering us on.”

During what he called an “interesting” year Fitzgerald said it was a little tougher to get the energy going for every game last season and that the Wolves tried to feed off each other and create their own boosts instead of relying on fans. Apparently that worked as the Wolves were 12-3-0-1 at Triphahn.

“We got into a rhythm for sure” Fitzgerald said.

Now back in Rosemont Fitzgerald and the Wolves will have to find their rhythm in a home arena the current players haven’t called home.

A lot can happen in almost 600 days and plenty has since the Wolves beat the IceHogs 3-2 on March 8 2020. Over the ensuing period the Wolves switched affiliations going from the Golden Knights to the Hurricanes. Coach Rocky Thompson was replaced by Ryan Warsofsky and the roster completely turned over.

For Warsofsky Saturday night will be his first game at Allstate Arena since June 8 2019 when he was an assistant for the Charlotte Checkers who beat the Wolves in Game 5 of the Calder Cup Finals to win the AHL championship.

“We’re all excited from the coaching staff to the players to the support staff to the front office everyone’s excited” said Warsofsky who’s entering his second season with the Wolves. “It’s been a lot of work to get back in front of our fans and I’m excited to get behind the bench and in front of the fans and hopefully put a good product on the ice a winning product.”

Beyond their home rink the Wolves’ upcoming campaign should be more normal in other ways.

In addition to Carolina the Wolves also served as Nashville’s affiliate after Milwaukee chose to sit out last season but the Admirals are back this time around. The Calder Cup playoffs which haven’t been contested since 2019 will return in 2022.

Noah Gragson

Noah Gragson opened the Round of 8 in the NASCAR Xfinity Series Playoffs with a third-place finish in Saturday’s Andy’s Frozen Custard 335 driving his Bass Pro Shops/TrueTimber® Camo/Black Rifle Coffee Chevrolet to the front in the late going and maintaining his position in the NXS point standings with just two races remaining before the winner-take-all championship race. Gragson overcame damage to the body on his Camaro and raced among the leaders when it counted. As a result Gragson enters next week’s event at Kansas Speedway fourth on the playoff grid two points above the cutline for the Championship 4.

Stage One Finish: 2nd

Starting from fifth position after the application of NASCAR’s mathematical formula earlier in the week Gragson was immediately on the move when the green flag waved for the 45-lap Stage One taking third place in the opening laps and sorting out his Bass Pro Shops/TrueTimber/Black Rifle Coffee Chevrolet. At the lap-20 competition caution Gragson told crew chief Dave Elenz that his car was tight in the center of the corners and on exit. During the caution period Gragson was told the top lane which had been treated with resin to help with grip would come in soon. When the race resumed with 20 laps remaining in the stage Gragson dropped to fourth in a battle with AJ Allmendinger. Later in the run Allmendinger slipped to the high side and slowed down which caught Gragson who was already committed to the top lane by surprise and contact was made with Allmendinger’s rear bumper. Gragson maintained fourth position until lap 41 when the caution waved again. Several of the cars around Gragson came to pit road but Elenz elected to keep Gragson on the track for the one-lap conclusion to Stage One in order to collect stage points. Gragson crossed the line in second place when the green-and-white checkered flag waved over the field. In the process Gragson earned nine valuable stage points. Gragson said his car was still tight in the center of the corners and on exit so Elenz added four tires and made a chassis adjustment to help his driver when he came to pit road at the end of the stage. By virtue of several cars pitting early Gragson returned to the track in 16th position for Stage Two.

Stage Two Finish: 9th

On the second lap of Stage Two Gragson went high into Turns 1 and 2 and dropped all the way to 23rd position when his car got loose in the third groove. Gathering his car up Gragson reset and made his way back to 17th before the caution waved for debris at lap 55. Once the green flag was displayed Gragson kept moving forward getting to 14th in the first three laps of competition. He was 12th once the field settled out and was back in the top 10 at lap 79. He would eventually end Stage Two on lap 90 in ninth position adding two more stage points to bring his total for the day to 11. On the stage break the Nevada native told Elenz that his Bass Pro Shops/TrueTimber/Black Rifle Coffee Chevrolet started out loose but was building tighter. On pit road Gragson took four fresh tires and fuel with a smaller chassis adjustment as well. The team held Gragson on pit lane to fix some damage to the right front bodywork and sent their driver back out in 24th position. On the out lap Gragson reported a vibration and Elenz brought him back down pit road to tighten the lug nuts. He rejoined the field in 28th position.

Final Stage:

At the green flag to start the final segment Gragson immediately moved forward taking 24th at lap 101 when the caution came out for a crash in Turn 2. Lining up 21st on the inside line Gragson passed five cars on the first lap of green-flag racing to run 16th. A few laps later at lap 115 Gragson was back in the top 10 and he kept coming sweeping to eighth on lap 118 and seventh on lap 125. Quiet on the radio Gragson moved the Bass Pro Shops/TrueTimber/Black Rifle Coffee Chevrolet to sixth place six laps later. Elenz asked Gragson about his water pressure gauge after in-car camera shots showed water on the windshield of the car behind him but it proved to be nothing to worry about. Several laps later Gragson reported that his car was building tighter and tighter on the long green-flag run. Under caution at lap 144 Gragson hit pit road again for four tires and fuel maintaining his track position in the process. A car ahead of him was called for a pit-road violation which advanced Gragson into the top five. Choosing the top line for the restart Gragson settled into fourth position and soon moved up to the third at lap 165 by passing Austin Cindric.

Gragson was still third with 26 laps remaining when the final caution flag of the race came out and he told Elenz that his car was building tighter again as the run went on. After some conversation Elenz brought his driver to pit road for their final set of sticker tires for the run to the finish along with fuel and a little more of the adjustment from the last pit stop. Gragson started the final stint from the inside of the third row and ran fifth for several laps. With 13 laps remaining Gragson moved up to fourth place and took third with 11 laps left in the 200-lap event. He would finish there at the checkered flag.

John Hunter Nemechek won the race with Daniel Hemric second ahead of Gragson JR Motorsports teammate Justin Allgaier and Cindric. Allmendinger was sixth with Justin Haley Harrison Burton JRM’s Michael Annett and Brandon Jones the remainder of the top 10.

Noah Gragson driver No. 9 Bass Pro Shops/TrueTimber/Black Rifle Coffee Company Chevrolet team

“It was a good rebound. I made a mistake hitting a car getting onto pit road when they all stacked up. It did some damage to the nose which we repaired on the pit stop. It was a good recovery for our Bass Pro Shops/TrueTimber/Black Rifle Coffee team. The engine was awesome today; thanks to the guys at the Hendrick Engines shop. They had a lot of steam under the hood today. We needed to make a little bit bigger swing on our adjustment on the last pit stop but we’re close. I’ll take a third-place finish and go on to Kansas. We want to win and we’ll keep fighting for a championship.”

Justin Allgaier

Justin Allgaier driver of the No. 7 Sam’s Club #MakeOverMyBackyard Chevrolet secured his ninth consecutive top-10 finish on Saturday afternoon in the NASCAR Xfinity Series event at Texas Motor Speedway taking the checkered flag in the fourth position. The result marks the fifth time in the last six races that Allgaier has finished inside the top five. Additionally with today’s top-five result the JR Motorsports driver remains third in the NXS Playoff Grid four points above the cutline with two races remaining in the Round of 8.

Stage One Finish: 4th

Allgaier lined up for the 200-lap event from the sixth position after the field was set via NASCAR’s mathematical formula earlier in the week. From the drop of the green flag Allgaier held steady maintaining his track position inside the top 10 until the competition caution was displayed on lap 20. While under caution Allgaier reported to crew chief Jason Burdett that the Sam’s Club Chevrolet was building tight while rolling through the corner. Although not handling to his liking Allgaier continued to battle inside the top 10 once back under way running as high as seventh before a caution with just six laps remaining in the opening stage provided Burdett an opportunity to work with some strategy. With a handful of the race leaders opting to come to pit road Burdett made the call for Allgaier to stay out moving the JRM driver up three positions and into the top five for the one-lap sprint to conclude Stage One.

Taking the green as the second car on the outside row Allgaier traded positions with AJ Allmendinger and JRM teammate Michael Annett before taking the green-and-white checkered flag in the fourth position and earning seven extremely valuable stage points to begin the day.

Stage Two Finish: 8th

During the stage-ending caution Burdett called the driver of the Sam’s Club Chevrolet to pit road for four tires and an air-pressure adjustment. However due to varying pit strategies Allgaier returned to the track for the start of Stage Two in the 22nd position. Undeterred by the loss of track position the Illinois native charged forward improving nine positions to 13th in just three laps before a lap-54 caution period bunched the pack back together. Taking the lap-61 restart as the seventh car in the outside line Allgaier quickly gained an additional three positions to 11th before the field was slowed once again by the caution flag on lap 63. The driver of the Sam’s Club Chevrolet continued his ascent up the leaderboard on the restart that followed marching back into the top 10 over the green-flag run that followed to take the green-and-white checkered flag in the eighth position on lap 90. With the stage result Allgaier earned an additional three valuable stage points to bring the No. 7 team’s total to 10 on the afternoon.

Final Stage:

While under the stage-ending caution Allgaier reported to Burdett that he needed help with the front turn on his Sam’s Club Chevrolet. As a result Burdett called Allgaier to pit road for four tires and another round of adjustments. A strong stop by the Sam’s Club crew gained Allgaier three positions in the running order sending the JRM driver back out for the start of the third and final stage on lap 97 in fifth. Holding the fifth position through a quick lap-99 caution period Allgaier set his sights forward following the lap-108 restart making a daring three-wide move down the back straightaway to power into the third position.

Now inside the top three Allgaier remained steadfast matching lap times with the top two throughout the 33-lap run that followed before the caution flag was displayed once again on lap 141. While under caution Burdett called the driver of the Sam’s Club Chevrolet back to pit road for four fresh tires and fuel. Another strong stop sent the JRM driver back onto the track in the second position for the lap-149 restart. Firing off in second Allgaier fended off a challenge from the inside line before settling into the runner-up position. Then while narrowing the gap to the race leader through lapped traffic an incident exiting Turn 2 forced NASCAR to again throw the caution flag on lap 172. As a result of the caution Burdett made the call to bring Allgaier to pit road for the final set of fresh tires and fuel. However with one car opting to stay out and an additional machine choosing to take just two tires Allgaier returned to the track following the stop in fourth.

Taking the green flag from the second row on lap 180 Allgaier found himself mired in an intense battle for position with JRM teammate Noah Gragson Harrison Burton and Austin Cindric. Trading positions with the trio for several laps Allgaier was able to remain inside the top five throughout the closing laps to take the checkered flag in fourth.

The fourth-place result marks the fifth time in the previous six races that Allgaier has finished inside the top five and the 15th time in the last 17 races that he has placed in the top 10.

Additionally today’s top-five finish keeps the JRM driver third in the NXS Playoff grid four points above the cutline with two races remaining in the Round of 8.

Justin Allgaier driver No. 7 Sam’s Club #MakeOverMyBackyard Chevrolet team

“Today was a solid day for our Sam’s Club #MakeOverMyBackyard Chevrolet. We kept fighting all day long and were able to come away with another top-five finish and remain inside that top four in points. We know what we need to do from here as we get ready for next week in Kansas. Hopefully we can have another smooth day there and get ourselves one step closer to moving on to Phoenix.”

Michael Annett

Michael Annett turned in another solid performance on Saturday at Texas Motor Speedway scoring points in both stages and earning a ninth-place finish in the Andy’s Frozen Custard 335 for NASCAR Xfinity Series cars on the 1.5-mile quad-oval. The finish in the No. 1 Allstate Peterbilt Group 50th Anniversary Chevrolet was Annett’s ninth top-10 finish of the 2021 season and first since his return to the cockpit last week at the Charlotte Roval. The finish also helped the No. 1 team gain in the owner’s championship cutting 14 points off the team’s deficit to the cutline for the Championship 4. With two races remaining until the field in the owner’s championship is narrowed to four the team is eighth in the standings 19 points shy of fourth.

Stage One Finish: 5th

Annett rolled off from ninth position after application of NASCAR’s mathematical formula to determine the starting lineup.. Over the opening laps the No. 1 Allstate Peterbilt Group 50th Anniversary Chevrolet stayed tight in the top 10.. When the yellow waved at lap 20 for the competition caution Annett told crew chief Mike Bumgarner that his Camaro was very neutral on entry and that once he moved up to the top lane around the 1.5-mile layout the handling got better. When the green flag was shown again Annett continued in the top 10 until the caution waved at lap 41 for a stalled car. Some of the cars ahead of him hit pit road moving him up to fifth in the running order. When the green flag waved to begin the final lap of the 45-lap Stage One Annett held his spot and finished there earning six valuable stage points in the process. Heading toward Turn 3 on that final lap Harrison Burton tagged the left front fender of Annett’s car in a battle for position knocking the fender in a little. On pit road Annett took four tires fuel and an adjustment to help a developing tight condition. In addition the crew popped the affected fender back out and sent Annett back into the race in 25th position behind the cars which had pitted earlier.

Stage Two Finish: 7th

Beginning the run in heavy traffic Annett made short work of the cars ahead when the green flag waved to begin Stage Two. The Iowa driver gained five positions on the first lap of green-flag racing and five more over the next three circuits to run 14th. A caution flag waved for debris at lap 55 but on the ensuing green flag Annett continued to march forward picking up two positions on the first lap of green-flag action and getting back into the top 10 the next time under the flag stand. Annett continued to move forward getting to eighth before another caution waved at lap 64. Annett assumed seventh position at lap 72 and ran down the pack of front-runners ahead of him over the next several laps but could advance no further. Annett brought the Allstate Peterbilt Group 50th Anniversary Chevrolet home in seventh at lap 90 adding four more stage points to his total for the day bringing it to 10. Under the yellow Annett told Bumgarner that his car had gotten tight at about the same time in Stage Two as it did in Stage One and that aerodynamics had hindered his ability to gain positions over the final run to the stage flag. Bumgarner brought his driver to pit road for four tires fuel and a little more of the same adjustment made on the Stage One stop sending Annett back out for the final segment in 10th position.

Final Stage:

When the green flag waved to start the final 110-lap segment Annett gained one position to ninth before another caution flag stopped the action. When it resumed on lap 109 Annett took another two positions to seventh and moved to sixth at lap 112. Riding there for several laps Annett tracked down the next car in line and swept into the top five on lap 122. Annett kept the pressure on staying in fifth for the next 20 laps until the caution flag waved again. Bumgarner called him back down pit road at that time for four tires and fuel. The pit crew held serve and got their driver back on the track without losing a position. When green-flag racing resumed at lap 149 Annett held fourth position for a lap before the field began to battle in earnest. Annett slipped to sixth in the midst of the battle in the front with 47 laps remaining and stayed there until the caution flag waved again at lap 173. Annett’s Allstate Peterbilt 50th Anniversary Chevrolet had been building tight as the laps wound down and Bumgarner called him back to pit road for his final set of sticker tires and fuel and once again the pit crew held Annett’s spot in the order.

On the ensuing restart Annett held position as before but as he entered Turn 4 five laps into the run he ran over a bump that upset his car losing two positions to ninth. He would recover without losing any more positions and ran the rest of the race in ninth position.

John Hunter Nemechek won the race with Daniel Hemric JR Motorsports teammates Noah Gragson and Justin Allgaier and Austin Cindric the top five. AJ Allmendinger led the second five with Justin Haley Burton Annett and Brandon Jones the rest of the top 10.

Michael Annett driver No. 1 Allstate Peterbilt Group 50th Anniversary Chevrolet team

“Our Allstate Peterbilt 50th Anniversary Chevrolet was really good today and we could have finished a few spots better if I didn’t hit the bump there late. That caused me to lose the track position we had gained at the time. Our No. 1 pit crew did a great job on pit road all day gained a lot of positions. It was a good day for us too in the owner’s points and we’ll take that to Kansas with us next week.”

Sam Mayer

Making his first NASCAR Xfinity Series start at Texas Motor Speedway Sam Mayer driver of the No. 8 QPS Employment Group Chevrolet drove from his 11th-place starting position to inside of the top five in the early stages of Saturday afternoon’s Andy’s Frozen Custard 335 NXS event. Then midway through the opening stage contact with another car forced the JR Motorsports driver to make an unscheduled pit stop shuffling Mayer back outside of the top 30. Undaunted by the task at hand Mayer battled back over the remainder of the event earning stage points following Stage Two and running working his way inside the top 10 during the final stage before ultimately taking the checkered flag in the 13th position.

Stage One Finish: 17th

Mayer lined up for his first race at Texas in the 11th position after the field was set through NASCAR’s mathematical formula. From the drop of the green flag Mayer moved forward needing only two laps to drive inside of the top 10. Racing in the 10th position as the competition caution waved on lap 20 Mayer reported that his No. 8 QPS Employment Group Chevrolet was loose off throttle. Restarting from the inside of row five for the ensuing restart Mayer checked up to avoid a slower car but contact from behind caused a tire rub on the left rear fender. An immediate yellow saved Mayer as crew chief Taylor Moyer called the No. 8 down pit road to fix the damage and replace the two left side tires in the process. Restarting from the rear of the field Mayer set his eyes forward as he raced his way up to 25th before the next caution waved on lap 39. Pitting for right side tires during the caution Mayer lined up for the restart from the 17th position. With a one-lap-dash to end Stage One Mayer remained in the 17th position as he crossed under the green-and-white checkered flag on lap 45.

Stage Two Finish: 3rd

During the stage-ending caution Moyer made the call to keep the driver of the No. 8 QPS Employment Group Chevrolet on track as they had just taken tires one lap prior. Restarting from the third position Mayer settled in just behind the front two running cars until a lap-54 caution bunched the leaders back together. Restarting from third Mayer raced into the runner-up position before a lap-64 yellow slowed the field once again. Starting from the outside of the front row Mayer fell to third and settled in until the green-and-white checkered flag was displayed on lap 90 to end Stage Two. Mayer earned eight stage points for the result.

Final Stage:

Prior to the start of the third and final stage Moyer made the call to bring the QPS Employment Group Chevrolet to pit road for another set of four fresh tires fuel and an air pressure adjustment. Restarting from the inside of row two Mayer held steady in the third position when a lap-99 caution was displayed. Restarting from third once again Mayer battled an ill-handling Camaro that proved arduous to drive as he dropped down to the 11th position. Reporting the car was way too loose he raced around the 12th position until a lap-141 caution gave Moyer an opportunity to work on the QPS Employment Group Chevrolet. Pitting during the yellow for four tires fuel and to fix some slight damage sustained Mayer came out of the pits in the 14th position. Restarting from the top of row six Mayer utilized the high-side to gain one position before the final caution was displayed on lap 172. The JR Motorsports driver brought his No. 8 Camaro to pit road for the final time for four tires fuel and a chassis adjustment to alleviate a loose-handling Camaro. Restarting from 14th with less than 20 laps remaining Mayer pressed on and battled his way to a 13th-place finish.

“We struggled to find the balance on the No. 8 QPS Employment Group Chevrolet during the latter parts of the race and just couldn’t make up any ground. It felt good to run towards the front in Stage Two and put an entire race together after getting a little damage early on. We will press on to Kansas next week and hopefully be near the front again.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlZWtlcnN0aW1lLmNvbS9hLXNpdC1kb3duLXdpdGgtc2VyaWFsLWVudHJlcHJlbmV1ci1qdWxpYW4tbGF0dHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Sit Down With Serial Entrepreneur Julian Latty,"Julian Latty is a Virginia based serial entrepreneur investor and mentor to countless aspiring entrepreneurs. He’s self made and has gone from a challenging upbringing to being one of the most prominent entrepreneurs in all of Virginia. He currently owns and operates an Allstate insurance agency in Virginia Beach with another location planned for Dallas Texas owns two food trucks in Virginia Beach and is currently working on a new CBD venture with a business partner. We sat down with Julian to discuss his journey all things entrepreneurship and the reason why he’s so motivated to give back to other entrepreneurs.

His Backstory

Julian has always been an underdog. There was a point in his life where he could hardly make rent for his apartment and was never sure that his car would start on his way to work. He’s been told time and time again that he wouldn’t be able to find success and he refers to himself being treated as the “black sheep”.

Julian uses his past as fuel for his future. He knows that the only thing able to slow him down at this point is himself and he works tirelessly so he can grow into the dominant intelligent charismatic entrepreneur he still aspires to be even with all of his current success.

Giving Back

When he’s not working on his business ventures or spending time with family and friends Julian is giving back to the community. During the peak of the pandemic he used his food trucks to give free meals to nurses and doctors on the front lines. Around the holidays Julian provides meals and toys to families in need and has a goal of giving back to his community with resources and education to help start businesses for people interested in entrepreneurship.

Julian always shoots for the stars when he sets goals and wants to follow in the footsteps of folks like MLK Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali in terms of the impact and legacy he hopes to leave behind.

Julian’s parents are in real estate and own land in rural virginia. After speaking with his parents about growing on their property they said yes. The farm will be known as iCanna Farms an extension of iCanna Premier CBD. We start should start our first grow in 2022 sometime and grow thc once it legalized in Virginia

His Motivation

Julian works day in and day out to not only further himself and his career but to be genuine and relate to the person who’s struggling. He wants them to look at him and say “If he can do it I can do it too.” Julian knows firsthand that a strong work ethic and positive mindset can be all it takes to emerge into success as an entrepreneur and he is constantly encouraging others to keep working hard and never give up until they’ve achieved their dreams and then some.

Read more

STANTON Del. — Amazon’s biggest newest warehouse with more robots than ever brings America closer to an automated future when machines do all the work of moving everything from groceries to laptops from makers to users. And do it faster.

While Amazon has been building increasingly automated warehouses since opening its first satellite center in 1997 five miles down the road in New Castle Del. this $250 million showcase is something entirely different.

Advertisement

Insides the five-story plant — as big as 17 football fields or four of Philadelphia’s tallest high rises — an electromechanical ballet performed by robots takes place in an eerie quiet. Robot vehicles guided by optical and motion sensors make turns tightly adjacent to one another selecting and carrying Amazon’s vast array of merchandise from storage to delivery.

There are still workers unloading trucks from suppliers and stowing the contents — not in vast shelves for hands to grab but in eight-foot-tall stacks of square yellow bins. Once within these goods begin their robotic travels.

Hour after hour tireless robots seize the stacks and move them across the vast floors dutifully pausing before isolated checkers flesh and blood who wave electronics devices to verify the orders. Finally workers pack the sorted goods onto conveyors to carry them to loaders for delivery.

And Amazon is developing drones and self-driving vehicles to speed those last steps.

Rival shippers such as FedEx or the U.S. Postal Service big grocery chains and upstart deliverers such as Philadelphia’s Gopuff have also been speeding up their warehouses. But Amazon’s massive investment will force its competitors to invest a lot more a lot faster analysts predict.

About 10000 Amazon-built robots here far outnumber the 1000 newly hired human workers who spend 10- to 12- hour shifts at the 3.7 million-square foot complex which Amazon contractors erected on the site of a former General Motors factory.

Does that 10-1 ratio spell an end to the massive hiring that has made warehouse work at double the minimum wage so widely available in recent years?

Amazon and its admirers are a little sensitive on this point so it’s worth noting upfront: Amazon is still hiring not just because so many workers don’t last a year but also because its service is so popular that it keeps building more centers adding people to run them doing things robots still can’t. For now.

Amazon employed 1.3 million employees worldwide last year up from 800000 a year earlier. Among U.S. companies only rival Walmart with all its stores employs more.

To be sure some critical economists say Amazon destroys more jobs than it creates. Other analysts say that labor-saving has always been the goal of new technology.

In any event Will Carney the plant’s manager here said “Our hiring is not quite done.”

The facility is in a “ramp-up” stage and may eventually employ as many as 4000 to 5000 workers as the work expands over the next several years according to spokesman Steve Kelly.

Amazon hopes it will be easier to keep human workers this winter when the company has pledged to start providing workers up to $5250 a year toward colleges costs. It may also add robots and employees in Delaware though Amazon won’t detail its longer-term plans for the facility.

The staff as much as it has grown since opening this summer is still fewer than Amazon employs at fulfillment centers one-quarter this size.

The facility is the flagship of a sweeping expansion by Amazon across the Philadelphia region. Amazon has plans to open as many as nine new facilities in the coming months. That’s on top of the 14 sites added last year across Philadelphia and its suburbs the Lehigh Valley South Jersey and northern Delaware.

In all Amazon now has more than 57 centers up and running or underway across this greater Philadelphia region. Real estate and industry analysts call the growth unprecedented.

Still here in Stanton Amazon is no replacement for the former GM plant where then-Sen. Joe Biden used to launch his political campaigns glad-handling the union workers.

Built amid farm fields in 1946 the old plant employed at its peak as many as 5000 United Auto Workers members who built Oldsmobiles Chevettes and toward the end Saturns before the last workers were let go in 2009 as a recession-wracked GM reined in production.

A Biden-backed proposal to build electric cars fizzled after burning through more than $200 million in state and federal subsidies.

Manufacturers add value and GM paid well; distribution of goods made somewhere else was historically a lot less lucrative. The GM plant along with a nearby Chrysler factory a DuPont paint complex and a Claymont Steel works underpinned a prosperous post-World War II American manufacturing economy. All four are closed.

Despite Amazon’s recent bump in pay up to $18 an hour — $3 more than Amazon projected two years ago when it announced its plan — the nonunion Amazon workers make less than GM workers did when the plant closed. (Less than half as much adjusted for inflation.)

As wages creep up Amazon has relentlessly focused on consolidating operations and speeding deliveries.

“This is just the beginning. You will see large centers like this throughout the country” with other supersized facilities already rising in California New York Virginia and Arkansas said Subodha Kumar a professor at Temple University’s business school and an expert on supply chains and information systems.

Robots make it easier to manage inventory speeding the deliveries from Amazon’s smaller distribution centers in such cities as Philadelphia said Kumar. Amazon now guarantees two-hour deliveries in many locations.

“They want 30 minutes” he said. “They have plans to go shorter than that if they can.”

Amazon said automation frees workers from dull repetitive tasks. But workers have complained that automated production has been accompanied by speed-ups and a higher-than-average rate of injuries.

Why Delaware? It helps that the state gave the company whose profits top $2 billion a month about $4.5 million in up-front aid while the local government cut realty taxes to a fraction of what GM paid. Wilmington’s proximity to workforces in Maryland New Jersey and Philadelphia’s southern suburbs helped too.

“They try to find locations they can run at lower cost” Kumar said.

(Amazon officials say the plant’s proximity to the Port of Wilmington airports and on-site railroad sidings don’t matter since cargo goes in and out by truck.)

“I call these very large plants the ‘motherships’” said Brittain Ladd a former Amazon logistics executive turned automation consultant.

Ladd said Amazon’s latest expansion draws upon location and system-management lessons from its highly profitable Amazon Web Services network of services to corporations.

He sees accelerating automation as inevitable.

“During the pandemic a lot of people decided they don’t want to spend 20 or 30 years working in a fulfillment center” Ladd said. “Amazon may employ a million people. But turnover in some places is nearly 100% a year. They can’t hire enough people. They have no choice but to invest in automation and robotics.”

Amazon bought Kiva which developed the robots deployed in Delaware and elsewhere eight years go — and thinking ahead stopped supplying Gap and other retailers with Kiva machines as if to forestall competition and keep the savings for itself Kumar said.

Ladd expects the robotics arms race to accelerate with Amazon forcing competitors to upgrade.

“In the long run if they are not going to innovate and automate they will not survive” said Temple’s Kuma. “Amazon is moving very fast.”",,,,,,,,,

– “38 Planes” Come From Away

On Sept. 11 2001 the world stopped when terrorists hijacked four planes flying them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and crashing in Shanksville Pennsylvania when passengers revolted.

Air traffic halted and planes everywhere landed and stayed grounded for days as the threat was assessed. That day 38 international flights descended in Gander Newfoundland and the 7000 passengers aboard those flights immediately doubled the population of the small town.

One of those flights American Airlines Flight 49 was traveling from Paris to Dallas-Fort Worth and now an effort is being made to find those likely North Texas-based passengers to invite them to take in the touring production of the Broadway hit Come From Away based on the story of the town and the 7000 stranded passengers.

Among the stories told in the musical is the story of Dallas-Fort Worth-based Beverley Bass the first female captain for American Airlines who was flying Flight 49 that day. In the musical her character reflects on how she became a pilot — and how her view of the world has changed as she and the others stranded in Gander take in the news reports and learn more about what happened in the song “Me and the Sky.”

“Suddenly I’m in a hotel/Suddenly something has died/Suddenly there’s something in between me and the sky” Beverley sings.

Performing Arts Fort Worth the nonprofit owner and operator of Fort Worth’s Bass Performance Hall as well as American Airlines and the Consulate of General Canada announced this week that they are seeking those passengers of Flight 49 to attend opening night festivities on Oct. 19 hoping they will be on hand to tell their stories attend the show and a VIP reception.

Passengers of Flight 49 are invited to contact the Canadian Consulate General by calling 1-214-922-9806 emailing [email protected] or via private message on Facebook.com/CanCGDallas or Twitter at @CanCGDallas.

They’re also encouraged to reach out to People Newspapers at [email protected] too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWRkbGV5b3Vyb3dua2Fub28uY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTcvYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtZmxpZ2h0LWF0dGVuZGFudC1idXN0ZWQtYWxsZWdlZGx5LXNtdWdnbGluZy1nb2xkLWJhcnMtcm9sZXgtd2F0Y2hlcy1hbmQtY2FzaC1vbi1mbGlnaHQtdG8tbWlhbWkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Airlines Flight Attendant Busted Allegedly Smuggling Gold Bars Rolex Watches and Cash On Flight to Miami,"A veteran American Airlines flight attendant has been arrested in Argentina on suspicion of trying to smuggle two gold bars thousands of dollars worth of expensive jewelry and cash as well as other expensive goods out of Argentina on a flight to Miami which she was the head purser of.

The 57-year-old female flight attendant has been identified by local Argentine media as Laura Diana Schulz who is originally from Bariloche. Schulz’s arrest is making headlines in Argentina because she was a former Reina de la Nieve (Snow Queen) in her home town’s famous winter festival.

Officers from Argentina’s Policía de Seguridad Aeroportuaria (airport police) stopped Schulz during a routine check as she was going to board American Airlines flight AA900 from Buenos Aires to Miami.

Suspicion arose after officers noticed something strange in Schulz’s luggage during routine x-ray monitoring. When they asked her what was in her bag she allegedly told the officers that she was carrying her own savings that she was going to place in a friend’s safe in Miami.

Officers obtained a court order to search Schulz’s luggage and found thousands of dollars worth of expensive luxury goods including: 2204 grams of gold Rolex watches and other expensive jewelry. Along with thousands of Pesos police also found US$ 11413.33 in Schulz’s belongings.

The flight attendant who stands accused of smuggling and money laundering allegedly told police that the cash was money that passengers had donated onboard AA flights as part of its partnership with the United Nations children’s charity Unicef.

Schulz was arrested around three weeks ago but details have only now emerged after police released information about the case publicly for the first time.

Local media claim the total haul could be worth in excess of US$ 100000.

Police say the goods were carefully hidden in various compartments in Schulz’s luggage. Some pieces of jewelry were allegedly painted black to conceal the true material so far to make it seem much cheaper than it actually was.

In an emailed statement a spokesperson for American Airlines told us: “We are aware of this matter and are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation.”

The airline said it was unable to comment further as the matter was being dealt with by police.

Flight attendants are occasionally targeted by international smuggling gangs because their security access and insider knowledge allow them to go undetected in the vast majority of the time they are used to smuggle illicit goods across borders.

They do however sometimes get caught. Last October a Malaysian flight attendant was jailed for nine years after trying to smuggle AUD$3 million into Australia. Another Malaysian flight attendant was jailed in the UK for 12 months after he was caught trying to smuggle £150000 out of Britain.

And in 1997 an Emirates flight attendant was caught when he attempted to smuggle bags stuffed with heroin into the UK. Of course there have been lots of other attempts and gold is frequently the material flight attendants are asked to smuggle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3R1bHNhd29ybGQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYXJ0cy1hbmQtdGhlYXRyZS9waWxvdC1mZWF0dXJlZC1pbi1jb21lLWZyb20tYXdheS11c2VkLXRvLW1ha2luZy1oaXN0b3J5L2FydGljbGVfYjZmZGUyMjAtMmFlNC0xMWVjLThmODYtYWJhMjEwOGEwYzUyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pilot featured in 'Come From Away' used to making history,"Beverley Bass had no idea what she was getting herself into when she agreed to meet with a pair of writers some 10 years ago in a small Canadian town.

As someone who had spent much of her adult life in the aviation business Bass knew first-hand the importance of knowing as much about a given situation as possible from the condition of the plane she would control to the ever-changing weather conditions through which she would have to fly to the well-being of the passengers in her charge.

That attention to and care for detail helped Bass during one of the most difficult days in U.S. history.

Bass was the captain of American Airlines Flight 49 en route from Paris France to Dallas the morning of Sept. 11 2001. When the U.S. government completely shut down all air traffic after the terrorist attacks on New York City; Washington D.C.; and rural Pennsylvania Bass’ flight was one of 38 re-routed to the town of Gander Newfoundland and Labrador.

What happened when all those planes loaded with passengers from around the world descended upon a town of about 9000 residents is told in the musical “Come From Away” which is currently running at the Tulsa PAC.

Bass returned to Gander in 2011 to mark the 10th anniversary of the five days she and some 7000 other people spent in this small island town.

“There were all sorts of news media there and I did a ton of 20-second interviews” Bass recalled. “At some point I was told that these two playwrights Irene Sankoff and David Hein wanted to interview me as well. I had no idea what they were doing — they didn’t talk about a project they were working on. But we ended up talking for about four hours. Then I went back home to Texas and never thought any more about it.”

Until she got a call some four years later inviting her to attend the world premiere of “Come From Away” in La Jolla California.

“Again I had no idea what it was I was going to see” Bass said. “I certainly didn’t know how prominent my story would end up being.”

In “Come From Away” the character of Beverley Bass serves as a representative of all the airline captains whose planes ended up in Gander by using the details of Bass’ own biography.

“I remember we were sitting in the center of the third row from the stage” she recalled. “There’s a scene early on where the Beverley character makes a phone call and when I heard the words ‘Tom I’m fine’ my husband and I both started to cry. I don’t think we saw 75 percent of the show that first time we were so overwhelmed.

“I think it was then I realized how that day was much harder on my husband and children” Bass said. “I mean I knew where I was and knew I was safe. But my family didn’t hear from me for nearly nine hours.”

Bass has more than made up for the first viewing of “Come From Away.” Since 2015 when the show was first performed in La Jolla through its various stops on the way to Broadway and a national tour Bass has attended 158 performances of the musical.

She also has met and befriended all the actresses who have played the character of Beverley in the show from Jenn Colella who originated the role to Marika Aubrey who performs it in the current touring production.

One of the songs in “Come From Away” is “Me and the Sky” which Bass described as “practically my biography in one song.”

Bass was born in Fort Myers Florida and at a very young age became fascinated by everything to do with aviation.

“I honestly can’t remember a time when I wasn’t interesting in flying and airplanes” she said. “All the national airlines came through the Fort Myers airport and I would stand by the fence at the airport watching these huge planes take off and land and wonder how they did those things — what it felt like to leave the ground and how to land something that is that big and moving that fast.

“I thought pilots had to be some kind of gods” Bass said laughing. “And I knew from the time I was 8 years old that I wanted to be a pilot. And nothing ever made me change my mind.”

Bass began flying while attending Texas Christian University and in spite of encountering all kinds of resistance from those who didn’t think women could or should be pilots went to work as a pilot for American Airlines in 1976 one of the first three women the company hired as pilots.

Ten years later Bass became the first woman to serve as captain of an American Airlines commercial jet liner. Later that year she was captain of the first all-female flight crew in history.

“I didn’t set out to be a pioneer” Bass said. “I was just doing what I loved to do.”

Which was what Bass was doing on the morning of Sept. 11 2001.

“We were over the Mid-Atlantic when we received the first word of a plane striking the World Trade Center” she said. “And I think like most people in the aviation world I thought it had to be a light airplane they were talking about.

“Then we learned about the second plane and that was the first time we heard the words ‘terrorist attack’ and that the New York air space was closed” Bass said. “That didn’t impact us because our route didn’t go near New York. But when we learned that all U.S. air space was closed I knew we were going to be landing somewhere in Canada. I figured it would be some place like Montreal or Toronto.”

Then Bass received a most unusual transmission from air traffic control.

“We had just reached 50 degrees west longitude (which runs through the western edge of Greenland) when we were told ‘American Four-Niner you are ordered to land immediately at Gander’” Bass recalled. “Now airline captains don’t receive orders. Ultimately every decision is the responsibility of the captain. But this day was different.”

Bass said Gander was not an unknown destination. In years past it served as a fueling station for planes crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Today it is used primarily as a landing site for medical and technical emergencies.

American Airlines Flight 49 was the 36th of the 38 planes that ultimately “came from away” to Gander on Sept. 11. By the time the passengers on Bass’ trans-Atlantic flight were allowed to deplane they had spent 28 hours in the plane.

“We practically doubled the town’s population but the Canadian officials did everything they could to find lodging for everyone transport to those lodgings food everything” Bass said. “We ended up being there for five days before we were able to come home and as we were leaving I said to my crew ‘I want the whole world to know what we experienced here.’

“And that’s what this wonderful musical does” she said. “It’s giving people all over the world the chance to learn about this extraordinary time.”

Critics Say it’s Not ‘Carbon Neutral’,"When a British company decided two years ago to locate a wood pellet manufacturing plant in North Carolina’s Robeson County with its large Black and Indigenous population it came as no surprise to Shalonda Regan.

Regan lives in Lumberton two miles from where Active Energy Renewable Power has been working to convert a former textile mill into a plant that turns wood chips into pellets that the company says can be burned as a renewable fuel alongside coal or as a coal substitute.

“In my part of town I would say there is just a lack of knowledge when it comes to things that could possibly harm us or affect our health” said Regan a youth tutor and construction project manager who has joined a lawsuit against the company.

“Our literacy rate is pretty low. The poverty rate is high. It just felt like it was selected strategically” she said.

The company’s chief executive officer Micheal Rowan told residents in a recent opinion piece in The Robeson the local newspaper that “we intend to be a positive force in the community” by creating jobs and economic development.

Environmental justice and climate advocates see Lumberton as among the newest battlefields in an international fight over biomass fuels and global warming that has only grown more intense this year in the run-up to the Conference of the Parties (COP26) the United Nations-led climate negotiations next month in Glasgow.

The talks will be hosted by the United Kingdom a world leader in the environmentally controversial practice of burning biomass for electricity. The U.K. gets much of its biomass in the form of wood pellets from the Southeast as part of its declared pathway to a net-zero carbon emission future.

U.S. biomass advocates say that only 2 percent of the forests in the South are harvested every year leaving 98 percent in various stages of regrowth. Those new trees are more than enough to offset all the carbon dioxide that gets released when wood pellets are burned to produce electricity they say. And because forest land in the South is primarily privately owned they say the best way to make sure it remains forested is for landowners to make money from wood products instead of selling the land for development.

But the wood pellet industry in the Southeast has triggered an environmental justice backlash.

Environmentalists in the U.S. have been teaming up with their counterparts in the U.K. to pressure politicians to end lucrative subsidies to Drax a major British utility and wood pellet burner and producer that they see as a key driver of the booming wood pellet industry in the South.

As part of a “Cut Carbon Not Forests” campaign groups like the U.S.-based Southern Environmental Law Center the Natural Resources Defense Council and Dogwood Alliance are working with U.K.-based Biofuelwatch and others to try to short circuit that company’s plans to advance carbon capture and storage technology on power plants that burn the wood product.

The activists have also been working to change European Union and U.K. policies that treat burning biofuels as carbon neutral. Those policies they say harm biodiversity and lead to air pollution and flooding in communities of color where trees are cut down and pellets are produced.

Environmental advocates who work on biomass policy said they doubted that negotiators at COP would focus much on wood pellets or bioenergy specifically. Instead they said the official discussions will more likely relate to Article 6 provisions of the Paris agreement and the international trading of carbon credits as nations work toward their commitments to achieve carbon neutral economies by 2050.

Emissions trading allows climate polluters like oil companies and airlines to offset their carbon emissions by purchasing credits in green industries that emit less carbon dioxide or suck an equivalent amount out of the atmosphere like wind farms or forests.

Adam Colette program director for Dogwood Alliance a North Carolina-based forest conservation group that operates in the Southeastern United States sees a connection between the allowance of offsets and emissions trading in which the numbers often don’t add up and government policy that effectively considers the practice of burning wood pellets to make electricity as carbon neutral even though scientists have shown it can emit more greenhouse gases than burning coal.

“Wood pellets and the international wood pellet market is the most visceral example of everything that is wrong with that” he said.

At Least Theoretically Wood Pellets Can Be Carbon Neutral

Nobody disputes that trees can be a renewable resource that harvested trees or forests can regrow—and that at least theoretically burning wood can be carbon neutral. Carbon emissions that are released when wood is burned can be offset by the carbon dioxide that trees take up during the process of photosynthesis.

But hundreds of scientists around the world have been arguing that biofuels policies and practices are often far from climate friendly and that European subsidies propping up the industry are in fact dangerous. While the industry generally maintains that it only uses wood waste or low-value trees to make pellets critics have issued reports with photographs that they say show destructive logging practices and the conversion of entire trees to wood pellets.

The argument centers on how quickly new tree growth can absorb the carbon dioxide that’s emitted from power plants that burn wood pellets given an increasing sense of urgency over the speed with which global greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced to avoid the worst effects of global warming.

“Burning wood puts more carbon dioxide in the air right now today with certainty than the fossil fuels you were burning” John Sterman a professor of management and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told Inside Climate News. To solve the climate crisis he said “emissions from fossil fuels need to go down rapidly but it is equally important to keep the carbon in forests on the land.”

Sterman is among more than 500 scientists who earlier this year signed a letter to U.S. President Joe Biden European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen European Council President Charles Michel Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea warning about wood burning for electricity generation.

Bluntly the scientists including Peter Raven director emeritus of the Missouri Botanical Society and former President of the American Association for Advancement of Science wrote: “Trees are more valuable alive than dead both for climate and for biodiversity. To meet future net zero emission goals your governments should work to preserve and restore forests and not to burn them.”

The scientists maintain that subsidies have escalated tree harvesting for energy production at a rate that is creating a “carbon debt” that eventually might be paid back by regrowth—but not nearly fast enough. In 2018 Sterman was lead author of a scientific paper published in Environmental Research Letters that said the time frame was as long as 104 years depending on forest type.

“Regrowth takes time the world does not have” the scientists argued in their recent letter. Numerous studies they pointed out have shown that “this burning of wood will increase warming for decades to centuries. That is true even when the wood replaces coal oil or natural gas.”

In a report made public on Thursday the London-based think tank Chatham House and the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts formerly the Woods Hole Research Center concluded that U.S.-sourced wood pellets burned for energy in the U.K. were responsible for 13 million to 16 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions almost none of which are included in that country’s official greenhouse gas inventory. If they were this would have added between 22 and 27 percent to the emissions from U.K. electricity generation or 2.8 to 3.6 percent of total U.K. greenhouse gas emissions in 2019—roughly the same as the annual greenhouse gas emissions from as many as 7 million passenger vehicles according to the report.

The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission earlier this year acknowledged the biomass controversy describing it as “toxic” among scientists. In a report titled “The use of woody biomass for energy production in the EU” the research centre maintained that wood-based bioenergy has the potential to help the world’s climate and biodiversity crises. But the report also concluded that subsidies can “shift the balance towards undesirable outcomes” such as excessive wood burning. It recommended new sustainability legislation including sustainability criteria for imported wood pellets such as those from the United States.

U.K. Defends its Wood Pellet Subsidies

If world leaders aren’t going to get down in the weeds of biofuels energy policy at COP26 environmental advocates expect those discussions will occur outside the official meetings. Climate conferences typically attract a full range of observers including businesses industry representatives environmental advocates religious leaders and protesters all attempting to influence the public and public officials.

Environmental advocates in the United States and the United Kingdom for example are bracing for Drax the U.K. company that’s driving demand in the South for wood pellets to further push its plan for what’s called “bioenergy carbon capture and storage” often referred to in shorthand as BECCS as a way to achieve what the company calls “negative carbon emissions.”

BECCS would use technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions from a biomass power plant before they enter the atmosphere and store them underground.

A new report from the U.K.-based think tank Ember notes that per kilowatt hour burning wood pellets emits more carbon dioxide than burning coal helping to make Drax the U.K.’s largest single source of carbon dioxide emissions. Ember previously found that Drax received more than £800 million in subsidies last year and is on pace to receive £10 billion in subsidies between 2012 until 2027 when the financial support is to run out.

The environmental groups expect Drax to use the COP “as an opportunity to present (BECCS) and also to put more pressure on the government to do some further subsidies” said Almuth Ernsting co-director of the U.K.-based environmental advocacy group Biofuelwatch. “We are working with our allies to try to counter that spin.”

“What we are concerned about and what we really want to prevent” Ernsting said “is Drax from getting massively positive PR in the media portraying themselves as the pioneers of carbon negative energy because what they are doing in terms of burning huge quantities of wood which is anything but low carbon. And they do not have any real world experience or the know-how of capturing CO2 on a large scale.”

In fact the company which disputes claims by scientists that its wood-pellet burning is anything but carbon neutral acknowledges it’s touting BECCS in the run-up to COP 26. It is also openly making a case for subsidies by advocating for “an effective negative emissions policy and investment framework from government” to get the technology up and running on two of its biomass generating units by 2030.

In June after experimenting with two pilot programs the company announced an agreement with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Engineering Ltd. for carbon capture technology at what it described as “the largest deployment of negative emissions in power generation anywhere in the world.”

In the U.K. renewable energy sources account for 37 percent of its electricity generation with biofuels taking the largest share at 14 percent. In April it set a goal of cutting carbon emissions by 78 percent by 2035 compared to 1990 levels.

Drax is pitching BECCS as a way to help the U.K. meet its Paris agreement climate goals and has partnered with Bechtel to explore opportunities to build new BECCS plants internationally including in the U.S. and western Europe said Drax spokeswoman Ali Lewis in a written statement.

“The climate emergency means that it’s no longer enough to reduce emissions” Lewis said. “We need to take more urgent action to permanently remove CO2 from the atmosphere—making negative emissions from BECCS critical.”

The subsidies are providing the incentives needed to make decarbonization technologies economically feasible the company argues.

But in the United States the environmental group the Natural Resources Defense Council has been looking closely at Drax and its plans for carbon capture and storage and finds them lacking.

First operating the carbon capture and storage equipment at a power plant takes extra energy and NRDC estimates Drax would need to harvest and burn about 30 percent more wood to make the carbon capture equipment work impacting forests and local communities said Nathanael Greene a senior renewable energy researcher with NRDC.

In a study released Wednesday NRDC estimates that when all carbon releases are considered—from what escapes from forests during harvesting to carbon emissions associated with making wood pellets and shipping them overseas—a wood pellet plant with carbon capture is equivalent to 80 percent of the smokestack emissions of a typical coal fired power plant.

That’s less than a coal plant but not by much according to the analysis.

“The idea that this is what the U.K. might possibly think is a pathway to its 2050 goals is pretty alarming” he said.

This past summer the European Commission proposed changes to its Renewable Energy Directive that would increase the current E.U.-level target of having at least 32 percent renewable energy sources in the overall energy mix to having at least 40 percent by 2030. The plan which still needs approval from the European Parliament also includes stronger sustainability criteria for forest biomass. This includes banning the use of all biomass from primary and highly biodiverse forests and phasing out subsidies for burning forest biomass to produce electricity except in certain regions that have been particularly reliant on fossil fuels.

Mary S. Booth director of the Partnership for Policy Integrity a research organization and a principal critic of the biomass industry said she is skeptical of how much difference the proposed policy changes would make.

“It looks like a meaningful thing” she said. But the “fine print” creates “huge geographic carve outs.”

Beyond that she acknowledged that environmental advocates face a “grindingly slow” effort at making any changes in biomass policy. Eurpope has “put so much into this basket. It’s baked into so many of the climate models without a full accounting of carbon so the inertia just rolls on.”

A British government spokesman said the U.K. has no plans to end its wood pellet subsidies before they are set to expire in 2027 while doubling down on the country’s biofuels program.

“We are totally committed to eliminating our contribution to climate change by 2050 which is why we only support biomass which complies with strict sustainability criteria” the spokesman said in a written statement from the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy. “For biomass used in electricity generation these criteria consider a range of social economic and environmental issues including protecting biodiversity land use rights sustainable harvesting and regeneration rates.”

Wood Pellets: A Growth Industry Across the Southeast

Across the South the wood pellet industry has continued to grow often expanding into areas with higher than median poverty levels and populations that are predominantly nonwhite.

The Southern Environmental Law Center now counts 23 wood pellet plants in states from Louisiana to Texas with 11 more that are either seeking permits or have been issued permits.

“There was a huge expansion in 2019 and we’ve continued to see that expansion” said Heather Hillaker a staff attorney with the law center.

Corporate leadership of the Maryland-based Enviva a major supplier to Drax and a global leader in the production of wood pellets said on a quarterly earnings conference call in late July that they were expanding several of their plants in the Southeast U.S. and making plans to develop a new one in Bond Mississippi as demand for its product continues. The company has also announced new deals to send additional pellets to Japan and the Netherlands.

John Keppler Enviva chairman and chief executive officer said the proposed tightening of the European Commission’s biomass regulations are “generally” in line with Enviva’s practices. The commission he said also “continues to recognize the importance of sustainable biomass in meeting aggressive emissions reduction targets and the indispensable role biomass plays in mitigating climate change” according to a company transcript of the call.

Industry expansion often comes with the backing of state officials. In September for example a new Drax wood-pellet plant under development in Arkansas was praised by state officials there.

“The investment that Drax is making throughout Arkansas is proof that the state’s timber industry is poised for a bright future and is a great example of how a global economy works” Arkansas Secretary of Commerce Mike Preston said in a press release. In May Drax announced a $40 million investment in Arkansas for three new pellet plants.

But what often follows Hillaker said is excessive noise and air pollution.

“Unfortunately communities continue to experience a lot of negative impacts of living next to these facilities” she said. “It seems like these facilities really ramp up in the middle of the night or at least the noise seemingly ramps up in the middle of the night. And so that causes issues with sleep and then you have the pollution and the dust from the facilities that continue to cause problems.”

The industry seems to be growing the fastest in the Gulf Coast states as companies increasingly look to markets in Asia said Colette with Dogwood Alliance.

In North Carolina Active Energy’s market includes the United States according to the company’s CEO. The company did not respond to emailed requests for comment.

“We will make a product that will be used in North Carolina and around the country to reduce emissions and pollution” Rowan wrote in the local newspaper. “We hope our local community will be proud.”

But Active Energy is still working to secure a permit that will set limits on local pollution that comes from turning wood into black coal-like pellets a novel process for the region known to produce what are called “white pellets” which are made in part in wood burning kilns.

A permit review document with North Carolina regulators explains Active Energy will put wood chips in a pressure cooker which uses a “steam explosion” process to break down wood fibers into very small particles. The fibers are then densified in a pellet press producing a product that is designed to be harder and more water resistant than white pellets.

State regulators said they were awaiting more information from the company before they can issue an air quality permit.

In a related matter the Southern Environmental Law Center on behalf of the local Winyah Rivers Alliance has sued the company over claims of ongoing and unauthorized discharges of industrial wastewater at the wood pellet mill property in Lumberton which is contaminated with toxic solvents from prior industrial use.

Regan the Lumberton resident is a party in that lawsuit and said she would be happy if the British company were to abandon the pellet plant plans altogether.

But short of pulling out Regan said “my only ask is that the wood pellet plant just get into compliance and do the things required of them. Don’t try to cut any corners. Make sure people feel protected.”

That may be both a blessing and a curse for lawmakers because it’s now clear that the bill will need to shrink to pass. And like Congress Americans don’t all agree on which of its big-ticket items are most important.

But at least one thing seems clear from public surveys: People want to pay for the bill by taxing the rich.

A Vox and Data for Progress poll conducted October 8-12 found that 71 percent of voters support raising taxes on the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans to pay for the bill. Eighty-six percent of Democrats and 50 percent of Republicans backed the idea. Other tax provisions focused on the wealthy that could be included in the bill — such as tax increases on corporations and capital gains — found 65 percent or more support overall.

Sixty-three percent of voters in the poll said they supported the $3.5 trillion overall plan that includes spending on health care long-term care child care and clean-energy jobs.

It’s less clear which priorities voters most want to spend that money on. When asked to choose the most and least important parts of the Build Back Better Act’s many policies taxing the rich was most frequently cited as a top priority with 13 percent of respondents choosing the measure. (The poll surveyed 1224 likely voters and had a sampling margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.)

Expanding Medicare benefits to cover dental vision and hearing also showed strong support with 12 percent of respondents ranking it the highest priority and another 12 percent picked policies to increase access to long-term care for older adults and people with disabilities. Republicans were especially supportive of the provisions for health care and long-term care for older adults compared to Democrats who most frequently cited the tax increases and clean-energy measures as top priorities.

Democrats face tough choices in keeping a promise of “transformative” policies in the Build Back Better Act: Do programs need to be made permanent increasing their price tag? Should funding child care or prekindergarten win out over expanding Medicare benefits? How fast must the country move to cut fossil fuels and fight climate change?

This is Democrats’ first chance in years at crafting major legislation not directly tied to the pandemic — and given the electoral map’s skew toward Republicans it could be their last for another decade.

The popularity of the Build Back Better Act so far may or may not make it easier for lawmakers to get the bill over the finish line. In the Vox/Data for Progress poll voters were presented with arguments for and against removing a particular provision to reduce costs such as Medicare benefits expansion or clean-energy policy. Only about a third of voters or fewer supported the cuts. And respondents showed a diversity of opinion on what’s most important in the bill.

That likely reflects the fact that Democrats’ big bill touches on important issues for people at various stages of life said Ethan Winter a senior analyst for Data for Progress.

Winter noted that a policy like free prekindergarten would be especially favored by a young parent while expanding Medicare benefits appeals more to older adults — who make up a larger swath of the electorate. The somewhat stronger support for tax increases on the wealthy and spending on care for older adults suggests those ideas are a core appeal of Democratic politics for both the party’s base and swing voters.

“People elect Democrats because they will raise taxes on the rich to do modest economic redistribution and [policies] for seniors are always very popular” Winter said.

Polls have shown solid majority support for most pieces of the bill as standalone policies. (The child tax credit expansion has seen majority approval but seems to fare worse in polling when voters are explicitly asked about making the expansion permanent.)

The bill’s popularity could shift as Americans learn more about it and are exposed to partisan messaging; an October CBS News poll found that few Americans say they know much about what’s in the bill and only a third think it will affect them directly despite many provisions focused on helping middle- and lower-income families.

And there’s a potential warning sign for Democrats in a new Gallup poll: In a September survey 52 percent of voters said the government is doing too many things that should be left to individuals and businesses — basically returning to the average level surveyed in the past decade. In 2020 as the pandemic pummeled Americans and the economy 54 percent of voters said they wanted the government to do more.

On climate issues 57 percent of voters in the Vox/Data for Progress poll said tax credits for electric cars in the Build Back Better plan would make them more likely to purchase one.

Sixty-three percent of voters expressed support for the clean electricity program a key component of the bill’s climate crisis strategy that now appears in danger of being scrapped or significantly cut back. When asked about removing this provision of the bill after hearing arguments for and against government intervention in the energy industry 53 percent of voters wanted to keep the clean electricity plan and 36 percent wanted to remove it.

Democrats’ bill is popular. So why are they shrinking it?

Americans largely seem to like the Build Back Better Act. Most don’t seem fazed by the $3.5 trillion price tag. The strong support for tax increases on the rich — after big tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations under President Donald Trump — suggests skeptical centrist Democrats may have other concerns in backing cuts to the bill.

The precariousness of the bill largely comes down to Democrats’ very thin majorities in the House and Senate. That gives Joe Manchin a senator from a Trump-voting coal state the power to dictate demands on climate provisions as well as the overall size of the bill.

It also means another centrist senator Kyrsten Sinema is a key figure in the negotiations even though it’s not totally clear what she wants in the bill — and she left this week for Europe on a fundraising tour. (While Manchin’s approval in his home state of West Virginia has remained fairly steady overall Sinema’s resistance to the legislation has caused her approval rating to plummet among Democrats and prompt stirrings of a primary challenge in Arizona a state more evenly split between Republicans and Democrats.)

Manchin Sinema and other moderate Democrats have sometimes appeared at odds with each other on tax increases and how to pay for the bill making things even more complicated.

At New York magazine Eric Levitz chalks pushback by some House Democrats up to America’s skewed representation in Congress and the decline of labor as a lobbying force. Plus perhaps old-fashioned stubbornness: Many Democrats in Congress came of political age in the era of Bill Clinton deficit reduction and welfare reform. “I think that’s why we can’t have ($3.5 trillion worth of) nice things: Labor is weak Congress is malapportioned and some old rich Democrats have annoying beliefs” Levitz wrote.

No matter what happens with the Build Back Better Act it won’t end debates around what pursuing popular policies really means. Even if the final bill is embraced by the public it might not lead Democrats to electoral victory either.

But if Democrats are just looking for legislation that most Americans want taxing the rich to pay for policies that help families seniors and the planet seems like a safe bet so far.

The desert had superb weather a great golf course for the tournament knowledgeable golf fans and the overall appeal of a destination resort for visitors.

But the LPGA will move its tournament now the Chevron Championship after 2022 convinced that trying to stay in the desert is no longer the best option.

“This partnership (with Chevron) will be a game-changer for the LPGA in so many ways” said Mollie Marcoux Samaan who took over as commissioner of the LPGA this summer. “It will allow us to elevate this major championship to new heights.”

The LPGA’s exit from the desert after next April will leave the Coachella Valley once awash in professional golf events in the 1990s and 2000s with just one regularly scheduled event from one of golf’s major professional tours the PGA Tour’s The American Express played each January in La Quinta.

But the Coachella Valley billed as the winter golf capital of the world for decades and now home to 120 courses hasn’t lost its appeal to the professional game a top official of the PGA Tour said.

“The short answer from our end as it relates to The American Express is we absolutely believe the Coachella Valley is the perfect place to have that event” said Tyler Dennis executive vice president of the PGA Tour and president of the division that runs day-to-day operation of the men’s tour. “If you look a bit deeper at it the tournament has really been part of the heart of the tour for a very very long time.”

In announcing the Chevron move to the Houston area – the tournament will be played at Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage one last time in April – Marcoux Samaan admitted walking away from five decades of history and tradition in the Coachella Valley is a difficult decision for her and her players.

“For the players tradition is important and being a part of something bigger than yourself is what the LPGA has been about for 71 years” Marcoux Samaan said. “That's something I know personally I always look forward to. Yes people have brought that up but again I think (we are) recognizing that we are moving into new heights here for the LPGA for women's sports for women's leadership for this tremendous partnership with such an amazing company.”

In recent years the LPGA major in the desert had faced numerous issues many to do with sponsorship. All Nippon Airways title sponsor since 2015 asked to leave the event before 2022 the final year of its sponsorship deal as its airline business suffered heavy financial losses from the COVID-19 pandemic. Finding another sponsor who wanted to keep the event in the desert and still use the tournament for hospitality and marketing was difficult a past tournament director said.

“A sponsor that wants to use a platform like this across their employee base across their provider base impact their community from a charitable aspect that’s the difficulty they face if they are not based here” said Gabe Codding tournament director of the LPGA event from 2008 to 2017 and now director of communications for the city of Rancho Mirage. “Everything has to be imported. All their customers all of the employees all of their guests everything.”

Lack of a corporate base in the desert

Not having a large corporate base in the Coachella Valley also can cause sponsors to look elsewhere for an event Codding added.

“For an event to really stay with the times they really need that support that community business support to where not everything falls on the shoulder of the title sponsor or a couple of presenting sponsors"" Codding said. ""It is getting too much for one person or one sponsor to be able to take on the whole thing.”

Part of the demands on a sponsor is money. The year Kraft left as sponsor of the LPGA event in the desert n 2014 the purse for the event was $2 million. The purse last April under ANA was $3.1 million but Chevron will increase that purse to $5 million. While each tournament is different sponsors generally contribute about twice the purse size or a bit more to sponsor an event. The American Express purse on the PGA Tour last January was $6.7 million.

Dennis said the size of a market or the proximately of a sponsor to the tournament’s city shouldn’t dictate the success of an event.

“If you look at the PGA Tour schedule we’ve got all kinds of different markets actually small medium large” Dennis said. “Every tournament’s kind of got its own flavor. The key pillars to it all to be successful you’ve got to have a great title sponsor that has a clear vision and we certainly have that in American Express. It is one of the great companies and they have a very clear vision of what they want the tournament to be. You’ve got to have a great community support and there is no better place for golf than the Coachella Valley.”

Smaller markets such as in Monterey with the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and in Silvis Ill. with the John Deere Classic show the Coachella Valley isn’t too small for a big sports event Dennis said.

“So we are really bullish on the Coachella Valley for The American Express. It is a great time of year for the community. So like I say we think the trajectory is fantastic right now” he said.

That doesn’t mean the PGA Tour event hasn’t faced its own sponsorship issues in the Coachella Valley.

Long-time title sponsor Chrysler left after 2008 when the car manufacturer was accepting federal bailout money during a deep financial recession. The tournament then was played without a sponsor -- or the millions of dollars a sponsor brings -- for three years.

Since then with the tour having a partnership with the Clinton Foundation as well healthcare company Humana and employment company CareerBuilder have sponsored the tournament. The event again played without a sponsor in 2019 though CareerBuilder funded the tournament fully. American Express took over the title in 2020.

The LPGA major also faced issues that had nothing to do with the support of the Coachella Valley. Competition from the men’s Masters tournament in Augusta Ga. including a women’s amateur tournament at the Augusta National course the same week as the desert major took media and fan attention away from the LPGA event. The LPGA and tournament operator International Management Group were unable to negotiate different dates with Mission Hills Country Club.

“There's just an awful lot to consider” Ed McEnroe senior vice president of IMG said of the move. “I mean obviously first and foremost it's got to be a major championship-caliber golf course and you look at things like weather windows player travel flow network dates competitive landscape both as it relates to T.V. and the local host community. As you know Augusta National Women's Amateur has been the same weekend as our championship weekend. We know these two incredible incredible events for women in sport deserve their own stage.”

While the LPGA major and The American Express have remained mainstays of professional sports in the desert for decades Dennis said the loss of the numerous golf tournaments in the Coachella Valley dating back to the 1990s some unofficial events but all televised nationally shouldn’t diminish the desert as a vibrant spot for pro golf.

“There are not too many places in the world you can play golf in November December January February” Dennis said. “So when ideas come up things happen there is a reason the valley always pops up on radar screens. Because it’s perfect you know it is just something of a meteorological point of view.”

Dennis added that many of those 1990s events from tournaments like The Diners Club Matches that lasted four years in the desert to the Skins Game that was played from 1986 to 2008 on six different desert courses were often events used by organizers to help real estate sales at new courses and were never intended to last more than a few years.

Such events have all but disappeared across the country as the PGA Tour has added more and more official events as part of its FedEx Cup season-long points series. Official PGA Tour events now run from the first week of January to the week before Thanksgiving.

Dennis said just offering golf is no longer enough for events. The American Express is like many events on the PGA Tour or LPGA in offering other amenities during tournament week including after-play concerts. That was something the LPGA event in the desert never included. In 2020 The American Express had concerts from rock singer Stevie Nicks and country artist Luke Bryan with the event selling around 20000 tickets at $50 apiece good for golf and the concert each day.

American Express tournament director Pat McCabe says that after not having concerts or fans last January because of COVID-19 restriction two nights of concerts will return in 2022.

“There is an opportunity to touch a whole other segment of folks who like golf are aware of golf casually watch it on television may or may not be interested in coming to the tournament” Dennis said. “With the concerts a lot of tournaments have done this for a very sort of nominal cost if you will you are enjoying a day at the tournament getting to see what the PGA Tour is all about and you get a concert.”

The same is true for the BNP Paribas Open the two-week tennis event played this month in Indian Wells but normally played in March. BNP Paribas is a French-based financial institution but is a big sponsor of tennis including being the title sponsor of the Indian Wells event since 2009. Live music in the evening high-end restaurants and outdoor seating areas with large viewing screens are designed to make the on-site visit to the Indian Wells Tennis Garden an experience rather than just a day watching tennis.

“Our roots are here in the Coachella Valley players and fans absolutely love Indian Wells and we are thankful for the support of this community said Phillipe Dore marketing director for the BNP Paribas Open in a statement. “Our focus remains on making the BNP Paribas Open and the Indian Wells Tennis Garden the best tournament and venue in the world and having a deep and positive impact on the region.”

With the prospect of no sponsor in 2022 a continued conflict with Augusta National events and no network television Marcoux Samaan said the LPGA is making the right choice in leaving the desert.

“We have talked (through the departure) and again overall the response has been extremely positive” Marcoux Samaan said. “I think people know that this is an opportunity for us to sustain this major moving into the future build new traditions still honor the past and honor the great work that's been done.”

While he couldn’t talk about the specifics of the LPGA's move out of the desert Dennis said nothing about the Coachella Valley its weather and its golf courses should stop tournament organizers from strongly thinking about the desert as a home.

“You just never know"" Dennis said. ""I’ve been with the tour for 21 years and you just never know what will happen next.""

As for Shaquille O’Neal and Alonzo Mourning? Well Shaq used to liken his dynamic with Zo to Russell and the Big Dipper.

O’Neal and Mourning went 1-2 in the 1992 NBA Draft. The two centers felt an intrinsic drive to be better and traded petty insults for years. But a scary health diagnosis changed things between the rivals-turned-teammates.

Shaquille O’Neal and Alonzo Mourning had similar drives that sparked the rivalry

Shaquille O’Neal and Alonzo Mourning actually shared several similarities before making the jump to the NBA.

Shaq has been candid about his admiration for fellow Hall of Fame center Patrick Ewing through the years. Meanwhile Mourning tried to follow in Ewing’s and Dikembe Mutombo’s footsteps as the next great center at Georgetown University.

Both guys were dominant forces in college. O’Neal averaged 27.6 points 14.7 rebounds and 5.0 blocks when he was a sophomore. That season came to epitomize the immovable object-type player he’d be in the NBA. Mourning put up equally dazzling numbers with the Hoyas particularly in his senior year. Zo averaged 21.3 points 10.7 boards and 5.0 blocks. He appeared to give Shaq a run for his money in terms of being the No. 1 pick.

The Diesel ultimately earned that distinction with Mourning going second to the Charlotte Hornets. The draft order set the tone for years of pettiness. In fact O’Neal might have lit the match for the rivalry by citing play styles to compare himself and Mourning to Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell respectively.

Shaq compared his offensive dominance to Wilt Chamberlain while Mourning’s defensive presence was reminiscent of Bill Russell

Shaq and Zo were tied together as the top two picks in the 1992 draft and when asked to compare himself to his fellow draftee O’Neal brought up one of the most notable rivalries in NBA history.

The Diesel had a quote in an NBA video entitled NBA Legacy Living Legends to Rising Stars (h/t the South Florida Sun-Sentinel) in which he likened his game to Wilt the Stilt. Mourning Shaq said had Bill Russell tendencies as a defensive-oriented force.

“I think I’m sort of like Wilt Chamberlain. Scorer real strong dominant. I would consider Bill Russell to Alonzo Mourning. Strong around the basket defensive player.” –Shaquille O’Neal via the South Florida Sun-Sentinel

Being compared to Bill Russell is an honor for any center. But Mourning might have felt a bit slighted by Shaq’s perception of him as a “defensive player” even if he was a two-time Defensive Player of the Year.

Mourning once said Shaq wouldn’t be as effective if he were Zo’s size and criticized O’Neal’s apparent lack of creativity on the block. The Diesel responded by saying Mourning only ever deployed a jump hook.

More pettiness arose between the two stars. Shaq brought up a bunch of their contrasting endorsement partnerships — such as O’Neal initially being with Reebok and Mourning signing with Nike — as a means of pushing the rivalry.

On the floor though there wasn’t much of a rivalry. Shaq went 13-3 against Mourning in his career during the regular season. He averaged 30.4 points 12.4 rebounds 3.1 assists and 3.0 blocks while shooting close to 57% from the field. Mourning averaged a respectable 21.1 points 9.2 rebounds and 2.0 blocks in head-to-head matchups but he shot just under 44% from the field.

O’Neal always seemed to have a leg up in his feud with Mourning. But a scary health diagnosis and Shaq’s move to Miami led to a lasting friendship.

The Diesel put the rivalry aside following Mourning’s near-fatal kidney illness and teamed up with Zo to win a title

Alonzo Mourning was still in the prime of his career when he suddenly found himself fighting for his life.

Zo had been diagnosed with kidney disease in 2000 but still played 75 games during the 2000-01 season. Things worsened over the next couple of years. Doctors told him in November of 2003 that his life would be in danger if he continued to play basketball and that he needed a transplant per ESPN.

Mourning’s career was seemingly over. But he made a remarkable recovery after receiving a transplant and joined the Heat in 2005 about 20 months after Shaq was traded from Los Angeles to Miami. O’Neal said (h/t South Florida Sun-Sentinel) when Zo came back to South Beach that the rivalry was all superficial and expressed his respect for Mourning.

“All that other stuff is sort of like a fairytale world we live in. When it comes to a life-and-death situation it doesn’t matter.” –Shaquille O’Neal via the South Florida Sun-Sentinel

The newfound admiration between the two benefited the Heat on the floor as well.

With veterans like Shaq and Mourning in addition to a young Dwyane Wade Miami won the NBA title during the 2005-06 campaign. Although Mourning was more of a reserve center at this stage of his career he played his role to perfection. Bill Russell surely would have been proud as Zo averaged a whopping 2.7 blocks despite playing just 20 minutes per contest. Meanwhile O’Neal remained a strong interior force averaging 20.0 points and 9.2 rebounds.

That championship only served to strengthen the bond between Zo and Shaq who remain close to this day — Mourning even served as one of O’Neal’s presenters when he entered the Hall of Fame in 2016.

The rivalry between the two legendary centers began with an audacious comparison. But it blossomed into a beautiful friendship.

View the current offers here.

Only 100 miles separate Fort Lauderdale from Naples a city perched on the Gulf of Mexico in southwest Florida. Yet once you reach ""the west coast"" (how we South Floridians affectionately refer to Florida's Gulf Coast) you'll find a much slower pace than the pulsating metropolitan vibe of South Florida.

Once the snowbird haven of Midwesterners Naples has expanded its appeal to include families and couples looking for a relaxing getaway.

And as the ""unofficial"" end of summer arrived with Labor Day I was looking forward to one final escape across Alligator Alley to Naples before cooler weather prevailed (yes even in Florida) and my life reverted to biweekly soccer practices homework assignments and the daily work grind.

Drawbacks

(Photo by Juan Ruiz/The Points Guy.)

You'll need a car to go anywhere else. The hotel location is not within walking distance to any offsite restaurants or shops.

The Ritz-Carlton brand lacks special perks or benefits for Marriott Bonvoy's elite members.

As with most Ritz-Carlton properties be prepared for sticker shock.

The hotel's interior lodge-style decor could use an update – but I suppose the classic luxury look could be a draw for some guests.

The 295-room property only has one pool and it's on the smaller side.

The vibe

The sprawling Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort Naples has Mediterranean-style aesthetics — think textured walls stone and wood finishes vibrant textiles and rustic furnishings — which gives it a high-end feel that is suitable for being home to two PGA-level golf courses. Families with small children can be seen in abundance thanks in large part to the waterpark poolscape but the resort equally caters to couples looking for a respite with its laid-back vibe.

Even at full capacity during a holiday weekend the ambiance remained tranquil but also had a sense of activity — an optimal and difficult balance for a busy resort.

The room

You can expect decent-sized rooms measuring 470 square feet and suite sizes starting at 750 square feet. Though the rooms could use some updating they still convey a feeling of old-time glamour with white-marble tiled bathrooms and earth tones that blend well with the resort's tropical motif. Rooms come equipped with a king or two double beds and all feature a personal balcony with seating for two overlooking the resort grounds or a perfectly manicured golf course.

Well-lit marble bathrooms feature a separate bathtub and shower double sink and single-use PAYA hotel toiletries. In-room amenities include complimentary bottles of water Nespresso coffeemakers well-stocked minibars and 55-inch LCD TVs with premium movie channels. All Marriott Bonvoy members receive complimentary in-room Wi-Fi.

Food and drink

The resort has two onsite standalone restaurants Lemonia and RÍA. Lemonia serves daily breakfast and contemporary American cuisine for dinner. RÍA is a newly-added lunch and dinner spot serving a variety of dishes such as Peruvian lomo saltado and other classic Latin American delicacies in a modish yet low-key outdoor setting. If you're the on-the-go type or need a quick fix the resort's Express(o) cafe offers caffeinated beverages and pastries while the Bella Vista Lounge overlooking the 18th hole of Tiburón Golf is the ideal spot for relaxing with a glass of wine or champagne before or after dinner. If you're by the pool and don't want to abandon your sunbathing you can also order lunch right from your pool chair.

At check-in I was offered access to the Club Lounge an exclusive lounge on the second floor offering delectable light snacks a complimentary selection of adult beverages and an excellent morning breakfast. Daily Club Lounge rates are $225 for non-elite Bonvoy members or $175 for Bonvoy elite members (Gold and up) and include internet access and valet parking.

I was admittedly hesitant at first but when I considered breakfast snacks and drinks for a family of four I figured I'd likely save a considerable amount of money over paying à la carte prices. I opted to add lounge access for one day and breakfast for two mornings (think hot stations with bacon scrambled eggs and pancakes and cold options such as smoked salmon charcuterie fruits and pastries) and it was well worth the daily rate.

Amenities and service

True to its name the Ritz Carlton Golf Resort Naples features two Greg Norman-designed PGA-level golf courses. If you don't fancy playing 18 holes you and your family can borrow complimentary golf clubs and golf balls from the hotel's concierge desk and hit the putting green in front of the Bella Vista patio.

Younger children can frolic at the interactive children's splash pool while older children and adults can zoom down waterslides to their heart's content at The Reservoir the property's new riveting waterpark experience.

Additional features include a heated pool with a sundeck indoor playground an entertainment room for kids and hydro clay tennis courts with one-hour complimentary court time and racquet rental included with the resort fee. The onsite spa offers massage and facial treatments while the fitness center has Peloton bikes and a copious amount of cardio and strength-training equipment.

At the Ritz the mission is its guests' genuine care and comfort and it shows. Each time a hotel employee walked by my daughters there was always a reminder about a kid-friendly activity occurring or the tasty treats being passed out soon. This personalized approach to service was recognizable immediately upon arrival when the front-desk employee introduced me by name to the bellhop who would assist us with our luggage – and that pursuit of service excellence was noticeable until the moment we checked out.

Out and about

The beach is only a few minutes away by car. Still you'd be hard-pressed to pull your kids (or even yourself) away from the onsite waterpark with three waterslides and 600-foot mellow and meandering lazy river divine for a leisurely float on a hot Florida day. This is the type of resort where you want to stay on property and enjoy a day out on the golf course by the pool or racing down one of the exhilarating waterslides.

The only time we left the grounds was to have dinner at the resort's beachfront sister property The Ritz-Carlton Naples and get a glimpse of the sunset from its outdoor seaside restaurant Gumbo Limbo. Guests staying at either resort are offered complimentary shuttle service between the properties which are approximately four miles apart. So whether you have a rental car or are mostly staying put you can enjoy the amenities and restaurants at both.

Bottom line

(Photo by Juan Ruiz/The Points Guy.)

Top-notch service an upscale vibe patently family-friendly staff and facilities and an array of exciting activities for your whole group make The Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort Naples a notable option in southwest Florida for your next getaway.

That said if you're coming to Florida seeking oceanfront access steps from your Ritz-Carlton room you may want to instead pick sister property The Ritz-Carlton Naples located on one of Florida's most spectacular beaches."

What Was Really Going On?,"Then in 2008 — as the country began tipping fully into the Great Recession — an investor in his early 20s from Miami named Chaim Schochet showed up. Working on behalf of a firm called Optima International Schochet offered $16.75 million for the empty building. A far cry from the Motorola investment but more than locals could have hoped for. They happily accepted. Glimmers of potential sprang once more. “Hope burns eternal” Roger Lehmann a member of the Harvard Economic Development Corporation said after the purchase.

At the time there was no reason to think Schochet and his colleagues were anything but savvy businesspeople snapping up properties across the Midwest. Optima International was a parent company to a constellation of related firms (including one called “Optima Harvard Facility LLC”). Prosecutors would later dub this the “Optima Family” with its American operations overseen by two Americans named Mordechai Korf (Schochet’s brother-in-law) and Uri Laber. As the Justice Department alleged in a series of civil forfeiture cases this “Optima Family” plowed hundreds of millions of dollars into investments in state after state: commercial real estate in Cleveland and Dallas and Louisville steel factories in West Virginia and Kentucky and Ohio production plants in Michigan and New York and Indiana. Time and again these investors swooped in pledging jobs revitalization and a lifeline for towns watching their economic lifebloods dry up.

In just a few years the “Optima Family” collected over a dozen mills plants and other facilities across the American heartland. All of them had fallen victim to America’s yearslong manufacturing slump part of the broader deindustrialization that began in the 1970s. All of them were eager for any injection of financing they could get and for any promise of a brighter future. And according to prosecutors these purchases were all directly connected to a powerful steel and banking tycoon in Ukraine who was buying American properties to hide stolen money.

Shortly after Ukraine’s 2014 revolution investigators in the country alleged that Ihor Kolomoisky was secretly overseeing one of the greatest Ponzi schemes the world had ever seen totaling at least $5.5 billion. Legal filings from American prosecutors last year detailed how Kolomoisky allegedly used his control of Ukraine’s largest retail bank PrivatBank to loot staggering sums from Ukrainian depositors and then used a series of shell companies and offshore accounts to whisk the money out of the country and into the U.S.

The idea seems to have been to purchase troubled assets that American sellers were eager to offload. Even if the buyers ultimately took a loss the assets were still outside the grasp of Ukrainian investigators and could still act as vehicles through which to funnel money. Perhaps most importantly the properties could be bought without much inquiry into the source of the monies: For two decades American real-estate professionals have benefited from a “temporary” exemption to anti-money laundering laws allowing them to avoid performing due diligence on the customer making the purchase.

In subsequent efforts to seize the operation’s assets American prosecutors laid out a theory that much of Kolomoisky’s operation was overseen by Laber and Korf who “created a web of entities usually under some variation of the name ‘Optima’ to further launder the misappropriated funds and invest them” across multiple states. According to the DOJ the funds lifted from PrivatBank bounced through a number of shell companies and offshore accounts before being injected into the Optima network and from there into assets around the American Midwest. And all of this took place while Kolomoisky — now sanctioned by the U.S. for what the State Department calls “significant corruption” and “ongoing efforts to undermine Ukraine’s democratic processes” — grew his power and wealth within Ukraine itself creating a gargantuan private militia and reportedly manipulating elected officials along the way.

The details gathered by U.S. and Ukrainian investigators and laid out in DOJ filings and court cases around the world from Delaware to the UK to Israel comprise what one analyst said might be “the biggest case of money laundering in history.”

Kolomoisky says he bought the American properties with his own money denying the Justice Department’s allegations about laundering ill-gotten funds. Neither he nor his American associates (who also deny wrongdoing) have been named in any criminal complaints. Reached for comment prior to publication of this article an attorney for Korf and Laber responded “Mr. Korf and Mr. Laber have never engaged in money laundering of any kind and they have no knowledge of anyone else doing so. Any allegations against Mr. Korf and Mr. Laber arise from Ukrainian political disputes they have nothing to do with.” Kolomoisky and Schochet the Miami investor did not respond to a request for comment.

Schochet has not been targeted by name in the government filings and the government has not suggested he is personally a target of their investigations. But the DOJ complaint notes that the Harvard plant purchase was part of the sprawling Optima laundering scheme (including fraudulent loans used to purchase the plant in the first place). The investigators describe how using investments in steel mills skyscrapers and industrial plants across the Midwest and Rust Belt Kolomoisky could take full advantage of America’s permissive climate for money laundering — all apparently to help clean the proceeds of his massive Ukrainian Ponzi scheme.

After Schochet finalized the purchase in Harvard locals say they saw little of him. “Chaim wasn’t around much” Charlie Eldredge head of the Harvard Economic Development corporation told me. “I would see him once a year once every other year…. Clearly it wasn’t the focus of their interest.” He added that it quickly became clear the Optima network “didn’t really have any real plans [about] what to do with the facility.”

More than five years after the purchase no jobs had returned and no further investments emerged. Unpaid property taxes kept accumulating starving the strapped local government of hundreds of thousands of dollars. In 2016 Optima sold the building at a $7 million loss to a Chinese Canadian businessperson. Years of neglect by various owners began to take a toll: Soon the factory went dark entirely. With a half-million-dollar tab in unpaid electricity bills the juice was cut off forcing local officials to visit with flashlights. “It’s just heartbreaking to see that beautiful place sitting vacant” the McHenry County treasurer said in 2018.

Along the way the massive building itself — its factory and fitness center its child care rooms and 500-seat auditorium even its pair of heliports — continued a slow march toward implosion. Mold began creeping along the walls and roof into the pipes into the recesses of the building. The factory’s entire fire suppressant system including over 20000 sprinkler heads began falling apart. “The mechanical [equipment] all needs to be replaced” Mayor Michael Kelly said. “The roof leaks. No one’s really taking care of it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIxLzEwLzE3L2hhaXRpLWtpZG5hcHBpbmctNDAwLW1hd296by1jaHJpc3RpYW4tYWlkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who is 400 Mawozo the Haitian gang accused of kidnapping American missionaries?,"News that an armed Haitian gang kidnapped 17 members of an Ohio-based missionary group — including five children — on Oct. 16 placed Haiti at the center of an international crisis .

Very briefly triumphant. “I sat down and of course I went to plug my phone in and it didn’t work” said Sosin a reporter for the news organization the 19th. That led to a frustrated tweet — “80% of the power outlets at airports are lies” — and plenty of commiseration.

“This has like forever been the case” they said in an interview. “Power outlets have never worked in airports. They’re just lies.”

As long as there have been personal electronic devices in need of electricity travelers have lamented a lack of places to charge them. The problem experts say: Airports are generally old and gadgets are fairly new. The average airport is more than 40 years old said Scott Elmore spokesman for Airports Council International – North America.

“Most airports were built before 9/11 so they weren’t built for TSA checkpoints” he said in an email. “And of course they were built before there were cellphones.”

The New York Times ran a story in 2006 headlined “The Socket Seekers” that described efforts of airports in Atlanta Chattanooga Tenn. Anchorage and other cities to add plug-in capability.

“Travelers are usually reluctant to complain about the scarcity of outlets” the story said. “That is because they are unsure if they are allowed to use the sockets which sometimes appear to be there for the exclusive use of airlines and cleaning crews.”

How times have changed.

Social media is crowded with complaints from passengers who can’t find a free outlet or one that works. They direct ire at fellow travelers who hog power “some gross dude’s legs” they had to reach through to get to an outlet and airport architects whom they accuse of orchestrating some sort of millennial blood-sport.

Recent years have brought new annoyances including gag stickers that offer the false promise of electricity. One available online boasts that it is an “easy trick to kill time on a long layover.”

Authorities in Los Angeles warned of a ploy involving public USB charging stations in airports and other locations in late 2019 that they referred to as “juice jacking” in which scammers could steal information by setting up fake power sources.

Late 2019 turned into early 2020 and travelers suddenly had a pandemic to worry about instead of power outlets. But as passengers have returned to the skies they have discovered the old problem — now with the added wrinkle of trying to maintain distance from everyone else.

Harriet Baskas who writes about airports on the blog Stuck at The Airport and elsewhere said she encountered power problems often in the pre-covid times.

“I have had the experience of finally finding an empty chair by a power plug unpacking all my gear plugging in my computer and happily tapping away until looking down to realize the power plug isn’t working” she wrote in an email.

She and other travel pros have hacks to avoid the frustration: settling into a lounge if possible bringing a portable charger or toting a travel surge protector with multiple outlets.

“Not one has ever said no when I ask to plug in since they can plug in too” longtime aviation journalist Benét J. Wilson a senior editor at the Points Guy said in an email. She wrote a guide to airport power outlets that was last updated in 2019.

Despite the complaints airports have been improving — one upgrade at a time — which means travelers’ experiences could depend on which terminal they end up in.

Pittsburgh International Airport which broke ground this week on a massive new terminal is adding more outlets. Philadelphia International Airport where finding outlets is “consistently a top priority amenity” for passengers has added some in past upgrades and “is actively working on plans to increase access to power outlets” spokeswoman Heather Redfern said in an email. And LAX — the subject of Sosin’s tweet — recently added 300 more places to plug in spokesman Heath Montgomery said.

Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport even bragged on Twitter in June about the abundance of outlets in a new area in Concourse A.

“We know there’s no such thing as too many charging outlets” the tweet said.

Or as Wilson put it: “Even as airports try to add more it’s always never enough.”

Phones have an airplane mode. This is useless except when you want to charge the phone a little quicker. What we need is an AIRPORT mode. Which will take you to the nearest available power outlet — Hari Balakrishnan (@HariBalakrish20) September 5 2019

Alexandria Va. resident Nicole Mathis said in a Twitter message that she chooses to drive the extra miles to Baltimore rather than fly from Reagan National Airport when possible because she knows there will be better amenities including power in the terminal.

“I applaud airports opening up new terminals with shiny new amenities” she wrote. “But they mustn’t overlook updating the old terminals.”

Mathis said she doesn’t want to have to worry about her phone running out of power before a flight. And while she has seen some people sit on the floor to charge up that is not ideal either.

“What grown adult would choose to sit on an airport floor if they didn’t have to?” she wrote. “Yet faced between a dirty floor and 20% battery remaining before a 5-hour flight I can’t think of a soul who wouldn’t cop a squat immediately. ”

Elmore said his group’s last survey on airport amenities — conducted in late 2019 and early 2020 — showed 70 airports offering free charging outlets for passengers up from 59 in 2017. Most outlets are built into seats or tables which he called “a major infrastructure challenge.” A study released earlier this year he said shows airports have infrastructure needs of more than $115 billion.

“It’s not as simple as just running a new outlet” he said in his email. “You have to meet electrical standards and lay incredible configurations of power and circuitry.”

Ty Osbaughwho leads the aviation practice at architecture and design firm Gensler said airports are looking at a variety of solutions for how much power they have coming into the building and the best ways to distribute it.

When he started working on terminals he said the plan for power was “you put a few plugs here and a few plugs there in the gate areas and that was probably sufficient. It was mostly maintenance.”

Share this article Share

For a project his firm is working on for Newark Liberty International Airport he said the requirement is that every seat has access to power.

“It’s now a mandate” he said.

Osbaugh said that after a pandemic-forced pause in big growth projects he expects airports to spend the next few years making “fundamental foundational upgrades” to prepare for future growth.

But as much as airports do to improve the power situation Osbaugh said he expects the needs to evolve.",,,,,,

Kevin Lavallee CEO of TK Elevators’ North American operations stands at the top of the company’s new elevator testing facility Wednesday Oct. 13 2021 that towers over the Atlanta Braves stadium and surrounding skyscrapers northwest of Atlanta.

One of the world’s largest elevator towers will soon be opened to test elevators of the future as well as current ones high above the Atlanta suburbs.

TK Elevators’ 420-foot (128 meters) tower is set to become fully operational early next year company executives said this week on a tour of the new research lab and elevator testing facility.

“This is going to transform our industry” said Kevin Lavelle CEO of the company’s North American operations.

It’s the largest elevator test tower in the Western Hemisphere according to the company and general contractor Brasfield & Gorrie which built it.

The tower with its multiple elevator testing shafts looks down into the nearby Atlanta Braves’ stadium and offers stunning views of the Atlanta skyline. It’s next door to the company’s new North American headquarters in Cobb County just northwest of the city.

Construction on the tower began in 2019 with 3000 tons of steel and the structure is now in place with interior work still ongoing as TKE prepares to fully open it in February.

Among concepts being tested in the high-rise: twin elevators which use the same elevator shaft but operate independently with one car above the other Lavelle said. Twin elevators save space and are able to carry passengers more efficiently he said.

An environmental chamber will be able to test how elevators operate in extreme environments such as the arctic cold in Canada and searing heat of other parts of the world said Steve Allen vice president of engineering.

TK Elevators once part of the German firm ThyssenKrupp was sold last year and became a separate company. It chose Atlanta for its North American headquarters partly because of the engineering talent in the metro area and engineering schools such as the Georgia Institute of Technology Lavelle said.

The company invested more than $200 million in its headquarters complex which will be home to more than 900 workers.

As the company plans for a grand opening of the tower in February it’s aiming to open up much of the space to the public including students for tours of the facility Lavelle said. One reason for that is to generate interest in engineering and the elevator industry among students who might one day enter the field he said.

“I think we have a real opportunity with the students” Lavelle said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDVhdGxhbnRhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NvbnRpbmVudHMtbGFyZ2VzdC1lbGV2YXRvci10ZXN0LXRvd2VyLXRvLW9wZW4taW4tY29iYi1jb3VudHnSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3g1YXRsYW50YS5jb20vbmV3cy9jb250aW5lbnRzLWxhcmdlc3QtZWxldmF0b3ItdGVzdC10b3dlci10by1vcGVuLWluLWNvYmItY291bnR5LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Continent's largest elevator test tower to open in Cobb County,"The continent's largest elevator test tower is nearing completion in Cobb County according to TK Elevator.

The global elevator company is completing North American headquarters at The Battery Atlanta. The three-building headquarters will feature a 420-foot-tall glass elevator.

That height makes it the tallest elevator test tower in North America.

A spokesperson for TK Elevator said there will be 18 elevator shafts that will test concepts and products including high-speed elevators and two elevator cars in a single shaft.

The tower also features a three-story tall LED display panel wrapped around three sides of the building that will be visible from Truist Park.

Google shed some new light on the Iranian hacking group known as APT35 or Charming Kitten and how they use Telegram bots to let them know when a phishing lure has a nibble. Speaking of Telegram a new report shows just how poor a job the messaging service has done keeping extremism off the platform.

There was good news for Cloudflare this week as a judge ruled that the internet infrastructure company isn't liable when one of its customers infringe copyright designs on their websites. And there was bad news for humanity as the governor of Missouri has threatened repeatedly to sue a journalist for responsibly disclosing a security flaw on a state website that he uncovered.

And there's more! Each week we round up all the security news WIRED didn’t cover in depth. Click on the headlines to read the full stories and stay safe out there.

In February someone tried to poison a Florida city's water supply by hacking into its control system and dramatically increasing the amount of sodium hydroxide. In 2020 a former employee at a Kansas water facility accessed and tampered with its controls remotely. And that's before you even get to the four ransomware attacks that intelligence officials documented this week in a joint warning about the ongoing threats that hackers pose to US water and wastewater facilities. The alert notes that water treatment plants tend to invest in physical infrastructure rather than IT resources and tend to use outdated versions of software both of which leave them susceptible to attack. Disgruntled insiders have ample access to wreck havoc and ransomware attackers always like a target that can't afford to stay offline for any significant period of time. While this isn't necessarily surprising—we sounded the same warning back in April—the joint FBI/CISA/NSA/EPA memo gives new detail into how many confirmed attacks have taken place in recent months and it offers some guidance for critical infrastructure operators on how not to be the next victim.

A comprehensive hack of Twitch recently included source code gamer payouts and more causing quite a stir among streamers especially. But it's not the biggest hack in Twitch history. That distinction belongs to a 2014 compromise detailed by Motherboard this week that was devastating enough that Twitch had to ""rebuild much of its code infrastructure"" according to the report because so many of its servers had likely been compromised. Inside Twitch the hack became known as “Urgent Pizza” because of how much overtime engineers had to work—and dinners the company had to feed them—to mitigate the attack. It's well worth a full read.

Chances are you've heard this story by now but it's still worth including a case with allegations this wild. The Department of Justice has charged Navy nuclear engineer Jonathan Toebbe and his wife with trying to give state secrets to a foreign country; the people on the other end of the line turned out to be FBI agents. Toebbe allegedly participated in several “dead drops” of sensitive information; court documents say he hid data cards in everything from a peanut butter sandwich to pack of gum. He allegedly offered up thousands of documents asking for $100000 of cryptocurrency in return.

It's always a good idea to update all of your devices all of the time—automatically even—but especially so when that update is specifically designed to fix a so-called zero-day bug. In this case a security researcher had gotten so tired of Apple not crediting his submissions that last month he posted a proof-of-concept exploit and full details for four separate iOS security flaws. This is the second one to be patched which leaves two to go. Hopefully Apple will give him a proper hat tip when it gets around to fixing those.

The FBI CISA EPA and NSA recommend WWS facilities including DoD water treatment facilities both in the United States and abroad use a risk-informed analysis to determine the applicability of a range of technical and non-technical mitigations to prevent detect and respond to cyber threats.

WWS Monitoring

Personnel responsible for monitoring WWS should check for the following suspicious activities and indicators which may be indicative of threat actor activity:

Inability of WWS facility personnel to access SCADA system controls at any time either entirely or in part;

Unfamiliar data windows or system alerts appearing on SCADA system controls and facility data screens that could indicate a ransomware attack;

Detection by SCADA system controls or by water treatment personnel of abnormal operating parameters—such as unusually high chemical addition rates—used in the safe and proper treatment of drinking water;

Access of SCADA systems by unauthorized individuals or groups e.g. former employees and current employees not authorized/assigned to operate SCADA systems and controls.

Access of SCADA systems at unusual times which may indicate that a legitimate user’s credentials have been compromised

Unexplained SCADA system restarts.

Unchanging parameter values that normally fluctuate.

Require multi-factor authentication for all remote access to the OT network including from the IT network and external networks.

Utilize blocklisting and allowlisting to limit remote access to users with a verified business and/or operational need.

Ensure that all remote access technologies have logging enabled and regularly audit these logs to identify instances of unauthorized access.

Utilize manual start and stop features in place of always activated unattended access to reduce the time remote access services are running.

Audit networks for systems using remote access services. Close unneeded network ports associated with remote access services (e.g. RDP – Transmission Control Protocol [TCP] Port 3389).

When configuring access control for a host utilize custom settings to limit the access a remote party can attempt to acquire.

Network Mitigations

Implement and ensure robust network segmentation between IT and OT networks to limit the ability of malicious cyber actors to pivot to the OT network after compromising the IT network. Implement demilitarized zones (DMZs) firewalls jump servers and one-way communication diodes to prevent unregulated communication between the IT and OT networks.

Develop/update network maps to ensure a full accounting of all equipment that is connected to the network. Remove any equipment from networks that is not required to conduct operations to reduce the attack surface malicious actors can exploit.



Planning and Operational Mitigations

Ensure the organization’s emergency response plan considers the full range of potential impacts that cyberattacks pose to operations including loss or manipulation of view loss or manipulation of control and threats to safety.

The plan should also consider third parties with legitimate need for OT network access including engineers and vendors. Review test and update the emergency response plan on an annual basis to ensure accuracy.

Exercise the ability to failover to alternate control systems including manual operation while assuming degraded electronic communications.

Allow employees to gain decision-making experience via tabletop exercises that incorporate loss of visibility and control scenarios. Utilize resources such as the Environment Protection Agency’s (EPA) Cybersecurity Incident Action Checklist as well as the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.

Safety System Mitigations

Install independent cyber-physical safety systems.

These are systems that physically prevent dangerous conditions from occurring if the control system is compromised by a threat actor. Examples of cyber-physical safety system controls include: Size of the chemical feed pump Gearing on valves Pressure switches etc. These types of controls benefit WWS Sector facilities especially smaller facilities with limited cybersecurity capability because they enable facility staff to assess systems from a worst-case scenario and determine protective solutions. Enabling cyber-physical safety systems allows operators to take physical steps to limit the damage for example by preventing cyber actors who have gained control of a sodium hydroxide pump from raising the pH to dangerous levels.



Additional Mitigations

Foster an organizational culture of cyber readiness. See the CISA Cyber Essentials along with the items listed in the Resources section below for guidance.

Update software including operating systems applications and firmware on IT network assets. Use a risk-based assessment strategy to determine which OT network assets and zones should participate in the patch management program. Consider using a centralized patch management system.

Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets using up-to-date signatures. Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network assets are identified and evaluated for the presence of malware.

Implement regular data backup procedures on both the IT and OT networks. Regularly test backups. Ensure backups are not connected to the network to prevent the potential spread of ransomware to the backups.

When possible enable OT device authentication utilize the encrypted version of OT protocols and encrypt all wireless communications to ensure the confidentiality and authenticity of process control data in transit.

Employ user account management to: Remove disable or rename any default system accounts wherever possible. Implement account lockout policies to reduce risk from brute-force attacks. Monitor the creation of administrator-level accounts by third-party vendors with robust and privileged account management policies and procedures. Implement a user account policy that includes set durations for deactivation and removal of accounts after employees leave the organization or after accounts reach a defined period of inactivity.

Implement data execution prevention controls such as application allowlisting and software restriction policies that prevent programs from executing from common ransomware locations such as temporary folders supporting popular internet browsers.

Train users through awareness and simulations to recognize and report phishing and social engineering attempts. Identify and suspend access of users exhibiting unusual activity.

FBI CISA EPA and NSA are expressing thanks to Dragos and the WaterISAC for their contributions to this advisory.

Stop greenwashing and start caring for the planet,"Apple talks a lot about the environment and its sustainability measures.

The company is quick to point out ""the environment"" on each new product release and it markets every product on its website in terms of environmental impact. Customers are also told how Apple products are ""good for the planet.""

Apple

Apple has a whole section on its website dedicated to the environment. This page has a lot of green on it along with cartoonish depictions of trees and planet Earth just to show us how serious the company is about all things green.

But there are things that Apple isn't telling us about.

Apple is actively working to curtail the lifespan of products by making them unduly hard to repair charging uneconomical repair prices and locking out third parties from being able to offer more reasonable repairs.

Apple isn't happy that you bought something. Apple wants you to buy more things.

Apple is designing obsolescence into its products and that's unquestionably not good for the planet.

And nowhere do we see this practice as clearly -- and nowhere does the planet feel it the most -- than when it comes to the iPhone.

Apple's vision for the lifecycle of the iPhone must go something like this:

""You buy it then use it until it breaks or the battery wears out and then you buy another one.""

Sure there's some blurring around the edges with warranties and extremely expensive repairs but the main event in the equation is selling a product and then following that up by selling another.

And that's clear in the design (remember the design that Apple said was good for the planet).

Must read: Your new iPhone 13 doesn't belong to you

Take the back glass on the iPhone.

Why would a company like Apple build a device where the back glass -- essentially a cosmetic feature -- costs hundreds of dollars to repair if it breaks (something that glass is renowned for doing)?

Yes hundreds of dollars.

If you break that and you don't have AppleCare+ then you're paying the ""other damage"" fee which for the newer iPhones range from $399 for the iPhone 13 mini to a whopping $599 for the iPhone 13 Pro Max.

And this isn't because parts for newer handsets are more expensive. The ""other damage"" fee for the iPhone XS Max is also $599.

A number of third-party repair shops now have a laser glass remover thus making this repair quicker and easier but it strikes me that Apple designed the iPhone in such a way as to make repairs as expensive and as difficult as possible pushing users towards purchasing AppleCare+ warranty or buying a new phone when they break theirs.

Repairs are priced in a way to elbow people towards buying a new device.

And that negates all the progress Apple has made in other areas such as recycling and renewable energy.

Good for the bottom line but not good for the planet. Or for that matter customers.

And it's not just big repairs that are complex. What should be simple routine repairs — such as battery replacements — have become needlessly complicated.

Replacing an item that Apple itself describes as a ""consumable"" component should be straightforward and routine.

And to top that off if users want to replace their own battery (or choose a non-Apple endorsed third-party repairer) they'll be plagued until the end of time by an ominous warning message that Apple is unable to verify that the battery is genuine — even if we 100 percent know it's genuine because say it came out of another iPhone.

The only way around this is — yes you guessed it — to pay Apple money.

If Apple is genuinely losing money on repairs — as the company told the US House of Representatives subcommittee on antitrust back in 2019 — you'd think it would welcome third-party repairs.

And spoiler even if it is true that Apple loses money on repairs the company isn't losing money when it comes to AppleCare warranties and definitely not losing money if the obstacles it puts in the way of repairs ultimately push people to buy a new handset.

These warnings aren't limited to the battery where there may be a legitimate concern — albeit a small one — related to quality and the fear that a third-party battery could go up in smoke and everyone would blame Apple.

Components such as the display and camera modules are also tied to the device and replacing these not only generates warnings but also kills some features such as Face ID.

You don't own your iPhone. Not really. Apple is letting you borrow it and if you break anything or you own it long enough for the battery to wear out you have to pay Apple to fix it for you.

It's more like a lease.

Apple is a multibillion-dollar corporation and you don't become a multibillion-dollar corporation by being nice. But Apple does get a lot of things right — privacy protection being one — and it's disheartening to see Apple's leadership fail so spectacularly when it comes to the fundamentals of caring for the environment.

Recycle. Reduce. Reuse.

Apple sells some 200 million iPhones a year. Placed end-to-end they would form a chain that would go three-quarters of the way around the globe (around 30000 kilometers).

That's a lot of product.

Add in all the iPhones sold so far and that's a big pile of electronic waste that the planet is going to have to absorb.

And that's why it's important that Apple does its bit to aid the reuse of old iPhones by making them repairable which would in turn reduce the number of iPhones needed.

Yes Apple might very well sell fewer iPhones but since I'm sharing the planet with Apple I think that selling fewer iPhones in exchange for better sustainability is a good trade.

That's the ""reduce"" bit that Apple doesn't want you to think about.

Apple could lead the way in sustainable products and influence other companies to follow suit but instead it chooses to greenwash unsustainable practices.

And that's a real shame.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90ZWNoLzIwMjEvMTAvMTcvYXBwbGUtZmlyZXMtZW1wbG95ZWUtd29ya2VyLWFjdGl2aXN0LWdyb3VwLzg0OTExMDYwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple fires employee who helped start worker activist group,"One of two recognized leaders of an employee activist group within Apple has been fired.

Janneke Parrish a program manager for Apple Maps working in Austin Texas said she was fired Thursday. She is one of the co-founders of an employee group that this summer opened an #AppleToo website and began publishing former and current Apple employees' stories about harassment and discrimination on Medium.

""I believe that it is retaliation. One does not casually speak out publicly against Apple and expect that to go ignored"" Parrish told USA TODAY. Her firing was first reported in an interview with The Verge.

More than 500 people have come forward about workplace issues Parrish and Cher Scarlett another Apple employee who helped start the group told The New York Times which also confirmed Parrish's firing.

►Talking Tech podcast:New Call of Duty: Vanguard game tells a different war story

►Upgraded to Windows 11?:Here’s how to get the most out of your refreshed PC

Parrish said an internal investigation at Apple began last month after audio of an all-staff meeting with CEO Tim Cook was leaked to The Verge and The New York Times. She was told the company suspected her of leaking the feed Parrish told The Verge. She was suspended on Oct. 8 she said. Then on Oct. 14 Parrish said she was told she was fired for deleting files on the company devices she had turned in.

""I think when I came under investigation that was a pretext to find something that they could use to fire me"" Parrish said. ""Prior to turning in my devices though I did remove some of my personal data from these devices because well my private conversations … those are not Apple's business. And similarly my financial information on apps like Robinhood is not Apple's business. Because I deleted files from my devices before turning them in that is the reason that was given for why I was terminated.""

In response to a query about Parrish's firing Apple sent a statement to USA TODAY: ""We are and have always been deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace. We take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised and out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved we do not discuss specific employee matters.”

This is just the latest incident involving Apple and employee concerns. Just prior to Parrish's firing her comments appeared in a story by The Washington Post about Scarlett who is on medical leave from the company. Parrish's firing was also confirmed by The Washington Post.

In that story Scarlett said she had attempted to look into whether there was a pay gap for Apple employees across the country which angered some other employees. She said some used the company's internal Slack channel to accuse her of leaking confidential information to reporters – something Scarlett told the Post she hadn't done.

She has since hired a lawyer and sought to go on paid medical leave because of the accusations' effect on her health.

Apple also recently fired Ashley Gjøvik who had been suspended in early August after sharing her concerns about workplace safety due to workplace pollution. After her suspension she says she filed workplace complaints with state and federal agencies including the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as well as the National Labor Relations Board.

In documents Gjøvik shared with Bloomberg Apple claimed the senior engineering program manager was terminated for violating policies including not cooperating with the investigation and disclosure of confidential product information. Gjovik said she was fired in retaliation for reporting concerns about work conditions to the government and press and for organizing with employees.

The #AppleToo movement arose from employee outcry over Apple's May 2021 hiring of Antonio García Martínez a former Facebook product manager and author of the book ""Chaos Monkeys.""

A letter signed by more than 2000 employees and forwarded to Apple management expressed concerns about ""misogynistic statements in his autobiography – such as ‘Most women in the Bay Area are soft and weak cosseted and naïve despite their claims of worldliness and generally full of shit"" The Verge reported at the time.

""That was a moment where we realized that employee activism could make a difference that our voices in solidarity with each other could have a positive impact on our work at Apple"" Parrish said. But issues of remote work advocacy – including employees' ability to advance if not at Apple's Cupertino California headquarters – and pay equity ""did not get a positive response from leadership"" she said.

Vincent White an attorney at White Hilferty and Albanese in New York City said Parrish plans to file complaints in federal court and possibly with federal agencies.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

""Je viens vous annoncer ce soir la fin des opérations militaires sur l’ensemble du territoire national à compter de ce jour à minuit"" a-t-il annoncé à la radio d'Etat ajoutant: ""le cessez-le-feu unilatéral immédiat est la démonstration (...) de ma ferme volonté de privilégier la voie du dialogue"".

La Centrafrique est le théâtre d'une guerre civile depuis 2013 qui a cependant considérablement baissé d'intensité depuis trois ans.

En décembre 2020 une partie des groupes armés qui occupaient alors plus des deux-tiers du pays regroupés au sein de la Coalition des Patriotes pour le Changement (CPC) ont lancé une offensive pour empêcher la réélection de M. Touadéra. Celui-ci a alors sollicité Moscou et Kigali qui ont dépêché des centaines de paramilitaires russes et de soldats rwandais à la rescousse d'une armée centrafricaine démunie.

Grâce essentiellement au soutien des Russes et des Rwandais elle a depuis reconquis toutes les grandes villes et repoussé les rebelles dans les forêts. Mais ces derniers multiplient les attaques furtives ces dernières semaines loin de la capitale Bangui. Malgré quelque 12.000 Casques bleus d'une force de maintien de la paix de l'ONU (Minusca) déployée dans le pays depuis 2014.

""Mercenaires"" russes

Bangui et les groupes armés ont déjà paraphé plusieurs accords de cessez-le-feu et même de paix mais aucun n'a tenu.

""Les forces armées centrafricaines appuyées par les forces alliées russes et rwandaises ont pu repousser les assauts de la CPC et reconquérir une bonne partie du territoire national"" a affirmé M. Touadéra vendredi.

L'ONU a accusé en août les paramilitaires russes combattant selon elle par centaines et les soldats centrafricains de se livrer --tout comme les rebelles-- à des exactions contre les civils dont certaines relevant de ""possibles crimes de guerres"".

Les Nations unies comme la France et les ONG internationales considèrent que ce sont des ""mercenaires"" de la société privée de sécurité russe Wagner Moscou ne reconnaissant la présence que de 1.135 ""instructeurs non armés"".

M. Touadéra a justifié ce cessez-le-feu par la recherche de l'""apaisement"" pour favoriser l'ouverture d'un ""dialogue républicain"" promis après sa réélection il y a dix mois mais qui n'a toujours pas vu le jour. Un ""comité d'organisation (...) travaille d'arrache-pied pour nous proposer la date de la tenue du dialogue républicain"" a-t-il promis vendredi.

""Les principaux leaders de la CPC à l’exception de Nourredine Adam et Ali Darassa (...) ont signé l’engagement de cesser toute action armée sur le territoire national"" a affirmé M. Touadéra.

Crimes contre l'Humanité

Adam et Darassa sont respectivement les chefs du Front Populaire pour la Renaissance de la Centrafrique (FPRC) et de l'Unité pour la Paix en Centrafrique (UPC) deux des principaux groupes armés du pays. L'UPC a cependant quitté la CPC en avril.

""Nous respectons le cessez-le-feu mais (...) restons sur des positions défensives si on nous attaque nous nous défendrons"" a annoncé par téléphone à l'AFP Abakar Sabone porte-parole militaire de la CPC.

""Si Touadéra considère que nous ne faisons pas partie du cessez-le-feu c'est pas grave. On va continuer nos actions jusqu'à ce que nous trouvions une solution"" a commenté auprès de l'AFP Ousmanou Bi Mohamadou porte-parole de l'UPC.

Une nouvelle guerre civile avait éclaté en 2013 après un coup d'Etat contre le président François Bozizé. Des combats sanglants avaient suivi entre la coalition de groupes armés l'ayant renversé la Séléka à majorité musulmane et des milices rassemblées par le chef de l’Etat déchu les anti-balakas dominées par les chrétiens et les animistes.

Ce conflit a culminé entre 2014 et 2015 avec des milliers de morts et Séléka et anti-balakas --qui forment encore la plupart des groupes armés actuels-- ont été accusés de crimes contre l'Humanité par l'ONU.

M. Bozizé est aujourd'hui à la tête de la CPC.

Le cessez-le-feu ""ne fait pas obstacle (...) au maintien de l’ordre public et la restauration de l’autorité de l’Etat sur l’ensemble du territoire"" a averti M. Touadéra vendredi.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlY2hvcmVwdWJsaWNhaW4uZnIvbG91cGUtMjgyNDAvYWN0dWFsaXRlcy9sZXNwYWNlLWZyYW5jZS1zZXJ2aWNlcy1vdXZlcnQtYXUtcHVibGljXzE0MDMwMjQ4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,L'espace France services ouvert au public,"L'espace France services a proposé une journée portes ouvertes mercredi après-midi pour faire découvrir à la population ses nombreux services.

Alors que le FC Barcelone aimerait prolonger le contrat d’Ousmane Dembélé tout indique que cette envie est encore très loin de devenir réelle tant les négociations n’auraient absolument pas avancé.

En proie à des difficultés financières le FC Barcelone doit faire en sorte de ne pas perdre ses meilleurs éléments actuels faute de pouvoir recruter massivement. Dans un tel contexte il est évident que le club catalan se doit de ne perdre aucun joueur dans le cadre d’un transfert libre. Seulement voilà à l’heure actuelle c’est exactement la tendance qui se dessine avec Ousmane Dembélé. Arrivé en 2017 en provenance du Borussia Dortmund l’international français arrivera au terme de son contrat au Barça le 30 juin prochain. Logiquement le club catalan souhaite absolument le prolonger aussi bien pour des raisons sportives qu’afin d’éviter ce fameux départ libre en fin de saison. Problème cette prolongation semble encore très loin d’être concrète.

As the cream of female film talent including Hollywood’s Meryl Streep and Britain’s Andrea Arnold prepare to receive significant career awards a dark cloud is threatening. It is expected that new allegations of the abuse of women in the European entertainment industry will be made public which may overshadow the sparkle of a feminist Croisette.

Streep’s screen achievements will be celebrated with an honorary Palme d’Or at the opening ceremony while a day later Arnold the acclaimed British film director will receive the prestigious Carosse d’Or from the French director’s guild. And on Sunday another influential British film personality will be saluted when diversity champion Dame Donna Langley the chairman and chief content officer at NBCUniversal is to be honoured with the Women in Motion Award at a lavish dinner. All this comes in a year that also sees the American director Greta Gerwig best known for last summer’s Barbie presiding over a jury that features the campaigning stars Eva Green and Lily Gladstone. But the story of the 77th festival will not be all positive for women.

In the run-up to the annual gathering on the Côte d’Azur rumours have been widespread in France of the existence of a secret list of 10 men in the industry including leading actors and directors who have been abusive to women. The names described as “explosive” are believed to have been sent anonymously to the National Centre for Cinema in Paris along with other leading film finance companies in France.

According to reports in Le Figaro and the satirical magazine Le Canard enchaîné festival organisers have set up a crisis management team to respond to the accusations. Films might have to be dropped from the screening timetable if they involve implicated names.

The impending revelations may prove an apt curtain-raiser for the Wednesday premiere of a short French film Moi Aussi about abuse in the industry. The film which was added to the festival’s Un Certain Regard programme at the last minute is predicted to prove just as incendiary as the list owing to its emotive content.

Made by actor Judith Godrèche dubbed the “ambassador of #MeToo” in France it draws on the words of many female contributors and takes the form of a choral piece uniting different personal accounts. “Suddenly before me was a crowd of victims a reality that also represented France so many stories from all social backgrounds and generations” Godrèche has explained. “Then the question was what I was going to do with them? What do you do when you’re overwhelmed by what you hear by the sheer volume of testimonies?”

The 52-year-old actor first shook up French cinema in February when she accused the directors Jacques Doillon and Benoît Jacquot of having raped her in the 1980s when she was a teenager. Jacquot 77 Godrèche said had a relationship with her when she was under the age of consent. He denies committing any offences and has said that he was “under her spell”. She claims Doillon 80 forced her to take part in a gratuitous sex scene on his 1989 film La Fille de 15 ans (The 15-year-old Girl). He says she agreed to take part in the scene in which he also acted and he denies rape or assault. Godrèche followed up her accusations a month later with a speech at France’s high-profile Cesar awards in which she claimed the film industry had been a cover for exploiting underaged actors.

The effect of new abuse allegations and all the honours being heaped on influential women will certainly mean the opening of the 2024 festival is in strong contrast to last year. Last May demonstrators on the Croisette opposed Johnny Depp’s appearance in the opening film Jeanne du Barry. They were angry about recent abuse allegations against him involving his ex-wife Amber Heard that led to his defeat in a British libel trial although a month later he won a similar libel trial in an American court.

A more progressive tone should be set by Streep’s opening honour made in recognition of “countless masterpieces” over 50 years of cinema. “To stand in the shadow of those who have previously been honoured is humbling and thrilling in equal part” said Streep on hearing of the award.

London-born Langley a “trailblazing” studio chief is also being rewarded next weekend for fostering “a more inclusive industry” over two decades with films that “provide a platform for women”. Away from film sets Langley has also campaigned as a board member of Vital Voices and is a founder of the Hollywood Reporter’s Women in Film mentorship programme. Previous winners of the Women In Motion award include Jane Fonda Salma Hayek Viola Davis and last year Michelle Yeoh.

Arnold whose new film Bird is showing in the main competition this year will receive her award after a Wednesday screening of her 2006 film Red Road. Set in Glasgow it tells of a false accusation of rape made vengefully by a female CCTV operator.

Jury-member Green is one of the more prominent actors to have accused Harvey Weinstein of making inappropriate advances. In 2017 the actor said she had to push away the disgraced producer during a business meeting in Paris. “I got away without it going further but the experience left me shocked and disgusted” she said.

The reaction to the #MeToo movement in France has been slower and more nuanced than in America. The legendary actor Catherine Deneuve was among those to initially play down the importance of prosecuting the bad behaviour of men defending their so-called “right to pester”. But last week French legislators agreed to a government inquiry into sexual and gender-based violence across the country’s performing arts and fashion sectors. And in the autumn French actor Gérard Depardieu stands trial on charges of sexually assaulting two women on the set of The Green Shutters. He faces rape charges in another case and is under investigation over allegations of assault. He denies all charges.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vc2VhdHRsZS1uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzL3ByZXNpZGVudC1qb2UtYmlkZW4tdG91dHMtam9icy1jbGltYXRlLXJlY29yZC1hdC1zZWF0dGxlLWZ1bmRyYWlzZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden slams Trump hints at Inslee recruitment at Seattle fundraiser,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

That night one witness called emergency services 11 times before police intervened.

Despite warnings of violence at UCLA police didn’t step in for over 3 hours

Late on April 30 Sean Tabibian called 911 to say police were needed urgently at the University of California at Los Angeles. “All hell had broken loose” Tabibian recalled in an interview. Masked agitators were attacking pro-Palestinian protesters on a campus quad video footage shows and a team of hired security guards had retreated.

The call at 11:09 p.m. was the first of 11 that Tabibian made to police that night as the violence escalated according to his cellphone’s call log. Other witnesses called 911 as well records show.

“They said they were responding” said Tabibian a local business executive and UCLA alumnus who was near campus around the time commotion erupted at the encampment and who said he was concerned that protesters had been discriminating against Jewish students. “They kept saying they’re responding they’re responding.”

While a small UCLA patrol could be seen in footage briefly early on law enforcement agencies did not move in to stop the violence until 3 hours and 34 minutes after Tabibian’s first 911 call a Washington Post examination has found — a delay that prolonged one of the most violent altercations since pro-Palestinian protesters began setting up encampments on college campuses across the country this spring.

The examination — based on evidence including more than 200 videos emergency radio transmissions text messages and interviews with more than a dozen witnesses — illuminates the stakes for university and local officials as they decide if and when to call police to deal with pro-Palestinian encampments. Elsewhere police have been accused of using heavy-handed tactics but at UCLA where university policy discourages calling police preemptively campus police as well as the Los Angeles Police Department and California Highway Patrol are facing scrutiny for their hands-off approach that night.

It’s not clear why police waited so long to respond. But in the hours before they took action at least 16 people were visibly injured the majority of them pro-Palestinian including two protesters who could be seen with blood streaking across their faces and soaking into their clothes videos and images show. The counterprotesters ignited at least six fireworks; struck protesters at least 20 times with wooden planks metal poles and other objects; and punched or kicked at least eight protesters.

The protesters occasionally fought back. People on both sides sprayed their opponents with chemical irritants at least 48 times — in some instances in the face at close range. Unconfirmed reports of a gunshot on campus and a man armed with a knife were relayed to officers over radio recordings show.

As the violence raged some police remained stationed at a hastily convened command post near the encampment while others assembled in formation closer to the violence but held back for an hour video shows. Authorities did not report making any arrests and a review by The Post of video footage found no indication attackers were detained.

Law enforcement’s tepid response on April 30 contrasts starkly with their aggressive maneuvers the following night when officers in riot gear some firing projectiles swiftly dismantled the UCLA camp and arrested 210 people for refusing to leave.

The Post’s examination also found that faculty had raised concerns for days about harassment of pro-Palestinian activists and physical violence directed at people in the protest encampment raising questions about whether the school should have had more police on hand to prevent an altercation.

Skip to end of carousel College protests over Gaza war Waves of antiwar protests are spreading across colleges campuses with growing police arrests as graduation season approaches. See the universities where protests are intensifying Are you a college student? Tell us about protests on your campus (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post) End of carousel The college is typically policed by its own small force and university officials must ask outside departments for extra help when they determine it’s needed. UCLA follows a systemwide University of California policy “not to request law enforcement involvement preemptively and only if absolutely necessary to protect the physical safety of our campus community” a spokeswoman said in a statement last month after protesters established their encampment. While LAPD would not answer questions about when they were summoned a senior UCLA official told a colleague that the college had asked LAPD for assistance by around 11:30 p.m. on the night of the attack according to text messages obtained by The Post. The California Highway Patrol has said UCLA requested its help an hour later at 12:30 a.m. UCLA police chief John Thomas told the Los Angeles Times that when he got to campus shortly before midnight he saw 19 officers from campus police the LAPD and three other local police departments but an LAPD lieutenant told him the force was too small to step in. It was not until about 1:30 a.m. that officers began staging with campus police in a parking lot near the encampment video shows. CHP confirmed the time UCLA requested its help but did not respond to further questions. In an unsigned email LAPD told The Post “The department is looking into its involvement on campus along with other law enforcement agencies and a detailed report is being completed.” Campus police referred questions to UCLA. A spokesperson for UCLA did not respond to requests for comment. UCLA and LAPD have said they are now jointly investigating perpetrators of the April 30 attack and that they have asked the FBI for help. Michael V. Drake the president of the University of California system has requested an external investigation of the university’s response that night. Mounting concerns On April 25 as protests emerged at universities nationwide over Israel’s war in Gaza students at UCLA’s Westwood campus began building a tent encampment on Dickson Plaza an open tree-lined quad in front of the college’s Royce Hall theater. Their demands to college leaders included calling for a cease-fire divesting from companies tied to Israel’s war effort and boycotting Israeli universities. Over the next several days videos show counterprotesters faced off with pro-Palestinian demonstrators. According to protesters they repeatedly tried to enter the encampment.

UCLA asked for assistance in policing the demonstrations from the wider University of California police system on April 25 and April 26 but then canceled those requests Wade Stern the president of the University of California’s police union told The Post. The cancellations first reported by the Los Angeles Times were frustrating Stern said. “Every cop wants to go and help” he said. “We all want to be there.”

Concerns about students’ safety mounted among some faculty ahead of a pro-Israeli counterprotest planned for April 28 and permitted by university officials. In a phone call on April 27 Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck assured Randall Kuhn a public health professor that counterprotesters did not want to “pick a fight” and that UCLA was stationing dozens of hired security guards around the encampment including 30 ready “to help address any provocations or potential attacks” according to an email Kuhn sent to colleagues summarizing Beck’s remarks. Beck referred questions to a UCLA spokesman.

On April 28 counterprotesters erected a massive TV screen to blast footage of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas at the protesters. UCLA’s police force was bolstered that day by additional officers from other University of California campuses. Still when an assault occurred they were outmanned and sought additional help from several local police departments according to a timeline compiled by police union officials.

By the next night tensions were rising again. Videos show a small group of agitators taunting people in the pro-Palestinian encampment. Police later separated fights between the two sides protesters said in interviews.

Hours later UCLA again asked for help from other UC police departments. But none was able to send reinforcements as they were monitoring protests on their own campuses according to the union timeline.

The attack

Agitators gathered outside the encampment the following day. Recordings posted on social media showed protesters refusing entry to a Jewish student who identified as a Zionist and a mother complaining to UCLA that Jewish students were being blocked from accessing a library.

At 2:35 p.m. Danielle Carr an assistant professor at UCLA’s Institute for Society and Genetics wrote an email seeking to sound an alarm about “truly unbelievable” aggression against protesters during the pro-Israeli counterprotest two days earlier. “I know that many faculty are wondering what the administration plans to do to protect our students” Carr wrote to an office responsible for handling complaints of sexual violence and harassment.

By the evening a large crowd had gathered outside the protest camp. One man was draped in an Israeli flag and others wore hoodies with slogans demanding the return of Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas. At 10:48 p.m. counterprotesters moved closer to the encampment’s southern barricades and blared “Harbu Darbu” — an Israeli wartime anthem calling for retribution for Oct. 7. Suddenly they rushed forward and started pulling metal fences away from security guards stationed at the perimeter of the encampment.

The guards were from Contemporary Services Corporation (CSC) which contracts with UCLA and specializes in crowd control at sporting events and concerts and a subsidiary. While some CSC guards attempted to push back attackers others stood aside.

“There are too many!” one of the security guards said recordings show. Another shouted “CSC pack it up!” as fellow guards walked away. CSC did not respond to questions from The Post.

The agitators pushed past the fencing and started ripping down plywood barriers on the perimeter of the camp’s south and north sides. Pro-Palestinian protesters attempted to hold their line.

Calls for help

When Tabibian the business executive placed his first 911 call at 11:09 p.m. he connected with a dispatcher and they spoke for 21 seconds. “I believe I told him that people were getting hurt — they needed to get over here and shut this down” Tabibian told The Post noting that it was difficult to differentiate between each of his 11 calls. Tabibian blamed pro-Palestinian protesters for provoking the chaos.

At 11:13 p.m. two UCLA patrol cars and an ambulance arrived near a UCLA campus police car that an observer said had been there all day. A third arrives shortly after. At least four officers stepped out of their cars and were soon surrounded by counterprotesters some shouting “Shut it down!” in an apparent reference to the encampment. One man was ushered to the ambulance and at 11:19 p.m. the three police cars and ambulance pulled away.

Reports of injuries rolled in. At 11:31 p.m. a fire department dispatcher asked an ambulance stationed nearby to respond to an injury at the college.

Kuhn the public health professor texted Beck the vice chancellor about his growing concern. Beck assured him that LAPD had been summoned.

Violence continues

Moments later a counterprotester lit a firework and lobbed it over the encampment perimeter. It exploded inside the encampment to terrified screams.

The lack of police intervention frustrated witnesses. Jeremy López who supported the protest called 911 at 12:28 a.m. to report that students were being beaten. “The operator said ‘Yes we know already’ and hung up” López later told The Post.

Carr the assistant professor who had warned of potential violence arrived at the plaza a few minutes later and encountered what looked to her like a war zone. Students were sprawled on the ground some bleeding from their faces. Others were reeling from eye pain caused by irritants.

The violence continued “for hours and hours with nobody stepping in” said Bharat Venkat an associate professor. “I thought a student would be killed.”

A mob surrounded two pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had stepped outside of the encampment. While one was hit with a wooden stick the crowd rained punches on the other. He was later recorded receiving treatment from volunteer medics his face covered in blood.

At 12:32 a.m. a man on LAPD radio said they “might want to launch a UCLA unit” according to a review of radio communications archived by the platform Broadcastify. Seconds later an officer said he was at UCLA’s Murphy Hall — close to the violence — along with four other units. But no LAPD personnel were seen taking action in available video footage of the area.

After 1 a.m. police reported over radio that an “MFF” — mobile field force — and a helicopter had been requested at the college and officers were told that the incident was “code three” meaning they should use lights and sirens.

But over the subsequent hour the address of the temporary command post was misstated over radio confusing some officers.

People calling police continued to receive dismissive responses. “Didn’t you already call?” an operator said when a woman called UCLA police at 1:33 a.m. video shows. “I already told you we’re handling the situation. You can’t continue calling unless you have an emergency.”

Police emerge

Throughout the evening police vehicles had gathered on the outskirts of campus but the first mass of police visible in footage reviewed by The Post was a line of about 30 CHP officers that began to form at 1:43 a.m. Another row of officers in black lined up behind them. They did not advance.

At 2:17 a.m. counterprotesters rushed the encampment barricade physically assaulting protesters including slamming a plank of wood on someone’s head and spraying an irritant. Officers stood about 200 feet away. None moved to stop the violence the video shows.

Nearly an hour after they assembled in line and nearly four hours after the attack began officers from CHP and LAPD began slowly moving in formation toward Dickson Plaza at 2:43 a.m.

By 3:10 a.m. police had separated the majority of attackers from the pro-Palestinian protesters. But law enforcement did not arrest or appear to question the attackers instead granting them an exit route away from the camp according to video.

“There have only been a couple times in my life where I’ve had trouble understanding what’s real and what’s maybe a nightmare and this was definitely one of them” Nicholas Shapiro an assistant professor and a former EMT who helped treat injured students later told The Post.

Shapiro arrived home with dark stains on his fingers and palms.

“Surreal” he texted a group of professor friends at 3:47 a.m. “to be ending the night cleaning a student’s blood off my hands.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTEvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvYmlkZW4tbW9yZWhvdXNlLWJsYWNrLWNvbGxlZ2VzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Antiwar Protests Haven't Flared Up at Black Colleges Like Morehouse,"As President Biden prepares to give graduation remarks this month at Morehouse College in Atlanta a prestigious historically Black institution the White House is signaling anxiety about the potential for protests over the war in Gaza.

During a recent visit to Atlanta Vice President Kamala Harris stopped to ask the Morehouse student government president about the sentiment on campus about the conflict how students felt about Mr. Biden’s visit and what the graduating class would like to hear from him on May 19.

Then on Friday the White House dispatched the leader of its public engagement office and one of its most senior Black officials Stephen K. Benjamin to the Morehouse campus for meetings to take the temperature of students faculty members and administrators.

The reasons for concern are clear: Nationwide demonstrations over the war and Mr. Biden’s approach to it have inflamed more than 60 colleges and universities stoked tensions within the Democratic Party and created new headaches for his re-election bid."

(Oct. 16 2021) – Atlanta United 2 lost 4-2 to Memphis 901 FC Saturday night at AutoZone Park. Abdoulaye Diop scored his first goal for the club Ajani Fortune netted his second of the season and 16-year-old academy player Luke Brennan made his professional debut. The loss eliminated Atlanta from playoff contention.

ATL UTD 2 weathered a series of Memphis attacks in the first half before finding a penalty against the run of play just before the break. Fortune attempted a long diagonal ball from right side but it was picked off by 901 FC’s Mark Segbers. However he hit a weak back pass to the goalkeeper and David Mejia ran on to the ball as he dashed into the penalty area. Segbers immediately fouled Mejia giving ATL UTD 2 a penalty kick and earning a yellow card for denying him the opportunity. Diop stepped to the spot and scored with strike to left side of goal. Cody Cropper got a piece of it but it was hit with plenty of pace and found the back of the net.

Memphis equalized in the 53rd minute. Kadeem Dacres nearly rounded Vicente Reyes but Josh Bauer cleared the ball away from goal. However Roland Lamah collected ball inside box and put a shot on goal where Caleb Wiley appeared to clear it off the line but it was ruled to have crossed the line.

Memphis took the lead just three minutes later after Atlanta failed to clear a cross and Dacres scored at the back post. Laurent Kissiedou slipped Kyle Murphy in into the box behind ATL UTD 2’s defense where he scored to extend Memphis’ lead to 3-1 in the 60th minute.

Fortune pulled one goal back in the 64th minute. ATL UTD 2 gained possession after a Memphis throw in and charged forward as Mejia and Robbie Mertz combined down the middle of the field. As Mejia entered the 18-yard box the ball was poked away but Fortune followed the play and curled a shot into the left side of goal for his second of the season.

Memphis restored its two-goal lead in the 69th minute. Dacres led a counterattack and played Murphy down the right side. Murphy put a shot on goal where Reyes saved it but he pushed it directly into the path of Alan Winn where he tapped home the goal from inside the six-yard box.

ATL UTD 2 (8-14-10 34 points) will return to action for its season finale Wednesday Oct. 20 against FC Tulsa at ONEOK Field (ESPN+ 8:00 p.m. ET).

Officers say when they arrived at the scene a victim told them that two subjects brandished firearms and took property from the business.

A short time later officers noticed the suspect vehicle turning into a nearby neighborhood and watched as the suspects attempted to switch vehicles.

Officers then attempted to initiate a traffic stop on the new vehicle but the driver refused to stop and a pursuit ensued.

Police say the chase ended at the dead-end of Spruce Street when the suspects crashed their car and took off on foot attempting to cross I-77.

The CMPD Aviation Unit K-9 Unit and other officers assisted in searching for the suspects.

Police say Alexander McCoy and Fleming were detained without further incident and taken into custody of the Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office following an interview with detectives.

The investigation into this case is active and ongoing.

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDI0LTA1LTA5L2Zvcm1lci1iZWQtYmF0aC1zdWVzLWh1ZHNvbi1iYXktZm9yLTMwMC1taWxsaW9uLXRyYWRpbmctZ2FpbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Bed Bath & Beyond Sues Hudson Bay for $300 Million in Trading Profits,"Why did this happen?

Viator drummed on Disincarnate's 1993 sole album Dreams Of The Carrion Kind (headed up by former Obituary Death and Testament guitarist James Murphy) and played keyboards on Acid Bath's 1996 record Paegan Terrorism Tactics.

News of Viator's death comes from a post by Murphy. We wish Viator's friends and family all the best at this time.

""RIP Disincarnate drummer Tommy Viator pictured here to the far left in 1993"" wrote Murphy. ""I have no idea what happened I just know that he is gone.

""Tommy was a key element to the band's sound with a drumming style all his own… he helped make the Dreams of the Carrion Kind album heavy as hell without a single blast beat at least not as that technique is known today. He was wearing my leather in this pic I don't really remember why.

""We just spoke back at the beginning of April and he seemed to be in good spirits and having some positive musical activities and plans with musicians local to him near his home in Louisiana. I'm glad we had that conversation and I'm very glad that I let him know that I appreciated him at the end of it. I would've said so much more if I had known but we never know."""

The match signalled the return of former boss Gavin Hunt to the arena for the first time since Amakhosi sacked the coach in May earlier this year.

Meanwhile his successor Stuart Baxter could not have asked for a better performance from his charges following the mandatory two-week FIFA international break.

After a muted opening spell the match sprang to life after Chippa United created two chances in quick succession.

Thokozani Sekotlong fired narrowly wide in the 7th minute before Athini Jodwana saw his goal-bound shot saved in the centre of goal by Chiefs keeper Daniel Akpeyi.

Amakhosi responded by fashioning two quick-fire chances of their own Njabulo Ngcobo firing high and wide in the 11th minute before the deadlock was broken a minute later.

Dolly netted the all-important opener latching onto a neat pass from Khama Billiat before arrowing a powerful shot into the top-left corner from the centre of the danger area.

And Dolly would eventually add to his tally just past the half-hour mark firing into the bottom-left corner after being teed up by Billiat following a fast break.

Hunt's charges registered a total of 19 shots on the day with only seven hitting the target but Akpeyi was again at his best between the posts for the home side.

The Chilli Boys redoubled their efforts after falling behind but lacked a cutting edge in the final third of the pitch.

Sekotlong and Siphesihle Mkhize were both denied by Akpeyi in the closing stages of the half while teammate Roscoe Pietersen saw his shot in injury time denied by the Chiefs defence.

Chippa continued to create chances after the half-time break but struggled to make their chances count.

After seeing Phathutshedzo Nange's goal-bound effort kept out by goalkeeper Ismail Watenga in the 51st minute Chippa hit back with three good chances of their own.

However Akpeyi was equal to the task keeping out shots from Nange Thokozani Sekotlong and Mokhele Maloisane.

Billiat ensured that he joined the party and guaranteed the victory on the 70th minute with a goal that brought delight to Baxter in the dugout.

Baxter's grin would widen in stoppage time as Lazarous Kambole came off the bench to score Chiefs' fourth of the night to cap off a brilliant performance by the Soweto giants.

The three points lift Chiefs to eighth on the log standings with Chippa moving down to the 14th position.

Chiefs' next fixture will take place in Tshwane against SuperSport United while Hunt's Chilli Boys entertain Swallows FC.

Both matches will be played on Sunday 24 October.",,,,,,

After the recent run-up in Tesla’s stock price Elon Musk has once again reclaimed his short-lived position as the richest person in the world. Musk’s fortune has grown so much he is now wealthier than Warren Buffett (legendary investor) and Bill Gates (Microsoft founder) Combined.

According to Bloomberg Musk is now worth $236 billion making his fortune bigger than Warren Buffett $103 Billion and Bill Gates $130 billion combined.

And now Elon Musk comfortably back to his number one position has started doling out investment advice to his fellow billionaires who happen to not be doing as spectacularly as he is.

Responding to a tweet by Trung Phan (a senior analyst and business writer at The Hustle) who remarked on Elon Musk’s turn of fortune in comparison to Bill Gates and Warren Buffet Musk responded by saying “maybe Buffett should invest in Tesla” and followed his own advice with laughter.

Maybe Buffett should invest in Tesla haha— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 17 2021

The entire premise of Musk’s advice is most likely to poke fun at the old guard of the financial world. After all Warren Buffett doesn’t need investment advice as he has more money than he can spend in several lifetimes. However Musk’s advice also likely contains an earnest invitation to Buffett to invest in Tesla.

Continuing his Twitter back and forth Musk agreed with a comment by a Twitter user who responded to Elon’s comments saying “maybe he [Warren Buffet] did think of investing in $TSLA but Bill [Gates] told him he shorted it.”

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 17 2021

Here Musk seems to be once again pointing the finger at Bill Gates for taking a short position in Tesla. (If you happen to not be familiar with the idea of shorting a stock it basically means taking a bet the stock price of a company will go down and if does making a profit.)

Musk initially shared his suspicion that Bill Gates is betting against his electric car company in his last appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast. Speaking to Rogan Musk said he has it from trusted sources that Bill Gates has a short position against Tesla.

The issue was brought up when Joe Rogan asked Musk about Bill Gates’ comments claiming electric semi-trucks aren’t practical.

Bill Gates cast aspersions on the viability of electric semi-trucks based on his belief the weight of a battery pack needed to power a semi-truck would be so heavy it will make such a vehicle unpractical.

However this is not a belief held only by Gates. Following Tesla’s Semi unveiling event several analysts who follow battery technology and long-haul trucking also shared their skepticism of Tesla’s 18 wheeler.

Still Musk believes Bill Gates’ comment is a combination of a financially motivated strategy designed to push Tesla’s stock price down and a lack of knowledge regarding the issue.

Musk had harsh words in response to the Microsoft CEO back in 2020. When asked about the same issue by a Twitter user Musk said referring to Bill Gates “He has no clue.”

He has no clue— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 12 2020

Bill Gates asked about Musk’s comment decided to take a more conciliatory approach calling Elon Musk a very good engineer and comparing his product design skills to that of former Apple CEO Steve Jobs.

However Bill Gates added fuel to the suspicion that he was betting against Tesla when he chose to obfuscate when asked directly in a CNBC interview if he had ever taken a short position on the electric car maker.

Gates’ comments on the CNBC interview all but confirm the former Microsoft CEO is short Tesla stock and given Bill and Warren’s close relationship Buffett might shy away from investing in Tesla if he knows Gates’ doesn’t believe the company is promising.

However even without Gate’s influence it’s unlikely that Buffett would invest in Tesla at least not at this stage in the company. Buffett usually goes for company’s with stable profits and proven out business models.

So even if Buffett was to believe in Tesla’s promise he would still not likely invest in the EV maker until the company has grown to a point it starts to take a significant chunk of annual automotive sales.

Having said that Berkshire Hathaway the holding company headed by Warren Buffett has other managers who can independently make investment decisions without needing Buffet’s go-ahead. So there is a chance although slim we might see investment into Tesla from Buffett’s firm in the not too distant future.

The saga of the 3 billionaires is still unfolding. Musk with Tesla’s continued success has taken a sizable lead for now. However if Elon is to remain at the top of the world’s wealthiest list Tesla will have to keep executing the company’s long-term plans flawlessly. We will keep you posted on Elon Musk and Tesla’s execution going forward. Make sure to visit our site torquenews.com/Tesla regularly for the latest updates as this saga unfolds.

So what do you think? Should Buffett invest in Tesla? Also do you believe Bill Gates’ short position is what’s holding Buffet from investing in the EV maker? Let me know your thoughts down in the comments below.

We had to buy something to replace it and that’s when we came across the Oculus Quest 2.

A strange alternative you might think but that’s exactly what interested us. I’ve never tried VR before but the idea of being immersed within the games sounded amazing. Also when you compare the price the $299 Oculus Quest 2 is much more affordable than the $499 PS5 so we took a gamble and bought one. We’ve learned a lot in a few short weeks.

Oculus Quest 2 fit and comfort

First of all the Oculus Quest 2's straps are fiddly to get the right fit on your head. There’s one strap that uses velcro but the other two that go around the head are more awkward to thread and change. It’s fine if it’s just you playing on the console because once you’re set up it’s secure and you don’t need to look at it again. But if there’s more than one of you using it it does become a hassle.

Once fit the Oculus Quest 2 flush to the face and feels comfortable to wear. Previously there were complaints of rashes on the face from the foam interface; however our model was supplied with the silicone cover which was issued to fix this problem. Neither of us showed any skin irritation after repeatedly using the Oculus Quest 2. My only complaint in terms of the fit was that I could still see through a small gap to the outside world when looking down towards my nose.

At 1.1 pounds the Quest 2 headset is fairly lightweight although it does take some getting used to. My partner stopped noticing it but I still feel it when I start a fresh session.

A small but important point to make is how to store this console. It’s an awkward shape and with two controllers you need to clear a drawer as it doesn’t look great on display. You can buy a case separately but one should really be supplied to protect it from damage.

Oculus Quest 2 games and experience

We bought a wide selection of apps to see what the Oculus Quest 2 could really do. I watched some of the virtual videos on Jurassic World and loved that you could literally look all the way around to 360 degrees and catch hidden details. As the dinosaurs approach you and rear up it really does catch your imagination and feel like you’re there with them.

We also had a go on Zombieland: Headshot Fever which turned out to be my partner’s favorite game. Once you get the hang of the controls — releasing the clips and reloading from your harness — while using two guns at once makes the gameplay much more exciting. Another game we particularly liked was Death Lap in which you can race drift and destroy other drivers.

Resident Evil 4 VR is an awesome Oculus Quest 2 game as well and will add The Mercenaries mode via free DLC in 2022.

The only game we weren’t so keen on was Warplanes WW1 Fighters. While the simulation looked amazing and the controls were spot on this made each of us feel sick quite quickly. I could only manage about 10 minutes of game time while my partner had to take off the headset almost immediately. That’s not to say some of the games don’t compensate if you struggle with motion sickness. There are options to choose a more relaxed play in some which won’t throw you about so much.

Moving onto sound — it’s very impressive on the Oculus Quest 2. It’s loud crisp and you don’t need headphones to improve the experience. You really can hear every detail from chirping birds to the wind rustling the bushes. There is a headphone jack available though if you’re disturbing others with the noise.

Oculus Quest 2 battery life

A full charge of the Oculus Quest 2 will give you 2-3 hours of battery life which doesn’t sound like much but I wouldn’t recommend playing it for much longer in a single sitting as it will start to take its effect on your eyes.

The only drawback with this battery life is you can’t use it in succession if there’s more than one of you — not for very long anyway. When you do run out of battery life mid-play there’s not much warning either. It flashes up that it’s low with about five minutes to spare and that’s it. It could use more warnings.

Oculus Quest 2 Verdict

To sum up we are pleased with our Oculus Quest 2 purchase. Of course it's very different from a PS5 but it’s a whole new immersive experience which we’re happy to have on demand. You can’t play on it for as long as you would on a traditional console but you feel much more involved.

The only downside is that the Quest 2 is not easy to share. The constant adjusting of the straps and fairly short battery life makes this impractical. But you can buy a secondary headset to solve this which we may do now. We can then play the same games together at the same time. too. Otherwise it can make you feel a little antisocial if there are others in the room.

I admittedly still want a PS5 I won’t deny that but this is more than enough to keep me entertained for now. We couldn’t be happier with the quality of the games and our overall experience with this headset.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvaG9tZS1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3Nvbm9zLWJlYW0tZ2VuLTItcmV2aWV3LWF0bW9zLWFsZXhhLWFuZC10aGUtYmVzdC1tdXNpYy1zdHJlYW1pbmctZ2V0LWV2ZW4tYmV0dGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sonos Beam Gen 2 review: Atmos Alexa and the best music streaming get even better,"CNET’s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month building on more than a quarter century of expertise.

SCORE Sonos Beam Gen 2 $499 at Best Buy $499 at B&H Photo-Video $400 at Amazon Pros All-in-one system offers astoundingly wide sound

Choice of Alexa or Google Assistant onboard

One of the best streaming music apps around Cons Expensive

No dedicated Dolby Atmos speakers

Not able to compete with systems with subs

With the right movie or TV show a soundbar with Dolby Atmos onboard can help transport you out of your living room and into another world -- from the nuclear wastelands of the Outback to the battlefields of Europe. Yet not all Atmos soundbars are created equal. Some include physical upfiring drivers and some like the Sonos Beam Gen 2 rely on fancy processing to create Atmos effects. After listening to the new Beam I was surprised at how good that processing can sound.

The $450 Sonos Beam Gen 2 is a tweak of the company's original Sonos Beam soundbar and adds Atmos compatibility as well as a better processor. Without changing the physical design beyond a new grill or adding any extra speakers the Beam Gen 2 does indeed sound bigger than before. It's not worth upgrading if you have the original -- save up for the Sonos Arc instead -- but for people looking to explore Dolby Atmos who want built-in voice assistant(s) and best-in-class whole-home music streaming the Sonos Beam Gen 2 is a great choice.

Ty Pendlebury/CNET

Sonos isn't for everyone though as it can be costly to build a whole-home system especially if you need to buy the $449 Port adapter for an existing stereo. The Sonos ecosystem is excellent however and no other company offers the same level of support for music streaming services. As an alternative you can buy a full 5.1.2 system with ""real"" Dolby Atmos for only 50 bucks more -- the excellent Vizio M512a. It does sound better but it involves a lot more boxes with wires and no Wi-Fi or voice assistant built-in.

What it is

Apart from a couple of key improvements the Beam Gen 2 is very very similar to the original Beam. It has the same size (2 foot wide) the same shape and number of speakers. These drivers consist of four elliptical midwoofers one central tweeter and three passive bass radiators. Actual upfiring drivers which are required for ""true"" immersive playback are absent on the new Beam.

Instead the Gen 2's main upgrades are on the inside with a more powerful processor and a new phased array (which can operate five separate audio zones versus the original's three). The two new arrays are dedicated to surround and height information and provide the simulated Dolby Atmos playback.

The Sonos Beam (fabric grill) sits on top of the Gen 2 (plastic grill) Ty Pendlebury/CNET

The other notable upgrade on the Gen 2 is HDMI eARC compatibility which brings with it HDMI 2.1 and Dolby Atmos streams. If your TV doesn't have an HDMI port you can use the HDMI-to-optical adapter in the box for Dolby Digital 5.1 decoding.

The Beam is also a smart speakers and offers a choice of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. The onboard microphone array appears to be the same as before and was reasonably sensitive to my commands -- even when the movie is blaring.

Why would you choose this speaker over a host of cheaper soundbars? Because it's Sonos. Whether you have an existing Sonos system -- say a One or two -- or are looking to strike out into home streaming Sonos still offers one of the most robust music platforms available. There are dozens of supported services from Apple Music to TuneIn to Sonos' own Radio HD. The speaker also boasts Spotify Connect and Apple AirPlay 2.

Ty Pendlebury/CNET

The Beam 2 comes with a night mode to reduce the impact of explosions when you don't want to disturb the neighbors in addition to a voice-enhancement feature. Unlike much of its competition the Sonos does not offer a music mode -- instead everything is ""wide.""

Adding a Sonos subwoofer and Sonos One rear channels to the Beam brings the total to $1600. Ty Pendlebury/CNET

Setup is simple and straightforward and the app walks you through each step. If you have an iOS device you can take advantage of Sonos TruePlay which requires you to wave the phone around the room for 2 minutes to calibrate the beam-forming technology. You may look and feel silly but based on my tests it does work.

Like all Sonos soundbar systems the Beam is able to be supplemented by additional speakers. The most cost-effective upgrade is a pair of Ikea Symfonisk surrounds for $198 -- they add the needed ambience for surround soundtracks and are fairly unobtrusive at the same time. Adding a pair of Sonos Ones ($419) is overkill -- especially as using them as surrounds disables the microphones anyway. You could buy the microphone-free One SLs but that would still cost $398.

You can also forget the Sub -- at almost twice the price of the Beam the $800 sub is a better match for the Arc (which paradoxically doesn't need it as much as the Beam does). The company sorely needs a $400 subwoofer -- and a $100 adapter for existing speakers while it's at it.

For my testing I used a Samsung QN65Q80T TV connected via HDMI eARC with an Oppo UDP-205 as well as a Roku Ultra .

How it sounds

The question I most wanted to answer was ""Does the Beam Gen 2 justify the $50 increase compared to the original Beam?"" The simplest answer is ""yes.""

The idea of any home cinema system Atmos or otherwise is to create a bubble of sound. The Beam managed to do so despite the fact that all of its speakers are housed in a from a single enclosure.

Compared to the original Beam the Gen 2 was certainly able to generate more atmosphere with Mad Max: Fury Road for example Iit flung effects all around and seemingly from back of me which is quite a feat without physical rears. The original Beam also offered a large bubble but the sound was focused more toward the front of the room. On the other hand neither speaker was able to generate above-the-head effects which occur in the scene where the little girl asks ""Where are you?"" for example.

The Gen 2 offers a clearer sound than the original which helps to make it more understandable during TV shows and adds an airiness when watching movies. While the sound of the Beam changes when you add a sub -- offering the appearance of an instant upgrade -- the Gen 2 sounds more like the sub-connected Beam all the time whether the sub is on or not.

The Beam's top panel Ty Pendlebury/CNET

I also compared the Gen 2 to the Vizio M512a-h6 a multi-speaker Atmos system in the same price range. The Vizio offers excellent music and movie replay and its impact was obviously helped by the included sub. I started with Turnstile's Alien Love Call -- featuring Blood Orange -- and found the uncharacteristically psychedelic track was suitably swirly on the Vizio while the just-there kick drum was quick and fast. The track held up surprisingly well on the Beam too where the swirliness suited the speaker perfectly and though the bass was not as deep the vocals were clearer.

Next I shifted to the audio-visual achievement that is the movie 1917 in Dolby Atmos. While it was able to offer a sense of height as a fronts-only system the Beam couldn't compete with the Vizio in surround effects. There was no front to back movement in the flares that fly overhead at 1hr 08min for example. However the pings of the rifle shots as our hero scarpers deeper into the ruins did have a greater sense of urgency on the Beam.

So far the Beam was keeping up but when I fed them both a meaty soundtrack -- the lobby shootout scene from the Matrix -- the Vizio shined. Ambience was better immersion was better and I could hear the synth bass soundtrack all the way through whereas it only peaked through occasionally on the Beam. If you want home theater oomph and don't care about the rest get the Vizio.

Should you buy it?

If you own the Sonos Beam you sadly won't be able to get the upgrades that the Gen 2 offers via a software update and it's not worth buying again just for a little more ambience. The Beam is definitely a great upgrade for people who own a Sonos One and want to expand their systems although the true upgrade is in the bigger and better-sounding Sonos Arc.

The Sonos Gen 2 benefits from the addition of Dolby Atmos while keeping all the things I love about the original. If you want a compact attractive system with a bunch of useful features it's my top pick at this price. That said Vizio's M512a is still the leader for the money with better sound and more inputs to play with.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2Jlc3QtYnV5LWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LXNhbGUtZGVhbHMtMTMwMDU5OTM0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shop Best Buy's massive anniversary sale,"Looking for more of the best deals sales and product recommendations?

In the south-western corner stands Bordeaux cast as the genteel playground of snooty chateau owners – a world of large properties in the hands of either old money or newer more corporate cash. In the other eastern corner we have Burgundy where winemakers are supposedly small-holding farmers rather than businessmen – “real people” in touch with the land but all at sea in a sales and marketing suite.

Although the truth is inevitably more complicated there has always been enough in the caricature for it to ring true. Burgundy really has had what Jasper Morris the Burgundy-based British merchant-turned-writer calls a different spirit. Its obsession with making wines that “express the difference between one site and another” has sometimes seemed more important than more base mercantile ambitions found elsewhere.

Is that still the case? In his introduction to the recently published second edition of his definitive guide to the region Inside Burgundy Morris gives voice to some of the disquiet felt about recent developments which arguably have rendered it more like the stereotype of its old rivals in Bordeaux. The issue is the seemingly never-ending rise in the prices commanded by Burgundy’s most celebrated wines. To pick just one example from the price comparison website wine-searcher.com: five years ago the average price of Domaine Leroy Musigny was an already-eye watering £4033 a bottle; by June this year it was going for £24178 a bottle.

The problem isn’t just that Burgundy’s wines are now priced beyond all but the tiniest percentage of wine lovers. There’s been a knock-on effect on land prices. According to figures released by French estate agents Safer in 2019 the price of the top-rated land in the region had doubled in the space of a decade making a single hectare of “grand cru” land worth on average €14.5m. That in turn has pushed out many ambitious younger producers from the most fashionable addresses and led to larger firms such as luxury goods company LVMH sweeping in.

All of which helps explain why so many Burgundy lovers have grown disillusioned with the region. But it’s far from being all bad news. As Morris says the only thing that has prevented “a kick-back against the lack of affordable wines” has been the rise of “beautiful wines” from Burgundy’s less fashionable regions and grapes. That might mean pinot noir and chardonnay made by a top producer working in the larger cross-regional appellation of Bourgogne or from a dynamic young vigneron plying the vineyards of Mâcon in the south; or it might mean one of the increasingly fine wines made from the much-maligned aligoté grape variety.

In other words the spirit of Burgundy lives on. You just might have to look a little harder to find it.

Six (relatively) affordable Burgundy wines

Waitrose Blueprint White Burgundy

France 2019 (£9.49 Waitrose)

With more than 400 winegrower members the vast Cave de Lugny co-operative is very far from the romantic idea of the small Burgundy domaine. But it makes some excellent value chardonnay including this soft gently creamy-peachy example.

Adnams Bourgogne Rouge

Burgundy France 2018 (£13.99 Adnams.co.uk)

East Anglian merchant Adnams has done exceptionally well to source a good-quality sub-£15 pinot noir from Burgundy: very much bargain pricing for this region. It’s lively refreshing fluently red-fruited and light (12.5%) in alcohol.

Domaine Caroline Bellavoine Bourgogne Aligoté

Burgundy France 2020 (£14.50 thewinesociety.com)

In a region where chardonnay rules aligoté Burgundy’s other white grape has always been rather looked down on. Lately however it’s enjoyed a revival producing wonderfully racy super-dry and luminously bright dry whites such as this.

Domaine Jean Chartron Bourgogne Blanc Cuvée Eugénie Dupard

Burgundy France 2019 (£20.35 privatecellar.co.uk)

The majority of this magnificent resonant multi-layered chardonnay comes from a tiny vineyard in the famous village of Puligny. As it’s blended with a little fruit from elsewhere it only qualifies for the lesser (and significantly cheaper) Bourgogne appellation.

Domaine Douhairet-Porcheret Monthélie Rouge Cuvée Miss Armande Vieilles Vignes

Burgundy France 2018 (£24.88 howardripley.com)

Another wine that benefits from being made in one of Burgundy’s lesser-known villages Monthélie in the Côtes de Beaune. This is very good value in the regional context and a simply delightful expression of pinot noir’s fragrant silky elegant side.

Fréderic Cossard Bourgogne Rouge Bedeau

Burgundy France 2019 (£40 bbr.com)

Fréderic Cossard’s whimsically labeled Bourgogne Rouge is full of charm. A blend of pinot noir from two plots that positively sings and dances with pretty red berry fruit and fresh cherry-ish acidity but is anchored by classic forest floor savouriness."

HT22 cells originate from immortalized primary mouse hippocampal neurons. HT22 cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s high glucose medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich Munich Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 20 mM HEPES 100 units/mL penicillin 100 µg/mL streptomycin and 2 mM glutamine.

For efficient cofilin 1 knockdown HT22 cells were transfected with 15 nM cofilin1 siRNA for 48 h using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany) according to the manufacturer. Following siRNA sequences were obtained from Dharmacon: scrambled siRNA (scrsiRNA 5′-UAAUGUAUUGGAACGCAUA-3′) Cofilin1 siRNA1 (CflsiRNA1 5’-AGACAAGGACUGCCGCUAU-3’) and Cofilin1 siRNA2 (CflsiRNA2 5’-GGAAUCAAGCAUGAAUUAC-3’). The sensitivity of HT22 cells to glutamate highly depends on cell density and on cysteine-glutamate antiporter (xCT) expression levels. In this biological system glutamate concentrations are usually adjusted between 5 and 10 mM to achieve 70–80% cell damage. Erastin toxicity also depends on cell density and xCT expression and also needs adjustment within a concentration range between 0.7 and 3 µM.

Primary cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic mouse brains (E18) as described previously [21]. Genetically modified mice expressing cofilin1 allele with exon 2 flanked by loxP sites were used as controls (Ctrl) [29]. Cofilin1 knockout was achieved by expression of the Cre enzyme capable of recognizing loxP sites and thus specifically deleting exon 2 of the cofilin1 gene region resulting in a nonfunctional gene product. Since a systemic knockout of cofilin1 is embryonically lethal [30] Cre expression is under the control of a CaMKIIα promotor to specifically delete cofilin1 in excitatory neurons for the forebrain-including cerebral cortex neurons [31]. Neuronal cultures were grown in neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany) supplemented with 1.2 mM glutamine 2% B27 Plus supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany) 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Glutamate treatment (25 μM) was conducted at day 30 in culture (DIV30) for 24 h. NMDA-antagonist MK801 (Merck KGaA Germany) was added as a control at a concentration of 10 μM simultaneously to glutamate addition. Rho-activator II CN03 (Cytoskeleton Denver USA) was applied at a concentration of 1 µg/mL 3 h prior to glutamate treatment.

RT-(q)PCR

Total RNA was isolated by using InviTrap Spin Universal RNA Mini Kit (Stratec Biomedical Birkenfeld Germany) 48 h after siRNA transfection. SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany) was used to perform reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and specific oligonucleotides (Gapdh (399 bp) forward 5′-CGTCTTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC-3′ and reverse 5′-AAGGCCATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCC-3′ and Cofilin1 (146 bp) forward 5’-GCCAACTTCTAACCACAATAG-3’ and reverse 5’-CCTTACTGGTCCTGCTTCC-3’). The amplification products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis after staining with ethidium bromide by illumination with UV light.

Quantitative PCR was conducted in the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Fisher Scientific GmbH Schwerte Germany). mRNA was extracted using the InviTrap Spin Universal RNA Mini Kit (Invitek Molecular GmbH Berlin Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and treated with Turbo DNA-free Kit. cDNA synthesis was conducted with 200 ng of DNAse-treated RNA via iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH Munich Germany) and then diluted 1:5 with aqua bidest and added to a mastermix containing iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH Munich Germany). The respective primer pair for the genes of interest in a MicroAmp™ Fast Optical 96-Well Reaction Plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA). Relative gene expression levels were analyzed by double-delta C T analysis and shown as 2-ΔΔCτ. The following oligonucleotides were used for RT-qPCR measurements: Cofilin1 forward (AGGACCTGGTGTTCATCTTCTG) Cofilin1 reverse (TGCTTGATTCCTGTCAGCTTCT) GAPDH forward (CCCTTCATTGACCTCAACTA) GAPDH reverse (CCAAAGTTG TCATGGATGAC) U6 forward (CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA) U6 reverse (AACGCTT CACGAATTTGCGT).

Protein analysis

Protein extraction and Western blot analysis were performed as previously described [11]. Briefly cells were ruptured in a lysis buffer containing 0.25 M d-mannitol 0.05 M Tris base 1 mM EDTA 1 mM EGTA 1 mM DTT and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Diagnostics Mannheim Germany). The total protein amount was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany). Proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Roche Diagnostics Mannheim Germany). Cofilin1 and phospho-Cofilin1 (Ser3) (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology Danvers USA) as well as α-tubulin as a loading control were analyzed using indicated primary antibodies (α-tubulin antibody 1:10000; Sigma-Aldrich Munich Germany). After incubation with the appropriate secondary HRP-labeled antibody (Vector Laboratories Burlingame CA USA) Western blot signals were detected by chemiluminescence with Chemidoc system (Bio-Rad Munich Germany).

Cell viability

Cell viability was assessed by a colorimetric assay based on the yellow-colored MTT reagent (3-(45-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-25-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide 0.5 mg/mL for HT22 cells and 1 mg/mL for primary cortical neurons; Sigma-Aldrich Munich Germany) which is reduced to a purple-colored formazan quantified by absorbance measurement at 570 nm with a reference filter at 630 nm by FluoStar OPTIMA reader (BMG Labtech Ortenberg Germany). Cell death was monitored in real-time using the xCELLigence Real-Time Cell Analysis (RTCA; Roche Diagnostics Mannheim Germany) system as previously described [32]. Changes in the impedance are depicted as normalized cell index.

Flow cytometry

Different cellular and mitochondrial parameters of the glutamate- or erastin-induced cell death pathways were analyzed using the Guava easyCyte 6–2 L flow cytometer (Merck Millipore Darmstadt Germany) upon harvesting adherent HT22 cells and following the addition of different fluorescent dyes. Apoptotic and late necrotic cells were identified using the Annexin V-FITC Detection Kit (Promokine Heidelberg Germany). Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining were performed for 5 min in the dark at room temperature after harvesting the cells with trypsin. By staining the cells with BODIPY 581/591 C11 (44-difluoro-5-(4-phenyl-13-butadienyl)-4-bora-3a4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-undecanoic acid; Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany) oxidized lipids and membranes were detected. Following 8 h of glutamate treatment the cells were stained with 2 µM BODIPY dye for 1 h at 37 °C. The cell-permeable dye 2’7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H 2 DCF-DA) was used to evaluate the accumulation of cellular reactive oxygen species upon 30 min incubation of 20 µM DCF dye in DMEM without serum. For evaluation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species accumulation MitoSOX Red indicator (Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany) was applied at a concentration of 1.25 µM for 30 min at 37 °C. For the MitoSOX measurement with isolated mitochondria 10 µM of the complex III-inhibitor antimycin A (AA) was used as a positive control and incubated simultaneously with MitoSOX Red indicator at a concentration of 1.25 µM and afterward measured with Guava easyCyte 6–2 L flow cytometer (Merck Millipore Darmstadt Germany). Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured upon staining the cells with MitoPT TMRE Kit (ImmunoChemistry Technologies Hamburg Germany). Therefore cells were incubated with 0.2 µM TMRE (tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester) for 30 min at 37 °C. For investigation of the mitochondrial membrane potential of isolated mitochondria from adult mouse brain tissue 40 µg mitochondria were diluted in 150 µL 1× mitochondrial assay solution (MAS: 70 mM sucrose 220 mM mannitol 10 mM KH 2 Cl 2  5 mM MgCl 2  2 mM HEPES 1 mM EGTA 0.20% BSA pH 7.2) supplemented with 2 µM rotenone and 10 mM succinate. In total 50 µM of the uncoupler CCCP was used as a positive control. Mitochondria were incubated with 0.2 µM TMRE for 15 min and then measured with Guava easyCyte 6–2 L flow cytometer (Merck Millipore Darmstadt Germany). Staining the cells with the mitochondrial selective dye Rhod-2 AM (rhodamine-2 acetoxymethyl ester; Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany) allows for specific evaluation of mitochondrial calcium accumulation. Therefore Rhod-2 AM was reduced to Dihydrorhod-2 AM and incubated at a concentration of 2 µM in DMEM without serum for 1 h.

Measurement of ATP mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR)

Cellular ATP levels were measured using the ViaLight Plus Kit (Lonza Verviers Belgium) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly cells were lysed transferred to a white-walled 96-well plate and the ATP monitoring reagent was added to the cell lysate. Afterward the luminescence was detected with a FLUOstar OPTIMA reader (BMG Labtech Ortenberg Germany). Determination of the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate as an indicator of mitochondrial respiration was performed using the Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer (Agilent Technologies Waldbronn Germany). Cells were plated in XFe96-well microplates (6000 cells/well Seahorse Bioscience) and 1 h prior to the measurement the growth medium was replaced by the seahorse assay medium (4.5 g/l glucose 2 mM glutamine 1 mM pyruvate pH 7.35). After recording three baseline measurements four compounds were added by injection.

The compounds and final concentrations used are as follows: oligomycin 3 µM FCCP 0.5 µM rotenone 0.1 µM and antimycin A 1 µM. For measuring mitochondrial respiration 5–12 µg of isolated mitochondrial protein was measured in 1×MAS containing the complex II substrate succinate (10 mM) and the complex I inhibitor rotenone (2 µM) to focus on mainly complex II- and complex III-driven respiration. For slight attachment of the plated mitochondria at the bottom of the cell plate a centrifugation step of the whole plate at 2000×g for 20 min at 4 °C was indispensable (Heraeus Megafuge 40 R; Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany). Indicated compounds for the injections were used in the following final concentrations: 4 mM ADP 2.5 µg/mL oligomycin 4 µM FCCP and 4 µM antimycin A (AA). Three basal and three measurements after each injection were recorded with the Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer (Agilent Technologies Waldbronn Germany).

Mitochondrial isolation

Mitochondrial isolation of freshly dissected cortical or hippocampal brain tissue (~50 mg) was performed as previously described [21]. The tissue was embedded in 2 mL mitochondrial isolation buffer (composed of 300 mM sucrose 5 mM TES 200 µM EGTA pH 7.2) and roughly homogenized with a 20-G Neoject needle (Dispomed Gelnhausen Germany) and then sieved through a 100-µm nylon cell strainer (Corning Incorporated Corning NY USA). To homogenize the tissue efficiently and extract mitochondria from the cell structure thoroughly a cell homogenizer (Isobiotec Heidelberg Germany) with 1 mL gas-tight syringes (Supelco Munich Germany) was used to ensure a constant rate of 700 µL/min. The cell homogenizer contained a spherical tungsten carbide ball with a clearance of 10 µm to decompose the tissue but simultaneously maintain the integrity of mitochondria. The cell homogenate was transferred into 1.5 mL tubes and centrifuged at 800 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Afterward the supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube and centrifuged at 10000 x g again for 10 min at 4 °C (Heraeus™ Fresco™ 17 Mikrozentrifuge; Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany). The resulting pellet consists of the crude mitochondrial fraction which was finally resuspended in MSHE-BSA (composed of 70 mM sucrose 210 mM mannitol 5 mM HEPES 1 mM EGTA 0.5% (w/v) BSA pH 7.2) buffer. The seahorse measurement was performed in mitochondrial assay solution composed of 70 mM sucrose 220 mM mannitol 10 mM KH 2 PO 4  5 mM MgCl 2  2 mM HEPES 1 mM EGTA 0.2 % (w/v) BSA pH 7.2). All steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Pierce™ BCA Kit was used to determine the protein amount of the mitochondrial fraction.

Protein expression and purification

Human cofilin1 was amplified by PCR using specific oligonucleotides (forward: 5’-CATATGGCCTCCGGTGTG-3’ reverse: 5’-GGATCCTCACAAAGGCTTGCCCTC-3’) and cloned into the pET-15b vector (Novagen Millipore UK). By using site-directed mutagenesis the cysteine residues of cofilin1 were mutated into serine residues using complementary oligonucleotides harboring the nucleotide exchanges (Cys39Ser: forward: 5’-GTGCTCTTCTCCCTGAGTG-3’ reverse: 5’-CACTCAGGGAGAAGAGCAC-3’; Cys80Ser: forward: 5’-CATAAGGACTCCCGCTATGC-3’ reverse: 5’-GCATAGCGGGAGTCCTTATC-3’; Cys139Ser: forward: 5’-CAAGCAAACTCCTACGAGGAG-3’ reverse: 5’-CTCCTCGTAGGAGTTTGCTTG-3’; Cys147Ser: forward: 5’-GACCGCTCCACCCTGG-3’ reverse: 5’-CCAGGGTGGAGCGGTC-3’) and the KOD Hot Start Mastermix (Merck Darmstadt Germany). The plasmids were confirmed by sequencing (Seqlab Göttingen Germany).

The human cofilin1 WT the mutant lacking two Cys residues (Cys139/147Ser 2Cys → Ser) and the mutant lacking all four Cys residues (4Cys → Ser) were expressed as His-Tag fusion proteins in E. coli as described before [33]. The proteins were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using the His Trap Kit from GE Healthcare Life Science USA. Expression and purification efficiency were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using precast gels from Bio-Rad USA and Coomassie staining. Proteins were re-buffered into PBS using Zeba Spin columns and the thermal stability of the proteins was analyzed by recording the emission at 600 nm over time with increasing temperature from 20 to 70 °C (2 °C per 3 min) using the Shimadzu UV1800.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL25ld3MvMzg2NTkwMC9wY3ItY292aWQtdGVzdC1rYXJ5LW11bGxpcy1mYXVjaS10aGVvcnkv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlLXN1bi5jb20vbmV3cy8zODY1OTAwL3Bjci1jb3ZpZC10ZXN0LWthcnktbXVsbGlzLWZhdWNpLXRoZW9yeS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Widow of scientist who invented PCR test hits out at Covid denier conspiracists who claim he was murdered...,"SICK JABS Widow of scientist who invented PCR test hits out at Covid denier conspiracists who claim he was murdered by Fauci

THE widow of the genius Nobel Prize-winning scientist who invented the PCR test has hit back at the “Covid loony resistance” for spreading wild conspiracy theories about him online.

Biochemist Kary Mullis came up with the polymerase chain reaction in 1983 but died from pneumonia in August 2019 months before it was rolled out across the world during the pandemic to diagnose Covid.

Since then several old video interviews have gone viral online where Mullis can be seen saying that the PCR “doesn’t tell you if you’re sick” and slamming Dr Anthony Fauci for his role in the AIDS crisis.

Conspiracy theorists have used the videos to claim the maverick man of science was murdered because he would supposedly have revealed that PCR tests produce fake Covid cases.

Some have gone to the extreme of suggesting that Fauci 80 may have somehow orchestrated his scientific rival’s death to keep him quiet.

The Sun reached out to his grieving widow Nancy Mullis who blasted the allegations as “annoying and egregious”.

Addressing the conspiracy theories for the first time the former teacher 74 said: “These Covid loonies have come out of the woodwork to tell me that Kary was probably killed to keep him from talking about Covid and that Fauci might be behind it.

“This is so ludicrous. I had to make my Facebook page private because of these kinds of people.

“What Kary said about Fauci and PCR being used to diagnose AIDS was 25 to 30 years ago.

“What people have done now is cobble together snippets of various videos but conveniently left out the AIDS part to make it seem that he’s talking about Covid.

“It’s terribly annoying since Kary died in August 2019 before Covid was even in the news.

“It’s completely egregious to me.

“I can promise you that Fauci’s name was never mentioned in our household for a couple of decades.

“It was not an issue that Kary was concerned about but you see people on the internet who say that for the last 30 years he tried to get rid of Anthony Fauci.

“There is so much online that is completely false about Kary but there's nothing I can do about it.

“Normally when people send me things about how Kary has been mentioned I ask them not to.

“It's uncomfortable for me to see how they have used him as kind of the face of the Covid loony resistance.

“The other salient point is that PCR has advanced since it was first invented. Just like cars or airplanes advanced PCR did too.

“To say that it shouldn’t be used for Covid is harkening back to what Kary said about AIDS in the 1990s but PCR has advanced since then.”

Mullis - who was 74 when he died at home in Newport Beach California - was described as a “wide-angled genius” during his lifetime but also courted controversy over some of his views.

The Berkeley-educated DNA chemist maintained that HIV had never been proven to cause AIDS and questioned whether human beings are causing global warming.

The avid surfer and guitar player was also open about having tripped on LSD in his youth and believed in astrology and reincarnation.

His views on HIV and AIDS in particular meant that he was highly critical of Fauci’s leadership during that epidemic.

In one of the videos from the 1990s currently being circulated online father-of-three Mullis says of Fauci: “He doesn’t know anything really about anything and I would say that to his face. Nothing.

“Tony Fauci does not mind going on television in front of the people who pay his salary and lie directly into the camera.”

But Nancy who became Mullis’ fourth wife in 1998 says that he was simply “disappointed” by the scientific establishment represented by Fauci.

She also revealed that she wrote an email to Fauci to assure him that neither she nor any of Mullis’ family are behind the conspiracy theories.

Nancy said: “Kary was such a fully completely out there person. Anything he felt he would say.

“I think he was disappointed in science in general because it was all about money and grants and scaring people and he was totally about the truth.

“(After the conspiracy theories emerged) I wrote to Fauci’s email on the government website.

“I said ‘I know you and Kary had your complete disagreement but in no way is his estate behind any of these lies on the internet’.

“I just felt better saying that because I don't support any of it.

“I got a Dear Nancy and signed Tony email but whether he wrote it or staff wrote it it's hard to say.

“It was just ‘thank you very much hope you're well’ just something very simple.

“It’s got to be hard seeing all this stuff on the internet with Kary maligning him over and over and over again.

“I just felt like I have got to say that this is not coming from me or his family or anyone that is close to Kary it’s coming from these completely weird people that thinks this is just a scam.”

Nancy also revealed that North Carolina-born Mullis - who won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1993 - had suffered from ill health for years before he passed away.

She said: “Kary died at home so how do they (the conspiracy theorists) think somebody had access to him?

“Where would they have access to him would they have come into our house?

“Kary had a six-way heart bypass when he was 60. He had a lot of health issues over the years but he was tough and self-reliant and always thought he could overcome anything.

“The six-way open heart surgery led over the years to blood pressure problems several ablations a pacemaker inserted for erratic and low heart beat and a stent.

“Heart disease ran in his family his mother had heart attacks and his two brothers had issues with their hearts too.

“Pneumonia probably just finished him off. He had it for a couple of weeks and was being treated at home by a nurse.

""I am completely bereft and devastated by his loss and I will never get over it.""

A representative for Dr Fauci was contacted but did not respond to a request for comment.

(Biogen via AP File)

The first new Alzheimer’s treatment in more than 20 years was hailed as a breakthrough when regulators approved it more than four months ago but its rollout has been slowed by questions about its price and how well it works.

Several major medical centers remain undecided on whether to use Biogen’s Aduhelm which is recommended for early stages of the disease. Big names like the Cleveland Clinic and Mass General Brigham in Boston say they’ll pass on it for now.

One neurology practice has even banned the company's sales reps from its offices citing concerns about the drug and its price which can climb past $50000 annually.

Many doctors say they need to learn more about how Aduhelm works and what will be covered before they decide whether to offer it. That might take several months to sort out. Even then questions may linger.

“The drug won’t be for everybody even with access” said Salim Syed an analyst who covers Biogen for Mizuho Securities USA.

Syed estimates that only around one-tenth of the people diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer’s may wind up taking Aduhelm chronically especially if regulators approve similar treatments from Biogen's competitors.

Biogen which reports third-quarter financial results Wednesday is not saying how many people have received the drug since it was approved on June 7. A company executive said last month that Biogen was aware of about 50 sites infusing Aduhelm far fewer than the 900 the company had said it expected to be ready shortly after regulators approved the drug.

Aduhelm is the first in a line of new drugs that promise to do what no other Alzheimer’s treatment has managed: slow the progress of the fatal brain-destroying disease instead of just managing its symptoms.

“It’s like a breath of fresh air” said Dr. Stephen Salloway a Rhode Island neurologist and Biogen consultant who is prescribing the drug. People with Alzheimer’s ""know what’s coming and they want to do whatever they can to stay in the milder stage.”

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Aduhelm despite objections from its own independent advisers several of whom resigned. The agency later said the drug was appropriate for patients with mild symptoms or early-stage Alzheimer’s.

Aduhelm clears brain plaque thought to play a role in Alzheimer’s disease and regulators made the call based on study results showing the drug seemed likely to benefit patients.

Biogen which developed Aduhelm with Japan’s Eisai Co. had halted two studies on the drug due to disappointing results. It later said further analysis showed the treatment was effective at higher doses.

The FDA is requiring Biogen to conduct a follow-up study.

The research Biogen submitted so far doesn’t give doctors as much insight as they would normally have into a drug said Dr. Brendan Kelley a neurologist at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. Its experts are still reviewing Aduhelm.

“Biogen went to the FDA with preliminary data so it makes it really challenging to know how to navigate” he said. More complete research would give doctors a better idea for how the drug will work in a broader patient population Kelley said.

Cost is another concern.

Biogen’s pricing for Aduhelm is “irresponsible and unconscionable” according to signs posted on office doors for The Neurology Center a Washington D.C.-area practice. The signs also refer to Aduhelm as a medication “of dubious effectiveness” and tell Biogen sales reps they are no longer welcomed in the center’s offices.

“As physicians we feel compelled to speak out and protest BIOGEN’s actions” one of the signs reads.

Neurology Center CEO Wendy Van Fossen said the signs went up in July but she declined to elaborate on why they were posted.

A Biogen spokeswoman said in an email that it was disappointing that some centers are denying access to the drug.

As for Aduhelm's effectiveness company data shows that plaque removal “is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit” said Biogen Chief Medical Officer Dr. Maha Radhakrishnan. She said regulators reviewed data from more than 3000 patients counting two late-stage studies and earlier research.

Doctors also are worried about whether patients taking Aduhelm will be able to get the regular brain scans needed to monitor their progress on the drug.

Issues with care access weren’t explored in the clinical research which also involved patients who were generally younger and healthier than those in the broader population noted Dr. Zaldy Tan director of the Cedars-Sinai memory and aging program.

The Los Angeles health system is still evaluating Aduhelm. Its committee of experts is considering things like which doctors will prescribe the drug and how to ensure patients are monitored for problems like dizziness or headaches develop. Bleeding in the brain is another potential side effect.

“Safety and access are real issues that need to be prioritized” Tan said.

Aduhelm also requires a deeper level of coordination among doctors than other Alzheimer’s treatments noted Radhakrishnan.

Prescribing doctors have to work with neurologists radiologists and nurse practitioners to diagnose patients confirm the presence of plaque in the brain get them started on the treatment and then monitor them.

“All of this is work in progress"" Radhakrishnan said.

Uncertainty about insurance coverage is another holdup.

Some insurers have decided not to cover the drug. Others including the major Medicare Advantage insurer Humana haven't made a decision yet but are reviewing claims case by case in the meantime.

The federal Medicare program is expected to make a national coverage determination by next spring that will lay out how it handles the drug.

Biogen executives said recently they think most sites that will offer the drug are waiting for clarity on reimbursement including that Medicare decision.

Medicare’s determination looms large for the Cedars-Sinai experts. Tan said they know they should reach a decision before the Medicare decision prompts more patient inquiries.

He said doctors also realize they aren’t just evaluating Aduhelm: They’re also thinking about how to handle similar treatments that could get FDA approval.

“We want to make sure we get it right” Tan said.

Melissa Garville died suddenly of an apparent pulmonary embolism on Thanksgiving Day 2020 at age 39.

Garville head of corporate communications at investment firm BlackRock left behind her husband of five years David Mazza 39 and their two young daughters Olivia 5 and Samantha 4.

A loving online obituary described the couple’s “life of adventure together which took them from ski mountains to national parks to the beaches of Nantucket. Melissa and Dave were the perfect complements. Their eyes shone when they looked at each other.”

A trove of images posted with the tribute reveals shots of a beaming Melissa Garville celebrating weddings meals out Christmas with her children and other family festivities with her parents Gregory and Christine Garville.

The doting grandparents even rented a neighboring Battery Park apartment so they could babysit according to their Manhattan Supreme Court filing.

But after Melissa’s untimely death Mazza allegedly “began making it increasingly challenging for [the Garvilles] to have visitation with the children” they charge in legal papers.

In September Mazza told the Garvilles he had found new love and was taking the kids to California.

“Not a day goes by without me thinking about Melissa” he wrote in the message included in the court file. “In this time of pain I had something beautiful come to me at the same time.”

He’d “reconnected” with a coworker whose daughter is close in age to his own kids and “she and I made the decision to be together and start a blended family in Los Angeles where they currently live. This is best for us so we can all be happy and healthy.

“While we may be moving I do not intend to stop FaceTime and there will be special visits” he pledged.

But the Garvilles say Mazza “has not responded meaningfully” to their requests for continued visits and want a judge to intervene.

“After the terrible and sudden loss of their mother we are concerned that the children would likely experience a second traumatic sense of abandonment if they are not allowed to maintain a regular relationship with us” they said in court papers.

It’s unclear when the couple last saw their grandchildren in person.

The grandparents want a judge to appoint a lawyer for Olivia and Samantha and grant them at least three weekend visits per year along with extended visits during summer.

Mazza said he “had no knowledge of the existence of a lawsuit” calling the situation “deeply personal” and declining further comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vZmluYW5jZS1hbmQtZWNvbm9taWNzLzIwMjEvMTAvMTYvaG93LXRvLXRoaW5rLWFib3V0LXRoZS11bnN0b3BwYWJsZS1yaXNlLW9mLWluZGV4LWZ1bmRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to think about the unstoppable rise of index funds,"T HE HISTORY of modern finance is littered with ideas that worked well enough at small scale—railway bonds Japanese skyscrapers sliced-and-diced mortgage securities—but morphed into monstrosities once too many punters piled in. When it comes to sheer size no mania can compare with that for passive investing. Funds that track the entire market by buying shares in every company in America’s S & P 500 say rather than guessing which will perform better than average have attained giant scale. Fully 40% of the total net assets managed by funds in America are in passive vehicles reckons the Investment Company Institute an industry group. The phenomenon warrants scrutiny.

Index funds have grown because of the validity of the core insight underpinning them: conventional investment funds are by and large a terrible proposition. The vast majority fail to beat the market over the years.

The Tenth Church of Christ Scientist,"WBEZ brings you fact-based news and information. Sign up for our newsletters to stay up to date on the stories that matter.

As a child growing up in Hyde Park Rivka Hozinsky watched people coming and going from the Tenth Church of Christ Scientist a building that commanded attention among a block of historical houses and one-flats.

But today the sanctuary sits empty and crumbling. So Hozinsky asked RESET: “What’s the story of the long-abandoned church at East 57th Street and Blackstone Avenue?”

Built in 1917 (some sources say 1915) for the Christian Science denomination the church has a classical revival entry. Tall stone columns support a hefty carved crown and two monumental walls curve out on both sides like a pair of unfurled scrolls. Beginning in the 1960s it housed the St. Stephen’s Church of God in Christ.

But since 1997 the building has sat empty as multiple owners have struggled to redevelop the structure.

The building has been owned by Zhendong “John” Liu since 2015 who would not offer WBEZ free access inside. However over the years other explorers have gotten in including prominent architecture writer Lee Bey and photographer Eric Holubow.

Bey’s pictures show a colossal dome with a glass central aperture to let the sun into the grand space it hangs over. In Holubow’s photos  taken in 2009 you can see the ravages of time: Crumbling plaster lie all over the bare floor graffiti is on the walls and big scars mark places where ornamental pieces were torn off.

The church designed by Coolidge and Hodgdon was meant to be an idealized classically-inspired space — more like a stately Roman temple than a traditional Christian sanctuary. The design was largely inspired by Chicago architect Spencer Solon Beman who famously planned the town (today the neighborhood) of Pullman and has been called the “chief theorist of Christian Science architecture.”

After Beman converted to the Christian denomination around 1907 he felt its churches should represent the style of early Christians not the overly romanticized Gothic style of later Catholicism according to an article written by a church librarian.

At one time there were 17 active Christian Science churches in Chicago. Many of the buildings survive but have been transformed into apartments or are used by other Christian denominations.

Stalled redevelopment

Liu the developer who bought the Hyde Park church hopes to fill its cavernous domed interior with condominiums. He paid $650000 nearly six years after the previous developer-owner Konstantinos Antoniou lost the building in foreclosure.

But his plan has stalled for years in part because of a long-running conflict with neighbors city officials and preservationists over what can or should be saved.

According to Liu the hold-up is due to an agreement between a previous owner neighbors and city officials. That owner agreed to put parking for the condo’s residents in the building’s basement. But Liu says soil tests show the water table is too high. The alternative putting the parking at ground level would require demolishing the building’s stunning facade. In several emails to city officials Liu shared with me he pleaded for leeway on the off-street parking requirements “for the love of this building.”

The city of Chicago declined to comment on the development other than to point to the public record.

Over the entrance an ornate carving reads: Tenth Church of Christ Scientists. Mary Hall / WBEZ

There’s another factor that may be slowing Liu’s attempt to revitalize the church: He is also in the midst of redeveloping a different historical church the Fifth Church of Christ Scientist in Kenwood. Built in 1914 and also designed by Beman the building has been vacant since 2003. Like its peer on Blackstone the church has seen a couple of development plans fail.

Liu bought the Kenwood church for $650000 in 2014. An extensive rebuild retained the façade and some interior spaces. The 13 townhouses created first went up for sale in July 2019 with asking prices starting at $1.17 million . More than two years later real estate and Cook County records indicate none of the units have sold. Meanwhile 43 townhouses have sold in Kenwood according to the real estate site Redfin at prices that top out at about $560000 — half the cost of buying in the old Fifth Church.

Liu said five of the units are owned and will be occupied by investors in the project and only eight are for sale. Public records don’t identify the investors and Liu declined to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdHJ1bXAtYmFja2VkLXJlcHVibGljYW4tY2hhbGxlbmdlcnMtZG9uYXRpb25zLWxhZ2dpbmctYmFkbHktMjAyMS0xMNIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdHJ1bXAtYmFja2VkLXJlcHVibGljYW4tY2hhbGxlbmdlcnMtZG9uYXRpb25zLWxhZ2dpbmctYmFkbHktMjAyMS0xMD9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trump-backed Republican challengers' donations lagging badly,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbG9jYWxwcm92LmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2dlcmFsZC1uLi1wZXRyaW4tcGFzc2VzLWF0LTk00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gerald N.

Since then Edward and Kevin Glazer have sold a combined 9.5 million of their shares which were converted to Class A on purchase with Baron Capital Group becoming the largest shareholder outside the family now owning 12825450 worth more than £145 million.

Tybourne Capital Management (HK) Ltd Invesco Capital Management LLC and Jupiter Asset Management Ltd all acquired more shares to move above the five per cent threshold requiring market confirmation which will come in due course.

There are currently 20 further companies with shares in United but the percentages change daily as trades are made on the market.

EVERETT — The union that represents The Boeing Company’s machinists began negotiations Friday after the company announced it would terminate workers who don’t comply with a new vaccine mandate.

“We are not against vaccinations and believe the vaccine is good for public health and safety” wrote the IAM District 751 union in a letter to its members. “However we must advocate for all our members; those that will not become vaccinated along with members who will get vaccinated. No matter a member’s opinion on this issue we must stand and protect our members’ jobs as best we can. We are looking at all options as we move through effects bargaining.”

More than 100 people protested the mandate Friday near the IAM District 751 union hall. People lined both sides of Airport Road with signs that had messages supporting “medical freedom.”

“We began hearing this week about potential walkouts or wildcat strikes” the union wrote. “We want to be clear. The Union cannot encourage a wildcat strike withholding our labor a sick out or walk out in any form due to the no strike/no lockout clause in our contract.”

The union’s letter to its members said it does not plan to pursue legal action against Boeing at this time. The bargaining and rally came after Boeing announced earlier this week it will require its employees to get vaccinated. Workers must be vaccinated by Dec. 8 or have an approved reasonable accommodation based on medical or religious beliefs. The forthcoming federal vaccine mandate is expected to apply to roughly half of the county’s workforce.

Andrew T. Ward was named vice president and chief investment officer at the University of Chicago effective Oct. 20.

Mr. Ward will oversee the investment management of the university's $10 billion endowment. He will replace Mark A. Schmid who retired from the university on Sept. 1 a news release said Oct. 15.

Mr. Ward was previously vice president and CIO at Boeing Co. Chicago where he oversaw its defined benefit plan and 401(k) plan which have more than $100 billion in combined assets.

Elizabeth Tulach Boeing's deputy CIO is replacing Mr. Ward as CIO Boeing spokesman Michael D. Friedman said in an email. Before arriving at Boeing Ms. Tulach was a senior vice president at GE Capital and an assistant vice president and director of private equity at University of Chicago.

David Dohnalek Boeing's senior vice president and treasurer said in an internal memo shared by Mr. Friedman: ""With deep investment fund management and leadership experience both inside and outside Boeing Liz is perfectly suited for this role and I'm confident she'll ensure our world-class Trust Investments team continues its legacy of success.""

At University of Chicago this is the second time Mr. Ward has succeeded Mr. Schmid as a CIO having replaced him as Boeing's top investment official when Mr. Schmid left in 2009 to join the University of Chicago.

At Boeing Mr. Ward had been managing director of investment strategy and asset allocation before his time as CIO.

In the University of Chicago news release Mr. Ward who graduated from the university with an MBA from the Booth School of Business in 1997 said ""I am honored for the opportunity to return to the University of Chicago. I look forward to leading a world-class investment team at one of the world's leading research universities.""

A new development in Seattle at 1200 Stewart aims to do just that by repurposing a full-size Boeing 747 as a lounge area.

The project is being undertaken by developers Westbank and designed by Henriquez Partners Architects. As per renderings published last year the plane will wear a bare aluminum finish and sit suspended between the two 48-story highrise buildings being built on Denny Triangle. Of course the wings are to be cut down significantly to allow the plane to fit neatly between the towers. Construction is expected to be completed in 2022.

The plane will sit in the galleria between the two apartment towers. Westbank

The interior of the plane will be stripped entirely and repurposed and is expected to be used as a lounge and office area. As reported by MSN the three-story retail podium surrounding the plane will feature a live music venue run by industry stalwarts Live Nation and a Trader Joe's grocery store among other tenants.

Seattle is a city is known for the Seahawks Dr. Frasier Crane and of course Boeing. Serving as one of the biggest employers in the city it's said that there are few Seattleites who don't know a friend or family member who hasn't worked for the company. Thus featuring Boeing's most famous plane in the new building is an excellent tribute that very much fits the fabric of the city.

Speaking to this angle Westbank noted “The unique geometry of the galleria at 1200 Stewart presents the opportunity to create a distinct presence downtown for a company that has played an integral role in Seattle historically as well as today as an economic leader and global innovator.""

The plane itself is a former United Airlines Boeing 747-400 tail number N178UA according to SimpleFlying. Originally delivered to the airline in 1990 it served for over two decades before entering storage in 2014. Reportedly it racked up over 13000 take-offs—and an equal number of landings—throughout its service history. Enthusiasts on the Airliner forums have raised questions about how the huge airliner will be moved to the construction site; The Drive has reached out to the developers for comment.

With the famous Jumbo Jet going out of production it's very much the end of an era for Boeing. Once construction is complete at 1200 Stewart however there'll be one more tribute to the plane that cemented the company as a global player in the aerospace industry."

Now it’s a newly built six-unit condominium complex with a Peloton-equipped gym and other high-end touches selling for the combined asking price of $4.2 million.

That late September afternoon at 282 Centre St. a faded red ticket clung to the rusted fence one of 20 city code violations issued in the two years since a local developer bought the place.

The boarded-up Dorchester house looked as bad as it smelled: An overgrown lawn discarded liquor and beer bottles and the stench of rotting garbage wafting from an overflowing trash can.

The building owner in both cases is Douglas R. George the developer and landlord whose wife City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George is one of two finalists running for mayor. He has been a quietly visible part of her campaign — standing behind her at campaign rallies and in television advertisements.

He is also an active player on the city real estate scene but few know the full breadth of George’s property holdings or how his business dealings with the city could force his wife to act carefully to avoid conflicts of interest should she be elected mayor.

George and his companies own some 55 properties in Boston with an assessed value of $54 million according to a Globe analysis of deeds and corporate records. His portfolio has run the full socioeconomic gamut from million-dollar condominiums and modern apartments geared toward young professionals to tidy two- and three-family homes that look well maintained from the street. But he also owns tired multifamily apartment buildings with broken windows and rotted porches and at least eight vacant lots and abandoned buildings that have drawn the ire of neighbors.

He has plans pending before the Boston Planning & Development Agency to build a tower as high as 18 stories with 120 residential units in South Boston.

Boston’s zoning code focuses power in City Hall so developers large and small have to deal with the city all the time. The city also regulates landlords and protects the rights of tenants. The code enforcement police tax assessor building officials and housing inspectors all work for the mayor. And each has tangled with Essaibi George’s husband in recent years.

A Globe analysis found that since 2008 the city has cited George’s properties for more than 550 code violations with fines totaling more than $40000 according to Boston’s database of code enforcement violations.

The tally included 347 violations with more than $25000 in fines marked “closed” which signifies the penalty had been paid according to the city. Another 205 violations with nearly $15000 in fines remain “open” meaning they remain unpaid or under appeal.

George’s properties have been cited 376 times for trash 98 times for overgrown weeds and 15 times for failing to shovel snow according to the data. The tally includes 82 code violations since Councilor Essaibi George launched her campaign for mayor in January.

George’s lawyer initially disputed the accuracy of the city’s record of violations calling the total grossly exaggerated. After reviewing the Globe’s compilation of public records attorney David Rich said the city had not properly notified his client of the violations.

“This is a broken system” Rich said. “This is not a Douglas George issue but rather a citywide systemic failure.”

Rich noted that the majority of the violations were for improper trash storage which he said was the fault of tenants. The city however holds property owners responsible for such violations.

Essaibi George’s campaign bridled at the Globe scrutiny of the properties owned and managed by the candidate’s husband.

“The Globe is throwing anything it can at the wall to see what sticks as it relates to Annissa’s husband” said a statement from campaign spokeswoman Nicole Caravella. “If Annissa’s husband is in violation of any regulation he will pay he will be held accountable just like anyone else. She has made it abundantly clear in many interviews her plans to keep that separation between her work and her husband’s.”

Douglas R. George declined an interview request but issued a five-page letter through his lawyer alleging that the Globe was seeking to ruin his reputation to aid the campaign of his wife’s political rival City Councilor Michelle Wu.

“Mr. George has a strong record of creating needed housing in the City of Boston” the letter read adding that “George strongly disputes that his properties are a blight on the community.”

Experts said that while there is nothing unusual or questionable about a municipal official having a spouse who has business interactions with the city it can be a challenge to make sure that no conflicts of interest arise.

“It’s a delicate situation for a mayor to [have a] spouse with those kinds of business activities” said Alan Mallach a senior fellow at the Center for Community Progress a national nonprofit working to combat vacant and deteriorated properties. “Because the fact is those are business activities that constantly in one way or another — whether it has to do with code enforcement or zoning or building permits — involve the city.”

Essaibi George has no ownership or management role in any of her husband’s many companies but state law prohibits any public employee from official involvement in matters in which their spouse has a financial interest.

Essaibi George declined an interview request. In a statement her campaign said that as mayor her work would remain separate from that of her husband. The campaign also provided a September letter from the state Ethics Commission that outlined how the conflict of interest law would affect her potential mayoral administration.

The advisory noted that when it came to her husband’s businesses the law bars her from acting in her official capacity in discussions informal lobbying offering advice or even personally delegating matters to aides. Real estate is particularly complex because the conflict of interest law can extend to neighboring properties. The ethics advisory noted that as mayor Essaibi George should not take any action on matters involving properties abutting or near her husband’s land. The campaign said she intended to follow the advisory.

Erin O’Brien a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston said it would be unfair to prohibit political spouses from operating a business. But she said there are beyond the need to abide by ethics law practical concerns about how front-line city workers would regulate Douglas George’s properties if Essaibi George wins.

“As a street-level bureaucrat do you want to give a major violation to the mayor’s husband? I think most of us would answer no” said O’Brien.

“If you’re one of the tenants would you want to complain?” O’Brien said.

Essaibi George has pledged that if she is elected her husband will not seek city approval for new developments although he is involved in two projects currently pending before the Boston Planning & Development Agency. The campaign and George did not answer a question about whether he would continue to pursue those developments if she is elected.

Douglas George’s businesses have offered some support for her bid for mayor.

Last month at least 17 of his properties displayed Essaibi George for mayor signs. One stood outside a brick two-family on Saxton Street where in July city inspectors issued George violations after the bathroom ceiling collapsed.

Then there is Columbia Flats a six-story 40-unit apartment complex being built by one of George’s limited liability companies on Massachusetts Avenue blocks from the couple’s home.

An unfinished ground-floor room in the building is being used as storage space for the Essaibi George campaign. A Globe reporter watched as a flatbed truck from a Hyde Park auto body company double parked out front and a man loaded dozens of campaign signs.

State campaign finance law does not bar businesses from posting political signs but does prohibit campaigns from accepting in-kind donations from businesses and generally requires that market-rate rent be paid for storage space and the use of vehicles.

Essaibi George’s campaign has not disclosed any rent payments to her husband’s companies for the sign storage or paying fees to the tow truck company which has donated to an independent political committee supporting her candidacy. The campaign and Douglas George did not respond to questions about the storage.

“If a campaign is receiving services from a corporation that must be disclosed in a timely manner” said Geoff Foster executive director of Common Cause Massachusetts. “If they are not that would raise serious concerns under our campaign finances laws.”

One of Essaibi George’s campaign signs overlooks a forlorn vacant lot on Blue Hill Avenue in Roxbury that her husband has owned since 2013.

A neighbor recalled a rare cleanup of the lot last month just before the preliminary mayoral election. But on the morning of Sept. 28 plenty of trash remained including heaps of brush a pile of broken lamps and an old tire.

“If she’s running for mayor she should beautify that” said the neighbor Marline Arana 51 whose opinion of Essaibi George was tainted by the condition of her husband’s lot. “Little things like that make a big difference in quality of life.”

Developers sometimes buy vacant lots cheap and let them sit because the land might become more valuable to build on years later. The practice of “land banking” can make sense from a business perspective. But poorly maintained lots can drag down a neighborhood attracting vandalism and other crime said Mallach from the Center for Community Progress who has studied the impact of vacant properties on cities.

Further north on Blue Hill Avenue one of George’s companies owns an abandoned house with peeling yellow paint broken windows and a roof partially open to the sky. Neighbors consider it an eyesore and wish he would clean it up and do something with it.

George does generally seek over time to improve properties he owns. He and his companies have constructed a 38-unit building at 35 South Huntington in Mission Hill which advertises lounges a gym and an outdoor deck. He has long bought crumbling buildings or vacant land and built something new.

Much of his real estate is concentrated in the Polish Triangle section of Dorchester just south of Andrew Square where he his wife and their children have long lived. Many of his two- and three-family homes there look relatively well maintained.

Those houses stand in contrast to the boarded-up brick building at 15 Medway Street in Lower Mills which George has owned since 2004. Neighbors said the property is often overgrown with weeds and has been a magnet for graffiti and illicit drinking.

The South Boston site where George has pitched an 18-story tower is currently a shuttered brick warehouse that last month had broken windows and a courtyard piled with old tires wood pallets and trash.

The Globe also examined the real estate holdings of the other mayoral finalist Wu. She and her husband Conor Pewarski a commercial real estate banker own just one piece of property — a two-family house in Roslindale where they live with their children. Wu’s mother lives in the other unit. There have been no code violations since they bought the house according to a city spokesman.

Beyond the properties under development Douglas R. George and his companies own two dozen or more rental properties in Boston with scores of units that require regular interactions with city building and housing inspectors who answer to the mayor. In April for example housing inspectors issued George a violation notice for a rat infestation at his worn three-family building on Esmond Street. Like all violations it was written on letterhead bearing the mayor’s name.

As a landlord George has also sometimes clashed with his tenants. Records show he has gone to court at least 20 times in the last decade to evict tenants including a 2019 case filed against a tenant living in the same building as Essaibi George’s popular Stitch House knitting store on Dorchester Avenue. The company that owns the building and filed for eviction Stitch House Real Estate LLC is owned records show by George not his wife.

George’s lawyer did not address the Stitch House case but said eviction is used as a “last resort” for tenants who endanger the safety of others or repeatedly fail to pay rent.

This July a roof leak collapsed the ceiling in Martha Jackson’s apartment in a building George owns. Jackson said she called one of George’s companies Polish Triangle Property Management for two weeks to no avail.

Saying she felt ignored Jackson 61 drove to Essaibi George’s campaign headquarters with pictures of the damage. The candidate was not there she said but the property management company responded almost immediately.

City inspectors issued George a half-dozen sanitary code violations. Inspectors also cited Jackson for a “severe accumulation of trash and debris” which George said hampered repair efforts. Jackson acknowledged that her apartment was messy but said she did not cause the leak in her roof which city inspections have noted since 2019. George said he responded swiftly to Jackson’s needs and has upheld his obligations as a landlord.

Now back home on Saxton Street Jackson would like to get rid of the Annissa Essaibi George for mayor sign lashed to the rusted fence outside her building.

“I want to take it down so badly” Jackson said. “It came from management.”

In oceanside Hull more than 80 percent of government buildings schools and houses of worship are at risk of such significant flooding that a major storm could render them inoperable or inaccessible. In Adams at the far northwestern corner of the state nearly every commercial building is vulnerable to a similar fate. And in Lawrence in the Merrimack Valley  flooding could shut down 75 percent of the city’s police and fire stations waste-water treatment facility and other critical infrastructure.

Overall in Massachusetts an estimated 162798 residential properties 12918 miles of roads 14644 commercial properties and nearly 2500 other critical buildings such as hospitals power stations and government buildings are at risk of becoming deluged and inoperable the report estimates.

By 2051 as climate change produces stronger storms and rising tides an additional 27714 residential properties 1181 miles of roads 2119 commercial properties and more than 450 critical buildings will face similar risks the report projects.

“As we saw a few weeks ago following the devastation of Hurricane Ida our nation’s infrastructure is not built to a standard that protects against the level of flood risk we face today let alone how those risks will grow over the next 30 years as the climate changes” said Matthew Eby executive director of the First Street Foundation.

Across the country the report estimates that risk to residential properties will increase by 10 percent over the next 30 years with 13.6 million at risk of flooding in 2051 while the number of commercial properties threatened by flooding will increase by 7 percent over the same period.

In addition it estimates that more than a quarter of the nation’s critical infrastructure will be at risk of flooding by mid-century a 6 percent rise from today with 2.2 million miles of road threatened with flooding.

The highest concentration of flooding risk exists in Louisiana Florida Kentucky and West Virginia. Louisiana alone accounts for six of the top 20 most at-risk counties given all their low-lying land and the frequency of powerful storms.

The report uses different thresholds to define risk for different buildings and infrastructure. It considers roads impassable when flooding reaches 6 inches. Police and fire stations become inaccessible or inoperable at 1 foot of flooding while the same risks for power stations are quantified at 2 feet of flooding and 3.5 feet for hospitals.

In Massachusetts Suffolk County faces the greatest risks — today and in the future.

More than 45 percent of the county’s critical infrastructure including Logan International Airport hospitals and police and fire stations are at risk of flooding according to the report. Those risks are expected to increase by 20 percent by 2051.

The report estimates that more than a third of roads in Suffolk are at risk of flooding with those risks rising by 14 percent in 30 years. It also finds that nearly a third of the county’s commercial buildings and a fifth of its residential buildings are at risk of flooding increasing by 22 percent and 8 percent respectively in 2051.

Some neighborhoods of Boston are looking at potential devastation.

In the Seaport for example the report finds that all critical infrastructure and nearly all commercial buildings are at risk of becoming inoperable as a result of flooding by mid-century. It also estimates that nearly 90 percent of roads in the waterfront neighborhood are at risk of becoming inoperable in the same period.

“This report underlines the urgency of our efforts to ensure that everyone in Boston especially the most vulnerable and those disproportionately affected by climate change is better protected from these growing risks” said Mariama White-Hammond the city’s environment chief. “We are working with public and private partners to protect Boston’s people and infrastructure from sea-level rise and major coastal storms across all 47 miles of the city’s coastline.”

The city is anticipating at least 40 inches of sea-level rise by 2070 which is expected to disproportionately affect residents who are low-income elderly and people of color she said.

“Without action flood risk will increase” White-Hammond said. “The choices we make today to build a better Boston will significantly shape how we navigate climate change now and for generations to come.”

Earlier this year the First Street Foundation released a similar report on flooding that predicted the nation faces steep financial losses as a result of flooding in 2051 with annual losses of more than $32 billion a 61 percent increase from the estimated costs today.

In Massachusetts the foundation estimated that the financial losses from flooding would rise to $316 million in 30 years a 36 percent increase from today according to the report. The state now ranks sixth in terms of the number of residential properties — those with up to four units — likely to experience structural damage from flooding.

In Boston where more than 3000 properties a year will face substantial risk of damage from flooding those losses are likely to exceed $62 million a year in 30 years 75 percent more than today the previous report estimated.

Amy Longsworth director of the Boston Green Ribbon Commission called the latest report “extremely sobering.”

This is partly due to the rarity of the condition and partly as a result of late presentation to specialist services with many patients having already received a range of empirical therapies which might mask or complicate the initial signs and symptoms. In our patient for several years the presentation was inaccurately interpreted by the local team as a primary skin rash which had turned itchy rather than the primary sensation of an irritating itch driving scratching and the subsequent rash.

Although not very often seen as a manifestation of neurological conditions pruritus of central origin has been previously described in association with both central and/or peripheral nervous system injuries of diverse etiologies such as infection tumors demyelinating disorders and more frequently stroke [8 111213 151617]. Nevertheless we report a rare presentation of central itch induced by thalamic deep brain stimulation for the management of refractory neuropathic pain.

Acute pain and itch represent two distinct sensations with different underlying neural networks and behavioral responses (scratching versus withdraw). Although evidences from preclinical works support the existence of neural discrimination between itch and pain the neurobiology of chronic itch and pain share largely similar mechanisms [1 8910 13] common pathways and closely related thalamic relays [3 303132]. Central neuropathic itch may often present concomitant with neuropathic pain and may be even more dramatic in cases where it occurs in association with cutaneous sensory loss which combined may lead to incoercible scratching to the point of self-injury [7 8 13 161718].

In the present study the access to detailed brain imaging provided a unique opportunity for the investigation of the relationship between these systems in humans shedding light on the discussion regarding plausible mechanisms implicated in the manifestation and perpetuation of chronic neuropathic itch and pain.

Pain and itch crosstalk in physiological and pathological conditions

It has been consistently observed that painful stimuli suppress itch [5 9 33]. Pruriceptors are polymodal and may also respond to algogens [3 30]. Therefore the activation of small itch-selective neurons regardless of stimulus modalities generates itch whilst the activation of larger population of pain afferents and pain-mediating neurons in the spinal cord stimulates via glutamate release signaling inhibitory neurons to suppress itch [3 30 32]. Interestingly specialized itch projection neurons (detailed below) do not exhibit spontaneous activity as pain projection neurons do due to active inhibition exerted by pain-processing neurons. Suppressing this inhibition might provoke itch of central origin without any activation of primary pruriceptive neurons from the skin [3 303132 34 35]. This suggests that based on the described physiological interactions inhibition of pain may produce itch [30].

The pain/itch network crosstalk is also well illustrated through the mechanisms of action of opioids [35]. The administration of morphine inhibits pain at the expense of eliciting itch which is mediated by the direct activation of distinct isoforms of µ-opioid receptors (MOR) in the spine but likely also by other indirect mechanisms [30 35]. Given that in the present case thalamic DBS led the patient to experience a dramatic improvement of her otherwise long-standing refractory neuropathic pain it is plausible that effective suppression of pain via neuromodulation could have also modulated the pain/itch interacting networks contributing to perpetuation and exacerbation of itch.

Peripheral pathways and thalamic relays for pain and itch

The underlying neural mechanisms for itch sensation are still not completely understood [31]. Although historically itch was regarded as a weak form of pain both transmitted by the same type of non-myelinated C-fibres via the lateral spinothalamic tract (STT) to reach the thalamus and somatosensory cortex this notion has been challenged during the last decades [1 3 5]. Torebjörk and Ochoa showed already in the 1980s that intraneuronal microstimulation of subpopulations of unmyelinated C-fibres could evoke either pain or itch independently [5]. Furthermore the increase of frequency and amplitude of stimulation of itch fibers would not change the quality of sensation to pain [5]. Other authors showed that increasing dosages of histamine injection into the skin did not change itch to pain but led to increased itch sensation [5 6]. Therefore the ability to distinguish pain and itch originating from the same region amongst other evidence suggests completely different sensory qualities underpinned by distinct interacting neural networks [1 5].

Although advances in the understanding of the neurobiology of itch have been achieved questions regarding the mechanisms involved in chronic neuropathic itch remain to be further elucidated [30 31]. Thus far pre-clinical and clinical studies support the idea of a network imbalance leading to peripheral and central sensitization of nonhistaminergic itch-signaling neurons possibly combined with disruption of descending itch modulation pathways [1 3 9]. Pruriceptive STT neurons also respond to noxious mechanical and a combination of noxious thermal and chemical stimulation indicating a polymodal chemonociceptive function [4]. Itch has been shown to be encoded by about one-third of STT neurons; the other two-thirds are nociceptive only [4]. Microantidromic mapping of histaminergic and nonhistaminergic pruriceptive neurons in the primate has shown that these neurons integrate with the STT terminating in several thalamic nuclei of the lateral ventral basal and posterior complex [4]. Andrew and Craig et al. [33] demonstrated the existence of specific lamina I itch neurons projecting to the VPI and to the lateral border of VPL showing that itch is subserved by specific neural networks distinct from that responsible for pain and temperature information. Nociceptive STT neurons project more often to the posterior portion of the ventral medial nucleus [36] whilst thermoreceptive neurons of the STT have a distinct projection pattern to the posterior thalamus [36]. Davidson et al. [4] corroborated previous findings showing that both histamine-responsive and nonhistaminergic pruriceptive neurons terminate in the ventral posterior inferior and ventral posterior lateral nuclei however the latter has also connections with the suprageniculate and geniculate nuclei. Although it is likely that multiple areas within the thalamus remain relevant most pruriceptive STT neurons appear to track to the lateral portion of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus suggesting the prominent role of this area in the neurobiology of pruritus [4]. Detailed imaging available in our case indeed demonstrated the location of the active stimulating contact in this exact area. This information together with the clinical evidence of stimulation driven itch which objectively improved when the stimulation was ceased unilaterally in the corresponding hemibody but not in the opposite hemibody which continued to receive stimulation for the first time provides direct evidence of a “central itch” centre in the lateral portion of the ventral posterior lateral/ventral posteroinferior nuclei.

Thus in our patient the mechanism implicated in the development of severe itchy rash was pruritus triggered by stimulation of the lateral aspect of the ventral posterolateral and ventral posterior inferior nuclei which led to scratching and chronic inflammation of the skin. In addition subsequently intracutaneous inflammation caused by incoercible scratching might have led to further neurogenic inflammation and perpetuation of chronic itch in a vicious cycle [1 30 31 34].

Thalamocortical circuitry

Several brain regions have been implicated in the pathophysiology and shown to be activated during an itch [1 3 9 10]. These include brain areas involved in (i) recognition and attention to the symptom (thalamus primary and secondary somatosensory cortices) (ii) associated with emotional awareness and planning of motor response to itch (cingulate and insular cortices) (iii) associated with the subjective sensation of feeling of itch (the medial parietal cortex posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus) and (iv) related to the execution of motor response (supplementary premotor primary motor cortices striatum and cerebellum) [1 3 4]. Furthermore the act of scratching during itch has been shown to activate the ventral striatum medial prefrontal cortex anterior cingulate end orbitofrontal cortex which are well-known brain structures associated with pleasure [1 3 9].

Thus another potential mechanism for our observation may relate to the thalamo-cortical projections and somatotopic organization of ascending fibers within the posterior limb of the internal capsule and thalamic peduncles. As previously discussed specialized itch ascending STT lamina I neurons synapse with thalamic third neurons within the VPL and VPI nuclei which then project to somatosensory cortical regions cingulate insula and anterior cingulate. The thalamic peduncles consist of ascending and descending fibre bundles that detach from the corona radiata and internal capsule to connect thalamic nuclei not only to the cerebral cortex but to the brainstem spinal cord and cerebellum [37]. The anterior thalamic peduncle travels along the anterior limb of the internal capsule to connect projecting to the prefrontal cortex orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate. The fibres within the superior and posterior thalamic peduncles connect reciprocally the thalamus to central parietal and occipitotemporal areas of the cortex whilst the inferior thalamic peduncle runs medially to the posterior limb of the internal capsule reaching the posterior insula temporal cortex and the brainstem [4 33 37]. Because active contacts were sitting in the lateral border of the thalamus in close relationship with the internal capsule and thalamic peduncles the electric current may have not only stimulated the thalamus directly but also orthodromically stimulated these fibers giving rise to sensory disturbance interpreted as itch.

Despite of extensive neurological and dermatological investigation close clinical follow-up and systematic documentation this observational study has limitations. Firstly due to the severity of her skin lesions the patient was kept on previous pharmacological treatment throughout the evaluation period which might have partially contributed to improvement of itch. Secondly the evaluation of itch symptoms and skin lesions might have been biased by the open-label design of the study where both patient and medical staff were aware of which electrode had been temporarily switched off. Finally regarding limitations intrinsic to the method of image processing and analysis of the position of the active contacts within the thalamus the neural structures identified by the application of standard and normative stereotactic brain atlas might not correspond exactly to the patient’s specific neuroanatomy.

Pathophysiology of central itch remains complex. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the genesis and interactions between pain and itch may contribute to the further development of future analgesic and antipruritic therapies. Targeted neuromodulation of the peripheral and/or central nervous system has already proven to be highly effective in selected conditions associated with refractory neuropathic pain [38]. Previous works using transcranial direct current stimulation and cutaneous field stimulation have also reported on the potential benefits of neuromodulation in the management of neuropathic chronic itch [39 40]. The present work sheds light on mechanisms implicated in the manifestation of central itch secondary to direct stimulation of deep brain structures opening an avenue for further investigation of neuromodulative strategies in the treatment of such challenging conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,

""We've always known"" says Debbie Staples a great-great-granddaughter of Green's who heard the story from her grandmother. … ""He made the whiskey and he taught Jack Daniel. And people didn't believe it … it's hurtful. I don't know if it was because he was a Black man.""

But people believe it now — in large part because Brown-Forman Corporation owner of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey has acknowledged the foundational role Green played in the brand's development.

""The truth of the matter is Nearest Green was the first head distiller of Jack Daniels whiskey"" says Matt Blevins global brand director for Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey. ""We're very proud of this story and are very committed to amplifying it and acknowledging that. In the past we did not amplify it the way that we could have in earlier eras but we're about the future and moving forward.""

America's first-known Black master distiller

The story begins in Lynchburg Tennessee current home of the Jack Daniel Distillery. In the mid-1800s Green's slaveholders hired him out to a local preacher named Dan Call. Green who had a reputation as a skilled distiller made whiskey for Call using a sugar maple charcoal filtering process that is believed to have originated in West Africa. Daniel a boy who worked for Call became Green's apprentice and learned the special technique that gave the Tennessee whiskey its smooth taste.

After emancipation in 1863 when enslaved people in rebel states were freed Daniel purchased Call's distillery and hired Green as Jack Daniel Distillery's first master distiller.

""The best knowledge that we have is that they had a mentor-and-mentee sort of a relationship and I would say a friendship"" says Blevins. ""The stories that have been passed down [talk] about the care that Jack Daniel took to always acknowledge … the Green family.""

There are no known pictures of Green but there is one of Daniel with Green's son George sitting next to Daniel rather than being relegated to the back.

""That photograph shows the respect that they had for one another and for their families"" says Stefanie Benjamin an assistant professor of tourism management at the University of Tennessee Knoxville. ""To be not only allowed in that photograph but also positioned in the foreground and sitting right next to Jack Daniels himself.""

Search for the truth

Green's role in the history of the brand was uncovered by a writer and entrepreneur named Fawn Weaver who became fascinated by Green's unheralded contribution to the world's most popular whiskey. After extensive research including interviews with Green's descendants Weaver shared her documentation with the company.

""I was very pleasantly surprised when they embraced my research and updated their records to reflect that"" Weaver told VOA via email. ""I think it said a lot about the character of their company that they moved that quickly to course correct.""

Jack Daniel's has incorporated Green's contributions into the official history of the brand but Weaver has gone a step further. She invested $1 million of her own money to establish Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey which is now the fastest-growing independent American whiskey brand in U.S. history.

The company's master distiller is Victoria Eady Butler Green's great‐great‐granddaughter.

""Uncle Nearest is the most-awarded American whiskey or bourbon of 2019 2020 and 2021 and the fact that it is the bloodline of Nearest Green blending and approving what goes into our bottles is something I marvel at regularly"" Weaver says. ""Victoria is an absolute natural when it comes to blending and to watch her work is to see something pretty darn close to perfection.""

Family business

Seven generations of Green's family have worked at the Jack Daniel Distillery a tradition that continues today with Staples and two of her siblings. But the Green family did not benefit when the Daniel family sold the Jack Daniel distillery to Brown-Forman for $20 million in 1956.

""Although they [the Green family] were very well off in terms of finances [in the 1800s] in that time they were not the owners or co-owners of the Jack Daniel distillery"" Benjamin says. ""And so those millions of dollars have been passed down through generations of the Jack Daniel family and not necessarily the Green family.""

Weaver's Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey has joined forces with Jack Daniel's to launch a program that provides support expertise and resources to African-American entrepreneurs entering the spirits industry.

Staples says her family is thrilled their great-great-grandfather is finally being recognized.

""It's kind of mind-boggling … and we are so proud"" Staples says. ""And to think that from here to Africa that recipe goes all the way back. And to think that he played such an important role in establishing this company. It sometimes seems unreal. It really does.""

Because of Weaver's tenacity Green's story although left untold for more than a century will not be lost to history. But that's not the case with so many other stories of Black achievement and contributions to the nation.

""Part of telling his story and sharing his legacy is to give credit and to give attention to a person who if it wasn't for him we wouldn't have the Jack Daniel whiskey as we know it today"" Benjamin says. ""It showcases yet another example of how formerly enslaved people Black people African American people who have really built this country are left out of the dominant narrative that we tell.""

Your grandparents ate it your grandchildren will too -- but coming down from a pandemic surge in sales Campbell Soup (CPB 1.55%) has gotten a little too cold for investors. Campbell founded in 1869 is a victim of an unprecedented pandemic cycle. But if investors stay patient they might still have the chance to scoop up some delicious returns.

Stocked pantries

Consumers loaded their cupboards with soup during amid lockdowns and now that more of them are vaccinated they're buying fewer Campbell products. The company recently reported an 11% decline in sales for the fourth quarter and projected essentially no growth for its fiscal 2022 performance. Investors didn't like this news and they seem to viewing the can as only half full.

But despite this sharp pullback in sales consumers are still buying more of Campbell's brands than they did before the pandemic hit.

Campbell's fourth-quarter net sales are up 5% over the same period in 2019 before the pandemic hit even though they are down from the fourth quarter of 2020.

The good news is that the crisis put Campbell into more households expanding its consumer base for the future. On a fourth-quarter earnings call Campbell's CEO Mark Clouse said ""ready to serve end market consumption"" grew 21% between the 2019 and 2021 fourth quarters. It was led by Chunky Slow Kettle and Well Yes! soups and he plans to retain these customers.

Nevertheless the stock hit a 52-week-low of $40.05 on Aug. 27 just before the company released results for its fourth quarter which ended Aug. 1. The stock is now trading around $41 well below its 52-week high of $53.77 in January.

Dominating store shelves

Campbell makes the soup that made Andy Warhol famous so it's easy to forget that it's not just about the soup. If you've ever said ""Uh-oh Spaghettio's"" you're talking Campbell. Its products include mainstays such as V8 juices Pepperidge Farms snacks Pace picante sauces Prego pasta sauces and Archway cookies to name a few. In 2018 Campbell acquired one of the world's largest makers of salty snacks Snyder's-Lance.

Campbell has plenty of competition but it has fended off other food companies in its categories for more than 150 years. It's difficult to walk through a grocery store and not encounter one of it's products. It is considered a wide-moat stock because grocers are reluctant to give its shelve space to lesser-known brands.

Looming constraints

The companies that will succeed the most in the quarters to come are the ones that can best overcome pandemic bottlenecks and rising inflation. Already supply disruptions labor woes and commodity shortages have pushed inflation above 5% and there's likely more to come.

These same risks apply to Campbell but the company boasts a stalwart logistics chain able to withstand these issues better than many other companies that haven't been around since the 1800s.

The company touts plans to raise prices and enhance supply chain productivity. It also expects its multiyear cost-savings program to deliver $850 million in savings by the end of its 2022 fiscal year -- including synergies achieved from its Snyder's-Lance acquisition.

With nearly $8.5 billion in annual sales this is a significant savings demonstrating that Campbell benefits from huge economies of scale to help meet the challenges ahead.

Soup on sale

Campbell is trading at a 12-month trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 12.5 which is lower than some of its food-making peers. Post Holdings (POST 1.08%) trades for over 37. J.M. Smucker (SJM 1.70%) trades for over 17. ConAgra Brands (CAG 1.14%) trades for 13.6.

Buying the bad news

Campbell isn't performing badly -- there just isn't as much fear-based consumer consumption as there was last year to spike its sales. Additionally its guidance for the challenging quarters ahead may not be as dire as investors currently perceive.

The company has transparently acknowledged its difficulties and laid out plausible strategies to deal with them. Meanwhile it's paying a roughly 3.5% dividend yield.

The stock now trading slightly above its low could prove a solid bet for investors patient enough to weather the rest of the pandemic cycle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZGVzaWduLWNoaWNrZW4tbnVnZ2V0LXNoYXBlcy1mb29kLXNjaWVudGlzdC1wZXJkdWUtd2hhdC1qb2ItbGlrZS0yMDIxLTEw0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9kZXNpZ24tY2hpY2tlbi1udWdnZXQtc2hhcGVzLWZvb2Qtc2NpZW50aXN0LXBlcmR1ZS13aGF0LWpvYi1saWtlLTIwMjEtMTA_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I work in food science at Perdue. Here's what it's like.,"Mark Tolbert.

Mark Tolbert 47 is a food scientist at Perdue helping design new products.

He oversees the company's innovation facility and projects and his team of 10.

This is his career story and what his job is like as told to freelancer Perri Ormont Blumberg.

This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Mark Tolbert a 47-year-old senior innovation center facilities manager at Perdue Foods from Salisbury Maryland about his job. It has been edited for length and clarity.

I grew up in southwestern Virginia on a beef cattle farm. Working on the farm was a daily job and I found that I'm naturally pretty mechanically inclined whether repairing things or troubleshooting problems.

Before and during college I worked at a veterinarian clinic a dairy farm a grocery store and even as a manager of a slaughter operation. I attended Virginia Tech for college where I double-majored in animal science and food science.

I took classes in meat science which is how I got my first job out of college in the early '90s managing a pilot plant at Central Soya a soy processing company that incorporated soy into meat products. After three years I went back to school for a master's degree in meat science.

From there I started working for Campbell Soup Company with leading roles across various brands including Chunky Soup and SpaghettiO's. In the last two years at Campbell's I ran quality control for those brands which was a very hands-on role. I also managed a team within the ingredients group at Campbell's. We worked on one project where we had over 700 ingredients and had to reduce the ingredients by 40%. In 2015 I started working at Perdue Farms.

I'm accountable for everything within the boundaries of the 5.14-acre property

The Perdue innovation center.

Perdue



I'm even responsible for a few things outside it like the railroad tracks everyone crosses on the way to our facility. I'm responsible for every blade of grass all the lightbulbs and everything in between.

Upon accepting the role I knew I would quickly expand it into something much bigger as my curiosity wouldn't allow me to settle into the more narrow job description for long. I manage research and development (R&D) projects like developing turkey- and drumstick-shaped nuggets in line with Thanksgiving. Our nuggets run through equipment I'm very familiar with so I helped develop the mold plates that contain the shape of the nugget.

I also was involved with the development of a blend of Perdue chicken with vegetables. My previous experience at Campbell's was essential since I had extensive experience working with frozen vegetables something people generally are not as familiar with at a meat company.

During my first hour on the premises I walk through the facility saying hello to each of my 10 team members

I start to gauge the morale of the group and figure out what might have to be done that day. On my own time I'll sometimes reread books like ""The Ideal Team Player"" by Patrick Lencioni and ""Lincoln on Leadership"" by Donald T. Phillips to refresh my memory on being a leader. I focus on everyone being a team player which includes being humble and hardworking.

I'll then check out the plant trials board which lets me know what we need to work on. Typically we average about two trials per day and it can get quite busy managing that. Sometimes we might run a special new experimental product and those days are always extra exciting.

There are always ""tastings"" or what we refer to as ""product cuttings"" in the days following our trials. Usually this will involve the R&D technologist leading the project along with representatives from sensory sales and marketing. Some product cuttings focus on flavor whereas others will look at technical data like shape weight breading adhesion etc. New shapes often require two to three iterations to get them to perform as expected.

After that I spend a little time seeing if anyone or any project needs extra attention. From there I'm off to my projects.







I love the daily 'strangeness.' There really is something different every day and I enjoy those challenges that give way to problem-solving.

I even keep a count in my head as the day goes on of the ratio of challenges versus solutions. I aim to keep it at 1:1 but some days it might be more like 5:1.

In the same week at work I can make breaded chicken nuggets (in any shape I choose to design) as well as pet treats hot dogs turkey deli ham – the list goes on. In my previous roles and now here at Perdue you'll find very few if any poultry and meat products in a grocery store that I haven't made.

Perdue Farms turned 100 in 2020. We were going to break a Guinness record for the largest serving of smoked chicken. The goal was going to be over 9000 pounds. I had specified all the equipment purchased an oven and aligned donations of utilities and tractor trailers. Unfortunately our plans were sidelined by COVID-19 but maybe we'll try again soon.

And with that we’re bringing back the annual Washington Wizards Ticket Exchange Thread. Last year we didn’t post a thread because of stricter coronavirus protocols and also because most home games were played without fans.

How do I put my tickets on?

Comment to this thread with your available games prices and email address which should be in this format (Mine is aleeinthdmv AT gmail DOT com) The purpose of this is to minimize the risk of spammers coming into your inbox. I discourage price gouging for certain games like those against the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers but you are free to list the prices you feel are appropriate. For season ticket per game pricing as a guide click here. For individual ticket prices click here. When your tickets are sold please reply to your original comment so we can delete it. We’ll make sure the comments are open throughout the season. Be aware that you as the ticket holder are generally held accountable for the misbehavior of the buyers of your tickets in a private sale.

How do I buy tickets from this thread?

Email the seller directly. After the sale is done which is between you and the seller (most sales would likely involve electronic payment via PayPal/Venmo/CashApp/Apple Cash etc.) you will receive the tickets electronically. Also be aware of the coronavirus protocols at Capital One Arena which we’ll go over in a bit. If you don’t want to wear a mask don’t come to the arena. It won’t go well for you. And if you are unvaccinated against the coronavirus want to sit close to the court AND you don’t care to show a negative test? Again just don’t come. And do you want to behave like an idiot just for your 15 seconds of fame? If that’s you don’t come and make a fool out of yourself.

And so you know BULLETS FOREVER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTUAL SALE BETWEEN A SELLER AND THE BUYER. THIS IS BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU. WE ARE ALSO NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF BUYERS’ BEHAVIOR AT A GAME.

Just letting you know that everyone enters this at their own risk. This is just a listing.

Coronavirus protocols at Capital One Arena for the 2021-22 NBA season

Here are some things you must know before attending a Wizards game this season. Things are subject to change if the D.C. Council and/or Mayor pass or issue new regulations/laws. We will update this if needed.

FACEMASKS ARE REQUIRED — D.C. has an indoor mask mandate. If you are an “anti-masker” you won’t be welcome in the arena. You may only remove your mask to eat or drink. CONCESSION/RETAIL STANDS ARE CASHLESS ONLY — Contactless payments are becoming the norm in society before the coronavirus pandemic. If you don’t want to pay with Apple/Google/Samsung Pay you can still use your credit/debit card. As of Oct. 17 Capital One Arena does NOT require proof of vaccination to attend as a fan in MOST locations — A growing number of arenas have required at least proof of partial vaccination like those in New York City. Toronto requires full vaccination period. About half of the NBA arenas require vaccination proof OR a negative COVID-19 test for all fans. But for now the Wizards don’t require any of these for at least most fans unless they are sitting in courtside seats which are in close proximity to the court which is defined as 15 feet. It is true that some events at Capital One Arena like some recent concerts last summer required all people proof of vaccination OR a negative COVID-19 test but that was because of the management of the concert promoter not Monumental Sports & Entertainment. If you are attending a Wizards game in seats 15 feet or closer to the court you will have multiple methods of showing proof of your vaccination OR your negative COVID-19 test — You can upload your documents to the CLEAR Health Pass App which is used like a state-run “vaccine passport” in European countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium. If you do not have access to the CLEAR app you will need a physical copy of your vaccination certificate (the paper one from the CDC your state health department or your VAMS certificate will do). If you are NOT vaccinated against the coronavirus and are attending YOUR COVID-19 TEST MUST BE LESS THAN TWO DAYS (48 HOURS) OLD. THIS IS A MORE STRICT STANDARD THAN THE 72-HOUR OLD COVID-19 TEST REQUIREMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL TO MANY COUNTRIES OR TO RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES FROM ABROAD BY AIRPLANE. All other NBA Fan Code of Conduct rules apply which are common sense. Be respectful.

Good luck with the marketplace and stay safe out there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3J1c3NpYW5tYWNoaW5lbmV2ZXJicmVha3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTYvdGhlLXN0b3J5LWJlaGluZC13aGF0LWNvdWxkLWJlLXRoZS1maXJzdC1oZW5kcml4LWxhcGllcnJlLWNhcGl0YWxzLWplcnNleS1zb2xkLWF0LWNhcGl0YWwtb25lLWFyZW5hL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The story behind what could be the first Hendrix Lapierre Capitals jersey sold at Capital One Arena,"It might have been Game 1 out of 82 but Hendrix Lapierre’s first NHL goal might go down as the most memorable moment of the 2021-22 season. Taking a pass from TJ Oshie the 19-year-old sent a shot towards the net that squeaked through Rangers goaltender Alexandar Georgiev. Lapierre tumbled hard into the end boards later admitting he didn’t know he scored until he heard the roar of the Capitals’ crowd. The rookie was then picked up and mobbed by a grinning TJ Oshie which began a raucous celebration on the ice. Lapierre was congratulated at the bench by Alex Ovechkin who Hendrix was a huge fan of growing up. So much so that he had one of Ovechkin’s fathead’s on his wall.

While that all sounds like a perfect story there was one thing absent from Lapierre’s goal: no. 29 Lapierre jerseys in the crowd. It’s both a sign of the times and just how fast Lapierre’s rise to the NHL has been.

After being drafted by the Capitals in 2020 Lapierre played only 21 games in junior before his NHL debut on Wednesday. The QMJHL where Lapierre plays held a partial season due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the prospect missed many of those games in the fall and winter after being selected to Team Canada’s World Junior Selection Camp. Combined with the surprising severity of Nicklas Backstrom’s hip injury and Connor McMichael’s ascension to top prospect status Lapierre was not forecast to make the team. And because his lack of playing time he had literally no hype surrounding him. Not only did most casual Capitals fans not know who Lapierre was but even the ones who did were unfamiliar with what his number would be in the NHL 29 making a jersey purchase remote.

It created an interesting situation where not only did any fans (that we know of) have any Capitals jerseys of Lapierre at the game but neither did his girlfriend or family who traveled to DC earlier to watch his debut game.

AND THE FAM'S ALL HERE 😍 pic.twitter.com/DFZWmxyHB4 — Washington Capitals (@Capitals) October 14 2021

But there was one intrepid fan who minutes after seeing Lappy score his first NHL goal dropped some serious cash to leave the arena in a custom-made one. The longtime Capitals fan’s name is Paul. Paul’s reasoning for the Lapierre jersey beyond Lappy’s general talent and goal that night was that his own birthday is on March 29th (Tom Wilson’s birthday).

“So 29 is my lucky number” Paul said in an interview with RMNB. “When I first saw Lapierre come out onto the ice I told everyone around me that this guy was going to score tonight.”

Then he went and did.

“When Hendrix scored I went crazy” Paul continued. “I left my seats and immediately went to look for the custom shop at Capital One Arena to ask them to make his jersey for me. When I got to the shop they said no one has the number 29 on the team and I responded ‘Yes there is someone with that number. HE JUST SCORED.”

The jersey creation process wasn’t without its challenges. Paul couldn’t find Lapierre’s name on the Capitals website so when he put the customized name down he misspelled the customized name on the receipt LaPirre. The jersey creator thankfully spell-checked before creating the jersey.

“He is an Aries so he is impulsive as hell” explained Paul’s best friend Claire.

“I’m repping a future legend!” Paul said excitedly.

Capitals fans who want to be as cool as Paul can purchase a Lapierre jersey on the NHL’s online store. Lapierre’s name was recently added to the dropdown as one of the players that can be customized onto jerseys.

Got a visit to a national park on your list for this year? You're not alone. Millions of travelers are looking to the great outdoors in 2023. And there's one thing you need (besides a cheap flight and a cheap rental car of course): a National Parks Pass.

The U.S. National Parks Service sells annual passes that can get you into any national park in the country – from Denali in Alaska to the Everglades in Florida – for free. It'll also get you into thousands of other federal recreation sites for the whole year. And it costs just $80.

Considering most national parks charge $30 or $35 per vehicle to get in you'll save money buying this pass if you visit three or more parks in a year.

But first let's talk about what the pass gets you how you can cut the cost of your pass and other ways to save on your travels to national parks this year.

What Does a National Parks Pass Get Me?

A National Parks Pass – also known as the “America the Beautiful Pass” – will get you access to more than 2000 national parks and recreation areas in the U.S. Unfortunately this annual pass does not work for state city or county parks.

Here's what you need to know about the pass:

Costs $80 for an annual pass plus a $5 fee if you buy online though you can also buy them at most national parks and federal recreation sites

It's valid for one full year from the month of purchase (through the last day of that month). So if you buy a pass in March 2023 it will be valid through March 2024.

Covers the pass owner and passengers where entrance fees are charged per vehicle

At other parks that charge by person it covers the pass owner and three adults

Children under 16 are always admitted free

Two people can co-sign and share any pass

That's right this pass covers more than one person no matter which park you visit! If you're charged by vehicle passengers in the car will get in free with you. If charged per person you plus three adults get in free. So either way you can get four to eight travelers in with one pass! And remember: kids under 16 are always free.

Plus you can co-sign on a pass with a partner travel buddy or friend and share it. Trade off on road trips and get as much use out of it as you can!

How Can I Save on a Pass?

Depending on how many National Parks you plan to visit you can easily come out way ahead on the $80 pass. But there are ways to save even more.

First remember your pass can cover others in your party and kids under 16 are free. There's no need for all of you to buy your own park passes. Plus each pass can have two “owners” – so split the cost!

Free annual passes are available as well. Current U.S. Military and their dependents volunteers who have contributed 250 or more hours of volunteer work at federal park sites and fourth grade students (and their families!) are all eligible to receive a free annual pass.

Free lifetime passes are available for U.S. citizens with a permanent disability and discounted annual and lifetime passes are available for seniors over 62.

To save more on your Pass use the right card!

First there is the Chase Sapphire Reserve. Even though the card has an annual fee that clocks in at $550 each year it provides an annual $300 travel credit that can be used on any travel expense. And that includes purchasing the national parks pass.

How Can I Save with a Pass?

Once you have your pass congrats! You're on your way to seeing more parks for less. A few great ways to save:

Many parks will offer free or discounted camping for seniors and access pass holders. Check out nearby camping options and consider spending a few (free) nights! Make a road-trip out of it! One of the best national park road trips is the Utah Mighty Five: Bryce Canyon National Park Zion National Park Canyonlands National Park Arches National Park and Capitol Reef National Park. Start from Las Vegas and drive around to five (or more!) of the national parks in the area. Here's our guide to road-tripping the Utah Mighty Five. National Parks Pass + Points & Miles = Free Trip! Here's how to use points and miles for your flight rental car gas and lodging on your national parks adventure. Have a group bigger than your pass can cover? These are the six days you can get into all U.S. National Parks for free each year!

If you're looking for a year of thrifty trips top your bucket list with the U.S. National Parks and get the parks pass. Challenge yourself to make it to three or more parks in a year with a buddy or the family in tow! With many parks charging $20 – $35 per person the savings add up fast.

Getting to National Parks

So you've got your National Parks pass. If the national parks you're dreaming of aren't in your backyard then you'll need a flight too!

We've been seeing rock-bottom (pun intended) flight prices for U.S. National Park gateways for this spring and summer (and beyond!). Here's what we've been finding and sending to Thrifty Traveler Premium members.

Yellowstone on your bucket list? You'll want to fly into Bozeman Montana (BZN). We've been finding flights as low as $136 roundtrip! This is typically a $400+ flight especially for peak season. Here's the alert we sent Premium members:

Want flight deals to national parks plus other domestic and international destinations? Try Thrifty Traveler Premium for just $5.99 a month!

Dreaming of a road trip through Utah? The cheapest and easiest place to start that road trip is in Las Vegas Nevada (LAS). If the bright lights of the Strip aren't for you head straight out to the national parks! From there you can hit all of these national parks and sites:

Bryce Canyon

Capitol Reef

Arches

Zion

Canyonlands

Grand Canyon

Glen Canyon

and more!

We've been seeing flights to Las Vegas drop as low as $58 – yes that's roundtrip! Many of the nonstop routes have been exceptionally cheap for this summer fall and into winter:

Glacier National Park is a bucket list spot for many but getting there typically isn't cheap or easy. The closest airport is Glacier Park Airport in Kalispell (FCA). Flights into this airport typically run $450+.But we've been seeing flights under $200 roundtrip for nonstop summer flights! Here's a peek at the instant alert we sent Thrifty Traveler Premium members recently.

These flight deals are no longer live but our team is busy searching for the next hot deal to a national park gateway. Don't miss out on the next one we find: join Thrifty Traveler Premium for $5.99 a month! A cheap flight plus your park pass means you can go further and see more national parks for less.

Bottom Line

If you're like us getting out into the great outdoors again this summer has been the only thing getting us through winter and the pandemic. Now it's time to see those parks that have been sitting on our bucket lists.

If visiting a few parks – or taking a few friends or family members – is part of your 2023 travel plan getting an Annual National Parks Pass could help you save quite a bit. For $80 get yourself and your travel buddies into the most spectacular national wonders in the country.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vd2l6YXJkcy9waG90b3Mtd2l6YXJkcy1rbmlja3MtMTAxNTIx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: Wizards at Knicks - 10/15/21 Photo Gallery,1 / 17NEW YORK NY - OCTOBER 15: Bradley Beal #3 of the Washington Wizards handles the ball against Kemba Walker #8 of the New York Knicks during a preseason game on October 15 2021 at Madison Square Garden in New York New York.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZmludGVjaHRpbWVzLmNvbS9rZXktZmluYW5jaWFsLWNlbnRyZXMtaW4tdGhlLW1pZGRsZS1lYXN0LWFuZC1hZnJpY2EtcGFydC1vbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Key Financial Centres in the Middle East and Africa: Part One,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='thefintechtimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Oct 16 2021 / 12:00 pm

Cardinal Raymond Burke on Friday said that he is continuing to recover from COVID-19 and can offer daily Mass now in a statement posted on his Facebook account.

“With heartfelt gratitude to all those who have prayed for my recovery I write to inform you that since my previous letter physical therapy has aided my rehabilitation so greatly that I am now able to offer daily the Holy Mass” the cardinal stated on Friday. “Words cannot adequately express my joy at this gift of God’s grace in my life.”

Burke added that his “recovery continues to remain an intensive process.”

The 73-year-old cardinal was hospitalized with COVID-19 in August and was placed on a ventilator. Normally based in Rome he reportedly fell ill while in Wisconsin. By Aug. 21 the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Wisconsin – which provided official updates on Burke’s condition – stated that he was off the ventilator and was leaving the hospital ICU.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Take the drivers who ferry him from airport to hotel to performance venue and finally back home – one of whom confides in him the affair he had with Whitney Houston in Nevada when riding with the Hells Angels while another describes an uncle whose baby son had his arms chewed off by pigs (“Oh how I hated getting out of that car”). There is nothing too macabre too gross or indeed too mundane to capture his attention. And over the course of nearly two decades as Sedaris moves from his early 40s to his early 60s and acquires homes in rural Sussex coastal North Carolina and uptown New York there is no sense that he is becoming jaded.

To read these entries – some of the more boring ones omitted Sedaris explains in his introduction but otherwise free of retroactive editing – is to become complicit in a high-wire act: appreciating his appreciation of weirdness and recognising it for the voyeurism it sometimes is balancing his enthralment to observation with his more active poking of the hornet’s nest his amused indulgence with something a little less benign. Therein of course lies Sedaris’s edge; a flâneur in Comme des Garçons who doesn’t so much cross the line as vault it in search of another one.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in his interactions with the audiences who pack out theatres and then queue for hours to chat with him. In Pennsylvania a 19-year-old asks him to inscribe a copy of his book When You Are Engulfed in Flames to his mother with “something shocking and offensive”. After a moment’s consideration Sedaris picks up his pen: “Dear Mary Lou I wrote. Your son Jesse left teeth marks on my dick. I handed it back and realised by the look on his face that by shocking and offensive he’d meant ‘lightly disturbing’.” What Sedaris has – and one of the many reasons I and his multitudes of fans haven’t derived similar fame and fortune out of seeing a dead pigeon in the street – is follow-through. He really commits to the joke. In Boston he randomly asks a young woman at his signing table when she last touched a monkey. “I expected ‘Never’ or ‘It’s been years’ but instead she took a small step back saying ‘Oh can you smell it on me?’” It transpires that Jennifer works at Helping Hands an organisation that trains monkeys to be service animals and later sends Sedaris a picture of one reading a copy of his book. He immediately fires off a donation subsequently visiting their centre (“Which one is the ugliest?” he asks and is told that they don’t use words like that before they point one out) and inviting a monkey to join him at a bookshop event where naturally she upstages him. Sadly health and safety regulations preclude Sedaris hiring her as a regular sidekick.

The diaries are not all shtick. Although they are clearly written with a reader in mind – on the most basic level they contain little bits and pieces of explanation and scene-setting that would be unnecessary in a completely private journal – they are frequently in a far less antic register. Unsurprisingly Sedaris hits this minor key most movingly when he is writing about his family in particular the death of his sister Tiffany who killed herself in 2013.

That evening staying “at a dismal Marriott on the highway with a minifridge and a window overlooking a Hooters billboard” he signs books for hours at a Barnes & Noble concealing what has just happened to him from a legion of fans but unable to stop his mind from whirring. “‘You look fantastic in that tunic’ I said and ‘What’s your take on sausage?’ remembering the time Tiffany joined me at the Brookline Booksmith and told everyone who came through the line that they had beautiful eyes or the world’s most perfect hands.

We hear not only of Lou’s persistent jibes but also of his badgering his local paper with anonymous phone calls telling them to interview his son.

Its only riders are plastic skeletons.

It’s one of many elements of what Ammon Smith calls the “Carnival of Creeps.”

Smith and his family create original elaborate Halloween displays each year.

“This is entertainment for us. When people watch Netflix documentaries we’re putting Halloween together because that’s what we’d rather be doing” Smith said.

While the “Carnival of Creeps” may look frightening at first glance it’s surprisingly kid-friendly.

There are places for visitors or trick-or-treaters to pose for photos among props and even a carnival-style game called the “skull toss.""

“You can win one of the various creepy dolls we’ve got here"" Smith said.

Smith says when his family moved to their current home several years ago they had very few trick-or-treaters and the elaborate displays he’s built ever since are intended to inspire Halloween memories for kids.

“I think that there is some magic in running around in the dark with your Halloween Costume on and trying to fill up your whole pillowcase full of candy” he said. “I feel like because we do this the neighborhood is just full of trick-or-treaters on Halloween and that makes me really happy.”

After a complete cancellation the world-famous Carnival in Rio de Janeiro will be held again in 2022.

The public sale of tickets for the samba school parades in the Sambodrome has already begun according to a statement by the Samba Schools Association (LIESA) on Thursday.

The parades of the best samba schools are scheduled for Feb. 27 and 28 and the showcase of the six schools that impressed the judges the most is scheduled for March 4.

""There's a big rush for the grandstand seats bigger than in previous years"" a LIESA spokesperson told Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa).

In just one day five times as many seats were sold as on the first day of sales for the 2020 Carnival a statement from the association said noting the clear demand for the return of the spectacle.

""People are already preparing for the days of celebration and festivities we will have in the Sambodrome"" LIESA president Jorge Perlingeiro said.

He said the association was working to organize the biggest Carnival ever – ""and we are sure it will be a memorable return.""

The Carnival – an annual catharsis of sorts that allows Rio to let off steam – usually attracts millions of tourists to Sugarloaf Mountain every year.

According to a report by the Carnavalesco website the spectacle brings revenues to the city equivalent to around $700 million.

The Carnival in Rio had been scheduled to take place in February this year. In light of the pandemic the city had already canceled the street Carnival but only postponed the famous parades of the samba schools in the Sambodrome.

The association of samba schools hoped for a Carnival in July. However Mayor Eduardo Paes himself a big fan of the Carnival did not think the conditions were right and the Carnival was canceled altogether.

After the United States and India Brazil – the largest country in Latin America – has the most coronavirus infections with almost 22 million cases. Last Friday it passed the 600000 COVID-19 death mark.

Rio de Janeiro has at times been one of the most affected cities.

As the vaccination campaign progressed – more than 100 million Brazilians are now vaccinated against the coronavirus 56% of those over 18 in Rio – and while hospital occupancy rates dropped the city's optimism grew.

On a trial basis festivals with thousands of visitors are taking place samba groups are practicing for Carnival 2022. However the vaccination of the population against COVID-19 is fundamental for the realization of this annual spectacle it says in small print on the LIESA website about the dates of the samba school parades.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2Nhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1saW5lLXJldHVybnMtdG8tcHJpdmF0ZS1kZXN0aW5hdGlvbi1pbi10aGUtYmFoYW1hcy81ODAyONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Cruise Line Returns to Private Destination in the Bahamas,"Carnival Magic becomes the first cruise ship to return to the private destination of Princess Cays in the Bahamas. The vessel has already been sailing since restarting operations in early August 2021.

Carnival Magic Visits Princess Cays

The cruise line has returned to Princess Cays in the Bahamas with the Carnival Magic cruise ship on October 13. This is the first vessel to visit the destination since operations were firsts suspended in March 2020.

“We are delighted to return to the private Bahamian destination of Princess Cays and offer guests an opportunity to experience all of the beauty and charm of the island while providing a much-needed boost to the local economy” said Christine Duffy president of Carnival Cruise Line.

Carnival Magic made the call during its six-day Eastern Caribbean cruise which departed Port Canaveral in Florida on October 11. The itinerary includes calls in Nassau and Amber Cove and is scheduled to arrive back home on October 17. The voyage also includes two full days at sea.

Princess Cays is a private destination located in the south of Eleuthera island in the Bahamas. Many class it as a private island as it’s basically just for cruise visitors from Carnival-owned cruise ships that call there.

Princess Cruises is the leading cruise line that operates to the destination but sister line Carnival Cruise Line also includes it on several itineraries. Half Moon Cay mainly for Holland America Line is another private destination used by Carnival Cruise Line.

Carnival Magic restarted operations on August 7 and was the sixth ship in the fleet to do so. There are two additional Carnival ships currently sailing from Port Canaveral including Mardi Gras and Carnival Elation. Carnival Freedom will begin cruises from the port in February 20211.

The ship was also the first vessel to feature the new red white and blue livery during a dry dock which is rolling out across all Carnival ships.

Supply chain players on various fronts told CCJ that they have little confidence in President Joe Biden’s initiative to alleviate congestion at the nation’s busiest ports.

The White House announced Wednesday that the president’s Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force had paved the way for 24/7 operations at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. The White House reports that both ports “are the point of entry for 40% of containers to the U.S. and are on track to reach new highs in container traffic this year.”

Major companies that rely heavily on those ports – like FedEx UPS Walmart Home Depot and Target – have pledged to step up afterhours operations which comes as welcome news following a failed 24-hour pilot program at the Port of Long Beach last month.

NASA The White House also announced that International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) members are willing to work extra shifts at the ports.

Nonetheless analysts and those working on the front lines during unprecedented freight imports say the president’s plan fails to fully address critical challenges like warehousing equipment and driver shortages that have continued to create frustrating inefficiencies.

“Port throughput is not just taking containers off steamships but having the capacity in the yard to position those containers the chassis to put the containers on the drivers to take the freight from the ports and capacity in the rail network to facilitate the hoped for acceleration in port throughput” said Kenny Vieth president and senior analyst at ACT Research. “While the President’s recognition of the situation is welcome and will undoubtedly help at the margin this effort resembles squeezing a balloon: The problem appears likely to be pushed to the next mode with insufficient capacity.""

“Fixing the problem at the port moves it to the next step in the supply chain. Trucking is already operating at capacity so adding more throughput requires them to operate more hours and more efficiently than they currently are able or willing to do."" Rick Mihelic director of emerging technologies NACFE

The outlook on shifting to 24/7 ports isn’t much better for customs house broker Peter Wittwer North America in Largo Florida.

“Nothing will change if ports operate 24 hours” said Siegfried Adam Jr. “There are not enough truckers to work three shifts per day nor does the hinterland infrastructure support hundreds of more containers to be unloaded in a 24-hour period. It’s a dumb idea. It solves nothing.""

Rick Mihelic director of emerging technologies at the North American Council for Freight Efficiency said shifting to a 24/7 model adds additional strain to industry channels that are already struggling to keep up.

“Twenty-four hour operations at the ports impact all the downstream resources as well warehouses trucks trains distribution centers retail outlets and factories” Mihelic said. “Fixing the problem at the port moves it to the next step in the supply chain. Trucking is already operating at capacity so adding more throughput requires them to operate more hours and more efficiently than they currently are able or willing to do.""

Critical links in the chain

With a broad trucking and port history that spans back to 1950 Dependable Supply Chain Services is concerned about the road ahead.

Leonard Arriola director of intermodal and drayage services at Dependable a full-service logistics provider that serves all the major ports in California said opening up the ports around the clock is not enough to alleviate record congestion.

Arriola pointed out major inefficiencies in container return procedures along with equipment and labor shortages which have continued to hamper port operations.

“Extending the hours alone will not alleviate the problem” Arriola said from his office in Los Angeles. ""The major roadblock is the inability to return empty containers in a timely manner. I currently have 890 containers out on my own private fleet of chassis and 375 of them have empty containers on them that do not have a return location because one there’s nowhere to return them; two return restrictions; and three no [return] appointments are available.”

Port of Los Angeles Bill Aboudi operations manager at OPS Trucking in Oakland California said container problems have been stacking up at the Port of Oakland.

“Returning empty containers has been a challenge with terminals restricting the return of empties because shiplines are over allocation” Aboudi said.

Chassis availability is another issue that carriers have continued to battle long before the Biden administration formed the Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force in June to take on unprecedented port congestion which on Friday had left 88 ships waiting at anchor near the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California.

""During a regular ‘peak’ season we always run short of chassis"" Arriola said ""now we have quadrupled the number of vessels arriving it has exasperated the shortage of chassis.”

Labor shortages have continued to hamper operations too.

“There is also not enough labor to fully man the ports 24/7” Arriola added. “If there are 9000 dock workers over two shifts and you add a third shift that brings you down from 4500 workers per shift to 3000 per shift. How is that going to increase productivity?

“There is an immediate need for more dock workers if even on a temporary basis however the union may be a hurdle in this as they have a history of nepotism. As for the drivers they will work around the clock if allowed” Arriola continued.

Aboudi expressed disappointment at not hearing the president address hours of service and additional factors impacting productivity and the bottom line.

“Listening to the press conference Biden spoke to Longshoremen FedEx Target Home Depot...but I didn't hear mention of MTO [marine terminal operators] and truckers” Aboudi said. “In an intermodal chain all the parties have to work together.”

To further relieve the strain on carriers and owner-operators Aboudi suggested that ports nix charging for street-turning containers and suspend per diem and demurrage charges “until the system is fluid.”

The bottom line

Being open 24 hours doesn’t guarantee additional container deliveries as Total Terminals International (TTI) learned last month at the Port of Long Beach.

TTI one of the largest terminals at the port kicked off a 24-hour pilot program in mid-September and two weeks later still had not had any container pickups between 3 and 7 a.m. according to the The Wall Street Journal.

The Biden administration hopes that will change and that carriers and owner-operators will follow the examples of some of the largest fleets in the nation like FedEx UPS and Walmart which have pledged to step up their afterhours operations to ease port congestion.

Dependable Supply Chain Services For one major trucking supplier that’s been set back by ongoing shipping delays and surging container costs the switch to 24/7 couldn’t have come fast enough.

“I cannot believe it has taken this long to make this decision” the trucking equipment CEO told CCJ under condition of anonymity. “If it adds precious hours of unloading time it has to reduce the backlog over time.”

Port congestion has resulted in “much longer delays in getting goods into the country” the CEO continued and has made it “very difficult to pin down delivery times. Each month we kick the can down the road a bit as sales are delayed by delivery delays.”

Big upticks in container costs are also impacting the bottom line.

“We are seeing $20000 to $23000 on 40-foot containers” the CEO said. “We were paying about $5500 last year at this time. Worse than the costs have been the delays in getting space on ships or getting goods delivered to the most obvious close ports.”

High container costs can have big ripple effects beyond the ports.

“I think the global economy is suffering and action should be taken by governments to ease inflationary pricing” the CEO said.

In addition to expanding hours at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach Mihelic suggested that more effective freight data management combined with additional government intervention could help take on piles of freight.

“Getting drivers and equipment where it is needed is something the market needs to solve in the near term” Mihelic said. “Getting more licensed drivers and building more equipment is not a quick fix.

“We need to capitalize on the vast amount of digital freight data to quickly find where assets are sitting too long or being used as temporary storage or idle and then apply funding mechanisms to help expedite moving them to where they can help the network” Mihelic continued. “The government’s best tool in an emergency often relates to dollars either helping incentives or punitive measures.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWF2aWF0b3JtZS5jb20vYWlybGluZXMvZXRpaGFkLWNhcmdvLXN0cmVuZ3RoZW5zLWl0cy1kaWdpdGFsLWZvb3RwcmludC13aXRoLWEtcmV2YW1wZWQtd2Vic2l0ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Etihad Cargo Strengthens Its Digital Footprint With A Revamped Website,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.theaviatorme.com/airlines/etihad-cargo-strengthens-its-digital-footprint-with-a-revamped-website on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWF2aWF0b3JtZS5jb20vYWlybGluZXMvZXRpaGFkLWNhcmdvLXN0cmVuZ3RoZW5zLWl0cy1kaWdpdGFsLWZvb3RwcmludC13aXRoLWEtcmV2YW1wZWQtd2Vic2l0ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlybGluZXMvYWxpdGFsaWEtc3VjY2Vzc29yLWl0YS1lbnZpc2lvbnMtc2t5dGVhbS1tZW1iZXJzaGlwLzE0NTk1Mi5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alitalia successor ITA envisions SkyTeam membership | News | Flight Global,"Newly-launched Italian carrier ITA Airways is intending to join the SkyTeam alliance continuing the allegiance of its predecessor Alitalia.

The new carrier initiated operations on 15 October with an Airbus A320 service from Milan Linate to Bari and started charter flights with a Milan Malpensa-Rome Fiumicino sortie.

Its initial network of 44 destinations covered by 59 routes will increase to 74 destinations and 89 routes by 2025. The company has signed ground-handling and maintenance pacts with Alitalia which remains in administration.

ITA says it will “focus” on Fiumicino and Linate with the aim of being the “reference airline” for business and leisure traffic.

It adds that it will join the SkyTeam alliance and introduce codesharing with other SkyTeam carriers to increase connectivity – although it says it will depend on its identifying a “strategic partner”.

Alitalia previously had equity tie-ups with SkyTeam’s Air France-KLM as well as Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways.

ITA starts with a fleet of seven long-haul and 45 short-haul aircraft but plans to expand to 78 aircraft – comprising 13 long-haul and 65 short-haul – next year.

The fleet will shift into triple figures by 2025 when the airline expects to have 23 long-haul and 82 short-haul jets a total of 105.

It has already reached preliminary agreements to acquire multiple Airbus aircraft – including 28 from the airframer and 31 from US lessor Air Lease.

ITA insists it will pursue an environmentally-friendly agenda with a number of initial flights from Rome already using blends of sustainable fuel produced by Italian energy firm Eni.

“The new company was born under the banner of sustainability” the carrier states adding that it intends 75% of its 2025 fleet to be “low environmental impact” aircraft.

ITA has recruited 2800 personnel a figure it expects to double to 5750 in 2025.

While ITA says it reserves the right to use the Alitalia brand which it acquired from Alitalia’s extraordinary administrators it has unveiled a completely different livery from the perennial design of the former flag-carrier.

The livery base is blue a colour which has historically royal roots and became representative of Italian unification in the 19th century. Blue is also linked to the country’s presidential emblems the Italian armed forces and the ‘Azzurri’ Italy’s national football team.

ITA says the colour reflects “unity cohesion and pride”. The livery also features the Italian green-white-red tricolour on the aft half of the vertical fin.

“The choice of the new ITA Airways brand stems from listening to people and their level of satisfaction pursuing one of the fundamental pillars of the business plan – customer centrality” says the airline.

It states that this customer focus will be one of four “pillars” for the company alongside innovation sustainability and digitalisation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9JbmR1c3RyeS93aWxsLXRhdGFzLWJlLWFibGUtdG8tdHVybi1hcm91bmQtYWlyLWluZGlhL2FydGljbGUzNzAzMjI4Ni5lY2XSAW9odHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvSW5kdXN0cnkvd2lsbC10YXRhcy1iZS1hYmxlLXRvLXR1cm4tYXJvdW5kLWFpci1pbmRpYS9hcnRpY2xlMzcwMzIyODYuZWNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Explained | Will the Tatas be able to turn around Air India?,"October 17 2021 03:30 am | Updated 12:06 pm IST

The story so far: On October 8 the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey announced at a press conference that the Tata Sons subsidiary Talace Pvt. Ltd. had won the bid for the national carrier Air India . He said that after the setting of a reserve price of ₹12906 crore the Tata Sons subsidiary had emerged the winner quoting a figure of ₹18000 crore. The other shortlisted bidder Ajay Singh of SpiceJet  had quoted ₹15100 crore. Within minutes Ratan N. Tata Chairman Emeritus Tata Sons and Chairman Tata Trusts put out a tweet “Welcome back Air India!”

What will Tata Sons get?

The Air India group is made up of these components: Air India; Air India Express Air India Engineering Services Limited (AIESL) Air India Air Transport Services Limited (AIATSL; ground handling services to the Air India group and other airlines) Airline Allied Services Limited or AASL (Alliance Air); the Hotel Corporation of India (Centaur hotels and the Chefair flight kitchens) and Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited (AISATS is a 50:50 joint venture between Air India Limited and Singapore Airport Terminal Services Limited (SATS) .

The Air India sale this time is the third attempt by the Government of India (incidentally all under the National Democratic Alliance) the earlier bids having been in the early 2000s and 2017-2018. This time round the Government offered management control and sale of 100% equity share capital each of Air India and Air India Express and a 50% equity share capital of Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited — which the Tatas have won.

It was the mountain of dues and deep losses that were the catalyst for the sale. How will the debt be cleared?

The airline’s total debt at the end of August this year was ₹61562 crore. Of this Tata Sons (its holding company Talace Pvt. Ltd.) would be taking over ₹15300 crore with a cash payment of ₹2700 crore. The rest an estimated ₹46262 crore will be moved to Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL) a special purpose vehicle formed by the Government to handle the debt and non-core assets of Air India such as land and buildings.

Much of the debt is related to the merger between Air India and the other state-owned carrier Indian Airlines which was cleared by the Cabinet on March 1 2007 to form the National Aviation Company of India Limited (NACIL). Preceding this development — i.e. of the merger — the then United Progressive Alliance government had in 2005 approved the purchase of 68 aircraft by Air India (from Boeing) — and also the largest commercial aircraft deal in India’s civil aviation history — and a year later 43 planes for Indian Airlines (from the Airbus 320 family for $2.2 billion). The Boeing deal was for 23 777s 27 787s and 18 737s (for low cost carrier Air India Express). Boeing has also built and transferred a state-of-the-art maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) facility at Nagpur. Following mounting losses there was an investigation into allegations about the nearly ₹70000 crore deal that had caused a financial loss to the “already stressed national carrier”. It also inducted A320Ns on lease from the ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Company in 2017.

As far as debt clearance is concerned the Government is to also transfer to the AIAHL about ₹16000 crore of unpaid fuel bills and other pending dues that Air India owes to airports and vendors. In short it will hold about 75% of the airline’s debt that the Tata Group is not taking over. An aviation consultant said the Tatas could also take over an additional and estimated ₹9000 crore worth of lease obligations for over 40 Air India jets. The non-core assets including land and buildings that are estimated to be valued at ₹14718 crore are being transferred to the AIAHL. There are reports that the Government is planning to add the feeder/regional airline Alliance Air (the second wholly owned Air India subsidiary) to this mix with an eye to selling it. If this happens the Government will completely exit the airline business.

According to Mr. Pandey the airline loses ₹20 crore a day. And from 2009-10 to date the Government has infused over ₹110276 crore into the airline; ₹54584 crore as cash support and ₹55692 crore as loan guarantees. The sale deal is expected to be wrapped up by December-end (though some experts say it could go on till March). The four Air India subsidiaries AIATSL AASL AIESL the Hotel Corporation of India Ltd. and non-core assets that also include the fabled collection of art work paintings and artefacts and other non-operational assets have been transferred to the IAHL.

Do the Tatas have a business model ready?

Air India the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tata Sons did not respond to queries from The Hindu on the subject. However aviation experts have tried to piece things together. The contours cover human resources fleet management flight scheduling and technology services. The Tatas already have two airlines in the stable which are still in poor financial health: Vistara (a joint venture with Singapore Airlines Limited as a 51:49% stake partnership) and Air Asia India a low-cost service where the Tatas now have a nearly 84% stake. An aviation analyst said that going by data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) the Tatas could now have a 26% share of the domestic aviation market that would put them behind market leader IndiGo with its estimated 57% market share. Opinion is that there could be mergers and synergy between the four airlines .

What are the positive and negatives of working with Air India?

The Air India deal catapults the conglomerate into the big league making it the largest player from India on international routes.

First the positives. The brand Air India has an instant connect. According to a Tata datasheet there will be a fleet strength of 141 aircraft (117 from Air India and 24 from Air India Express) and a widespread domestic and international footprint (over 7000 slots and also code share agreements) with a significant share of the revenue from international operations. Its non-stop long haul flights from India to the United States are a high point. There is also a repository of bilateral rights which experts say could be used to expand flights in a big way to Europe Africa and South America for example. The Air India frequent flyer programme has nearly three million members. The airline has experienced crew ground staff and engineers. It is also a member of the 26-member global aviation grouping Star Alliance.

In terms of the crucial aviation operating metrics among Indian carriers it has a high Available Seat Passenger Kilometre (ASKM) and Revenue Passenger Kilometre (RPKM). It has also cleared recognised safety audits and won international awards for its environmental performance. The airline also has a few firsts and records to its name.

According to an aviation expert the negatives would be linked to the structure of its finance lease/bridge loans and operating leases for a part of its fleet the poor state of the cabins seats and inflight amenities on most of its aircraft fleet staff strength in certain administrative functions the cost contracts for some of its subsidiaries and the training at and safety record of Air India Express. Part of the fleet has also been grounded for a long time for want of crucial spares and engine parts.

Not having Alliance Air as a part of the group could be a setback as it “operates flights to Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities or those which link these cities to the metro hubs”. Thus what would have been inhouse and seamless regional passenger feed to the main flights (international and domestic) could now be hampered.

The total number of permanent and contractual employees of Air India and Air India Express is 13500. According to Mr. Pandey there cannot be retrenchment of staff for the first year. Gratuity and provident fund benefits will be according to the law and post-retirement medical benefits (for retired staff and staff to retire) will be provided by the Government.

Another aviation expert said a Tata team had visited all the Air India facilities and “sought every possible document”. These may have also been to examine details of agreements and contracts with third parties; liabilities and commitments; available licences and approvals and internal and third party audit reports.

According to Captain Mohan Ranganathan a retired airline instructor pilot aviation safety expert and an industry watcher “The Tatas have got just the airline aircraft routes and landing slots. The hangars and engineering belong to the AIESL and will all be sold off separately. If the Tatas want them they have to bid and pay! The training centres in Mumbai and Hyderabad are also in that category. The Air India employees in the housing colonies have been given six months notice or sale of the land whichever is earlier. The Tatas will have to spend a huge amount getting the aircraft refurbished and fitted to their standards.

“The biggest problem is the integration of Air Asia India and Air India Express. Their style of operations is completely different. The integration is not easy and will be time consuming. The Government has also sold out to the Gulf carriers with bilaterals in their favour. Whether the Government will rework them now is the question” he said.

How soon will it be profitable?

Former Executive Director Air India Jitender Bhargava in a commentary has said “The question of how rapidly the Tatas can make the airline profitable needs to be viewed in the context of the impact of the pandemic additional domestic factors such as price sensitivity of Indian passengers and high operational costs.

“Air India also has very limited non-aeronautical revenues. Monetising every customer-interfacing object as most airlines do will add to revenues. The real gains will emerge once the initial phases of cost reduction and enhancing revenues are over and the Tatas move to the next phase of fleet expansion which should be a priority” he said.

“The new owners will be able to operate additional flights without having the need to induct more operating crew or aircraft maintenance engineers because rationalisation of manpower and higher productivity through reengineered work practices will generate surplus manpower to meet future needs.

“Once Air India’s current inherent weaknesses largely stemming from Government ownership inability to exploit full potential due to inertia adverse impact on the morale of employees due to frequent changes of leadership are made a thing of the past on the Tatas taking control positive all-round results will be there for all to see. Turning around Air India by making it profitable once again after several years will be a daunting but achievable task. It will also be a long-haul flight for the Tatas and one should make no mistake about it by being over ptimistic because the ground realities of the Indian market cannot be simply wished away” Mr. Bhargava said.

Another aviation industry expert said it is most certain that Tata Sons will tap the capabilities of its group companies such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to formulate the digital and technological transformation of Air India. This would be to run the airline’s technology services end-to-end enabling automation to analytics-enabled decision-making. The end result is to have “intelligent airline operations”. TCS is no stranger to the aviation and airline business and has clients such as Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic.

An aviation expert said that while the new owner may have several and efficient business strategies it would benefit from the legacy of experience of today’s Air Indians.",,,

Kennedy Memorial Park will now be greeted by a giant black white and yellow caterpillar sculpture.

“We’re trying to make it more user friendly and kid friendly. We want people to come out here and utilize it a little bit more. It’s not art that kids can’t touch” said Webster County Conservation Naturalist Erin Ford.

Artist Tim Adams of Webster City created the piece by welding propane tanks together then painting it and adding details such as the antennas and a leaf in the caterpillar’s mouth.

“Every kid in Fort Dodge learns about monarch butterflies and the metamorphosis so we thought it would be kind of fun to start with something that everybody knows” said Ford.

The Children’s Forest was originally planned and developed beginning in 1962 and has changed over the years. Initially it was about 30 acres of shrubs and hundreds of trees to serve as living memorials to honor people who had passed.

Mina Landes who passed away in September of this year was instrumental in cultivation and care of the trees and shrubs in the Children’s Forest. Landes and several volunteers donated countless hours and financial support to the development of the Children’s Forest.

In 2020 the .3 mile Storywalk Trail was added with story stations along the trail. Visitors can walk the trail at their own pace and pause at each station to read the next bit of a nature-themed children’s book. The story is changed seasonally and Ford said it is a fun way for children to learn about nature.

The Children’s Forest also features several wood carvings of characters from “The Lorax” by Dr. Seuss. The sculptures were created by Gary Keenan a chainsaw sculptor from Des Moines from ash trees in the Children’s Forest that had died from the Emerald Ash Borer.

Ford said the conservation team plans to continue to add more to the Children’s Forest in the coming years. She said they are considering adding more sculptures to complete the butterfly life cycle.

Ford said the conservation group is happy with the caterpillar piece and hope people come out to see it. “It turned out to be a fun piece and you definitely can’t miss it when you pull up” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwOi8vd3d3LnN1cmZiaXJkcy5jb20vY29tbXVuaXR5LWJsb2dzL2Jsb2cvMjAyMS8xMC8xNy9zdHVkeS1vZi1ncmVhdC10aXRzLW9hay10cmVlcy1hbmQtY2F0ZXJwaWxsYXJzLXJldmVhbHMtY29tcGxleGl0eS1vZi1jbGltYXRlLWNoYW5nZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Study of Great Tits oak trees and caterpillars reveals complexity of climate change | surfbirds,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vcmVhZHRoZXJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9oZWlnaHRzLXN0dWRlbnRzLWVhcm4tbGV2ZWwtMS1za2lkLXN0ZWVyLWNlcnRpZmljYXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Heights students earn Level 1 Skid Steer Certification,"Hamilton Heights High School students Arcy Smith Gavin Bramel Jade Zachary Brendan Mosbaugh Drew Monnin and Cole Amos recently completed a two-day course to earn their Level 1 Skid Steer Certification. Day one was safety and maintenance education in the classroom followed by a day of hands-on equipment operations in the school’s Sandbox.

Skid steers are versatile machines that are used in a range of settings for tasks like digging demolition landscaping and excavation to name a few.

“I am very proud of these students who completed their Level 1 Caterpillar Skid Steer certification” said Eric Fisher Project Lead the Way – CEA Master Teacher and NCCER Instructor. “Industry recognized certifications are important for students to achieve and demonstrate to potential employers the skills they have accomplished while in high school. It does require an investment of time knowledge and actual experience to learn to operate this type of equipment.”

“Our CTE program is designed to give students valuable certifications and hands-on experience to better position them to enter the construction workforce in a high-wage career after graduating from high school” continued Fisher. “Today more than ever there is a need for skilled tradesmen and women. There are incredible options in the construction trades to earn high wages and benefits that make careers in the construction trades highly desirable as a career path. We are committed to growing our Career and Technical Education program and providing opportunities for students to gain real-world experience that helps develop the next generation of skilled workers entrepreneurs and community leaders.”

Andrew Monnin a senior in Heights’ CTE program said the best part of the class was definitely the opportunity to operate the skid steer.

“The actual seat time on the equipment provided valuable experience that will make us much more employable and beneficial employees” Monnin explained. “I learned how to use a skid steer to grade which was something that I didn’t realize could be performed on a skid steer … Earning this Caterpillar skid steer certification is very special to me. It represents a comprehensive knowledge of the proper operation and maintenance of this piece of equipment a unique skill that very few my age have.”

A special thank you is extended to Ridge Inman MacAllister/CAT instructor who administered the day-long course and helped supervise the hands-on portion that took place in the Sandbox. Hamilton Heights’ partnership with companies like MacAllister/CAT provides opportunities for its students to gain real-world experience in heavy equipment operation that prepares them for life and careers in the construction industry beyond high school.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbGVzb25saW5lLmNvLnVrL3doYXRzLW9uL2Zvb2QtZHJpbmstbmV3cy9tYXJrcy1zcGVuY2VyLWhhbGxvd2Vlbi1jb2xpbi1jYWtlLTIxODc5Nzkw0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FsZXNvbmxpbmUuY28udWsvd2hhdHMtb24vZm9vZC1kcmluay1uZXdzL21hcmtzLXNwZW5jZXItaGFsbG93ZWVuLWNvbGluLWNha2UtMjE4Nzk3OTAuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marks and Spencer unveils limited-edition Halloween version of Colin the Caterpillar cake,"We have more newsletters

It isn’t to be mistaken for a boom but the third quarter saw a desperately needed lift in the market.

CBRE reports that Manhattan leasing activity rose for the first time since late 2019. There were slightly fewer ground-floor availabilities in 16 prime corridors tracked by the brokerage. Average asking rents dropped by 1.6 percent quarter-over-quarter the smallest decline since last year.

Quarterly retail sales improved across the borough rising 3.8 percent to $38.3 billion in the third quarter according to CBRE.

“The city’s economic fundamentals continue to strengthen with further improvement expected as more people return to pre-Covid routines” CBRE research director Nicole LaRusso said.

Leasing highlights included Wegmans mammoth deal for 89000 square feet in the former Kmart space at 770 Broadway.

Brooklyn-based bath and massage spa Bathouse will launch its first Manhattan location in at 7 W. 21st. St.

5 Chef Matthew Kenney made a deal for restaurant Scen Rising to open at 1165 Broadway. Plantlab

The Upper East Side saw 12 new leases the largest number of any major neighborhood. Among them: a 12000-square-foot deal for members-only health clinic Sollis Health at 575 Park Ave. Often slow-moving Third Avenue north of Bloomingdale’s racked up a 3800-square-foot location for grocery delivery service Fridge No More’s first physical store at 1138 Third.

Food and beverage was the busiest category including Pink Taco’s 10500 square feet in a former TGI Friday space at 7 Times Square.

That trend might extend into the fourth quarter. In a deal signed late last week that was brokered by CBRE Scen Rising by celebrity chef Matthew Kenney and entrepreneur Maximilian Koenig inked for 930 square feet at 1165 Broadway. The asking rent was $325 per square foot.

There are “boutique” buildings and there are mini-boutiques. A case in point: 76 Eighth Ave. a new 10-story office property with just 35072 square feet of first-class space.

5 Real estate broker Clark Finney is seeing a big flurry of leasing activity at petite 76 Eighth Ave.

The recently completed project developed by Noviprop which has owned the site for 30 years and international firm Plus Development has had no trouble drawing tenants.

Market sources said that just over 10000 square feet have already been claimed by Bluewater Property Group Amanda Music and an unidentified real estate investment firm. Each office floor has floor-to-ceiling windows. Office rents range from $115 to $130 per square foot.

A source said that several more leases are in the works for full floors. The building also has 2578 square feet of ground-floor retail space.

JLL’s Clark Finney and Andrew Coe who couldn’t be reached for comment represented the ownership.

The Shelter Island summer scene will have new blood next year. Cape Resorts which owns Sag Harbor’s insanely popular Baron’s Cove resort and hotels in Cape May NJ will reopen in June the historic waterfront Pridwin which was closed since November 2019.

Cape Resorts managing partner Curtis Bashaw had hoped to begin restoring and upgrading the property two years ago but the pandemic got in the way. Now his company has started work on reviving the Crescent Beach property in a partnership with the Petry family which operated the Pridwin since 1961.

Its peaceful leafy grounds are a far cry from the boisterous scene at Sunset Beach nearby. The reconfiguration will reduce the number of guest rooms in the 1927-vintage main building from 39 to 33 allowing for larger bathrooms and installation of a guests’ elevator for the first time.

Meanwhile there will be 16 guest cottages on the seven-acre grounds up from nine. There will be a new 100-seat restaurant with outdoor space and a spa “to bring a wellness component to the property” Bashaw said.

The Pridwin season which previously ran from mid-May to Mid-October will be expanded from Easter through New Year’s Bashaw said.

“We believe the Pridwin market is not just a Hamptons crowd ” Bashaw said “but a place people might choose as they would in the Hudson Valley or Cape May.”

He added that although the Pridwin is not legally a landmark it should feel like one.

“We’re proud of our restorative efforts and of the economic impact created by hotels we’ve restored. Pridwin will mean a lot of job creation on Shelter Island for people who were always caught in a very seasonal economy.”

Mr Murray amassed the 3538 sq m site at 31-53 Cremorne Street over the past six years. Records show he bought 33-37 from the Schwartz family in 2018 for $10 million and 33-37 from Micheal Gannon in 2015 for $2.875 million. The state land registry reveals Mr Murray put a caveat on number 31 in April. Teska Carson agents Matthew Feld and Luke Bisset are handling the sale.

A syndicate including Spotlight’s Fried family and Marne Properties’ Peter Gyopar sold the property with a permit for a 13-unit luxury development designed by Bruce Henderson Architects. JLL agents Josh Rutman Nick Peden Tim Carr and MingXuan Li handled the deal. Mr Peden said the buyer who beat competition from off-shore groups is planning to complete the permitted project.

The three-level property is on a large 1924 sq m site with 40 studio apartments eight shops and a large car park out the back. The rooms were converted into six-12 months leaseholds last year when tourist numbers dried up.

Records show the Renzella’s Morraine Nominees bought the hotel for $2.55 million back in 1988 when Fitzroy Street last sported a seedy atmosphere. The owners rode St Kilda’s wave of gentrification and then weathered the doldrums that followed with a sea of overseas tourists. The property has a permit for a five-storey residential development designed by Cactus Architects on the car park. There is a three-level limit on the street frontage. It’s half a kilometre to the beach and close to the new Victoria Pride Centre. Gurner’s luxury redevelopment St Moritz is around the corner.

CBD strata An investor has snapped up a strata office occupying half of level 11 and the rooftop of 343 Little Collins Street paying $2.14 million. The deal for the 208 sq m office and 164 sq m rooftop reflected a yield of 4.9 per cent and sold at $10288 a sq m - quite a premium for the central CBD and really an indication of the development potential of the rooftop. Colliers agents George Davies Anthony Kirwan and Alexander Leggo negotiated the transaction fielding five offers and 100 enquiries.

The property is leased to the Clinton Institute on a five-year lease returning $105400 a year in rent. The buyer is understood to be keen to develop the rooftop down the track. The Colliers team also sold a level 1 of 362 Little Bourke Street last week for around $3 million. The 325 sq m office sold on a 14-day settlement. Coming up JLL is marketing level 7 of 21 Victoria Street a building on the corner of MacKenzie Street overlooking the Carlton Gardens.

The sale was made by the Coopersmith Group that has owned the dealership site in Melbourne’s eastern suburb of Ringwood since October 1981.

The 8878 square metre property and showroom at 391 Maroondah Highway Ringwood was bought by Coopersmith for $400000 at auction in 1981.

Agents CBRE said the sale represents a yield of 4.33 per cent.

CBRE senior director David Aiello said in a statement that: “Over the course of four decades Coopersmith Group has built a landmark and growing hub of car dealerships in Melbourne’s east.”

Ringwood Mazda is one of Australia’s biggest Mazda dealerships and forms a key part of Ringwood’s automotive ‘Golden Mile’ that also includes Car City and Ringwood’s Mercedes-Benz dealership that is owned by Eagers Automotive Ltd.

The family-owned commercial building and development company Coopersmith Group and its partners control about seven hectares of land on the prime highway strip with its Nissan Volkswagen and Ford dealerships.

Over the past 14 years the Coopersmith Group has built and owned Etheridge Ford Ringwood Ringwood Volkswagen Ringwood Nissan and Ringwood Mazda.

CBRE said that under Coopersmith Group’s ownership the Mazda site at 391-397 Maroondah Highway has also been home to various garden and nursery tenants and prior to its purchase was held by Patterson Cheney Holden as a vacant paddock in the 1970s.

Coopersmith Group is now building a multi-storey BMW dealership in Ringwood which will be leased to Autosports Group.

The purchase of the dealership property by the leaseholder is becoming more common.

APE recently acquired a group of properties on which its dealerships are situated while earlier this year prestige used vehicle dealer Nick Theodossi and partners bought the 1.8 hectare site occupied by Subaru Interactive at the Docklands in Melbourne for $50.5 million.

One way to do that is through pricing power which is shorthand for a company's ability to raise prices to cancel out rising costs and maintain the profits and margins that investors want to see.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

UBS strategist Keith Parker says his firm is focused on the companies that have the most pricing power and highest stock upside. They determined which companies are most easily able to raise their prices and developed a metric that combines pricing power momentum in profit margins and the companies' exposure to input costs that could rise.

Parker only looked at companies that scored in the top 33% of their sectors and picked companies that have ""Buy"" ratings and upsides of at least 10% to UBS analysts' price targets.

The supply chain problems are getting a ton of attention right now but they won't be easily solved. Evidence is mounting that the snags will last well into 2022 even as the economy gets back on its feet. So the companies that can manage those problems might have a durable advantage.

He also said a handful of companies are looking at serious trouble identifying major downside for Occidental Petroleum and American Airlines with limited additional downside for Comerica Huntington Bancshares and Prudential.

The top picks are somewhat more diverse as the consumer discretionary technology real estate and industrial sectors are all represented.

The following companies are the ones with the most upside according to UBS and Parker's analysis. They're ranked from lowest to highest based on how far they will rise if UBS' 12-month price targets are accurate. Those upside figures were calculated as of October 14.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A government source also claimed that in its role working for Parliament Chubb's approach had been “very inconsistent across the country” with some MPs offered only very basic measures and others given high levels of security.

“When they did show up they were just like: ‘You need locks on the windows’” said one frustrated former minister. “That’s about it. They were basically assessing it from the perspective of ‘how do you secure a house’ not the specific and weird threats MPs face”.

The Telegraph understands some MPs have been offered fixed panic alarms in their constituency offices and homes while others have been given portable “lone worker devices” that can alert police if they are in danger.

The new measures were put in place following the murder of Jo Cox a Labour MP in 2016.

The police National Counter Terrorism Security Office designed a package of security measures for MPs which were approved by the National Police Chiefs Council.

ADT set to take over

An email to members from parliamentary authorities sent earlier this year confirms that ADT will “take over the responsibility for maintaining existing security measures and installing new security measures”.

MPs also said that when they requested security beyond the “basic” package offered by Chubb the installation of any new systems was beset by delays and administrative difficulty caused by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa).

One MP said police had advised them to install new security systems in their home but it was too difficult to have them signed off by parliamentary authorities. The MP accused Ipsa of a “computer says no” approach.

Ideas understood to be under consideration include offering MPs routine police protection or private security guards at weekly constituency surgeries as part of the Home Secretary’s review.

It is understood that Priti Patel would like to abolish the two-tier system for MPs’ security. Under the current policy only members who have received serious threats are given the “enhanced” package from the parliamentary security contractor.

Arrangements under review

A Parliament spokesman said they worked with the Metropolitan Police’s Parliamentary Liaison and Intelligence team and local police forces to ensure MPs are as safe as possible adding that security arrangements “are kept under continuous review”.

However a Commons source said the criticism was “unfair to Chubb” insisting that far more parliamentarians were now using security measures than before the firm was brought in. “We now have huge numbers of MPs taking measures because we brought in a national contractor” the source said.

Other features include the Apostles without Judas a citadel representing heaven and the jaws of Hell. Christ bleeding from the nails and with a gaping wound in his side is flanked by his mother Mary and John the Baptist.

Mr Lawes said: “The church’s original Doom it is thought was painted in the 1420s or 1430s and was plastered over during the Reformation.

“The Victorians uncovered it in 1884 but since then it has suffered further and it is now hard to discern.

“So it was a genuine thrill to be asked to recreate it using traditional techniques. A great deal of research had been done on the original with regard to the pigments used.

“And with the knowledge gained from examining the country’s more complete paintings I was able to interpret the Woodham Ferrers’ version.

“It is not as big as the original but I hope it captures the colour and drama and that it provides a sense of what worshippers would once have been looking at as they attended services.

“We are not used to our churches being decorated with bright coloured paintings but it was once common.”

‘Desire to bring the painting to life’

Nia McIntosh a heritage consultant using money from the National Heritage Lottery Fund has overseen a wide Heritage Hub project at St Mary’s.

She said: “The original Doom has been through a lot over the years. It was damaged in a storm in 1989 and has deteriorated further despite conservation interventions.

“It’s now very hard to see which was why we wanted to find out what it had looked like originally and create a new version. We were able to with money from the Friends of Friendless Churches.

“My desire was to bring the painting to life for our visitors and congregation; to create more of an immersive experience and transport people back to the medieval period.

“Steve is an expert in this area and he examined the parts that remain of the original and studied documentary evidence from examinations since it re-emerged in 1884.

“Tests were done on the remaining paint to establish exactly what pigments were used and examination into extant Dooms enabled an interpretation which is as close as we can get.

“I’m sure there hasn’t been a Doom painting using traditional techniques created for a parish church since the Reformation.

“St Mary’s has other medieval paintings and decorations and we are currently hosting an exhibition and events to celebrate it.”

The exhibition Doom and discovery; wall paintings in the medieval church runs until the middle of June.

Other experts involved include Sara Charles a medieval book production expert who hand made the original recipe pigments and the brushes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd0dm0uY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvbXQtb2xpdmUtYmFwdGlzdC1jaHVyY2gtcGl0dHN2aWV3LWFsLWJ1cm5zLWRvd24tYWZ0ZXItYW4tb3Zlcm5pZ2h0LWZpcmUv0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3R2bS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8xMC9tdC1vbGl2ZS1iYXB0aXN0LWNodXJjaC1waXR0c3ZpZXctYWwtYnVybnMtZG93bi1hZnRlci1hbi1vdmVybmlnaHQtZmlyZS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mt. Olive Baptist Church in Pittsview AL burns down after an overnight fire,"PITTSVIEW Ala. (WTVM) - In Pittsview Alabama a pastor is now without his church after it was burned down in an overnight fire. The church is believed to have been struck by lightning.

We went to Mount Olive Baptist Church where there was still smoke from the fire. Officials say the church was around 200 years old and some members had gone to the church for as long as 50 years.

We spoke with Reverand Eugene Brown who has been the pastor at Mount Olive for the last 8 years.

He said the group’s faith is still strong despite seeing their beloved church in ashes.

“The building is destroyed but We are still here because we are the true church of God not the building and we can worship anywhere” said Brown.

No injuries were reported at the church on Continuation Street in Pittsview - there have also been no announcements for rebuilding.

The parishioners are all here. The clergy are too. Well sort of — if you count avatars powered by artificial intelligence.

Today's service features a sermon prayers and songs brought to you almost entirely by ChatGPT.

While AI-led services haven't become mainstream scientists and theologians are exploring how new technology can coexist with some of the world's oldest teachings.

In places like Temple B'Nai Or in Morristown New Jersey the congregation made up of scientists young and old sets out to answer a question: What is a human? And does allowing technology into a fundamentally human experience like faith alter it somehow?

""We started looking at the future that is now and had questions of AI and you know even uploading our mind to the cloud things like that"" Rabbi Michael Satz told Scripps News.

Satz says it isn't the first time the nearly 4000-year-old religion has had to grapple with change.

""My ancestors wrote the Torah in the scroll — 2000 years ago the new technology was to have a book. And so the ancient rabbis had to ask the question can we liturgically use a book when we read the Torah? And they decided no you need to read out of the scroll because that's connecting us to our ancestors"" he said.

Today they're faced with similar questions.

""How do we look at AI as a tool that can help us be who we are rather than help us divide ourselves from others?"" Satz asked.

But can AI answer the tougher questions of spirituality like ""What's the one true religion?""; ""Why do bad things happen to good people?""; ""What happens after you die?""

""I can see people turning to AI as a start as a research tool for those questions and see what have the great Jewish teachers said about this question in the past?"" said Satz.

Congress A congressman wanted to understand AI. So he went back to college AP via Scripps News

Kutter Callaway an associate professor of theology and culture at Fuller Theological Seminary and an adviser with AI and Faith agrees the human touch is necessary.

""Depending upon what data sets it's using we get an intense amount of bias within AI right now"" Callaway told Scripps News. ""And it reflects shock and awe the same bias that we have as humans. And so having someone that is actually a kind of wise guide or mentor to help you discern how to even interpret understand the results that AI is giving you is really important.""

But Callaway says there's good that can come from AI like translating the Bible into various languages.

""That is a very difficult task when it requires on-the-ground humans who know a language really well. But when assisted through AI all of a sudden you have a tool that actually can speed up that process quite a lot"" he said.

Rabbi Geoff Mitelman who helped found the studies at Temple B'Nai Or through his organization Sinai and Synapses agrees saying AI can be an aid in study.

""The best sermons that I ever find ... that I ever hear are when a rabbi sees a word in one text that is used in some other text and links the two of them"" Mitelman said. ""AI can very very quickly say 'Yes here's all the places where this text is used' and then the rabbi can then say 'Oh that's interesting I hadn't seen that connection before but I wouldn't have known this might connect here.'""

However there are concerns across religions about the interpretation of such texts bias and misinformation.

""The spread of misinformation and how easy it is to create and then spread misinformation whether that's using something like Dall-E or ChatGPT or videos and also algorithms that will spread misinformation — because at least for hundreds of thousands of years it was better for humans to trust than to not trust right?"" said Mitelman.

That cautious view of AI and religion seems to translate across practices a poll from the Christian research group Barna shows.

Over half of Christians 52% said they'd be disappointed if they found out AI was used in their church.

In 2020 leaders from the Roman Catholic Church IBM and Microsoft signed the Rome Call for AI Ethics a joint agreement that would eventually include leaders from Judaism Christianity and Islam to make sure future usage of AI is transparent inclusive responsible and impartial.

But no matter how far the technology goes all three agree the embrace of AI and religious life won't happen overnight.

""Our tradition tells us when two people are studying Torah together the divine presence is with them. And I think you know using AI being with AI can be isolating because you're not with other real flesh-and-blood people"" said Satz.

It's just like when places of worship turned to Zoom: Four years later people are slowly coming back to in-person services. The clergy we spoke to said there's a reason for that.

""If you think about so many of the great conversations that you've had or meetings that you've had how many of them were just sort of serendipitous conversations that you had in the parking lot or at services or you know so much of the joy of life are the unexpected meetings"" said Mitelman.

""Often Christian worship is supposed to be cumbersome. It's supposed to be inconvenient. It requires you to bring your body into a space with other bodies and celebrate the broken and bruised body of the God that we worship"" Callaway said.

Which leads back to that church service in Germany and the idea of bots someday replacing faith leaders.

""I think probably yes it is coming and faster than we think"" said Callaway. ""To me depending upon an algorithm essentially to deliver to us what I think is a moment where humans commune with other humans and with God — if you remove the humans from that equation then it's very quickly you're removing God from the equation too.""

Mitelman agrees.

""I think I would be a fool to say that's never going to happen. I think that's certainly not outside the realm of possibility but I don't think it's going to be hugely accepted"" he said. ""People need humanity here whether that's Christianity Islam Hinduism. So much of religion is not just faith but it is a physical manifestation. So is that kneeling is that kissing the Torah scroll is that standing or sitting.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3R1cmtleS1yZW9wZW5zLWFuY2llbnQtY2h1cmNoLXByaXplZC0xMTAzNTc0MTguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Turkey reopens ancient church with prized mosaics to Muslim worship,"FILE PHOTO: Chora Museum or Kariye Mosque re-opens its doors to visitors and worshippers in Istanbul

FILE PHOTO: Chora Museum or Kariye Mosque re-opens its doors to visitors and worshippers in Istanbul

By Ali Kucukgocmen

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey has opened the ancient Chora church one of Istanbul's most celebrated Byzantine buildings to Muslim worshippers after it was used as a museum for more than 70 years making it the second such major conversion under President Tayyip Erdogan.

Erdogan a champion of pious Muslims in Turkey and head of a party with Islamist roots turned Istanbul's world-renowned Hagia Sophia from a museum into a mosque in 2020 in a ceremony attended by tens of thousands of people.

That move was criticised by church leaders and some Western countries who said reconverting Hagia Sophia risked deepening religious rifts. Erdogan said this was interference in sovereign rights and that he was determined to protect Muslims' rights.

The original Chora or Kariye church dates back to the 4th Century and was turned into a mosque by the Ottomans. It became a museum in 1945 and Erdogan signed an order in 2020 converting it back into a mosque. It reopened on Monday after restoration.

The outer halls were preserved as a museum with visitors able to view the prized mosaics that dot the ceiling unhindered. Curtains concealed the mosaics in the building's prayer section in line with Muslim traditions.

People were seen lifting the coverings to look at the mosaics of Jesus and of Mary with the infant Jesus.

Ferdy Simon a British tourist said he would have preferred the building to remain as a museum so that people could see the mosaics and frescoes there. ""It seems to be a political gambit"" he said speaking outside the Chora.

""It's a bit of a shame when you see devout women who have come here to pray and they are told they can't go into the main narthex area"" he added referring to the fact that the main prayer section is reserved for males as in all mosques.

'POLITICAL GAIN'

Ugur Gokgoz a Turkish man who came to pray said it was Turkish people's right to use the Chora as a mosque adding that the artefacts inside the museum were preserved.

""There was a small section reserved for prayer. At the end they didn't tear everything down and turned it into a mosque"" he said.

A church was first built at the site in the 4th century but most of the existing building dates to an 11th century church that was partly rebuilt 200 years later following an earthquake.

The Church of the Holy Saviour in Chora built near the ancient city walls of Constantinople contains 14th century mosaics and frescoes showing scenes from biblical stories.

They were plastered over after the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 but brought to light when - like Hagia Sophia - it was converted to a museum by Turkey's secular republic in 1945.

Burcin Altinsay Ozguner Turkey head of the International Council on Monuments and Sites said the Chora artefacts are unique and the best way to make them available for researchers is to maintain the building as a museum.

""Of course there are political gains behind it"" she said adding there was no obvious need for a mosque in the case of both Hagia Sophia and Chora with mosques right next to them.

During a daylong Commission on Chicago Landmarks hearing dozens who back landmarking St. Adalbert Church provided fiery testimony and characterized the Archdiocese of Chicago and the nearby parish that now oversees the church property as greedy and disrespectful of St. Adalbert’s heritage.

Anina Jakubowski joined many of the landmark supporters in the crowd in saying she placed her hopes not just in the church receiving protected status but in a dream that the church which closed in 2019 might one day reopen. Jakubowski grew up attending masses at St. Adalbert and her mother fought a planned closure of the church in 1974 Jakubowski said.

“It was built as a house of God” said Jakubowski now a Downers Grove resident. “How can you have so many thousands of people who have been in that church and prayed? Where do those prayers go?”

But archdiocese leaders said they opposed the protective designation because it would create restrictions so strict that the church building could become stuck in disrepair and cost the nearby St. Paul Parish that inherited St. Adalbert’s assets millions of dollars in upkeep costs.

“The future vitality of St. Paul’s depends on its ability to use all of the resources it owns including the assets of the closed St. Adalbert’s parish” said Bishop Robert Lombardo who called the potential landmark status “an offense to our right to religious self governance.”

The landmarks commission did not vote on whether it would recommend a landmark designation for St. Adalbert but is scheduled to do so June 6. If the recommendation is made the landmark status question would go to the full City Council for final approval. The status would trigger a series of restrictions on what could be done to the church building and landmarks commission reviews of any redevelopment plans in order to protect the church complex’s “significant features” — including its Renaissance Revival facade. Still a landmarks designation would not completely ban renovations and interior changes.

The church was called “one of the finest in Chicago” by the Tribune when it was completed in 1914 and at its peak served 4000 families. But its membership declined as Pilsen shifted from a more heavily Polish community to predominantly Mexican said Dan Klaiber a Department of Planning and Development coordination planner.

Protesters many of them proudly Polish have ardently pushed back since the archdiocese shut down the church five years ago. They decried the removal of a statue from the site and led the charge for its landmark status. A 73-year-old woman last year was arrested for trespassing while protesting the removal of stained glass windows and art from the shuttered church. On Friday she joined the spectating crowd at City Hall. And many have continued to pray the rosary outside the building every Friday.

But representatives with the archdiocese argued that the building is not significant enough to merit the landmark protections. It pales when compared to other neighborhood churches isn’t made by a significant architect does not add a distinctive presence in the neighborhood and had major structural issues that could require scaffolding to continue to cover its facade urban planning consultant George Kisiel said.

A landmark status would effectively block efforts to reuse the land in Pilsen which desperately needs more affordable housing Lombardo said. Any money made from the archdiocese from selling St. Adalbert would go to St. Paul’s located a mile away he added.

Needed repairs to secure the church long covered with scaffolding on its facade because of safety concerns could cost as much $8 million according to the archdiocese. The landmark designation would deter demolition but would not compel rehabilitation.

The movement to protect St. Adalbert has drawn support from Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez 25th. The Pilsen alderman gave a strident speech Friday that called for the protective status arguing the complex must be saved “not only because of the structure but because of the people … that built this structure with blood sweat and tears.”

He harshly criticized the archdiocese warning that “luxury apartments” would be built on the property if the church does not win protections. He called the arguments of archdiocese leaders “propaganda” and accused them of being like the moneychangers and merchants in the temple in Jerusalem that Jesus lambasted in the Gospel. The comparison drew eruptions of cheers and boos from the crowd.

The charged debate caused the meeting to be continually stalled due to repeated interruptions from the crowd.

“We are here for literally a hearing. That means we hear everybody” said Adam Rubin a landmarks commissioner as he tried to maintain decorum while running the meeting.

James Geoly the Chicago Archdiocese’s general counsel said later that Sigcho-Lopez had effectively blocked several proposals from developers who had pitched plans to convert the church building for other uses such as a museum and an event venue. The archdiocese was under contract with a developer when the church complex was granted preliminary landmark status in August. The landmark status would protect the church building as well as rectory convent and school.

In at least one proposal new developments on the 2-acre property would have included 40% affordable housing while preserving the main building Geoly said. He held out faith that an agreement to develop the land while preserving the structure could be reached.

“Tomorrow this could all be solved” he said."

By Park Jae-hyuk



Cigna is facing intensifying protest from LINA Korea's executives and employees for its recent decision to sell the life insurer to Chubb which has Ace Insurance and Chubb Life Korea as its Korean operations.



""Cigna denied rumors several times about its sale of LINA expressing its intention to continue managing the Korean operation through the announcement of a plan to set up a digital non-life insurance company here"" LINA executives said in a statement Thursday. ""However it abruptly notified its unilateral decision.""



The executives criticized the U.S. headquarters for not listening to LINA employees about its decision on the amount of bonuses to be paid in compensation for the sale.



""Cigna has yet to inform us of the specifics of the bonuses welfare and our status after the sale"" a LINA employee told The Korea Times Friday. ""We organized a council to talk with the U.S. headquarters.""



He added that the employees will form a union if they fail to reach an agreement with Cigna.



LINA executives also vowed to protest against the U.S. headquarters if the acquisition deal prevents employees from being paid what they viewed as a fair amount in recognition of their service. The executives called on Cigna to offer a bonus that meets the amount employees are seeking.



Cigna is said to be considering giving 400 percent of the monthly salary to each employee before the deal is finalized and an additional 200 percent a year later in order to minimize the exodus of its workforce.



LINA staff however were not satisfied with the amount given that the company's net profit last year reached 357.2 billion won ($302 million) the third-largest among life insurers here. The Korean subsidiary of Cigna has also paid 1.1 trillion won to the U.S. headquarters in dividends over the past 10 years.



In addition the price of LINA accounts for at least 60 percent of the $5.75 billion that Cigna will earn from its latest decision to sell its operations in Korea Taiwan Thailand New Zealand Hong Kong Indonesia and Turkey.



The valuation of LINA is even estimated at up to $5 billion according to some market insiders.

Shalat malam termasuk shalat sunah yang paling utama kedudukannya sedikit di bawah shalat wajib yang lima waktu. Foto istimewa

وَمِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَتَهَجَّدْ بِهِ

وَاذْكُرِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ بُكْرَةً وَأَصِيلًا وَمِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَاسْجُدْ لَهُ وَسَبِّحْهُ لَيْلًا طَوِيلًا

وَمِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَسَبِّحْهُ وَأَدْبَارَ السُّجُودِ

وَاصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا ۖ وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ وَمِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَسَبِّحْهُ وَإِدْبَارَ النُّجُومِ

كَانُوا قَلِيلًا مِنَ اللَّيْلِ مَا يَهْجَعُونَ وَبِالْأَسْحَارِ هُمْ يَسْتَغْفِرُونَ

تَتَجَافَىٰ جُنُوبُهُمْ عَنِ الْمَضَاجِعِ يَدْعُونَ رَبَّهُمْ خَوْفًا وَطَمَعًا وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ يُنْفِقُونَ فَلَا تَعْلَمُ نَفْسٌ مَا أُخْفِيَ لَهُمْ مِنْ قُرَّةِ أَعْيُنٍ جَزَاءً بِمَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ

أَفْضَلُ الصَّلاَةِ بَعْدَ صَلاَةِ الْمَفْرُوْضَةِ، صَلاَةُ اللَّيْلِ

نِعْمَ الرَّجُلُ عَبْدُ اللهِ، لَوْ كَانَ يُصَلِّي مِنَ اللَّيْلِ.

(wid)

termasuk shalat sunnah yang paling utama. Kedudukannya sedikit di bawah shalat wajib yang lima waktu. Sangat merugi jika orang Islam sengaja menghindari atau enggan shalat malam. Di dalam banyak ayat Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala menganjurkan kepada Nabi-Nya yang mulia untuk melakukan shalat malam. Antara lain adalah:“Dan pada sebagian malam hari shalat Tahajjud-lah kamu….” (Al-Israa' : 79).Juga ayat berikut:“Dan sebutlah nama Rabb-mu pada (waktu) pagi dan petang. Dan pada sebagian dari malam maka sujudlah kepada-Nya dan bertasbihlah kepada-Nya pada bagian yang panjang di malam hari.” (QS Al-Insaan: 25-26).Atau ayat:“Dan bertasbihlah kamu kepada-Nya di malam hari dan setiap selesai shalat.” (QS Qaaf: 40).Dan ayat:“Dan bersabarlah dalam menunggu ketetapan Rabb-mu maka sesungguhnya kamu berada dalam penglihatan Kami dan bertasbihlah dengan memuji Rabb-mu ketika kamu bangun berdiri dan bertasbihlah kepada-Nya pada be-berapa saat di malam hari dan waktu terbenam bintang-bintang (di waktu fajar).” (QS Ath-Thuur : 48-49).Menurut asy Syaikh Muhammad bin Suud Al-Uraifi bagi yang istiqomah mengerjakan shalat malam maka dia akan menjadi hamba yang dicintai Allah Ta'ala. Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala memuji para hamba-Nya yang shaleh yang senantiasa melakukan shalat malam dan bertahajjud.Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala berfirman:“Mereka sedikit sekali tidur di waktu malam; dan di akhir-akhir malam mereka memohon ampun (kepada Allah).” [(QS Adz-Dzaariyaat : 17-18).Dari kitab Tafsiir ath-Thabari Ibnu ‘Abbas Radhiyallahu anhuma mengatakan “Tak ada satu pun malam yang terlewatkan oleh mereka melainkan mereka melakukan shalat walaupun hanya beberapa raka’at saja.”Al-Hasan al-Bashri berkata “Setiap malam mereka tidak tidur kecuali sangat sedikit sekali.”Al-Hasan juga berkata “Mereka melakukan shalat malam dengan lamanya dan penuh semangat hingga tiba waktu memohon ampunan pada waktu sahur.”Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala berfirman dalam memuji dan menyanjung mereka:“Lambung mereka jauh dari tempat tidurnya sedang mereka berdo’a kepada Rabb-nya dengan rasa takut dan harap dan mereka menafkah-kan sebagian dari rezeki yang Kami berikan ke-pada mereka. Seorang pun tidak mengetahui apa yang disembunyikan untuk mereka yaitu (bermacam-macam nikmat) yang menyedapkan pandangan mata sebagai balasan terhadap apa yang telah mereka kerjakan.” (QS As-Sajdah : 16-17).Nabi Shallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam senantiasa menganjurkan kepada para Sahabatnya untuk melakukan shalat malam dan membaca al-Qur-an di dalamnya. Hadis-hadis yang mengungkapkan tentang hal ini sangat banyak untuk dapat dihitung. Namun kami hanya akan menyinggung sebagiannya saja berikut panda-ngan para ulama sekitar masalah ini.Abu Hurairah Radhiyallahu anhu berkata bahwa Rasulullah Shallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam bersabda:“Shalat yang paling utama setelah shalat wajib adalah shalat yang dilakukan di malam hari.”Al-Bukhari rahimahullah berkata dalam shahihnya : “Bab Keutamaan Shalat Malam.” Ibnu ‘Umar Radhiyallahu anhuma bahwa ia berkata: “Seseorang di masa hidup Rasulullah Shallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam apabila bermimpi menceritakannya kepada beliau. Maka aku pun berharap dapat bermimpi agar aku ceritakan kepada Rasulullah Shallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam.Saat aku muda aku tidur di dalam masjid lalu aku bermimpi seakan dua Malaikat membawaku ke Neraka. Ternyata Neraka itu berupa sumur yang dibangun dari batu dan memiliki dua tanduk. Di dalamnya terdapat orang-orang yang aku kenal. Aku pun berucap ‘Aku berlindung kepada Allah dari Neraka!’Ibnu ‘Umar melanjutkan ceritanya ‘Malaikat yang lain menemuiku seraya berkata ‘Jangan takut!’ Akhirnya aku ceritakan mimpiku kepada Hafshah dan ia menceritakannya kepada Rasulullah Shallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam lalu beliau bersabda:‘Sebaik-baik hamba adalah ‘Abdullah seandainya ia melakukan shalat pada sebagian malam.’ (HR. Muslim).Wallahu A'lam",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbWFnZGFsZW5lLmNvL3N0b3J5L2RyYWtvci1ob21ldG93bi1jaGEtY2hhLWNoYS1raW0tc2Vvbi1oby1ob25nLWJhbmphbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Bukti 'Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha' Lebih dari Cerita Cinta Ringan,When a k-pop star's death unintentionally opened the can of worms.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd29saXBvcC5kZXRpay5jb20vbG92ZS9kLTU3NzA5MzgvNDAta2F0YS1rYXRhLW1vdGl2YXNpLWlzbGFtaS10ZW50YW5nLWNpbnRhLWphZGktcGVueWVqdWstaGF0aS1kYW4tbWVueWVudHVo0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93b2xpcG9wLmRldGlrLmNvbS9sb3ZlL2QtNTc3MDkzOC80MC1rYXRhLWthdGEtbW90aXZhc2ktaXNsYW1pLXRlbnRhbmctY2ludGEtamFkaS1wZW55ZWp1ay1oYXRpLWRhbi1tZW55ZW50dWgvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,40 Kata-kata Motivasi Islami Tentang Cinta Jadi Penyejuk Hati dan Menyentuh,"Banyak orang menjadi bucin (budak cinta) dan rela melakukan apa saja demi pasangannya.

KuTips: Pakai Metode 'RIDD' untuk Atasi Anak Tantrum"
CSCO,Cisco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL25ld3Nyb29tLmNpc2NvLmNvbS9jL3IvbmV3c3Jvb20vZW4vdXMvYS95MjAyMS9tMTAvYXV0b25vbW91cy1hbmQtcmVtb3RlbHktZHJpdmVuLXJhY2UtY2Fycy1oaWdobGlnaHQtcG93ZXItb2YtY2lzY28tdGVjaG5vbG9naWVzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Autonomous and remotely driven race cars highlight power of Cisco technologies,"Whether the drivers are humans or computers high-performance race cars demand split-second reflexes and responsive reliable technology that excels under the most punishing and dangerous conditions.

That’s why Cisco has been working with Indy Autonomous Challenge and GT race teams in Indianapolis and in Austria to push the boundaries of what autonomous or remotely driven cars can do. The resulting innovations promise impacts far beyond the racetrack. The Indianapolis initiative showcases wireless capabilities that benefit everything from autonomous pick-and-pack warehouses and factory-floor robots to self-driving rail and people movers. And in Europe the reliability and performance demonstrated by controlling an all-electric GT race car from 43 miles away using Cisco SD-WAN could be leveraged for any business connecting campus branch or remote worker location.

As the premier sponsor of the $1.5 million Indy Autonomous Challenge on Oct. 23 Cisco is contributing its technology and networking expertise to support the first autonomous car race at the famed Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS). It involves 9 teams made up of students from 21 universities. Each team has been pulling all-nighters to develop the coding algorithms and software that will control their otherwise identical Dallara-built AV-21racecars all fitted with self-driving hardware re-engineered and assembled by Clemson University students.

To succeed it’s critical to have network connections that are lightning fast highly reliable and ultra-low latency. That’s where Cisco comes in.

“The network is super important” said Patty Medberry head of product marketing for Cisco’s Internet of Things group. “At these speeds one little hiccup can spell disaster so low-latency and reliability is key. And all the different sensors radars and cameras need to work together as one. That generates large amounts of data that the network must be able to handle.”

Remote connectivity on the GT Circuit

In Spielberg Germany on Sept. 5 the opening lap of the Red Bull Ring was run by one of the world’s fastest electric cars a 1000-horsepower DTM/Schaeffler race car. But for this event the car was controlled by a professional race driver 43 miles away in Graz Austria.

The remote driving and networking capabilities were developed by Cisco and its partner the German network service provider Riedel Networks. It’s a partnership with deep roots and extensive experience in the racing industry with the two companies collaborating on wide-area networking (WAN) and other infrastructure requirements for major events across Europe.

“It’s a very special relationship we have with Cisco” said Michael Martens managing director and CEO of Riedel Networks. “We use nothing but Cisco equipment. And we do 22 Formula One races a year. We have gotten a lot of support from Cisco over the years and we thought this challenge would be a good way to show just how powerful Cisco technologies can be.”

Cisco solutions for the Spielberg event included a trackside IP-network to connect the car to the pit crew with data and video. Cisco SD-WAN and Catalyst edge platforms provided direct connections between the racetrack and remote driver with Cisco 5G Cellular Gateway as a redundant backup. The average network latency was only 2 milliseconds.

“The goal of using these technologies” Martens stressed “is to combine the greatest compute power with ultra-low latency to deliver as close to the speed of light as possible.”

Showing what’s possible beyond racing

The implications for both the European and U.S. initiatives go far beyond racing.

“Racing is a fun thing” said Kyle Connor Cisco’s global transportation principal “but it’s not just about racetracks. Autonomous vehicles are in use across a variety of industries. And we’re showing how we can connect this intricate sensor-fusion capability and do it with great speed and safety. Because a car like this is not that different from an autonomous mining vehicle a train a crane in a port or a mobile robot in a smart factory.”

Similar Cisco solutions are already employed in rides at the world’s largest and most popular amusement parks.

“Some of the same technologies are already moving people around in amusement park rides” Connor said. “They don’t travel at 200 miles an hour but they’re all about voice and video sync. An explosion has to shake the ride at just the right time or your experience won’t be a good one. And if that vehicle stops talking to the network you have to make sure that those paying riders are safely controlled or stop the vehicle if necessary.”

On behalf of the Indy Autonomous Challenge Clemson University and Energy Systems Network (ESN) evaluated a number of technologies before settling on the Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul for the race’s foundational infrastructure.

“At this level of data transmission we needed a super reliable system and a super robust wireless infrastructure” said Matt Peak managing director of Energy Systems Network and a leader of the Indy Autonomous Challenge “so that our race control could track everything and and issue essential commands when necessary.”

So far the decision has paid off.

“In tests we were seeing around 400 plus megabits per second at very high speeds” Connor said. “Cisco Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul was the only technology with the reliability speed and low latency that met their requirements. Since then Cisco has donated its rugged Industrial Catalyst IE Switches to connect the various sensor components within the cars. These switches are built to withstand the harsh environments and the vibrations from the car and are similar to switches used on large mining vehicles.”

Motor sports have a grand tradition of innovation and there’s no telling what may arise from these current efforts.

“The Indianapolis Motor Speedway has been a proving ground for hundreds of innovations” said Medberry “including airbags anti-lock brakes and rear-view mirrors.”

Added Peak: “We’re very mindful of the shoulders that we’re standing on. There’s a 100-plus year history of innovation at Indianapolis. We hope to make our contribution to that cause with autonomy. And given the talent passion and conviction on these race teams I believe that we are working with future auto industry and robotics leaders.”

Another aspect of both the Indianapolis and European initiatives is that the vehicles use off-the-shelf technologies which would make adoption simpler across many industries.

“They took these cars and retrofitted them” Medberry said. “So if you applied this to say mining or cranes in a port you would not have to buy a whole new vehicle.”

Safety on the racetrack safety on the highways

For Martens the reliability of these systems is critical for all future use cases.

“It’s very important to have very rugged technology and reliable service” he said. “If you’re the driver of a multimillion-dollar race car communication must be crystal clear. And the network can’t be interrupted.”

As Peak stressed that same level of reliability and innovation promises to protect everyday drivers as well. For example the algorithms and technologies used at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway can improve advanced driver-assistance systems which assume control of cars to help drivers avoid highway dangers.

“A big goal is to save lives in person-driven cars” he explained. “If a fully autonomous race car can swerve around other cars and obstacles and maintain a steady state at a high speed then imagine it on your passenger car at 65 miles per hour when that unexpected obstacle falls off of the truck in front of you and you have to avoid it.”

For Martens the reliability of these systems is critical for all future use cases.

For Liana Schmitt Cisco’s SD-WAN managed service creation sales specialist for central EMEAR the Cisco/Riedel Networks/Schaeffler/ITR initiative is a demonstration of both technology and partnerships — and what’s possible when great innovators combine their talents.

“These are special use cases” she concluded. “But they demonstrate the power of our portfolio of network technologies. We’re thankful to have an opportunity to demonstrate our solutions and how we work together with our partners to figure out new areas of success new markets and future-proof projects.”

American technology major Cisco Systems’ India arm has renewed its lease for 9 commercial buildings totalling over 2.7 million sq ft in the largest office lease transactions in the country since the pandemic outbreak said persons with direct knowledge of the development.The San Jose-headquartered company has entered into an agreement with the Blackstone Group-entity Nucleus Office Parks to renew the lease at its Cessna Business Parks at Outer Ring Road in Bangalore “Cisco has renewed the lease for this space which houses its data labs and development offices for the next five years at 20% escalation to existing rentals” said one of the persons mentioned above.Cessna Business Parks an information technology special economic zone (SEZ) was earlier owned by realty developer Prestige Estate Projects and was sold to Blackstone as part of the over Rs 7460 crore transaction.Following the conclusion of the Prestige transaction Blackstone integrated this asset with Nucleus Office Parks that houses the US private equity major’s standalone office assets that are not part of any alliance with Indian developers.ET’s separate email queries to Cisco and Nucleus Office Parks remained unanswered until the time of going to press.Occupiers and tenants of large office complexes across the country including big corporations are renewing their lease agreements indicating their preference despite the much-talked about emergence of the work-from-home option following the outbreak of Covid19 pandemic last year.Corporates are going for renewals of large office spaces in key office markets with several large deals that were concluded recently.Following the outbreak of Covid19 pandemic around 21 million sq ft office spaces have been renewed since April 2020.In some of the largest deals Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) signed around 1.3 million sq ft Concentrix signed 8.46 lakh sq ft JP Morgan 8.44 lakh sq ft IBM 7.93 lakh sq ft and Amazon 6.34 lakh sq ft across major Indian cities.Rising interest in renewing office leases by big organizations is an indication of the return of business confidence and hiring scenario.The strength displayed by the office market in India since the pandemic owes much to the fact that the IT/ITeS sector has been largely unaffected by the economic downturn. IT/ITeS occupiers continued to account for a majority of the office leasing activity in 2020 at around 50%.The Indian IT industry the lead demand driver for office real estate in India is expected to hire more than 350000 employees in 2022 double the average in the past five years translating into more office space.The top five IT companies representing nearly one-third of the 4.4 million-strong Indian IT-BPO industry hired 55000 people in the June quarter and are likely to conclude the year with net hiring of around 1.5 lakh employees 50% higher than the best year in the past decade.Taking cues from 2020 the second half of the year is expected to witness increased momentum in the office space pick up.In 2021 net office absorption across seven major cities is likely to remain flat at around the levels of 25.6 million sq ft achieved in 2020 in case there are no further lockdowns JLL India said in a recent report.It expects the year 2021 to most likely close on an encouraging note provided vaccination targets are achieved and the country does not see another major outbreak of the virus.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvd2UtYXJlLXBvaXNlZC1hdC10aGUtY3VzcC1vZi10cmVtZW5kb3VzLW9wcG9ydHVuaXR5LWNpc2NvLXMtY2hpdHRpbGFwaWxseS0xMjExMDE3MDA3MTdfMS5odG1s0gGVAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21wYW5pZXMvd2UtYXJlLXBvaXNlZC1hdC10aGUtY3VzcC1vZi10cmVtZW5kb3VzLW9wcG9ydHVuaXR5LWNpc2NvLXMtY2hpdHRpbGFwaWxseS0xMjExMDE3MDA3MTdfMS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We are poised at the cusp of tremendous opportunity: Cisco's Chittilapilly,"Daisy Chittilapilly president of Cisco for India and Saarc who is responsible for strategy and sales operations and investments to drive the company’s long-term growth in the region sees the firm poised at the cusp of tremendous opportunity.

The fundraiser’s spirit of giving reached remarkable levels with West Aussies from all over the State opening their hearts — and wallets — for those in need.

Toppling last year’s record of $46.3 million 2021 marks the 12th consecutive year that the Telethon fundraising drive has broken the record set by the previous year.

Telethon chairman Richard Goyder thanks West Aussies for giving generously.

“Every cent is valued. We have some amazing philanthropists and the shared community support for Telethon is particularly inspiring” he said.

“Our Telethon beneficiaries are incredible people doing great things with huge amounts of passion and energy.”

Mr Goyder said that despite a tough year — with WA grappling with the uncertainty of border closures and the looming threat of COVID-19 restrictions — he was “always confident” West Aussies would dig deep for the annual fundraiser.

“As a community we look after the people who need the most help” he said.

“When we do that together and everyone makes a contribution that’s really special. We can’t thank everyone enough.”

This weekend’s mammoth donations drive brought the total amount raised by Telethon over 54 years to more than $400 million.

The State Government’s $10 million donation helped push the tally over the $62 million mark.

Surrounded by little Telethon stars Ollie Lim and Lucy Antipas Mr McGowan handed over the State Government’s cheque — the last big donation of the evening.

“The State Government’s ongoing support goes towards helping WA’s world-class child health researchers which is vital if we are to better understand diseases and chronic conditions and find new ways to prevent diagnose and treat them” he said.

“I’d encourage Western Australians to contribute generously to Telethon 2021 as they do every year because it’s this support that goes to helping Western Australian children.”

The donation marks a $4.5 million increase on last year’s $5.5 million cheque.

Other big donations included $3 million from Seven West Media chairman Kerry Stokes’ Australian Capital Equity $4 million from Rio Tinto $2.5 million from Crown and $2 million from Mineral Resources. On Saturday night the Telethon Ball raised $5.5 million.

In 2020 COVID-19 restrictions meant the broadcast was split into two halves. This year the much-loved 26-hour broadcast returned.

During the day it was streamed from the Optus family fun day where 24000 West Aussies flocked to enjoy rides activities and sunshine.

In the evening the broadcast returned to Crown where a stunning closing show — hosted by Channel 7 presenter Basil Zempilas — showcased some of WA’s biggest stars.

Fremantle indie pop stars San Cisco performed for the first time at Telethon after touring clashed with the event in previous years.

Lead singer Jordi Davieson said it was important to “pay it forward” by supporting the annual fundraiser.

“We’re so lucky to be here and doing what we do ... I think it’s important to give something back” he said.

Davieson said that musicians often support charity because they are generally “emotionally intelligent people”.

“To write good songs you kind of have to be” he explained. “You need empathy and to have some sort of depth to you.”

Being in a band “can be a very self-absorbed thing … it would be terrible to not somehow pay that forward”.

The San Cisco frontman added it was great to see so many local bands playing live at Telethon this year.

“In the old days they used to have all sorts of incredible acts playing like Stevie Wonder and Tina Turner” Davieson said.

“I think that’s pretty cool.”

The crowd were also wowed by special live performances from the Ten Tenors Gina Williams and Guy Ghouse.

Sporting favourites Nic Naitanui and Nat Fyfe and comedians Rove McManus and Ben Elton joined the line-up at the Crown Theatre.

Behind the scenes hundreds of volunteers took phone donations. Many had worked through the night to keep the Telethon Cirrus call centre running. They were encouraged by the Little Telethon stars Ollie Lim and Lucy Antipas who urged West Aussies to keep giving.

But finding a bank willing to take the money is a little more complicated. That is the hard lesson learned by people such as Genevieve LeJeune the founder of Skirt Club which runs a 16000-strong community for bisexual and bi-curious women and hosts events – including sex parties – around the world.

LeJeune says she had been a premier customer with HSBC her entire life and did not bother to shop around when she opened her business account in 2013. She said she told the bank that she ran a community for the “B” in LGBTQ+ and was not chased for any further information. “I didn’t think for one minute they would have an issue with what the business was about. And why would they be concerned as long as I’m cashflow positive and I do all the right things and it’s completely legal?”

All of a sudden in 2019 her business accounts were shut and the funds frozen. She has spent more than four years battling HSBC for access to more than £20000 trapped in those accounts. She was never offered an explanation and only regained control of the cash this spring after complaining to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Her suspicion was that the bank did not want to be associated with her business as Skirt Club’s signature “play parties” gained more press coverage.

HSBC says it does not have a blanket ban on sex-related business customers but considers each client on a “case by case” basis.

So LeJeune was not surprised when she heard that OnlyFans the online subscription platform known for hosting adult content blamed banks for its decision to ban pornography from its site last month. While OnlyFans later secured an agreement allowing sex workers to continue posting photos and videos others in the industry have not been so lucky.

Tess Herrmann a researcher at the UK charity National Ugly Mugs (NUM) which provides support to sex workers is investigating access to financial services across the adult industry which covers stripping pornography escort and dominatrix work and “full sexual service” more commonly referred to as prostitution.

“We see a lot of discrimination specifically from banks and financial institutions where sex workers are not able to open business accounts even though their escort business is a business but it’s not seen as such” she says. She has also heard of both personal and business accounts being shut down money being seized and sex workers being refused loans and overdrafts. “The stigma surrounding sex work affects every part of a sex worker’s life which includes their financial life their financial decisions and their access to financial services” Herrmann says.

Full-service sex work is legal in the UK. Banking the proceeds of sex work is not a criminal offence and does not constitute money laundering under UK law. However the parameters are narrow given that many related activities such as soliciting in a public place operating brothels pimping and kerb crawling are unlawful.

There are no specific regulators for sex workers or for the pornography and adult entertainment industries. This means there are no officials to certify that work is being done within the rules which in turn makes it harder for private companies such as banks to assess potential customers.

The potential risks are high: they could include exposure to child abuse images trafficking organised crime modern slavery or money laundering. Extra checks can be expensive and more difficult to justify for some lenders forcing some banks to introduce full bans on sex workers. Even the Financial Conduct Authority which regulates banking does not have policies outlining how to serve the adult entertainment industry while industry body UK Finance does not provide any guidance for its members on the issue saying that each bank will take a view depending on their commercial and risk appetite.

But Natasha Mulvihill a senior lecturer in criminology at the Centre for Gender and Violence Research at the University of Bristol says that while banks might have valid concerns about the risks handing oversight on such a contentious topic to the private sector can be problematic. “Are private sector companies the best arbiters of morality? Their judgments are always going to be based ultimately on profit.”

While high street banks may seem more risk-averse upstart fintechs are also cautious about the industry.

Following its troubles with HSBC Skirt Club turned to Revolut but after only a year it issued a 30-day notice for LeJeune to collect her cash before shutting her account without explanation. Revolut declined to comment but its policy states that it does not accept adult entertainment or pornography businesses as customers. It is not clear whether there was a mistake in the company’s processing of Skirt Club’s customer details. LeJeune now banks with Chester-based CardOneMoney a lender that offers accounts to higher-risk customers for a fee.

Sarah Kocianski a fintech expert and head of strategic insights at startup funder Founders Factory says that companies like Revolut Monzo and Starling which have yet to turn an annual profit may be hesitant to take on riskier clients such as sex workers – or even CBD and cannabis-related companies – that require more work and cost to monitor. “While they do want to help underserved communities they are not in a position to” she says. “I don’t think any of them want to accidentally step out of line.”

If sex workers move to cryptocurrencies it is not helpful for proving their income and it could be higher risk Natasha Mulvihill University of Bristol

The challenge is where that leaves sex-related businesses or more vulnerable independent sex workers who face further risks by not having access to banking. Aside from the constant fear about having an account shut it can also affect their ability to collect benefits prove income when renting a home and even pay the right taxes. Business accounts also add an extra level of security for sex workers who don’t want to share their real name with clients which can be quite dangerous Herrmann says.

This year 30-year-old escort Charlotte Edwards made headlines when she started a campaign to guarantee sex workers fair access to banking after she was denied a Covid loan from a scheme intended for small businesses. The bank in question Santander changed its mind after interventions from the all-party parliamentary group on fair business banking.

Edwards is now considering suing Santander for indirect discrimination. She believes banks are “discriminating against an already marginalised group who make a precarious living”.

“By making sex workers poorer with less access to resources such as banking services and business platforms they are actually contributing to people – especially women – staying within sex work but with far less protection and putting them at risk” she says.

Santander does not serve businesses in sectors such as the adult entertainment industry a policy it says is meant to “protect some of the most vulnerable citizens from risk of abuse including human trafficking”. However that policy can be challenged. “Departures from the policy are assessed on a case-by-case basis and can be approved when the bank is comfortable that such a departure would not pose harm to a prospective customer” a spokesperson says.

Excluding sex workers from the financial sector could also push them towards the informal economy. “If sex workers move to cryptocurrencies and other ways of being paid like gift cards it is not helpful for proving their income and it could be higher risk for them” Mulvihill says. Skirt Club is already considering turning to bitcoin to keep running. “Banks are not on my side they’re not here to help my business” says LeJeune. “Why would I stick with a high street bank any more?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLXByZXNzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9saWZlLzIwMjEvMTAvMTcvaG93LWZvcnQtbXllcnMtaGlzdG9yaWMtZGlzdHJpY3Qtd2VudC1jb3dib3ktdG93bi1hcmNoaXRlY3R1cmFsLWdlbS82MDUxOTY4MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From cowboy town to architectural gem: Fort Myers' historic district,"Cynthia Williams

Special to Fort Myers News-Press

Two weeks ago in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of Tropicalia I wrote about the most historically significant site in downtown Fort Myers. Today and again in celebration of Tropicalia I offer you part of the story (told with excerpts principally and unless otherwise noted from ""Hidden History of Fort Myers"" Chapter IV ""Built on Ego"" ) of how the heart of the historic district was transformed from a ramshackle cowboy town into the architectural gem it is today.

THE RIVALRY

The essential story of this transformation lies in the rivalry between two of the most dominant figures in Fort Myers history — Walter G. Langford and Harvie E. Heitman.

In 1904 “when the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad laid track into town linking Fort Myers with the solid clink of iron couplers to the world” (“The Pioneering Tourists Who Helped Build Fort Myers” Fort Myers News-Press January 17 2016) it was Walter Langford everybody had to thank for it.

In the first two decades of the 20th century however Harvie Heitman hell-bent on modernizing Fort Myers was largely responsible for the architectural makeover of the core of the downtown business district.

He began with the construction of the first brick building in Fort Myers — his own mercantile finished in 1898. Painted green with gold trim it was by 1900 the premier retail establishment in southwest Florida.

More:Florida history: St. Augustine the first permanent European settlement

“In 1901 Harvie Heitman evicted the tenants in the wood frame building next to his store tore the thing down and built a brick bank with a plate glass front. He installed a vault lined with Bessemer steel and secured with automatic locking devices. The interior of the bank [a branch if the Citizens Bank & Trust Company of Tampa] was finished in black cypress and in keeping with the technological advances of the new 20th century furnished with running water electric lights and telephones.”

In the winter of 1904 Heitman and Ambrose McGregor’s widow Tootie made plans to build a hotel. “It would be the first brick hotel and the first three-story brick building in Fort Myers. Harvie cleared the lot on the northeast corner of First and Hendry for it tearing down a wood-frame building then housing a small cigar ‘factory’ and Fort Myers’ first public reading room and to the dismay of many cutting down an aged and prolific pecan tree and half a dozen heavily laden orange trees.

“The construction of Tootie’s massive 43-room Bradford Hotel required 100000 Chattanooga pressed bricks. Its rounded corner entrance arched window and door frames and ten-foot-wide second-level veranda along with the plate glass windows across the retail spaces on the ground level made the hotel very grand and modern in appearance; its steam heat electric lights private baths and carpeted hallways and sitting rooms made it world class.”

More:Stained glass studio in Fort Myers inspired by love of art perfection

“In 1910 by adding a seamless annex Heitman doubled the size of the hotel. In the process he demolished the second oldest structure in Fort Myers a house that had been original to the fort.”

“In 1911 Heitman built the 3-story brick Bank of Fort Myers opposite its former location on the north side of First Street next to his superstore. The Press described it as an ‘ornament’ to the city and indeed it was with its stylish hip roof decorative white-brick designs and thick white pillars supporting great arched entryways.

“Coincidentally perhaps Walter Langford’s uncle Taff Langford beloved Fort Myers saloon keeper pulled down the wooden structure next to the bank and constructed his own two-story brick building which provided space on the top floor for The Grand Fort Myers’ first moving picture show theater. Flickers were shown daily.”

“In 1913 First National Bank President Walter Langford contracted for the construction of a First National Bank building on the corner of First and Hendry on the site of the Heitman-Evans store. (Heitman was moving across the street.) The monument to pseudo-Greek Revivalism was finished in August of 1914. Like a Greek temple…it reared Ionic columns to a triangular tympanum its twin entrance doors opening to a sanctuary of cold white marble.

“It was Walter Langford hauteur in solid granite.

“As Langford’s $50000 bank was rising block by granite block Harvie knocked down the historic old Jehu Blount general store on the northwest corner of First and Hendry and began work on a new two-story Heitman-Evans store with hardware on the first level and agricultural implements on the second. To add to the list of Heitman ‘firsts’ in Fort Myers his new building was equipped with a water sprinkling system.”

“Now [Heitman] turned back to the south side of First Street where the cold gray granite of the First National Bank building continued its monumental ascension. Jerking down every old wood-frame building between Taff Langford’s building on the east end of the block and Walter Langford’s bank on the west end he began construction of an $85000 193-foot long two-story building that he called the Earnhardt.

“Six months later the Earnhardt was finished. It was Harvie Earnhardt Heitman’s masterpiece. Creamy brick ornamented with decorative cornices and white and green trimming it offered eight retail spaces on the ground floor and thirty-five office spaces on the second. It also boasted Fort Myers’ first public washroom complete with hot and cold running water.”

And what of the bystanders the citizens of Fort Myers during all this commotion? In my Tropicalia story titled “Determination and Scrap Lumber Built Fort Myers’ First Hospital” (Fort Myers News-Press October 16 2016) I imagined in the vernacular one probable point of view.

“The town’s tearing down and building up so fast that you cain’t hardly get through the streets. You go som’ers today and tomorrer you cain’t find it. Gone. Up one side ‘a Main [First] Street and down t’other Langferd and Heitman seem to be in a dad gum race to see who can tear down and build up the fastest. Downright dangerous in town with all them buildin’s crashin’ down and like I say you go som’ers one day and the next it ain’t there. Instead of a general store you got a guy on his knees trowelin’ mortar to brick.

“Now a’ course Heitman and Langferd ain’t the only ones in on it. That Ton Ton…however you say it [Tonnelier]…that fancy-name feller from Michigan has gone and bought Doc Matheson’s big stone building and is fancying it up with this Patio duh Leeown [Patio de Leon] he calls it. And Mizz Terry now that woman has got sawdust flying all over the Royal Palm and the Riverview buildin’ up them hotels for the crowds that the Board of Trade’s fixin’ to bring in here with advertising paid for by their “publicity” tax. And ‘a course not to be outdone and to help kerry these rich folks upriver old ‘Bulldog’ Towles is building a wharf at the end ‘a Jackson street to accommodate his new steamships if you can believe that.

“And houses? Going up like toadstools. Between ’11 and ’12 maybe two hunnert of ‘em. Whole subdivisions planned way out east of town. Ever’ body’s gone plumb crazy.”

The frenzy of demolition and construction extended also to the bitter contest of wills between Heitman and “Bulldog” Bill Towles over the building of a new courthouse. Langford backed Towles and Heitman lost. Despite court injunctions brought against it “In December 1915 the new courthouse was finished. It stood there in all its solid yellow brick and granite neoclassic insolent grandeur its broad granite steps ascending proudly to a porch fronted with towering Doric columns its great double doors opening to an immense lobby of marble and darkly gleaming wood.

“It was Walter Galloway Langford to the T.

“Now Harvie Heitman was moving now like a whirling dervish down the north side of First Street all the wood frame buildings between the Bradford on west end of the block and his store on the east end clattering down in his wake. Dividing the block with a centered tiled arcade running the width of the block from First to Bay Street on the river he built retail space opening along either side of the arcade and on the river side Fort Myers’ first bona fide theater...with a stage…comfortable built-in seats and a moving picture screen.

“Two years later Harvie updated his Arcade Theater with lamps and fans mounted on walnut walls four hundred veneered seats a spacious stage with foot lights and dressing rooms and lights hanging from a steel ceiling. This sumptuous new theater opened on February 25 1917 to a full house.”

HEARTS STOP BUT THE BEAT GOES ON

“On the eve of the Florida building boom of the 1920s—a real estate construction and population expansion of inconceivable magnitude—Harvie Heitman and Walter Langford retired from their labors and died Walter in 1920 at the age of forty-seven and Harvie two years later at the age of fifty.

“Their work was finished…[but] even as they receded into the pages of their own history Fort Myers rushed into the future. In the decade to come the old frontier Fort Myers like a face wavering beneath water would sink wholly from sight and memory and the outlines of a new city emerge.”

With oil prices at seven-year highs and investors worried about supply chain problems and inflation Wall Street is on the hunt for companies that will avoid the worst of the pain of rising costs — or turn it to their advantage.

One way to do that is through pricing power which is shorthand for a company's ability to raise prices to cancel out rising costs and maintain the profits and margins that investors want to see.

(UNITED) in Harahan Louisiana has won the prestigious President’s Award for Quality Excellence from The Coca-Cola Company. The New Orleans facility demonstrated best-in-class performance in driving down consumer complaint rates and capability compliance and commitment to quality.

Since 1987 The Coca-Cola Company has presented the President’s Award to the one manufacturing facility in the United States that delivers on the promise of consumer satisfaction and delight. The New Orleans facility earned the highest overall score in the President’s Quality Scoring Index and maintained all external certifications for quality food safety occupational safety and environmental impact.

“Anybody who’s been in the U.S. bottling business for any amount of time knows New Orleans is one of the great bottling franchises in all of North America” said John Sherman Coca-Cola UNITED president and CEO. “When New Orleans joined the UNITED family in 2016 it was paramount to us to invest in our associates and facilities. The success of the last five years is a true testament to our team’s commitment to our four core values one of which is Quality.”

Stan Ellington Coca-Cola UNITED vice president of Supply Chain and Operations echoed Sherman’s sentiments crediting the achievement to “the two Ps” – people and process.

“Quality doesn’t happen by accident it happens by plan” Ellington said. “Winning the President’s Award is a true team effort that isn’t limited to supply chain and production. It’s the coming together of all areas of our company that made this possible from corporate to sales and distribution to engineering to fleet. It’s our people who bring New Orleans to life.”

James “Butch” Scarborough New Orleans Coca-Cola Production Center manager added the win is a big boost to the team many of whom were impacted by Hurricane Ida in South Louisiana.

“It means a lot to be recognized for our efforts and our positive impact on the customers consumers and communities we serve” Scarborough said. “This honor is especially uplifting as many of our associates and communities recover from the storm. I’m proud of the resilience our team has shown while performing at the highest level.”

“Coca-Cola UNITED’s New Orleans facility is a shining example of quality excellence. In the face of adversity and natural disaster their commitment to quality did not weaken; it grew stronger” said Alfredo Rivera president of North America for The Coca-Cola Company. “Their hard work resilient spirit and commitment to community helped them elevate their performance to the highest levels of quality and consumer satisfaction.”

Established in 1902 New Orleans Coca-Cola today serves more than 5000 customers in the greater metropolitan area. New Orleans Coca-Cola joined the Coca-Cola UNITED family in 2016. Headquartered in Birmingham Alabama Coca-Cola UNITED is the third-largest bottler of Coca-Cola products in the U.S. and most of Louisiana is included in its territory. The company operates bottling facilities and distribution centers in Baton Rouge and New Orleans as well as sales and distribution centers in Alexandria Lafayette Lake Charles Monroe and Shreveport.

This man’s reaction while using a Coca-Cola freestyle machine is absolutely electric.

The TikTok video has gotten over 550k likes in just one day.

Be sure to check out more pop culture stories at BroBible here .

Most would probably agree that the wheel electricity and the Internet are three of the most unbelievable inventions in the history of man. Maybe you throw the telephone the printing press and automobiles on your list of the greatest inventions as well. But do you know what else deserves a spot on that list? The Coca-Cola Freestyle machine.

If you were a kid when the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine was first introduced you probably remember where you first saw that glorious piece of machinery. You may even remember the exact date you laid eyes on one of the machines for the first time.

Nowadays they’re practically everywhere. You see them inside every other fast-food restaurant you go to and certainly inside different quick chain food spots. We’re numb to the magic behind the machine now because it’s the norm.

There are people out there that haven’t ever seen a Freestyle machine however and get to feel that feeling we all did when we first got to choose which soft drink we wanted.

Thankfully ro_taylor17 shared one of those moments on TikTok.

In her caption she writes that her brother has been “gone 10 years” and the video shows him having his mind absolutely blown away by the Freestyle machine.

At first he can’t believe there’s a lime Fanta flavor then he hits the Hi-C button and unleashes a ‘daaaaaaaamn’ that you can’t help but laugh at.

Vandersloot has been with the Chicago Sky since they drafted her with the third pick in 2011 riding the ups and downs that 10 years later led them to the mountaintop. As Vandersloot the longest-tenured Sky player tried to put the franchise’s historic first WNBA championship into words after the 80-74 win over the Phoenix Mercury in Game 4 on Sunday she recounted a conversation that brought this team’s storybook season full circle.

Several years ago when the Sky were going through some personnel changes Vandersloot and Candace Parker were together in Europe training and playing with USA Basketball. At a club in Spain one night Parker told Vandersloot about this coach she had her eye on named James Wade.

“I told Michael [Alter] ‘Candace Parker told me we need to hire this guy’” Vandersloot said referring to the Sky’s owner. “Now she comes to play for him and the first year we come here to win a championship — I don’t think you can write it better than that.”

Parker has said she knew this team was capable of winning a title in her first year — the two-time WNBA MVP left Los Angeles after 13 seasons and a championship with the Sparks to sign in her hometown of Chicago. She knew the caliber of players the Sky had but she also believed in their coach.

Coach Wade was ready for the challenge. pic.twitter.com/DPlXObuXau — Just Women’s Sports (@justwsports) October 17 2021

Parker said something she’s appreciated about Wade is the adjustments he makes. One of those decisions came with 4:52 left in the fourth quarter Sunday and the Sky trailing the Mercury 70-65 when Wade subbed Stefanie Dolson back in for Azurá Stevens despite her having five fouls. Dolson made the layup at the 1:22 mark that gave the Sky the lead and put in another one 36.2 seconds later that helped them ice the game.

Chicago which had trailed by as many as 14 points in the third quarter rode a 15-2 run in the fourth to win the title at home and avoid a Game 5 back in Phoenix on Tuesday.

“I told Stef ‘You’re going to be big for us in this next series so I need you to stay ready’ and she was ready” Wade said. “She gave us some good valuable minutes and she leaned on [Brittney Griner] a lot throughout the game so BG didn’t have the same legs in the fourth quarter as she did in the first three quarters.”

About a month ago the Sky might not have been as resilient as they were on Sunday.

Allie Quigley — who had a team-high 26 points Sunday on 5-for-10 shooting from 3 — said they reached a “breaking point” not long before the playoffs. Frustrated with their inconsistency after following up a seven-game losing streak with a seven-game winning streak early in the season and entering the playoffs as the No. 6 seed after going 16-16 they nearly buckled under the strain of it all. “We didn’t know who we were” Quigley explained.

At that point they took a hard look at themselves. They leaned on their leadership and made a conscious decision to grow stronger and closer from the adversity.

“Candace the first thing she said was she was going to play for me. It was just so inspiring that she wanted me to win a championship so bad and I just — it just made me want to play harder” Quigley said. “And everybody went around and said who they were playing for. In the end we all wanted to play for each other and that’s what you saw tonight in this whole playoff experience.”

What a memorable night in Chicago 🎬 pic.twitter.com/oavjJv5lRo — Just Women’s Sports (@justwsports) October 18 2021

Since that team meeting the Sky started playing their best basketball when it mattered most. They won two single-elimination games against Dallas and Minnesota. They took down the mighty Connecticut Sun in four games in the semifinals to earn a rematch with the Mercury who swept Chicago in the 2014 Finals for Diana Taurasi’s third championship and second Finals MVP award.

When reflecting on that series during Finals week Quigley said they were “babies” in terms of WNBA experience. Since then Quigley and Vandersloot not only fell in love off the court and got married but they also committed to stay with the Sky and bring a championship to Chicago.

“We did get a taste early what it felt like to be in the Finals and we got our asses kicked but we did get that taste” Vandersloot said while sitting next to Quigley Parker and Kahleah Copper named Finals MVP after overcoming career adversity of her own to put the league on notice this year.

“We knew if we got the right people — exhibit A and B — that we could be in this moment and it would be special here. We didn’t want to go seeking that. We didn’t want to go seeking this feeling. We wanted to do it here and we just knew that we had what it takes. We just needed a few more pieces and people to believe and that’s exactly what we got.”

The story of the Chicago Sky’s 2021 season? No you can’t write it much better than that.

NASSAU BAHAMAS — The education arm of the Organization for Responsible Governance (ORG) has partnered with talented Bahamian youth activists to shine a light on how deeply and culturally rooted gender-based violence (GBV) is in The Bahamas.

“No Slappin’ Up” a podcast organized by the first cohort of ORG’s Me You and Us Youth Saloon will bring a youthful perspective to addressing this long-standing issue when it debuts today on all the organization’s digital platforms.

Tiffany A Bain ORG’s education consultant and director of the saloon said: “It is incredibly important for youth to be involved in creating the measures and interventions to reduce incidences of GBV in the future.

“This impact isn’t just about the violence that we can see but the attitudes and beliefs which underly these behaviors.

“We’re truly impressed with the current group and their ability to grasp and understand the concepts thrown at them and even more so with their ideas to help mitigate these issues which includes a podcast that will air on all of ORG’s digital platforms beginning this Saturday at 10am.”

The podcast will touch on a variety of issues both directly and indirectly related to gender-based violence in society particularly in The Bahamas.

As part of the saloon’s endeavor to engage more young people in the conversation the cohort has also launched a poster competition for primary middle and high school students. Entrants must design a poster to help spread the message of protecting victims of gender-based violence or to bring awareness to the dangers of GBV in The Bahamas.

Entries can be submitted via email to youthagainstgbvbah@gmail.com by October 30 2021.

Matt Aubry ORG’s executive director said: “This program is preparing our youth for success by supporting their social and emotional growth. These skills are critical for leadership and effective communication.

“The engagement and development of well-rounded young persons in this country is essential to our sustainability.”

Philip Moss a cohort participant said he is excited about the podcast and has become “enlightened on just how far-reaching the effects of this form of violence are” on a global scale.

“As I conducted research to host our premiere podcast episode I realized how despite the detrimental immediate effects and fallouts of GBV it is dismissed because many factors leading to GBV are culturally normative in The Bahamas” Moss explained.

“I hope that as I continue working with this program I can help make young people more cognizant of these negative social norms and behaviors and how they contribute to GBV.”

For ReSade Burrows the program is essential as women are victims of GBV in Bahamian society too often.

“Culturally women are taught to be friendly and approachable partially because women are routinely subjected to assault for any perceived slight” said Burrows.

“I recognized that my male peers seem unaware that this is what girls are taught. In fact many deny these types of assaults happen.

“As a kid I had to learn to be hyperaware of myself and my surroundings whether I was alone or not. Girls are consistently taught to be aware of how they dress to smile when people are speaking to them — even unsolicited to learn self-defense to carry pepper spray and other weapons to always be on the defensive.

“It’s because of gender-based violence that we are taught that we are targets.”

Episodes of “No Slappin’ Up” will be released every Saturday through November on ORG’s website and Facebook and Instagram pages.

The deal struck between the two former rivals will see Blue Power becoming the co-packer or contracted manufacturer of Kirk-FP’s soap brands.

The two companies became rivals years ago when Kirk-FP acquired the soap brands after the shuttering of operations at Colgate Palmolive in Jamaica and Dominica. These brands include Bomber and Magic laundry soaps along with Refresh Castile and Carib Carbolic bath soaps among others.

Under the arrangement with Kirk-FP Blue Power will take over the domestic operation as well as the production that was outsourced to international companies in the Eurasia and Latin American regions. Blue Power says it will be working closely with Kirk-FP’s production and quality control team to ensure that the consistency of quality and product availability is maintained or enhanced.

General Manager of Blue Power Group Lisa Kong Lee expects the transition of the Kirk-FP operations to be seamless saying the additional production can be easily absorbed into the company’s current operations.

“We should be taking up one or two persons from Kirk; that’s the intention. There is no real need expand our shifts or change our production arrangements” Kong Lee said.

The value of the deal struck with Kirk-FP a privately held company was not disclosed. Kong Lee said only that the cost of acquisition of the machinery was “less than 10 per cent of company equity”. Blue Power is a listed company trading on the Jamaica Stock Exchange since 2010. Its last quarterly report for July 20121 estimated shareholder equity at $1.32 billion while the market value is currently above $1.8 billion.

The COVID-19 lockdowns pushed the college lecturer’s classes online. But her home on a dirt road minutes outside the village of Manchester 25 miles southeast of Ann Arbor remained stuck in an internet “dead zone” Deacons said.

At home a pricey cell service booster gave her one or two bars enough to text. After years chasing AT&T trucks to pester them about internet service the broadband technicians installed “works 50% of the time” chopping up Zoom calls into word salad she said.

So last year Deacons went to Panera Bread in Ann Arbor. They closed. She perched on benches and picnic tables outside libraries. And finally she ended up underneath the golden arches in Clinton just across the Washtenaw County line.

Twice a week for two hours Deacons slid the driver’s seat of her blue Ford Equinox back placed a laptop on the armrest and twisted to face her students aspiring teachers at Eastern Michigan University.

“I’m pretty easy going. I can roll with the punches but where it got really bad was last November” she said recalling how she would swaddle herself in blankets to keep from shivering through her courses.

Deacons wasn’t alone then and she isn’t now.

Spotty infrastructure leaves thousands without affordable high-speed internet access in Washtenaw County. They must adapt to a digitizing world accelerated by a global pandemic.

The Ann Arbor News/MLive spoke with five residents about the struggle to stay connected. Some are minutes from one of the top research universities in the country while others are in far-flung corners of the county marked by farmland and dirt roads.

Among them: A young family whose new home came with a nasty surprise. A retired online business owner who fears disconnections with doctors. And a condo resident who can’t afford the internet that’s available hindering access to food stamps and unemployment.

Their stories mirror those described in dozens of letters from residents urging officials to get serious about extending broadband across Washtenaw County a longtime goal boosted in recent years by federal and state grants.

Last month county leaders threw $15.5 million in federal COVID stimulus dollars at the problem supercharging an ambitious effort to fill a gap left by other funding sources and connect the remaining roughly 3300 homes extending speedy internet access countywide.

Deacons doesn’t expect rapid changes.

While she still takes meetings near the drive-thru line in the worst months of the pandemic Deacons found another option. A colleague took pity on her as temperatures dropped setting aside a room in their house as an office for the parking lot-bound instructor.

Many weren’t as fortunate. Here are just some of their stories.

When Noah Coward walked through the house that he and his wife Alexandria a nurse were considering buying he spied an encouraging sign.

The previous owner had a work-from-home set-up the 30-year-old construction manager noticed.

Coward who then lived in Howell was on the hunt for a bigger property closer to where he and his wife worked a place to raise their infant son Jason with their two dogs. The house on five acres in a rural area just six miles north of the Ann Arbor city limits was it.

It even had an Ann Arbor address.

Noah Coward Alexandria Coward and their 10-month-old son pose outside their home in Northfield Township on Thursday Oct. 7 2021. The Coward family purchased the home in spring 2021 only to find the previous homeowners' T-Mobile cell service internet contract wouldn't carry over once they moved in. Now they're on a months-long waitlist for cell-based internet service and while there's a fiber optic cable that terminates less than a mile away from their home Noah Coward says the couple is considering selling their new home and moving if they can't find an internet solution within a year.Jacob Hamilton | The Ann Arbor News

He joked with the previous homeowner about how unfortunate it would be if the young couple couldn’t get internet there but didn’t think much of it. The home’s occupants clearly had a connection.

But when Coward went to enroll in the cellular-based service they had used offered by T-Mobile it wasn’t there for him. Five months later the Cowards are still stuck on a waiting list. They’ve been told it’s “indefinite” with a limited number of homes served at one time.

He talked to his neighbors who had an unlimited data plan with AT&T. That option is no longer offered Coward learned.

Fiber optic lines end three fourths of a mile up the pothole-marked dirt road (Coward knows the spot). Satellite internet would run the family $100 to $120 a month capping their data at 30 gigabytes. “That’s not really feasible” he said.

“It was shocking to us when we found out and to be quite frank with you we would not have purchased this property if we knew that” Coward said.

He attended a town hall meeting about broadband access and reached to his county commissioner Sue Shink who lives nearby. Ironically he said she was having connection issues when they spoke.

Coward sees the money Shink and the rest of the county board put toward broadband access as a “light at the end of tunnel” but working in construction he knows that the pandemic has strained supply chains.

Moving out and leaving behind the tree-lined property with a horse corral out front is still on the table if the infrastructure doesn’t materialize Coward said.

The lack of broadband availability might even affect his property values according to research showing a 3% gap in prices between homes that have a decent connection and those that don’t.

Coward doesn’t want his 10-month-old child to grow up without adequate access. He wants to lay down roots in Northfield Township. But the broadband situation is forcing him to have second thoughts.

“Young couples such as myself would have no desire to move to this area if they knew there were issues” he said.

When broadband is available but still out of reach

When Carolina Barillas introduced herself to a new neighbor the response was immediate. “Oh you’re the lady without the internet” he said to her.

Barillas who serves on her condominium’s volunteer board in the small village of Manchester had been branded that way by the transition to Zoom during the pandemic.

She was laughed at she said. “It’s like saying oh you don’t have electricity.”

Barillas lost her job as a nanny during the lockdown and was rationing gas. Even with work now as a home health care aide there’s no room in her strict budget for the bills from Comcast or AT&T she said.

She’s lived in Manchester since 2003 and luckily now stays a five-minute walk from the library housed in what was once a factory owned by Henry Ford that produced gauges for the dashboards of cars and tractors.

Banks of public computers are a lifeline for people like her. But the library shuttered for several months last year and the Wi-Fi was spotty outside. “I was just cut off” Barillas said.

Barillas says she can't afford the inflated fee for broadband service in her Manchester Mich. home so she checks out a mobile hotspot from the library or takes advantage of their public computers and Wi-Fi connection which was more difficult to access when the library closed during the pandemic.Jacob Hamilton | The Ann Arbor News

That meant struggling to find a way to apply for unemployment and food stamps. She burned precious gas to submit a paper application in Ypsilanti and was denied she said. “It’s just roadblock after roadblock.”

According to a Washtenaw County report the trickle effects of living without reliable broadband are many from missing out on consumer savings to facing disadvantages in educational settings like the free college program Barillas applied to but wasn’t able to finish registering for.

Now Barillas is back in the library where she spends free time researching genealogy. She also checks out one of 10 hotspot devices the library has which are constantly in demand according to Library Director Kathleen Dimond.

“It’s always been really the bane of my existence trying to get something that’s relatively inexpensive” Barillas said.

County leaders have dedicated $800000 in federal COVID recovery dollars to people in her exact situation although it’s unclear exactly when that money will be available to the public.

Now the county is working to develop “a framework to responsibly spend” the sum to address internet access affordability and literacy issues Peter Lindeman the county board’s communications and operations manager said in a text message.

Lindeman points residents in need of emergency assistance to a COVID rent and utility assistance program.

Still in Manchester Barillas feels locked out by the companies offering her internet at prices she can’t afford.

“It should be like a regular utility” Barillas said “Their business model doesn’t help people of lower income.”

‘They think we’re living in the Dark Ages’

What does it mean to not have access to high-speed broadband? For many it’s repeated attempts to cajole for-profit internet providers to extend service while navigating a shifting array of options.

Megan Gore home-schooled her daughter virtually during the pandemic from their house in rural Manchester Township.

The family first used HughesNet a satellite internet service but it would go out when there were storms and the costs added up. Gore who teaches digital media and communications at EMU researched another service which didn’t quite cover their area.

“They said to us well you can pay to put up a tower at your house” she said. “We were thinking well wouldn’t you pay us to put up a tower so that you could continue on.”

Gore’s family now relies on three cell phones and hotspots with costs that can exceed $250 a month.

That’s a familiar story for Sally Wetzel.

Wetzel who is retired but runs a small art business online has lived in Sylvan Township four miles west of Chelsea for 25 years.

She went door-to-door to convince neighbors to pool resources to foot the bill for Comcast lines. “Some people have just sort of given up” she said. One neighbor who didn’t own a TV wasn’t interested.

In the end “none of us could afford it” she said.

Internet service providers are slow to expand their service into rural areas where return on the investment is low with fewer households served county officials have concluded. That’s spurred a push to find grants and other injections of money to get the work done led by the county’s Broadband Taskforce.

Still a solution for some 8000 homes and 20000 people targeted for connection could still be years away.

For a brief time last year Wetzel tried a T-Mobile cellular plan which was like “living in a whole new world” for two months until problems cropped up.

“When I called to say I’m having issues they’re like oh yeah we lost a cell tower” Wetzel said.

Access is worse at her house than on a far-flung island in the Upper Peninsula accessible only by boat and plane where her son has property with high-speed internet she said.

That means missing out on parts of daily life many take for granted.

Wetzel and her husband who has a pacemaker have been kicked off of telehealth calls with physicians. “It’s just a high-speed world and we’re not up to it.”

She has family near Chicago.

“They think we’re living in the Dark Ages” she said.

West Michigan's music scene

A few lucky Grand Rapids musicians had the special guest of a lifetime sitting in with them on a Saturday night in 2017.

Chad Smith drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers who played a sold-out concert at Van Andel Arena on June 25 2017 made the rounds the night before in downtown Grand Rapids surprising bands by playing Mojo’s Dueling Piano Bar & Restaurant then performing next door with Grand Rapids’ BareNaked 90’s at Flanagan’s Irish Pub and sitting in with Sebastian Bach during a show at 20 Monroe Live.

At Flanagan’s Smith — who grew up in Bloomfield Hills and is considered one of rock’s pre-eminent drummers — jumped behind a drum kit to play the BareNaked 90’s rendition of the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ “Under the Bridge” to the delight of band members and patrons who cheered and sang along.

“Totally unexpected and a ton of fun” band bassist Charlie Hoats told Local Spins. “Someone told us he was in the room so we pulled out ‘Under The Bridge’ which we had only rehearsed once previously and had not played before in public. He immediately walked up to the bandstand and our drummer (Mike Snider) made way for him. What a blast!”

The BareNaked 90’s cover band at the time featured Hoats Chris Psenicka (vocals) Kerry McDonough (guirtar vocals) Gerald Yott (guitar) and Mike Snider (drums).

“We were just as awe-stricken as the rest of the patrons to see a person of that caliber at a local pub” added Yott.

“He plays louder and harder than any drummer I have ever played with. To play with someone at that level and to be playing their song the entire thing was pretty surreal. … He was a very cool guy lending his talent to a local band working the West Michigan circuit.”

The gregarious Smith wearing a classic KISS world tour T-shirt also strolled a couple blocks down the street to 20 Monroe Live (now known as GLC Live at 20 Monroe) where ’90s rocker Sebastian Bach and his band were making a Grand Rapids tour stop.

Bach recalled times spent living in Michigan before performing Skid Row’s power ballad “18 and Life”. Bach recounted more stories of his time spent in Michigan throughout the set.

Bach paid homage to some fallen musicians most notably Soundgarden’s Chris Cornell (who passed away after a show in Detroit) and Greg Allman culminating in the band playing another Skid Row classic “Monkey Business” wherein they segued into the Allman Brothers’ “Whipping Post” which saw Smith come out to a raucous roar as he jammed along with the band to finish the song. (See video below.)

A few lucky fans were able to get some photos with the drummer before he headed out into the crisp summer night.

Smith and the rest of his band — featuring Grand Rapids native and band frontman Anthony Kiedis — performing the next night at Van Andel Arena supporting the band’s album “The Getaway.” Check out a review and photo gallery from Sunday night’s show here: Red Hot Chili Peppers show hometown love at Grand Rapids show.

Your grandparents ate it your grandchildren will too -- but coming down from a pandemic surge in sales Campbell Soup (CPB 1.55%) has gotten a little too cold for investors. Campbell founded in 1869 is a victim of an unprecedented pandemic cycle. But if investors stay patient they might still have the chance to scoop up some delicious returns.

Stocked pantries

Consumers loaded their cupboards with soup during amid lockdowns and now that more of them are vaccinated they're buying fewer Campbell products. The company recently reported an 11% decline in sales for the fourth quarter and projected essentially no growth for its fiscal 2022 performance. Investors didn't like this news and they seem to viewing the can as only half full.

But despite this sharp pullback in sales consumers are still buying more of Campbell's brands than they did before the pandemic hit.

Campbell's fourth-quarter net sales are up 5% over the same period in 2019 before the pandemic hit even though they are down from the fourth quarter of 2020.

The good news is that the crisis put Campbell into more households expanding its consumer base for the future. On a fourth-quarter earnings call Campbell's CEO Mark Clouse said ""ready to serve end market consumption"" grew 21% between the 2019 and 2021 fourth quarters. It was led by Chunky Slow Kettle and Well Yes! soups and he plans to retain these customers.

Nevertheless the stock hit a 52-week-low of $40.05 on Aug. 27 just before the company released results for its fourth quarter which ended Aug. 1. The stock is now trading around $41 well below its 52-week high of $53.77 in January.

Dominating store shelves

Campbell makes the soup that made Andy Warhol famous so it's easy to forget that it's not just about the soup. If you've ever said ""Uh-oh Spaghettio's"" you're talking Campbell. Its products include mainstays such as V8 juices Pepperidge Farms snacks Pace picante sauces Prego pasta sauces and Archway cookies to name a few. In 2018 Campbell acquired one of the world's largest makers of salty snacks Snyder's-Lance.

Campbell has plenty of competition but it has fended off other food companies in its categories for more than 150 years. It's difficult to walk through a grocery store and not encounter one of it's products. It is considered a wide-moat stock because grocers are reluctant to give its shelve space to lesser-known brands.

Looming constraints

The companies that will succeed the most in the quarters to come are the ones that can best overcome pandemic bottlenecks and rising inflation. Already supply disruptions labor woes and commodity shortages have pushed inflation above 5% and there's likely more to come.

These same risks apply to Campbell but the company boasts a stalwart logistics chain able to withstand these issues better than many other companies that haven't been around since the 1800s.

The company touts plans to raise prices and enhance supply chain productivity. It also expects its multiyear cost-savings program to deliver $850 million in savings by the end of its 2022 fiscal year -- including synergies achieved from its Snyder's-Lance acquisition.

With nearly $8.5 billion in annual sales this is a significant savings demonstrating that Campbell benefits from huge economies of scale to help meet the challenges ahead.

Soup on sale

Campbell is trading at a 12-month trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 12.5 which is lower than some of its food-making peers. Post Holdings (POST 1.08%) trades for over 37. J.M. Smucker (SJM 1.70%) trades for over 17. ConAgra Brands (CAG 1.14%) trades for 13.6.

Buying the bad news

Campbell isn't performing badly -- there just isn't as much fear-based consumer consumption as there was last year to spike its sales. Additionally its guidance for the challenging quarters ahead may not be as dire as investors currently perceive.

The company has transparently acknowledged its difficulties and laid out plausible strategies to deal with them. Meanwhile it's paying a roughly 3.5% dividend yield.

The stock now trading slightly above its low could prove a solid bet for investors patient enough to weather the rest of the pandemic cycle.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Qatar Vaccination Centre for Business and Industry permanently closed its doors after providing more than 1.6 million Covid-19 vaccines to residents in the Gulf state.

Qatar’s health ministry confirmed the centre has administered more than 1.6 million doses of vaccines since it opened in June.

“This centre played a pivotal role in supporting the safe roll-out of Qatars phased plan to lift Covid-19 restrictions by ensuring that service workers had access to the vaccine and were protected” said the lead of the Covid-19 centre Dr Khalid Abdulnoor.

“We are proud to have been able to vaccinate so many key industry workers during this period and to help the community get back to normal” he added.

The centre was a product of a collaboration between the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) and Qatar Charity (QC).

The project supported by the Ministry of Interior and ConocoPhillips-Qatar was dedicated to vaccinating business and industry workers as a part of the country’s phased plan to lift Covid-19 restrictions.

The centre covered more than 300000 square meters making it one of the largest vaccination centres in the world. This allowed it to roll out up to 25000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines each day.

Back to normal

Last week authorities confirmed 27 out of 28 PHCC’s centres have returned to full operation and delivery of healthcare services in addition to face-to-face consultations if requested.

This is “with the exception of the Rawdat Al Khail Health Centre which will remain as a Covid-19 dedicated health center” said Dr Samya Abdulla Executive Director of Operations.

Qatar’s active Covid-19 cases have also dipped below 1000 for the first time since April 2020 according to recent statistics from the MoPH.

In the last 24 hours 66 people recovered from the virus bringing the total number of active cases down to 918. Since the start of the pandemic there have been 236341 total recoveries numbers have shown.

So far 4787360 total vaccine doses have been administered since the National Vaccination Program kicked off in December. As it stands 83.1% of Qatar’s total population have been protected against the novel coronavirus.",,,,,,,,,,,,

For starters the iPhone 13 mini has a smaller screen notch - one of the most important changes Apple has delivered this year. It's not a groundbreaking reduction but it is the first step towards its retirement.

The other notable change is on the back - the dual-camera now uses diagonal alignment as opposed to the vertical one on the iPhone 12 mini. This new arrangement is probably a result of the primary camera improvements - a larger sensor with new sensor-shift stabilization.

Finally the larger battery and the new hardware are responsible for 6 extra grams and 0.4mm extra thickness over the iPhone 12 mini. That's insignificant obviously but old protection cases may not fit properly on the new iPhone 13 mini. That of course is all but surprising.

The Pros are in the middle

The Apple iPhone 13 mini is obviously an incredibly small and lightweight smartphone - it's 131mm tall 64mm wide and weighs 141 grams. Yet it is also one of the most durable devices on the market thanks to its Ceramic Shield front aluminum frame Corning-made rear panel and sapphire crystal lens covers. Apple likes to come up with fancy names but various drop tests have already proven this new design indeed lives up to the hype.

On top of this extra durable design the iPhone 13 mini is also IP68-rated for dust and water resistance. Apple went above and beyond the official IP requirements and secured the iPhone 13 mini against water - it can go swim in 6m deep water for 30 minutes and survive this adventure.

The 5.4"" Super Retina XDR screen occupies most of the front and it packs an incredibly sharp OLED panel with high brightness HDR10 and Dolby Vision support. The bezels are as thin as on the iPhone 12 mini but the notch is now narrower - that's the first size reduction since the iPhone X. The cutout still contains the Face ID sensors the 12MP selfie camera and one of the stereo speakers that also acts as an earpiece.

The screen is protected by a flat piece of Ceramic Shield glass made in collaboration with Corning. The back panel is also flat and covered by a Corning-made glass though not a Ceramic Shield (probably a version of Gorilla Glass Victus). Both glass sheets are covered with extra oleophobic layers which make smudges not that sticky and easier to clean.

Speaking about the back you can easily notice the new camera arrangement. The back glass is all glossy while the camera square is matte. The Pro models have it the other way around.

The whole camera setup is jutting out of the back and then the two camera rings are jutting out once more. This makes the mini wobble a lot but that's unavoidable for now.

The lenses are protected by sapphire crystal glass which is dense and durable and that's why they can easily scratch other surfaces like regular glass. Yes we are warning you again not to stack the iPhone 13 mini over other phones.

The iPhone 13 mini uses an aluminum frame with brushed paint and it's nicely grippy. Fingerprints do stick but they aren't as visible.

There is nothing on the top of the iPhone 13 mini.

The bottom has the mouthpiece grille the Lightning port and the other stereo speaker behind another dotted grille.

The volume keys the silencer and the SIM tray are all on the left.

The Side key is alone on the right side of the iPhone 13 mini. It powers on the iPhone locks it; you can use it to summon Siri or Apple Pay. It doesn't shut down the phone though; if you want to see the power menu - you hold Volume Up and Side key.

Handling the iPhone 13 mini has to be one of the most well memorable experiences we've had since the iPhone 12 mini. It's such a compact phone with an amazing display and excellent grip. One-handed operations are a breeze the iPhone sits well in hand and we rarely use the other hand for help. Overall this is the phone you get for the best experience on such a compact display.

The iPhone 13 mini is easily the king of compact phones - it is of striking lightweight design premium durability and extra grippy. If you ever go near a physical smartphone store you can easily experience that. If you do not like small phones the iPhone 13 mini is surely not for you. But if you do - you will love every minute of it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2NhbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9ub2tpYS14cjIwLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1pbi1pbmRpYS1uZXh0LXdlZWstMTA0MTIyMy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nokia XR20 to launch in India next week,It boasts a side-mounted fingerprint sensor and two dedicated physical buttons-- one to trigger the Google Assistant and the second which is placed on top users can assign custom functions or shortcuts to a frequently used app. Also it has hybrid dual-SIM slots ( nano SIM-1 + nano SIM-2 or microSD card).

As with most things in life it's hard to say goodbye to something great. Luckily after months and months the wait is finally over in the Costco food court.

From condiments to churros members have noticed the disappearance of certain menu items when the pandemic hit. But now some are back and better than ever. Check out these four yummy items that have made their way back to the warehouse chain's food court.

Relish

After months of not being available in stores the condiment has finally made its way back to Costco's food courts. Housed in a stainless steel station alongside ketchup and mustard sections the relish has been largely unavailable due to pandemic safety but is now out and ready for public use.

In a Reddit thread discussing the condiment's arrival the moderator @CookieButterLovers noted that ""Ketchup and mustard … were either provided in plastic sample cups or individual packets at some warehouses"" during the early days of the pandemic. User @thevictors51 jokingly encouraged others to ""Relish that Relish has Returned.""

Onion Crank

The long-awaited onion crank has made its triumphant return to the warehouse and it's arguably a more anticipated return than the relish. Easily a fan favorite nothing beats turning the handle to dispense freshly-cranked onions that grace the top of hot dogs.

Reddit users didn't hold back when it came to expressing how much they missed the popular onion crank. User @-snicks- even found an old Costco onion crank for sale at a vintage store and commented that ""It's been so long since there were onions I guess they're vintage now.""

Churro

Crunchy on the outside soft on the inside churros are a sweet delight that most of us can't refuse. Often paired with chocolate dipping sauce this widely embraced staple treat has made its way back to Costco's food court with a new recipe. Earlier this year the warehouse brand took to Facebook to announced the size upgrade of the churros stating that they are now ""20% larger.""6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

The response hasn't been all good but if this item is back maybe some beloved others will return soon too (looking at you combo pizza).

Tables

Just as great as assembling the iconic Costco food court hot dog are tables to sit and enjoy it! Some stores officially have the picnic tables back so that members can sit indoors and enjoy all the food court has to offer.

The pandemic limited indoor seating and some stores excluded them entirely but more and more shoppers can expect to have a seat and eat instead of taking their food to the car.

It's not uncommon for cheeses to have a cult-like following and Kerrygold's Dubliner cheese definitely has its set of fans. As described by the makers themselves the creation is a pale yellow cow's milk cheese made for crackers featuring flavors that are described as ""sweet and nutty with a piquant bite of aged Parmesan"" (per the official website). This Irish import is definitely unique and by most accounts really delicious. Says one fan ""This cheese will ruin you from other cheddars. Anything else will taste bland or bad. If they ever quit selling it I'd be screwed"" (via Reddit).

It's just another reason we can love Costco since this cheese like others in the deli section is sold in bulk. Dubliner specifically is listed as selling in two-pound blocks (via Costco Business). Many Redditors mention that in addition to the bulk sales option they have found coupons available for $3.50 off as well at Costco.

You know how one big problem is usually the result of several smaller problems?

Well that certainly is the case regarding drivers' ongoing frustration with heavy congestion at the Harmony Road and Interstate 25 interchange and backups going well beyond east and west mostly during the morning and evening commute.

There was much venting on social media last weekend when increased traffic due to Colorado State University's homecoming Kechter Road being closed and a crash combined to snarl the road beyond its boiling point.

Let's take a look at how we got to this point and what is being done to allow an interchange that sees 55000 vehicles a day to finally function efficiently.

Wait didn't they just work to fix this interchange?

Correct.

In May the Colorado Department of Transportation added a third northbound off-ramp left-turn lane from I-25 onto Harmony Road to alleviate vehicles on the off-ramp backing up onto I-25 and creating a dangerous situation. There remains a single right-hand turn lane at Harmony Road from the off-ramp.

A westbound lane was added on Harmony Road and the turning lane for those driving westbound on Harmony Road and turning south to the on-ramp of I-25 was extended to reduce backups.

Also new traffic lights were synced to match the new traffic flow.

The two-week northbound off-ramp lane work was a temporary fix to quickly alleviate vehicles from backing up on I-25. Crews then worked on shoring up other areas of need around the interchange.

The fix helped and for the most part traffic ran pretty smoothly until Oct. 1.

OK so why is it still so congested?

One big reason is the Oct. 1 closing of Kechter Road forcing its 11000 daily vehicles to either go north to Harmony Road or south to Colorado Highway 392.

That adds to an area already congested with large volumes of commuters and shoppers at Costco Walmart and other businesses on the east side of the interchange as well as the number of schools in the area.

""Kechter closed Oct. 1 and that was the first day we had significant issues'' said Eric Fuhrman town of Timnath engineering consultant. ""(Timnath and the city of Fort Collins) were both very concerned about Kechter closing and the impact it would have on Harmony. There already was a heavy traffic load at certain times of the day on Harmony.''

The renovation of the Kechter Road bridge (Buchanan Liberty bridge) was not part of the original North I-25 Express Lanes project which began in 2018. Its renovation and the renovation of the U.S. Highway 34 and I-25 interchange were added in 2019 when an additional $300 million in funding was awarded to the project by the Colorado Transportation Commission.

Last year during planning for Kechter Road the new northbound I-25 lanes were set to be moved east of their current location which in turn meant the frontage road between Kechter Road and Swetsville Zoo Road on the south side of Costco had to be torn up.

That in turn forced more traffic onto Harmony Road as Harmony became the only access road to Costco.

The town of Timnath is hoping to extend Weitzel Street on the east side of Costco to Larimer County 5 by 2022 to provide another access road to the area.

Timnath's plans: Costco corner in Timnath to see more development

As part of the North I-25 Express Lanes project the old Kechter Road bridge was recently torn down and will be widened to accommodate the additional toll lane in each direction on I-25. The new bridge will include one lane of vehicle traffic in each direction pedestrian and bike lanes and heightened barriers across the bridge. A roundabout will be constructed at the intersection of Kechter Road and I-25 southwest frontage road.

Kechter Road is expected to reopen in early May.

Another reason for the congestion is the traffic lights haven't been properly synced to handle the new increase in traffic flow from Kechter Road being closed.

It's not just the traffic lights at the on- and off-ramps that need syncing. Traffic lights heading west on Harmony Road which are the city of Fort Collins' responsibility and the traffic lights heading east on Harmony Road which are the town of Timnath's responsibility have to be synced for miles.

What is being done to finally get traffic moving more efficiently?

The Colorado Department of Transportation city of Fort Collins and town of Timnath are working on solutions to sync the traffic lights since all three have a hand in traffic flow in the area.

Nicole Hahn city of Fort Collins assistant city traffic engineer said those three worked in partnership to sync the lights in May and the three are working together again to help the flow of traffic.

""We know that area has been impactful'' Hahn said. ""We have made some changes on our side and Timnath on their side but we need to get the whole system working more efficiently.''

Fuhrman said syncing traffic lights in that area when there is free-flowing traffic going 45 mph is doable because you can move traffic through at a high enough rate to alleviate backups.

The problem is when you add in trying to sync I-25 interchange lights with high traffic intersections like Weitzel Street and Harmony Road just east of I-25 it's difficult to move enough vehicles through the light cycles and the flow of traffic stops.

""It's a cascading effect and once you get to the saturation point you can't get enough vehicles through and that's when backups occur'' Fuhrman said. ""It's a balancing act. If you add time to the I-25 off-ramp-onto-Harmony light then it makes it tougher to get out of Walmart.''

Fuhrman said it's up to CDOT to sync its traffic signals at the interchange so traffic flow can improve.

Jared Fiel CDOT spokesperson for the North Region said syncing traffic lights is a necessity but added it has a larger issue.

The closing of Kechter Road negated the gains made when CDOT expanded the Harmony Road and I-25 interchange with its temporary fix in May. The problem of vehicles being backed up trying to get on the northbound I-25 off-ramp had been fixed but that dangerous situation resurfaced when Kechter closed.

He said CDOT is expanding the northbound off-ramp to its permanent configuration that will once again alleviate back-ups onto I-25. However that work won't be completed until around the beginning of December.

""The bigger problem for us is the traffic backing up onto I-25 once again which is a safety concern'' Fiel said.

As for the increased traffic from the Kechter Road closure well unfortunately you are going to have wait until May to see that problem fixed.

Fiel said the agency knew closing Kechter would have a ripple effect but said the agency is hoping drivers will find alternate routes until Kechter Road reopens in spring.

""The perfect solution may not be there but we are trying to figure out how to make this the best it can be for right now'' Fiel said. ""But until May we are stuck with this.''

Bulk goods warehouses like Sam's Club and Costco attract millions of American shoppers each year. Although these types of stores require a membership for checkout (along with all sorts of other rules) their deals and special perks might just make those member fees worth it.

Similarly to IKEA and its iconic meatballs found in their food court Sam's Club too offers a café for hungry shoppers. We've all heard it's not good to shop on an empty stomach (and yet we've done it anyway) but you don't have to do so if you're shopping at Sam's Club. Business Insider notes that while Costco's food court receives more national attention (most recently for the drama surrounding its removal of the Polish hot dog from the menu) both warehouse stores have great snack options.

Even those of us that don't shop at Sam's Club have heard about the soft pretzels cheeseburgers and chicken bites available at its food court. In addition to these more filling snacks Sam's Club also has ice cream sundaes — and a new one is here that you'll probably want to try."

""Spent a year going from black to blonde because #crisis (we’ve all been there).

""Then followed this up with a few months of solid neglect and in turn ended up with a short bronzed limp semi mullet. I only have myself to blame"" she added.

The tennis WAG joked that her current 'do wasn't suitable for 'upcoming work commitments' which prompted her to undergo a mini hair makeover.

She thanked the staff at Elite Hair Extensions for making her 'feel human again' by giving her a 'luscious mane' courtesy of several inches of real human hair extensions.

Britt's post-Bachie love

Emergency radiographer Britt rose to fame on Nick 'Honey Badger' Cummins's season of The Bachelor in 2018 where she made it to the final two alongside Sophie Tieman. Sadly both women were left single at the end when the former footballer refused to commit to either.

Britt later coupled up with fellow Bachie star Timm Hanley after appearing on Bachelor In Paradise but they parted ways soon after.

She went public with her romance with tennis player Jordan Thompson in February this year with the pair travelling to the UK for Wimbledon mid-pandemic.

Speaking with Yahoo Lifestyle in August Britt joked that she knew Jordan 27 was the right guy for her ""because he was the first person that I dated in years that I didn't turn around and run from"".

""As cliche as it sounds it just felt right. My mum always said 'You'll just know. There is no explaining it' and she was right. It's just a feeling. It was so easy and effortless. We felt like we had known each other for years and gosh all we do is laugh!""

Phil Parkinson's Wrexham have won only one of their last four games in all competitions

Wrexham goalkeeper Rob Lainton was knocked out and suffered a broken nose during the FA Cup fourth-qualifying round draw at Marine.

Lainton 32 was replaced after only 13 minutes after a challenge from Niall Cummins which saw the Marine player booked.

Wrexham boss Phil Parkinson felt Cummins should have been sent off by referee Gareth Rhodes.

""The lad's just booted him straight in the face"" Parkinson said.

""The ref needs to be stronger there. I haven't seen the challenge [again] yet but with my own eyes I wasn't happy with the lad going for the ball.

""Rob's ended up unconscious on the pitch and a broken nose. I am going to look closely at that challenge because they are the type of moments in football that need to be deal with stronger than a yellow card.

""When it's a dangerous incident that's got the chance to severely injure one of our players questions have got to be asked.""

Lainton was not taken to hospital but is doubtful for Tuesday's replay against Marine.

""There's a protocol we have now got to follow because he was knocked clean out"" Parkinson added. ""We'll assess him over the next 24 hours.""

Lainton was knocked out during Wrexham's draw at Bromley in November 2020 when both sides left the pitch while he received extensive treatment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vYmFyYmFkb3N0b2RheS5iYi8yMDIxLzEwLzE3L2tsbS1pbmF1Z3VyYWwtZmxpZ2h0LWxhbmRzLXRvLW11Y2gtZmFuZmFyZS9hbXAv0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly9iYXJiYWRvc3RvZGF5LmJiLzIwMjEvMTAvMTcva2xtLWluYXVndXJhbC1mbGlnaHQtbGFuZHMtdG8tbXVjaC1mYW5mYXJlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KLM inaugural flight lands to much fanfare,"The inaugural KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight out of Amsterdam arrived in Barbados on Saturday evening to a welcoming party that included a water salute from the Barbados Fire Service and music played by the Barbados Defence Force Zouave Band.

Minister of Tourism and International Transport Senator Lisa Cummins along with Barbados Tourism Marketing Inc.’s (BTMI) Interim Head of Global Markets Cheryl Carter; Deputy Ambassador Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands Cor Stouten and Honorary Consul of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Barbados Anthony Gittens welcomed the flight crew and passengers to the island.

Minister Cummins presented gift packages with local products to Stouten Gittens and flight crew and passengers were treated to local products from Banks Holding including Banks Beer and Limited Edition pink packaging Plus Power Up beverage.

Pilot Captain Geert-Jan van Teeffelen along with 11 flight crew members and over 180 passengers including BTMI’s Director for Europe Anita Nightingale arrived on the flight.

Nightingale speaking on what it means for this new partnership with KLM stated: “The objective of the European division is to rebuild the market by getting partnerships with well-known trusted airlines with wide networks. We secured Lufthansa in 2019 for the winter and this year KLM.

“KLM is special because it was the very first airline that arrived in Barbados back in 1938. The Dutch are equally excited about returning to the island as shown by the 180 plus arrivals today.”

The KLM Royal Dutch Airlines was the first commercial airline to arrive at Seawell Airport in Barbados on October 19 1938.

As one of the longest-running airlines in the world and operating under its original name for 100 years KLM is the largest long-haul carrier from Europe serving 318 destinations in 118 countries with 80 codeshare partners.

KLM Flights will operate non-stop from Amsterdam to Barbados three days a week – Monday Thursday and Saturday. The service will run until March 31 2022.

Before the flight arrived Minister Cummins and BTMI and KLM personnel stationed here did rapid antigen testing for COVID-19."

Many stores are sold out,"Your nose is stuffy. Your throat is scratchy. And you feel like you could be coming down with something.

If this were 2019 you might have shrugged it off as fall allergies or a simple cold taken some over-the-counter decongestants and carried on. If you felt really lousy you might have gone to the doctor for a flu test.

But in 2021 those symptoms could also mean you have COVID-19. The only way to know for sure is to get tested.

At-home rapid tests are in short supply at locally owned independent drugstores pharmacy chains and big-box stores across metro Detroit right now where retailers say they can't keep them on shelves.

""We try to keep them in stock"" said Sami Shimoon pharmacist and owner of Collie Drugs in St. Clair Shores. ""It's difficult to get them. The big-box stores are buying all the supply and our warehouse when they do get them they don't get a lot.""

On Friday his store had a few of the BinaxNOW rapid antigen tests behind the pharmacy counter.

Most of the nearly two dozen pharmacies the Free Press surveyed from Ann Arbor to Chesterfield Township Detroit to Downriver didn't have any at-home rapid antigen coronavirus tests in stock.

Large retailers like Walmart Target and Meijer had none Friday at stores in Belleville Clinton Township Taylor and Roseville.

Neither did Frank's Drugs in downtown Ypsilanti nor Merriman Drugs in Livonia. There were empty shelves at a CVS in Chesterfield Township and a Rite Aid in Mount Clemens too.

""They are very hard to get"" said Vivienne Miller a pharmacy tech at Ann Arbor Pharmacy which is tucked into a busy shopping plaza on East Stadium Boulevard. ""We tried to stock them and we could only get two of them. That was it. ... We have tried everywhere.""

The moment the store's lone pair of tests arrived several weeks ago they were sold she said.

""Our supplier said they could get some later this month"" Miller said. ""They said October but it's October now.""

A few stores like the Collie Drugs and the Kroger pharmacy on Mack in Grosse Pointe Woods had a couple of boxes.

Others like the Rite Aid store on East Jefferson in Detroit had a glut of tests on Friday — 28 boxes. The CVS on Cherry Hill in Canton had 17 BinaxNow tests on a shelf Friday afternoon retailing for $23.99 each. A yellow sign beside them said sales would be limited to four per person ""to support as many customers as possible.""

The supply pinch is driven by a few factors retailers said.

High demand is among them.

In Michigan coronavirus case rates have continued to edge upward in the last three months. As more people test positive for the virus those who were exposed are more likely to also seek out testing. So are people with symptoms from allergies colds and the flu all of which tend to ramp up this time of year.

Students have returned to college campuses many of which require weekly testing for those who haven't been fully vaccinated. There's more demand for tests among workers too whose employers may require them.

The supply was further tightened by a recent recall of the Ellume COVID-19 Home Test. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration reported Oct. 5 that a manufacturing issue led users of the Ellume test to get false positive results.

And if President Joe Biden's sweeping COVID-19 vaccine mandates take effect soon — requiring all workers at businesses with 100 or more employees to take coronvirus vaccines or undergo weekly testing — it could further strain the already tight market for tests.

Feds say help is on the way

More over-the-counter rapid tests are coming said Jeff Zients White House coronavirus response coordinator though it might not be for several more weeks.

The FDA approved a new at-home test earlier this month that could boost supply. It's called the Flowflex COVID-19 Home Test made by ACON Laboratories.

In addition Zients said the federal government has invested billions in purchase commitments so companies that make rapid coronavirus tests can increase production. The aim is to quadruple the supply of at-home rapid tests he said.

""That means we’ll have available supply of 200 million rapid at-home tests per month starting in December with supply of tens of millions of additional tests coming on the market across the next few weeks"" Zients said during a news conference earlier this month.

Walgreens spokesperson Megan Boyd said ""overall we are able to meet demand"" for rapid tests in the pharmacy chain's stores but added that there are ""intermittent delays in supply in some locations and (we) are working with ... our testing partners to meet patient demand.""

At the Walgreens store in Riverview on Wednesday there were empty shelves where rapid coronavirus tests used to be. There were no tests Friday at the store near Detroit's Harbortown Shopping Center on East Jefferson either.

But dozens of BinaxNOW tests were available Friday at the Walgreens on Harper in St. Clair Shores.

For Walgreens customers who are able to find them in stock ""the incredible demand for at-home testing"" Boyd said has led the company to limit the sales of rapid at-home tests to four per customer ""in an effort to help improve inventory while we continue to work diligently with our supplier partners.""

CVS also is limiting sales of rapid antigen tests at its stores telling the Free Press in a statement: ""In order to serve our customers’ over-the-counter testing needs and due to high demand we’ve introduced product limits of (6) on cvs.com and (4) at CVS Pharmacy for the Abbott BinaxNOW and Quidel tests. We’re continuing to work with our suppliers to meet customer demand.

""In addition nearly 5000 CVS Pharmacy stores across the country offer on-site testing with same day and future day appointments in most geographies. Patients can make an appointment at a test site nearest them at CVS.com or the CVS Pharmacy app.""

Is a twindemic looming?

The home-testing supply crunch comes at a pivotal time: As the economy rebounds from pandemic malaise the nation could be on the brink of what health officials say could be a harsh flu season.

""Last year there were very few flu cases largely because of masking and physical distancing and other prevention measures put in place for the COVID-19 pandemic"" said Dr. Rochelle Walensky director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during a news conference earlier this month.

""With modest flu virus activity since March of 2020 CDC’s flu experts are concerned that reduced population-level immunity to the seasonal flu could place us at risk for a potentially severe flu season this year.

""The symptoms of flu can often be similar to those ... with COVID-19 which can lead to additional needs for flu and COVID testing and isolation for either of the diseases especially in schools.""

Though very little flu activity has been detected in Michigan so far this fall health leaders are concerned about whether the nation's health care system could manage a double-whammy of flu coupled with another COVID surge in the months ahead.

Hospitals already are facing a staffing shortage taxed by COVID-19 patients along with people who put off treatment of chronic illnesses during the pandemic and are showing up in emergency departments more acutely ill.

""An increase in flu infections and flu severity could put an additional burden on our health care system and increased stress on our nation's health care workers"" Walensky said urging people to get flu vaccines along with coronavirus vaccines to reduce the risk of a so-called twindemic.

Marisa Eisenberg an associate professor in the University of Michigan's departments of epidemiology and complex systems predicts the state is in for a doozy of a flu season.

That's because people are returning to pre-pandemic levels of activity. Many have shed their masks and other mitigation measures ""and so they feel more comfortable going out and doing stuff"" she said.

More:Is it COVID-19 allergies the flu or just a cold? How you can tell based on symptoms

""But unfortunately that means that flu can spread a lot more than it could when we were all sort of staying at home and really social distancing. So I do think that we may see the winter wave. The winter seasonality for flu might be coupled with a winter wave of COVID. We are on an increase now and that could easily kind of merge into a holiday season wave.

""I think we're going to get hit with flu.""

That too is likely to push up demand for coronavirus tests as people try to figure out which virus is causing their symptoms.

Seeking other testing options

When people can't find rapid tests on store shelves they're often driven to seek them out at urgent care centers and other testing sites to fill the gap.

That can be a more costly option — especially for people without health insurance.

At Beaumont Health's 28 metro Detroit urgent care centers people without insurance coverage will pay $155 for a visit — which includes not only a coronavirus test but a full checkup said spokesperson Scott Hughes.

He estimated about 60% of the patients treated at Beaumont's urgent care centers are coming for coronavirus tests and can get results from a molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within hours.

More:Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate could have a major impact on Michigan workplaces

Even for people who are fully insured there may now be some cost for coronavirus testing. The federal government requires insurance companies to fully cover testing for people who've been exposed to the virus and for those who are experiencing symptoms. But the insurers are not required to pay fully for routine testing for workplace or school protocols.

""Some insurance companies have pulled back and said 'Well we're gonna have to pass some of these costs on you know?' Whether it's a copay or whether it's 50% it varies by health insurer"" Hughes said.

That's why Hughes recommends calling ahead to your insurance provider so you're aware of what it'll cost to have a coronavirus test at an urgent care center.

Another option is to seek out a free rapid antigen test available at pop-up sites operated by the state health department. Some upcoming clinics are planned at schools restaurants and community health centers stretching from as far north as Suttons Bay to as far west as Three Rivers. Michiganders can go to michigan.gov/coronavirus to find a site or call the state's COVID-19 hotline at 888-535-6136.

The federal government also is working to increase access to free COVID-19 tests by expanding the number of sites where that service is available Zients said including at local pharmacies. There are now several hundred locations in Michigan. You can find one nearby online at https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov.

Even with more testing at pop-up clinics and drug stores the demand for at-home antigen tests hasn't slowed said Linda Herbert a pharmacy tech at Merriman Drugs in Livonia.

""Everybody's coming here but we don't have them"" she said. ""We're not able to order them from our wholesaler. They just say no.""

As for when — or if — rapid tests might be available to stock her store shelves she said is unclear: ""They don't tell us anything.""

Top corporate executive Helena Foulkes has now entered the Democratic primary for governor in Rhode Island.

Shortly after she launched her campaign with a well-polished video and sent a “letter to friends” Foulkes Tweeted that she was for “equality for all.”

But her track record as President of Retail at CVS and then as CEO of Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) shows that there was very little equality for all when it came to compensation.

Foulkes' tenure at HBC was short -- just two years and she earned more than $29 million annually. In contrast frontline workers at the retailer made approximately $30000 dollars.

Now as a candidate Foulkes will likely need to explain how her corporate compensation matches the Democratic party's ideals.

In 2020 at 45 major U.S. companies the CEO took home 1000 times or more what a median worker earned in 2019 and 2020 according to the AFL-CIO. The annual report on the discrepancy shows the growing gap between corporate compensation and what workers make.

Leading Senate Democrats in Congress are pushing the ""Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act"" which would penalize companies that pay their CEOs or other highest-paid employees 50 times more than the median pay for workers.

For Foulkes she would have faced a lot of taxes. For most of the last decade she consistently earned 100 times -- and upward -- the salaries of the workers she oversaw.

That legislation is sponsored by Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT) Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) Ed Markey (D-MA) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD).

Foulkes' compensation at Canadian retailer HBC came under fire from shareholders including public employees' pension systems.

At her first corporate annual meeting about one-quarter of votes cast by HBC shareholders opposed the company’s multi-million dollar payouts to top executives for the second year in a row at an unusually secretive annual general meeting reported the Toronto Star.

""Nearly 26.5 percent of votes cast were against the retailer’s approach to executive compensation according to company documents. That amounts to about 47.9 million negative votes.'We are concerned that the board has again chosen to make awards to executives that are outside the compensation plan' wrote the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan which holds a 10 percent stake in HBC in its rationale for voting against the proposal.""

“We do not feel that the awards have been sufficiently justified” said the fund in a statement.

According to the Star ""The company’s highest paid executive CEO Helena Foulkes received a pay package of a little over $29.4 million for the 2018 financial year — her first with the company. Foulkes who joined HBC in Feb. 2018 received a package that includes a roughly $1.6-million base salary and about $19.6 million in share-based awards and a roughly $3 million sign-on bonus. It also included a pension a roughly $2.7-million guaranteed annual bonus a housing and relocation allowance and other compensation.

Kai Li a professor at the University of British Columbia’s Sauder School of Business told the Star that the structure of Foulkes'compnesation package is called the ""golden handshake.

“They’re just throwing extra goodies to draw her here” the professor said calling it a bad business policy.

While Foulkes was a major earner at CVS in her final years before going to Hudson -- it was significantly less.

According to the website ExecPay.com ""Foulkes received an average of $5M in total compensation including $919K in salary at CVS Health from 2014 to 2017.""

In her announcement video Foulkes said she oversaw 200000 retail employees. The majority of those employees made less than $15 dollars an hour and many made minimum wage -- less than $10 an hour. Thus tens of thousands of the workers Foulkes oversaw made less than $25000 a year.

At CVS Foulkes made more than 200 times the front-of-store retail worker.

In March of 2019 the Star reported the announcement of Foulkes' departure “Executive chairman Richard Baker’s influence over Hudson’s Bay Co. is about to get another big boost as Canada’s oldest retailer closes a turbulent chapter in its nearly 350 years of existence. The Canadian retailer said Tuesday that Baker will replace chief executive Helena Foulkes who is departing the company about two years after she was hired.""

“She and Baker spent much of the last two years marred in complaints from shareholders about executive salaries and their failure to unlock the value of the company’s real estate” reported the Star.

Foulkes' campaign spokesperson Emma Caccamo repeatedly refused to respond to questions about the inconsistency between her advocacy for equality and her corporate compensation as compared to workers.

An Indiana couple says they took their family to get their annual flu shot at the local Walgreens last month but all of them including their 4- and 5-year-old were given a Covid-19 vaccine by mistake. Mistakes like this can happen but they’re incredibly rare public health experts say.

Pharmacists and other specialists who give the shots say there are dozens of safeguards built into the system to limit the possibility of human error. And in the case of Covid-19 vaccines if someone is getting a second dose for example and accidentally gets a Moderna vaccine when they had Pfizer’s first that likely won’t cause side effects or other health problems according to findings from an ongoing National Institutes of Health study.

“A single bad situation like that gets a lot of coverage but hundreds of millions of doses and second doses have been administered in a very effective accurate and careful way” said Jennifer Kertanis the director of health for the Farmington Valley Health District in Connecticut who has overseen many public vaccination efforts. “While these types of mistakes are really unfortunate they don’t happen very often and people administering these vaccines are doing everything they can to put steps in place to reduce that potential for human error.”

The CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials Lori Freeman said vaccine mistakes like this are as “rare as a plane crash thankfully.”

‘Checking double-checking and even triple-checking’

It’s unclear what went wrong in the case of the Indiana family.

Joshua and Alexandra Price said they learned about the mistake from the pharmacist who called them about 90 minutes after they received the shots. The couple had already been vaccinated against Covid-19 earlier in the year and their children weren’t old enough to get a Covid-19 vaccine yet as they were only authorized for children 12 and older. The vaccine they received was three times the dose being considered for children’s vaccines. The kids experienced side effects from the shots the family said and were being treated by a cardiologist.

A Walgreens spokesperson said the company could not comment on a particular case due to privacy concerns but released a statement that emphasized safety was a “top priority.”

“Our multi-step vaccination procedure includes several safety checks to minimize the chance of human error and we have reviewed this process with our pharmacy staff in order to prevent such occurrences” a statement from the company said.

It’s those safety steps that vaccine managers said are crucial to protect people who get a vaccine particularly when more kinds of vaccines are being added to the mix like Covid-19 boosters and flu shots and possibly Covid-19 shots for kids that would require a different kind of dosage.

“The system that pharmacies use is very similar to what they use in medication” said Mitch Rothholz the head of immunization policy at the American Pharmacists Association. “It’s checking double-checking and even triple-checking everything.”

“It also involves putting systems in place that limit human error” Rothholz said.

Avoiding vaccine mix-ups

Vaccine safety starts with how the product is stored and labeled Rothholz said. If products look similar stores will keep the vaccines in different parts of storage.

At mass vaccine clinics with multiple vaccines people seeking different shots will wait in separate sections. People who need a Moderna shot for example will be filtered into one section of the site another section will be for Pfizer another for Johnson & Johnson. Each section will be clearly marked with signs.

Often Freeman said clinics will provide just one kind of vaccine at a time to avoid any possible confusion.

Freeman said there is a lot of thought and redundancy that goes into giving out a vaccine. At many clinics people will be asked to pre-register and then when they get to the clinic a greeter will verify the person’s information. Then there’s registration and then another check when the person administers the shot.

Some personal responsibility is also involved the vaccine managers said. A vaccinator can steer that with a conversation as they give someone the vaccine.

“When I give a vaccine I always say ‘OK I’m giving you this particular vaccine. Is this correct?’” Rothholz said. “If I’m giving out more than one vaccine at a time I’ll be sure to give one in each arm and repeat what I’m doing and say ‘I’m giving you your Covid vaccine in your left and your flu vaccine in your right’” Rothholz said.

Rothholz urged people to bring their vaccine cards with them as an additional check. That way the vaccinator can reconfirm that the vaccine they are giving the person comes from the same manufacturer if it is a second or third shot.

What happens after a rare mix-up

In the extremely rare circumstance that someone gets the wrong vaccine Freeman recommends clear communication on behalf of the person who gave the vaccine and on behalf of the person who received one.

Communication should happen immediately and the person who got the wrong vaccine should seek care right away – and follow up to get the vaccine they should have received in the first place.

How much the wrong shot would impact a person’s health depends on a number of factors Freeman said. If a small child gets a larger Covid-19 vaccine dose meant for an adult they may feel side effects for example. If someone is allergic to one of the mRNA vaccines that could be an issue.

But if someone gets a Moderna vaccine when they were supposed to be getting a Pfizer booster they are unlikely to notice. There’s no recommendation for now to mix Covid-19 vaccines but early study suggests no side effects result from mixing vaccine types – especially the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines which use the same mRNA technology.

Ultimately it’s always good to talk to a doctor in the unlikely event that a mix-up would happen she said.

“I think you just want to get it checked out” Freeman said.

In the case of the Indiana family Dr. Peter Hotez dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine said the children should “probably do OK.”

“It is concerning they got a higher dose and they have to be monitored but they should do really well” he said. “There is a lot of data out there now in 5-year-olds and older.”

Pediatricians who have been testing Covid-19 vaccines in younger children tried a variety of doses including full adult doses. And children 12 and up have been receiving the adult dose safely.

As for the parents getting the Covid-19 vaccine would be like getting a booster shot.

“The big concern there is that it may not be as effective as it would be if they received it after six months” Hotez said.

For the Moderna vaccine the booster dose is smaller than the original doses.

From a provider perspective Rothholz said he wants to reassure people that even with all the complicated logistics of administering multiple different kinds of vaccines providers put a lot of thought into the safety systems they use. And with the Covid-19 pandemic they’ve had a lot of practice refining the vaccination process.

Shortly before midnight on Wednesday production workers at a John Deere facility in Waterloo Iowa started shutting down the plant quenching the furnaces in the foundry. The plant was already mostly empty with Deere telling overnight workers to stay home. Three days earlier union members at United Auto Workers meetings in Iowa Illinois and Kansas had voted overwhelmingly to reject a proposed contract that gave subinflation raises and eliminated pensions for all new hires. The rejection came as a surprise to both the union leadership and the company; even some of the workers who had voted no and authorized a strike were surprised that it was actually happening. The 10000 workers who walked off the job are striking Deere for the first time in 35 years. “Just confirmed Waterloo has their picket signs” one worker said before the strike began. “Shit’s about to get real.”

They join 2000 hospital workers striking in Buffalo New York; 1400 production workers for Kellogg’s in four states; 450 steelworkers in Huntington West Virginia; and a one-day walk-off of 2000 telecommunications workers in California all since October 1. One thousand Alabama coal miners 700 nurses in Massachusetts 400 whiskeymakers in Kentucky and 200 bus drivers in Reno Nevada were already on strike in addition to recently settled strikes by 2000 carpenters in Washington 600 Frito-Lay workers in Kansas and 1000 Nabisco factory workers at five plants across the country.

And there are tens of thousands of workers waiting in the wings with 37000 health care workers at Kaiser in Oregon California and Hawaii who have either authorized a strike or are about to as well as several large unions of academic workers also readying to strike. More than 60000 film and television workers were prepared to walk out with 90 percent of International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees members voting 98 percent to strike before a tentative contract was reached on Saturday. A vote on whether to ratify that contract will be held in the next several weeks.

This strike wave isn’t the 1940s when 1 in 10 U.S. workers went on strike in the space of a year. But it isn’t the labor lull of the 2010s either when large strike activity in the private sector fell toward zero. Today workers are increasingly militant — that is unwilling to accept bad terms of employment — but they are not particularly organized. With union density at a historical nadir the unions are playing an inspirational role but they aren’t the only source of the action. What we’re seeing now is strike activity beginning to rise from a decadeslong trough as the “essential” worker — a new category of worker born of the coronavirus pandemic — challenges the boss to make good on that designation.

It’s not just workers taking note of the potential power shift; Wall Street analysts also sounded the alarm on Deere’s stock price this week with one analyst downgrading projections by 25 percent. In a section of a proprietary report titled “Pendulum of Power Has Swung” the analyst wrote: “Members in addition to wanting concessions from Deere regarding a new 6-yr labor agreement could also be tying these negotiations in with their desire to change how UAW national leadership is elected and a broader national (and if global) enhanced activism by labor as they see their increasing power in a tight labor market.”

The woebegone small business owner who can’t attract workers has been one of the media’s favorite protagonists of the Build Back Better era partly as cover for the Fortune 100 CEOs like Deere’s John C. May who benefit from the same low-wage labor market. But that tight labor market a problem from the perspective of employers has a mirror image in the eyes of those workers who never left the workplace: the “essential” and “front-line” and “hero” workers. Inside the workplace workers across all industries from transit to health care to logistics to food manufacturing are beset by understaffing which leads to forced overtime and burnout. In slaughterhouses nursing homes and countless other worksites Covid-19 gave a new intensity to the existing landscape of occupational hazard: In 2020 nursing assistant became the most dangerous job in America.

The same forces making work intolerable for so many — not enough workers and too much work — are simultaneously preparing workers to fight back.

Workers are also feeling the heat of the past year’s market basket inflation. Kaiser’s 1 percent raise offer (on top of the introduction of an average 26 percent wage cut for all new hires) becomes a wage cut against a 5 percent consumer goods inflation. The 15-cent-per-hour raise International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers construction workers are getting in Orlando Florida doesn’t come close to keeping up with the rising cost of living. Kellogg’s proposal includes cutting the cost-of-living adjustment which was once a central part of collective bargaining in core industries but which never came back for Big Three autoworkers after the 2008 financial crisis and auto bankruptcies. Core to several of these strikes — Deere Kellogg’s and Kaiser — is a revolt against the 1980s-era introduction of “two-tier” contracts that provide worse conditions for new hires. As Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers’ International Union Local 3G president and Kellogg’s strike leader Trevor Bidelman told Labor Notes “The future’s not for sale.”

In the case of Deere workers are well aware of the company’s record profits and aren’t moved by what amounts to a $1-per-hour wage increase for most of them. The members have long self-organized into a Facebook group called “Post ’97” meaning employees hired after 1997 with worse wages benefits and pensions. The current contract for most “post-’97” workers would be a 6-cent raise from what “pre-’97” workers made 10 years ago. The company’s proposal to cut pensions for all new hires — creating a “post-’21” workforce — runs up against a moral opposition that aligns with a new economic playing field causing many workers to tout as a core demand of the strike: “No third tier!”

Long thread but important: John Deere workers have reached out to me frustrated about media repeating company talking points that workers make 60-70k a year. One who's been there over a decade showed me what they made in 2020: Under $40k. So let’s talk about wages at John Deere. pic.twitter.com/PnFXX5VMb6 — Jonah Furman (@JonahFurman) October 15 2021

But a tight labor market also means leverage for workers. Knowing that they’re harder to replace individual workers become more likely to say no to bosses: Today workers are quitting their jobs at the highest rate in decades — one of the most precise measures of their labor market power as individuals. Where workers are organized collectively into unions tight labor markets lead to rising willingness to confront employers over the terms and conditions of employment instead of just looking for a better deal elsewhere. In other words the same forces making work intolerable for so many — not enough workers and too much work — are simultaneously preparing workers to fight back.

The end of a national mobilization also tends to release built-up pressures in the workplace. Workers who put up with suppressed wages or stressful working conditions during an emergency expect to see something change afterward. As Harold Meyerson recently observed both 1919 and 1945-1946 saw massive strike waves as the world wars ended. In the 1945-1946 cycle when more than 10 percent of American workers went on strike events that could plausibly be called general strikes erupted in Stamford Connecticut; Lancaster Pennsylvania; Rochester New York; Pittsburgh Pennsylvania; and Oakland California.

The release valve that may be opening now resumes an expansion of labor activity before the pandemic. The generation before the 2008 crisis had been marked by long-term stagnation of wages and decline in labor’s share of national income. Recoveries from recessions in the 1980s 1990s and 2000s took longer than in earlier years and large numbers of workers got stranded in permanent underemployment or inactivity. These trends culminated in the Great Recession and its agonizing protracted recovery. But unemployment finally fell below 4 percent in 2018 and that year and the next a noticeable uptick in strike activity occurred — most notably in a massive teachers’ strike wave — when labor markets had finally recovered from the devastation that followed the 2008 financial crisis but teachers’ wages had not.

In terms of strike activity the current private sector wave picks up where the teachers left off after an interlude of relative inaction during the height of the pandemic. In 2020 moreover teachers formed the first major group of workers to refuse to accept whatever terms the employer dictated for reopening the workplace. It is difficult to imagine teachers speaking out against returning to work in unsafe conditions as much as they did without the national wave of militant teachers’ strikes in the two preceding years. This resistance has now spread across the economy in both organized and individual forms.

Today workers’ economic resistance — whether through organized strikes or in the refusal of dangerous underpaid and unappealing jobs — is shaping the political agenda. Many of the policies in the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion budget proposal would pursue the same ends as workers’ actions but in the realm of social policy. Proposed subsidies for home health care and child care the child tax credit Medicaid expansion and investments in housing and green energy would all indirectly support workers’ power. Either by increasing demand for labor further or by alleviating some of the grotesque social pressures that have forced employees to accept whatever terms employers offered them the federal government would strengthen workers’ bargaining position. When Sen. Joe Manchin D-W.Va. warns against becoming an “entitlement society” what he is opposing is the shift in labor market power that such policy measures help secure.

The issue in dispute across these strikes is whether American workers can be muscled back into punishing labor market conditions.

The heightened interplay between industrial and political disputes marks a break with recent history. Through much of the last generation even militant industrial action often bore little explicitly political significance. A major strike like the one at UPS in 1997 or Verizon in 2016 won gains for workers but such events remained economic affairs. Politicians might feel compelled to comment on them — as former President Bill Clinton did about the UPS strike — but such disputes didn’t raise or settle any larger political question about the balance of power between the classes. (After providing a carefully neutral comment urging UPS and the Teamsters to settle Clinton headed straight to Martha’s Vineyard.)

In the last several years a number of mainstream Democrats have come to accept what had previously been a left-wing argument: that the increase of social inequality and the decline in working-class economic security is the ultimate cause of the destabilization of American democracy and must be taken head on. The stated position of the Biden administration is that “the decline of union density has … weakened our democracy.”

When organized labor is stronger widespread dissatisfaction takes a more coordinated form. With higher levels of union membership organized workers’ militancy generates concentrated pressure on targeted firms and triggers dissension among employers. Some bosses start to squirm and seek to calm labor down by agreeing to progressive social reforms while others insist on holding the line. Those caught in the middle like salaried employees at Deere may largely sympathize with the strikers while being forced to work through the strike despite a serious skills gap.

John Deere is trying to break a strike by having salaried office workers operate heavy machinery let’s see how that’s going— pic.twitter.com/Yb1JkoFAH8 — Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) October 15 2021

The lower level of workers’ organization today — the smaller size of the organized workforce compared to an angry but scattered mass — makes it more difficult to divide employers politically in this way. On the picket lines and on Capitol Hill the political capacity of a shrunken labor movement is being tested. The more concrete gains workers win now in either arena the more others among the unorganized millions will see the benefits of unity.

President Joe Biden styles himself as labor’s champion aspiring to be “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen.” Days before he launched his presidential campaign (using a Pittsburgh union hall for his stage) Biden appeared on the picket line of one of the major strikes of 2019 at the Stop & Shop grocery chain in New England. Recently confronted with businesses having a hard time hiring staff the president said “Pay them more.”

But when asked to take sides he’s stuck to official neutrality his press secretary citing unspecified “legal reasons.” On Friday when asked about the John Deere strike he stated obviously “They have a right to strike. They have a right to demand higher wages. … I’m not getting into the negotiation.”

And the administration has allowed key pro-worker provisions in the American Rescue Plan Act to expire such as subsidies for COBRA which are particularly crucial for striking workers whose employers cut off health insurance. The Allegheny Technologies Inc. workers part of the United Steelworkers union who struck for five months this year had the benefit of federally subsidized COBRA; the UAW members currently striking John Deere whose employer plans to cut them off their plans by October 27 will not. They would however be eligible for other subsidies including heavily subsidized Obamacare plans though that would entail changing plans and potentially medical networks.

Ultimately the issue in dispute across these strikes is whether American workers can be muscled back into the punishing labor market conditions of the pandemic and the several decades that preceded Covid-19 that made the pandemic so brutal within the insecure and unequal American workplace. Will nonunion workers settle for low wages and dangerous conditions? Will union workers continue to ratify two-tier contracts with incremental givebacks to employers? When the U.S. worker “goes back” to work what kind of economy will they be going back to?

This is precisely the same issue as the one roiling Capitol Hill right now: whether Congress’s role is to return us to a pre-pandemic status quo or to intervene on the side of a battered working class.

As the Post noted the UAW strike action is one of many around the country as workers return from the pandemic: ""Thousands have gone on strike at food plants operated by Kellogg's Nabisco and Frito-Lay over work hours pay and benefits.

The sale worth $72473 began on March 25 2021 according to the Statement of Changes in Financial Ownership form filed with the SEC and signed by the company's attorney on Tuesday the day before the strike began.

According to financial data from the New York Stock Exchange which lists Deere & Co the company's stock price peaked in September 2020 before slowly falling. The fall accelerated in recent weeks as negotiations with union leaders dragged on.



May II has served as CEO of Deere & Co since November 2019 and also took on the role of Chairman in May 2020. He joined John Deere in 1997 and has served as a member of the senior management team since 2012.

Iowa's News Now reached out to John Deere for a statement. A spokeswoman tells us the shares were a charitable donation made in March and that it has ""nothing to do with any current events."" The SEC filing does include an explanation which states ""Gift of shares to a charitable donor advised fund.""

A female flight attendant is seen demanding that the woman sits down immediately but the passenger ignores her commands and berates the rest of the plane.

The woman becomes increasingly agitated when the flight attendant says that she could be handcuffed if she does not sit down and stop disrupting the flight. A short time later another flight attendant appears armed with plasticuffs cut the passenger has turned around and doesn’t see how close she is to being handcuffed.

In the end the original flight attendant manages to manhandle the woman down the aircraft aisle helped by an unidentified male. It remains unclear how the incident concluded.

The video was captured by TikTock member and musician @Jawny who said he bought an inflight WiFi pass just to share what was happening.

Like most US senators Tammy Duckworth travels a lot. But every 3-4 flights her mobility is taken away from her she tells Insider.

""Wheelchairs should be treated like a human limb because they're my legs"" says Sen. Duckworth in a video call with Insider.

""When you break my wheelchair or you lose my wheelchair you've taken away my legs."" Senator Duckworth lost her legs as a veteran in the Iraq war when the Blackhawk helicopter she was co-piloting was hit by an RPG.

Disability advocates activists and wheelchair users who fly often are urging a switch in the narrative: instead of saying wheelchairs are being broken view them as a part of the body that is being destroyed.

""If you treat the wheelchair as an extension of a person there's no way it would be destroyed""

In July 2021 according to the latest Air Travel Consumer Report there were 834 incidents of ""mishandled"" wheelchairs and scooters of passengers transported by US airlines. An average of 28 a day.

But the major airlines have adopted very few policies for the carrying of wheelchairs according to publicly available and press comments sent to Insider.

Hawaiian Airlines had a mishandling rate of 2% of their enplaned wheelchairs in July. Its policy states that electric and non-folding wheelchairs are stowed. Manual wheelchairs may be stored in an in-cabin cupboard. They did not respond to Insider's request for further information on handling policies.

American Airlines also had a rate of 2% of the 11160 wheelchairs it carried in July. It told Insider that wheelchairs get loaded and strapped down in the cargo compartment.

""The safe and careful handling of wheelchairs and mobility devices onto aircraft is a top priority at American. When it comes to loading them onto aircraft mobility devices take priority over luggage and are carefully handled and monitored throughout the loading and unloading process.""

Delta Airlines - responsible for the break of influencer and disability advocate GG deFiebre's chair in a May 2020 trip from New York to Phoenix documented in a viral TikTok post viewed 17.8 million times - saw 99 mishandlings in July.

The airline told Insider that wheelchairs are loaded onto the cabin last and offloaded first. They ask wheelchair users to present the necessary loading and handling requirements to the loader.

Indeed wheelchair users are at the forefront of managing the risk of transporting the chairs. The Department of Transportation - and many airlines - encourages wheelchair users to carry instructions to ensure the safest passage for their wheelchairs.

Bri Scalesse a 26-year-old model and disability advocate from New York had her wheelchair broken on a Delta flight 3737 from St Paul Minnesota to Newark New Jersey on July 4 2021.

""If you treat the wheelchair as an extension of a person there's no way it would be destroyed"" She told Insider.

""It starts with the core issue of people with disabilities not being seen as equal and important and our wheelchair is not being seen or understood.""

""One of the things crazy to me was I got three or four comments from people saying you know just go to a thrift store and buy a wheelchair in the meantime. And it blew my mind because it just shows me how little people know or understand what an actual wheelchair user needs to live a daily life the type of wheelchair the customization of the process of getting a wheelchair"" said Scalesse.

""I think that's something that people don't realize is our skin is so reliant on the cushions that we sit on and the way that our bodies fit. If you're sitting on the wrong thing for even four days you're going to have a sore - and that can then literally threaten your life"" she said.

New training and new airplanes: the future of accessible flying

Sen. Tammy Duckworth introduced a policy to force airlines to report wheelchair breaks (among other incidents) to the Civil Aviation Authority.

Senator Duckworth also advocated that ""there should be training for baggage handlers so that they know how to handle the different types of medical devices.""

As well as the treatment of the chairs in the airplane Senator Duckworth said that being met off a plane as a wheelchair user is often a ""crapshoot"" as they frequently arrive with a one-size-fits-all aisle chair which can harm the body of a disabled person.

She explains the need for better training to ensure that the needs of disabled passengers are met and cared for not ignored or absolved under the guise of ""that's not our fault it's a contractor"" Senator Duckworth explains.

Senator Duckworth has been a lot of 'firsts' in the Senate: the first female amputee the first female Thai-American the first disabled woman and the first senator to give birth while in office. She's helmed policy change to allow for breastfeeding on the floor of the Senate as well as introducing the Friendly Airports for Mother's act ensuring that mothers have a safe clean place to breastfeed their babies in airports.

But the change isn't stopping there.

""To fix this problem in the future we can make sure that when new airplanes are designed especially if they're in their passenger aircraft that they're designed so that they do accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities.

A lot of those types of standards could be part of the future when we design commercial airliners.""

In September 2021 Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Rep. Jim Langevin the first quadriplegic to be elected to Congress introduced legislation to improve the accessibility of air travel for disabled people.

The Air Carrier Access Amendments Act is co-sponsored in the Senate by Tammy Ducksworth and Bob Casey Richard Blumenthal Ed Markey Jeff Merkley and Maggie Hassan.

In a statement Langevin said ""Although we have made progress in the last 35 years to address barriers in plane travel for people with disabilities I know personally that challenges remain""

Except for large swathes of Asia a region that is divided in its approach to the pandemic and has dragged its feet in the reopening of borders.

Across much of the world a recovery in air travel is finally under way. International airlines are readying their crews and planes and preparing to take advantage of an expected boom in demand as countries learn to live with Covid-19

The response of two leading airlines to the uncertainty surrounding air travel in Asia is telling.

United Airlines America’s largest international carrier is to redeploy 50 to 60 long-haul planes that would normally ply Asian routes to the highly-profitable transatlantic route between the US and Europe which is to reopen to travellers in November.

Meanwhile the largest European airline that flies into Asia Deutsche Lufthansa says that by December it will be operating more flights between New York and Chicago than throughout Asia as it waits for the region to open.

Those plans are a reflection of the increasing divide emerging across the Asia-Pacific in how to deal with the pandemic. While Singapore is at the vanguard of opening up having recently underlined its intentions by announcing a slew of traffic corridors to places including the US and UK – other countries have taken longer to warm to the idea.

Australia has pledged to begin opening international borders from November while New Zealand which abandoned its “zero-Covid” strategy this month amid an outbreak of the Delta variant has flagged a staged reopening of its borders from 2022. But the biggest headaches for airline executives are caused by mainland China Hong Kong and Macau the last frontiers clinging to “zero-Covid” strategies.

CEOs from a variety of international carriers met in-person for a large scale conference for the first time in two years at the 77th International Air Transport Association summit in Boston US from October 3 to 5.

Conspicuous by their physical absence were CEOs from mainland China  Hong Kong Taiwan and Japan – in charge of some of the world’s largest airlines – who attended virtually instead. Still some executives from the region managed to navigate varying restrictions to attend among them the CEOs of Australian carrier Qantas Singapore Airlines and Korean Air.

The consensus of those executives who spoke to This Week in Asia was that boom times would eventually return to Asia but for now the region would take a back seat in their plans. Some did not expect to be flying into the region at full strength until 2023.

Frustration

For an airline that has thrived by connecting East and West through its mega-airport hub in the Middle East Dubai’s Emirates may arguably stand to benefit from the shrinking footprint of Asian airlines. Yet the Gulf airline’s visionary boss Tim Clark was adamant Asia’s closure was nothing to be “gleeful” about.

“I struggle with – forget commercial opportunities and competitive advantage – when countries close themselves off it causes enormous problems and it’s not just for us it’s for everybody else” Clark said.

The sooner the airline industry as a whole restored itself to its former competitive glory the better it would be for everyone Clark said.

Lufthansa’s CEO Carsten Spohr said his airline’s presence in Asia would be so small by December that it would operate more flights between New York and Chicago – 55 per week – than in the whole Asia region.

Before the pandemic Lufthansa – which controls the national airlines of Germany Austria Switzerland and Belgium – flew more than 100 passenger flights per week to and from mainland China.

Spohr said the slowdown would cause problems beyond the airline industry.

“We are not only slowing down our recovery at Lufthansa which is also my concern we are slowing down the recovery of economic relations between China and Germany ” he said.

Leading the way

Ed Bastian who led Delta Air Lines to being the most profitable air carrier in the world pre-pandemic said that reconnecting continental America and Europe could prove pivotal as a “live experiment” to show how air travel could be made safe.

“It will give other parts of the world the ability to see what travel looks like when you cross international borders” Bastian said.

Under recently agreed plans the US will allow fully vaccinated citizens flying from continental Europe and Britain to enter the country provided they pass a preflight Covid-19 test 72 hours before flying.

Within Asia it is Singapore that is leading the way in welcoming fully vaccinated visitors. The city state opened travel corridors to Germany and Brunei for vaccinated travellers on September 8.

After a month of operations 3100 travellers had used the scheme and only two had tested positive on arrival in the city state. On October 9 Singapore announced it would soon be opening travel corridors with eight Western nations – including the US and UK where infection rates remain stubbornly high – in addition to one with South Korea.

Korean Air’s chairman and CEO Walter Cho who has managed to keep his airline profitable through the pandemic thanks to its air cargo business said Asian nations needed to “trust” each other to open up more broadly rather than have just a piecemeal reopening between individual countries.

“Hopefully by the end of the year [the region will] open up but it can’t just be Korea it has to be many countries in Asia that are doing the same thing at the same time in agreement and trust each other country to do that” he said.

Singapore and Hong Kong’s twice-failed travel bubble is one example of how rising infections can quickly undermine such trust. The bubble was meant to launch in November 2020 but was postponed after a spike in cases in Hong Kong; it was then shelved again in May after a spike in Singapore and in August the two governments decided to drop the idea altogether citing differences in the anti-epidemic strategies.

No airline has suffered more from the closure of borders than Hong Kong’s iconic airline Cathay Pacific . With no domestic flights to rely on and with non-residents unable to enter the city freely for 18 months the carrier’s passenger business has crumpled.

The 75-year-old airline which has weathered all sorts of global and regional crises in the past has had to rely on a HK$39 billion bailout – with much of the money coming from the government – to avoid collapse.

Before the pandemic Hong Kong had been a global hub for air travel. Now it has one of the world’s strictest quarantine regimes for inbound travellers of up to 21 days. It is increasingly aligning its policies with Beijing in a move to prioritise reopening with mainland China over the rest of the world.

Mainland China’s own response to resurgent virus outbreaks has been to mass-test its citizens and to control the movement of its 1.4 billion population through a traffic light-based health code.

Guessing game

Topi Manner the CEO of Finland’s Finnair was the most optimistic of CEOs surveyed. Of Finnair’s 29 long-haul routes 21 are to Asia.

The airline is hopeful that markets like Japan and Korea will be ready to open by the end of this year which could enable it to revive flights to the eight cities in these countries it flew to pre-pandemic.

China Manner hopes could open by summer 2022. “We think that especially the places in North East Asia: Japan South Korea mainland China Hong Kong Singapore – they have vaccinated at speed and they will open up” Manner said.

Other airlines foresaw a slower opening for China.

Clark of Emirates said the chief worry was that Hong Kong and mainland China’s “zero-Covid” approach could leave them closed until 2023.

A 2023 timeline was also envisaged by Scott Kirby the CEO of United Airlines who blamed Asia’s slower recovery on “zero-tolerance policies” but noted that vaccination rates were lagging other parts of the world.

Kirby has largely written off expectations of a recovery in Asia before 2023.

“I hope that it is earlier but that is what we’re planning for” he said.

Dutch national airline KLM envisaged some reopening in Asia “step by step” next year hoping that this could open the floodgates.

CEO Pieter Elbers cautioned against raised expectations though he said he could see a scenario in which China could open “very quick and fast” should it decide on that course of action.

Just how quickly progress can come was demonstrated during the conference when Indonesia’s tourist hotspot of Bali said it would open to travellers from China New Zealand South Korea and Japan. Days after the conference Singapore announced the expansion of its travel corridors to the eight Western countries. Then on October 12 Thailand announced that from November it would open to vaccinated travellers from several countries including the US UK and China.

Rebalancing

For now most airlines are concentrating on what lessons can be learned from the pandemic. For Finnair the short- to medium-term takeaway is a redeployment of flights from Asian to North American routes though it remains “very committed” to the Asia-Pacific region. It is also launching long-haul flights from Sweden to places where there are fewer restrictions.

“We will for example start long haul operations from Stockholm Arlanda [Airport] to the US and to Thailand which is a move to find business from those places where the travel restrictions are basically allowing free travel for the fully vaccinated” Manner said.

United’s temporary pivot away from Asia comes as it enjoys near full recovery across all the other markets it flies to. In Asia its passenger traffic is down 85 per cent.

Clark of Emirates is bullish despite a key part of his network being hobbled and dozens of his Airbus A380s – the largest passenger plane in the world – being grounded.

Emirates is betting on flying near “full strength” by the middle of next summer hoping to gain at the expense of other Asian hub airlines that remain weakened or crippled by the pandemic.

KLM similarly declared it was “more or less” back at its pre-Covid levels in terms of the number of cities it services – though some have permanently been dropped new destinations have been launched in their place.

Delta said it was too early to tell whether it would permanently scale back flights to Asia. The Atlanta-based airline owns an 11 per cent stake in Korean Air.

Finnair which has built a niche flying the shortest route between Europe and Asia was the most optimistic of all.

“The bottom line is that the medium- to long-term outlook in Asia is good” Manner said.

“Half of the world’s population is in Asia there will be many new mega cities in Asia [and] interesting markets to serve.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zdC1hbnRob255LWxha2Utbm9rb21pcy1oYXJib3JtYXN0ZXItZW5qb3lzLXRlYWNoaW5nLW90aGVycy10by1zYWlsLzYwMDEwNzE1NS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Anthony: Lake Nokomis 'harbormaster' enjoys teaching others to sail,"Tim Brandon is sort of the volunteer harbormaster of Lake Nokomis.

He's also a sailboat owner instructor volunteer repair troubleshooter and good-natured leader of an informal group of sailing devotees who are serious about the sport without taking themselves too seriously.

Brandon 66 who retired from Delta Air Lines last year made his after-hours sailing avocation of years into something of a full-time volunteer gig during the sailing season that officially ended last weekend.

""We promote sailing at Lake Nokomis and around the world"" quipped Brandon a sailor since his Army and college days in California 45 years ago.

Brandon moved to Minneapolis in 1989 near Lake Nokomis where he and his wife Dore raised three children. He worked as a customer service agent for Northwest Airlines and Delta.

Nokomis a shallow lake of less than 3 miles around is not San Francisco Bay. However Brandon is part of a modest growth movement of sailors and aspiring sailors from youth to seniors who own or use boats through a Brandon-affiliated nonprofit that promotes sailing cooperative boat maintenance and fun.

Brandon acquired a used Rhodes 19 a small fun boat that has been kept on a Minneapolis Park Board buoy for about a decade.

""Years before that I befriended many sailors including a gentleman who had a Rhodes 19 and was struggling so I showed him how to sail it"" Brandon said. ""He liked sailing with me. I have other friends who have Aqua Cats and C Scows 18-footers on Nokomis.""

Some years ago amid growing interest the Park Board started providing a few rent-free buoys for ""community-sailing"" clubs.

Jim McKie another former Delta employee and teacher is the ""commodore"" of Youth Sailing Resources at Nokomis. He and others including Brandon formed the nonprofit to which some boat owners lease their boats for free for instruction and sailing outings by the boatless.

Brandon and the other instructors are remunerated only with the satisfaction of seeing youth-to-seniors improve and enjoy sailing.

""Some have gone on to sail on oceans around the world"" Brandon said.

And some just like sailing Nokomis and other area lakes.

""Lake Nokomis is a wonderful kindergarten"" Brandon said. ""It can be windy. As long as you wear your life jacket and keep your head about you you're not in a pickle on Nokomis. We also take the kids through tests such as capsizing the boat and recovering. Also anchoring sailing by poles reducing the sail size: This is what we work on. Lake Nokomis is a pleasant place to be.''

Last weekend Brandon participated in the Lake Nokomis Regatta of about a dozen boats with three to five people each. Brandon's daughter a Minneapolis school teacher sailed her 21-foot Venture called ""Que Pasa.""

""Sailing is a real builder of peoples' lives"" Brandon said. ""It's refreshing to me and a form of meditation. You're done with everything around you but the sailing. You're definitely exercising. Particularly on bigger boats.""

On a Sunday night in the dark Brandon helped fellow sailors exit the lake as the city-sailing season ended.

Sailing also gives Brandon purpose in retirement.

Chris Farrell economics editor at MPR and a Star Tribune contributor wrote this summer about the four pillars of a successful retirement as cited by Age Wave and Edward Jones. They are good physical and mental health; friends and family; financial security and purpose.

Nine in 10 survey respondents said purpose was critical to a good retirement. It can be part-time work volunteering walking reading gardening or some combination of things that are good for the mind body and spirit.

Brandon whose wife works part time didn't get rich working in the ranks for Delta. He also has started this fall driving a school bus part time for Minneapolis Public Schools. He likes kids and plans to supplement his income with what can be a $30/hour job.

""One of the good things is three months off in the summer"" Brandon said. ""Money is important. We'd be OK if I didn't work. But there are things we want to do.

""I'd like a boat on the Gulf Coast between Florida and Texas. The sailing season goes until December. I don't have to spend a lot of money. I could get a 26-foot Pearson a good boat for less than $5000 and you can sleep in them."""

An investigation by the CBC found agents steered buyers away from a property because it would mean a smaller commission.

A buying agent and a listing agent in Canada typically split a 5 percent commission paid by the seller but they are supposed to negotiate commissions with each listing or sale. Sellers can lower that by listing a property themselves.

The CBC investigation started after a couple in Ontario listed their property without an agent and offered any buying agent a 1 percent commission.

They received no calls from agents after six weeks with the house on the market although agents did call looking to represent them. When one of the sellers asked an agent why she had not heard from any buyers the agent said the listing had been “blackballed” the CBC reported.

Posing as potential buyers the news service called three agents asking them to represent them in acquiring the couple’s home.

One agent said the property was overpriced and said the couple wouldn’t lower their ask. Another said that a showing could not be scheduled. But the sellers said no agents ever called with a potential buyer.

The agent who claimed the couple wouldn’t negotiate did call and immediately brought up commissions.

“Right off the bat she wanted to know if she was getting 2.5 per cent [commission]” seller Joanne Petit said. “When we told her that there would only be a 1 percent commission she said ‘OK thank you I’m not interested I’ll keep my clients to myself.’”

Also when CBC reporters also posed as sellers and asked 25 agents if they could lower the commission offered to a buyer agent 88 percent warned against it.

Accusations of collusion among real estate agents is by no means unique to Canada. Brokerage costs in the U.S. are two to three times higher than in the rest of developed world according to REX a digital real estate startup based in Texas.

“In terms of commissions the industry functions as a cartel. They enforce on the entire industry a certain high and relatively uniform commission level” said Stephen Brobeck of the Consumer Federation of America a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit.

Brobeck said that commissions should not be negotiated between seller and buyer agents. He said “decoupling” commissions could save consumers billions of dollars a year.

Southern Realty donates foodstuff hospital equipment and protective items to the community

KLANGITES have much to be proud of their city famed for its delectable food.

From yummy savoury delights of bak kut teh and ikan bakar to sweet treats like apple strudel and pandan layer cake this is a township that keeps on serving.

This also holds true for Klang-based Southern Realty (Malaya) Sdn Bhd that set aside RM250000 as part of its ongoing food aid initiative within the community since July 2021.

Southern Realty aims to reach out and deliver food boxes to households and individuals experiencing hardship during these trying times pledging 500 boxes monthly to those in need.

Each food box contains pantry essentials such as a 5kg bag of rice noodles canned goods sugar along with a variety of sauces and condiments.

The palm oil and real estate investment company estimates these boxes would reach some 2500 households in the Klang region. With assistance from the police and the Klang Municipal Council more than 1000 families have received food boxes to date.

“As a company based in Klang we feel it is our responsibility to provide for the community in times of need” says Southern Realty senior director Dr Nick Low.

“We will strive to continue our longstanding commitment to the community and ensure everyone is taken care of. We have witnessed the impact of the pandemic first hand and decided to contribute over RM1mil to tide the various members of the Klang community over the Covid-19 pandemic.”

Low says that many people have lost their main source of income due to the pandemic and continued lockdown measures.

“We understand that these people are in dire need of basic necessities and we want to help alleviate any burden our neighbours may be facing and wish to contribute in any way we can” he says.

Southern Realty gave RM500000 worth of medical equipment and supplies to Hospital Tengku Ampual Rahimah in August 2021.

In the spirit of banding together to fight Covid-19 the company donated some RM500000 worth of medical equipment and supplies to Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah (HTAR) in August 2021.

Southern Realty’s contributions consist of new machines and essential equipment upgrades for the radiology forensic and laboratory departments as well as the Covid-19 response team.

The hospital received a brand-new mobile FDR Nano X-ray machine that is critical for evaluating Covid-19 patients 30 mechanical hi-lo hospital beds body racks and a variety of laboratory test equipment and other essentials.

HTAR consultant haematologist Dr Tan Swee Looi says: “When the influx of patients overwhelmed our facility Southern Realty's donation of GeneXpert to the pathology department and digital portable X-ray machine to the radiology department had our backs covered.”

“They even looked into the welfare of our frontliners' physical and mental well being with their thoughtful gifts. My sincere gratitude to Southern Realty for the thoughtful and timely assistance.”

To motivate the frontliners further the company donated RM350000 worth of amenities such as refrigerators and microwave ovens to staff pantries at all the wards as well as 200 vouchers of full board holidays to be used by the frontliners when the pandemic settles.

“Frontliners and healthcare workers are the community’s last line of defence against Covid-19. We want to show our support and do what we can to motivate them to continue their fight.

“Their wellbeing especially their mental health is our priority” says Low.

Southern Realty donated protective items costing RM120000 to the Klang Municipal Council.

Aside from hospitals within the Klang region Southern Realty also donated essential protective items to the Klang Municipal Council.

The company contributed RM120000 worth of protective items such as disposable PPE coveralls Covid-19 antigen rapid tests surgical face masks soft nitrile gloves disinfectant and hand sanitisers to the local authority.

Context: Carrie Lam suggested Housing Authority pay subsidies to those on waiting lists to accelerate delivery of new homes

Hong Kong’s main provider of public housing should provide support payments to residents waiting years for subsidised flats suggested Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor last week. This suggestion was given in a bid to speed up the authority’s building programme.

Lam said the Housing Authority was responsible for completing the construction process quickly once it was given land. It should try to give homes to applicants within three years of them joining the waiting list.

“The cash subsidies are currently paid by the government but why shouldn’t it be the Housing Authority? If you build the estates slowly you would have to pay” Lam said.

Lam’s statement is in reference to the Hong Kong government’s initiative rolled out in July. It offers cash to those who have been affected by the world’s most expensive property market.

Hong Kong policy address: 5 key takeaways from Carrie Lam’s speech

The subsidy scheme currently provides cash allowances for people who have been waiting for public housing for more than three years. As of June about 153600 applicants were queuing for public rental housing with an average waiting time of 5.8 years. This is the longest waiting time in 22 years and almost double the Housing Authority’s three-year service pledge.

The subsidy scheme for those on the long-term waiting list gives HK$2250 (US$1860) a month to two-member households and families of six or more get HK$3900. About 90000 households could benefit.

In response to Lam’s statement a spokesman for the Housing Authority said it always cooperated with the government to construct public housing accommodation as quickly as possible. He said the body would allocate its resources to manage its operating expenses and construction costs in a sustainable manner.

News: Carrie Lam back-pedals on suggestion for Housing Authority to pay subsidies

Hong Kong’s leader has back-pedalled on a suggestion that the Housing Authority pay cash handouts to those on its years-long waiting list.

During her weekly press briefing last Tuesday Lam said her previous remarks proposing the Housing Authority take over responsibility for making support payments to would-be tenants was merely meant to “spark discussion”.

She lauded the authority for providing 96500 new public housing flats in the past four years – a 50 per cent increase over the previous five-year period. But she defended her suggestion as a way to motivate the statutory body and the civil servants involved to “walk the extra mile” in speeding up the building process.

Hong Kong students report housing and online learning as biggest concerns

The city leader came under fire from some authority members after floating the suggestion early this month. She said her comments were aimed at “establishing a spirit of accountability” in the statutory body.

Housing Authority member Anthony Chiu Kwok-wai said he did not see how Lam’s idea for transferring the subsidies burden to the body would help solve the issue.

“The problem is not about who forks out the money as the Housing Authority after all is also using taxpayers’ money” Chiu said.

Instead he said the bottleneck lay in the early stages as most of the land allocated to the authority was not ready for construction of public housing estates. It usually took a decade to prepare the land for development with the necessary infrastructure in place such as roads electricity water supply and sewage he added.

The plight of Hong Kong families awaiting public housing

Dr Billy Mak Sui-choi another Housing Authority member said a variety of factors could have contributed to the delay including land supply shortages – the government’s responsibility – as well as the authority’s efficiency levels.

It was therefore vital for the government to come up with a clear mechanism for monitoring the Housing Authority’s performance said Mak who is also an economist at Baptist University.

“It is understandable and reasonable to hold the Housing Authority accountable and monitor its work if the problems lie in the body” he added.

“But it will be unfair to expect the authority to meet the three-year pledge if there is an insufficient supply of land.”

Issue: Hong Kong leader forecasts new Northern Metropolis will provide more than 1 million homes in next three decades

Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor revealed in her policy address early this month that Hong Kong faced a shortfall of 3000 hectares of land for housing economic and recreational developments in the period until 2048 higher than an initial estimate of 1200 hectares in a long-delayed review of a planning study.

Lam said to address the shortage the administration had identified about 4100 hectares from major projects until 2048 – including Lantau Tomorrow Vision a massive reclamation scheme in waters east of Lantau Island and parts of a proposed “Northern Metropolis”.

The Northern Metropolis would be near the border with mainland China and could provide up to 926000 flats.

“The solution to address the housing problems ... rests not on ‘quick fixes’ ... but rather on the determination to sustain land supply” Lam said.

She did not give an estimate on how much the project would cost but suggested it would be financially sustainable. The lack of definite figures has raised concerns that the project to develop 300 sq km could end up burdening the city financially as Lam had in a previous blueprint already proposed the Lantau Tomorrow Vision.

Witman Hung Wai-man principal liaison officer for Hong Kong at the Shenzhen Qianhai Authority hailed Lam’s Northern Metropolis push as a plan to fit the city into the development of Qianhai and the Greater Bay Area but expressed worry that red tape could derail the project.

“If Hong Kong still follows the old way of developing going through endless studies zoning and consultation the Northern Metropolis will only remain a castle in the air” Hung said.

Ryan Ip Man-ki head of land and housing at the policy think tank Our Hong Kong Foundation shared similar views and proposed the government set up a high-level unit or statutory body to oversee the metropolis project cutting through bureaucracy.

Glossary

Housing Authority: a statutory body in charge of building and managing Hong Kong’s public housing estates

Housing Authority’s three-year service pledge: refers to the statutory body’s target of providing the first flat offer to low-income family and elderly one-person applicants at an average waiting time of about three years. This time frame is not applicable to non-elderly one-person applicants under the Quota and Points System for which applicants need to accumulate enough points based on certain criteria – such as age at the time of application or length of time they have waited upon application – to be eligible for a subsidised flat.

Lantau Tomorrow Vision: Hong Kong’s plan to create a new metropolis on man-made islands in waters off Lantau Island. The 1700-hectare reclamation project was announced during Carrie Lam’s second policy address in October 2018. It is expected to provide between 260000 and 400000 homes for 700000 to 1.1 million people. Of these homes 70 per cent would be public housing in a bid to solve the city’s land shortage problem.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiHmh0dHBzOi8vdW5pbGFnLmVkdS5uZy8_cD0xMDU5MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BAYO OMOBORIOWO DONATES “DISCOVER NIGERIA” TO UNILAG,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='unilag.edu.ng', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /?p=10592 (Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1006)'))) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiHmh0dHBzOi8vdW5pbGFnLmVkdS5uZy8_cD0xMDU5MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,

COLUMBIA S.C. -- A South Carolina teacher is off the job after a student earned an illegal and unsafe prize in class.

They were gummies containing THC the main psychoactive compound in marijuana WIS reported.

It was meant to be a prize but instead when an elementary student put his hand in the prize bowl he got something called ""Stoney Patch Kids"" -- a product that boasts extra-strength THC and contains a schedule one drug.

While no child ate the marijuana gummies one came close.

""That's what concerned me most about the story the chance the child could've eaten these products that are not good for them"" said Susan Spearman grandmother to one of the students.

According to an arrest report Victoria Weiss had a box in her class filled with different candies she got at the Dollar General.

RELATED: Marijuana edibles can appear similar to candy

But on Sept. 23 when two kids earned a prize one grabbed a Dum Dum and the other grabbed gummies with marijuana.

According to the Lexington County sheriff the child who went for the gummies was told to pick another candy instead and still walked away with the Stoney Patch Kids.

It wasn't until that child went to an after-school program and asked for help opening the gummies that a teacher saw what was in them and alerted the school.

""When I first heard I was really shocked and sad that this teacher lost her job because of a mistake or an error in judgment and I'm really sorry for the kids who've lost their teacher that they have probably gotten used to and loved the routine she set up for them"" Spearman said.

The gummies' package said they contain 350 milligrams of THC and the sheriff said they are illegal in South Carolina.

The arrest warrant for Weiss said the assistant principal found another pack of THC gummies in the prize bowl and deputies found THC edibles in her home.

Weiss is charged with possession of a schedule one drug and is out on a personal recognizance bond.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbnRvbnJlcC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwLzE2L2ptLW0tc2Nob2xhcnNoaXAtZm91bmRhdGlvbi1zcG9uc29yaW5nLW1hc2txdWVyYWRlLWJhbGwtb2N0LTIzLzg0NTMyNDIwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JM&M Scholarship Foundation is sponsoring a MASKquerade Ball Oct. 23.,"The Repository

Frugal Frannie Investigates…,"By Frugal Frannie

Tis the season of check-out shock. My typical grocery shop used to hit around $50 a go. But in September each trip started landing at over $60. How about you?

According to the Consumer Price Index report issued October 13th food prices nationally are rising at a 4.6% annual clip with overall inflation hitting 5.4% the highest in 13 years.

To ensure I’m spending my food budget as wisely as possible I’ve been hunting in multiple Upper West Side supermarkets within a 15-minute walk of my apartment. My discovery? Bargains can be had at almost every one; but prices on individual “benchmark” items vary widely with some costing DOUBLE at one place versus another.

Instead of keeping all that data in my head I decided to create a “market basket” of 21 common items and do a survey of seven markets in a single day. On October 15th I checked prices at:

Brooklyn Fare at 62nd and West End Ave (just opened)

Fairway at 74th and Broadway

Gristedes at 84th and Columbus

Jubilee at 69th and Freedom Place

Key Food at 86th and Amsterdam

Pioneer at 74th and Columbus

Trader Joe’s at 72nd and Broadway

Comparing apples-to-apples even among apple prices wasn’t always simple. So here’s my GIANT METHODOLOGY DISCLAIMER: I looked for the lowest available price on a given item using unit pricing to standardize.

For example Trader Joe’s sells Granny Smith apples for 69 cents each; Fairway has a three-pound bag for $6.99; Brooklyn Fare posted $1.99 a pound. A typical apple weighs a half-pound. I calculated a standard pound price for all stores. Is it perfect? No.

If an item was on sale say three cans of tuna for $4 I went with the unit price based on that deal. Again this is a snapshot based on the lowest price I saw on a single Friday.

Finally some stores are rather haphazard with posted prices with many shelves missing proper tags. And I don’t know if the shelf price reflects what will be scanned at the register. Vigilance is your best defense frugalistas.

My findings:

What are you finding in your gustatory travels? Are you buying from different places than usual to save a buck? Have a secret source that always has the goods at great prices? Let’s hear it!",,,,,,,,,

As the last undeveloped commercial corridor in the Lexington County city it merits being more careful with what goes there Cayce Mayor Elise Partin told The Post and Courier.

The city has zoning in place to encourage valuable commercial development whether for retailers offices or light industrial companies City Manager Tracy Hegler said. Mixed-use projects in the area can have some homes or apartments Hegler said but the city is hoping to maximize development along the corridor.

That vision collided with a development's group reality earlier in October when City Council unanimously rejected a proposed mostly residential development for a vacant site along 12th Street Extension.

For the developers the result was a shock especially in the wake of a 3-2 vote by the city's Planning Commission in favor of the project developers.

The project plan for the Cottages at Cayce called for about 270 rental cottages and townhomes ranging from one to three bedrooms including some with attached garages on a 53-acre site.

Developers said the project was valued at up to $50 million though Partin and others with the city believe that the project's value and tax benefits were being overestimated as part of the company's pitch.

After the Oct. 5 defeat there was anger among at least some of the developers including an email from one of them Drew Babcock to the council member who made the denial motion Tim James who is seeking reelection in November.

""I would be very concerned if I lived in your district and would strongly consider finding an alternative to represent me at city council"" Babcock wrote.

Tuesday April 26 2016.

Steve Helber/AP



Three US water treatment plants were hit with ransomware attacks this year according to a new report.

The previously unreported incidents came after a widely publicized attack on a Florida plant.

Ransomware is on the rise globally and attacks on public infrastructure could put lives at risk.

Ransomware gangs attacked even more water treatment plants across the US than previously known according to a new report.

Water plants in Nevada Maine and California were all hit with ransomware in 2021 – and all three incidents went unreported until Thursday when the attacks were disclosed in a joint advisory published by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency the FBI the NSA and the Environmental Protection Agency.

The cyberattacks on water treatment plants come amid a broader rise in ransomware shaking public and private organizations across the US. Ransomware attacks in which cybercriminals deploy malicious code that locks up an organizations' computer systems until they agree to pay a ransom could cost victims $20 billion this year.

In all three attacks cybercriminals took over the water treatment plants' supervisory control and data acquisition systems also known as SCADA which lets administrators remotely monitor the facilities. In addition to the three attacks in 2021 a similar ransomware attack hit a New Jersey facility in 2020.

The previously undisclosed attacks came after a highly publicized hack of an Oldsmar Florida water treatment plant. In that incident the hacker tried to raise the amount of sodium hydroxide in the water by 11000% which authorities said could have put residents in danger – but a different employee who noticed the change immediately reversed it before drinking water was affected.

Ransomware is being treated with growing urgency by law enforcement and the cybersecurity community as criminals bring in record profits from ransom victims. Ransomware attacks grew 435% last year according to the security startup Deep Instinct. Cybercriminals gangs took down the networks of 560 healthcare facilities 1681 schools and colleges and more than 1300 companies according to the security firm Emsisoft.

The White House convened a meeting earlier this week with leaders from 31 countries to discuss a coordinated approach to stopping ransomware across the globe.

Experts say beating ransomware groups will depend on stopping the flow of cash from victims to criminals either by enforcing bans on ransom payments or by more heavily regulating cryptocurrency used in most ransomware transactions.

The federal advisory published Thursday warned water treatment plant administrators to be on the lookout for suspicious activity on their networks and to take steps to prevent fraudulent logins including activing multifactor authentication on all devices that remotely access facilities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZndlZWsudXNhdG9kYXkuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTcvamltLWZ1cnlrLXNvbi10YW5uZXItY2FkZGllLWZsdWZmLWNvd2FuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jim Furyk's son fills in as caddie as Fluff Cowan misses SAS Championship on PGA Tour Champions,"In Jacksonville last week it was Furyk & Friends.

In North Carolina this week it was Furyk & Son.

Jim Furyk competing in the PGA Tour Champions SAS Championship at Prestonwood Country Club finished tied for third with his son Tanner on the bag.

“I’m sure he enjoyed it and I promise you I enjoyed it 100 times more. Special week” Furyk said after his round. Regular caddie Fluff Cowan was taking the week off. “I feel bad that Fluff went down that he wasn’t able to be here. I hope he’s healthy and getting better.”

This was a week after he and his wife hosted the first ever Constellation Furyk & Friends tournament on the PGA Tour Champions.

Furyk and Tanner were teammates in the PNC Championship last December in Orlando. The SAS was the first time Tanner caddied for his old man.

But he wasn’t the only Furyk child at the tournament.

“It was a real special opportunity for our family. Caleigh [daughter] came in from college” he said. “To have Tanner on the bag just really cool. Then to have a real solid week and kind of come down the stretch and feel like you’ve got to make a putt on the last.”

Furyk briefly took the clubhouse lead at 11 under after draining a birdie on the last.

When we launched our Domino x Crate & Kids furniture line last month we couldn’t have predicted which items would be best-sellers (though we definitely had some favorites). But now that our creations have been out in the world for a few weeks we’ve noticed which ones in particular are trending. The main thing they all have in common? They’d work just as great in a kid’s room as they would in an adult’s space.

From a curved-line dresser to a perfectly peach pouf here are the items you can’t get enough of—and which ones might even sell out if you’re not quick enough to snag them now.

Push & Pull

Of all the things in the collection these cute dresser knobs are what most people are clamoring to get their hands on. The lilac is most popular followed by blue and then orange.

Soft Spot

The best part about this peachy pouf is its versatility. As in it’s a cute pillow for a playroom but also provides additional seating for family movie night when the couch gets too crowded.

Book Nook

Adults and kids alike will appreciate these cubes for organizing. They’re stackable and sturdy—and thanks to a clever removable shelf they can grow with your little ones.

Shine On

We designed this domed ceiling lamp to resemble the moon so we can see why everyone can’t stop staring at it—and adding it to their carts.

The Hot Seat

Just like it’s pouf counterpart the Renn chair is being scooped up at an alarmingly fast rate. Maybe that’s because it’s the perfect cushy spot to take in a good book.

It’s Electric!

This double-sided pillow adds a jolt of fun to any bed it touches no matter your decor.

Sew Cool

The geometric shapes on this pretty pink quilt mean it would look just as good draped over a sofa as it would on your kiddo’s bed.

All Dressed Up

Naturally this curved dresser also made the cut. Its light sungkai wood goes with everything and the interchangeable knobs will help set the palette for the rest of the room.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNobWlycm9yLmllL3doYXRzLW9uL2Zvb2QtZHJpbmstbmV3cy9sZWFzdC1oZWFsdGh5LW9wdGlvbnMteW91ci1mYXZvdXJpdGUtMjUyMzUxNjjSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5pcmlzaG1pcnJvci5pZS93aGF0cy1vbi9mb29kLWRyaW5rLW5ld3MvbGVhc3QtaGVhbHRoeS1vcHRpb25zLXlvdXItZmF2b3VyaXRlLTI1MjM1MTY4LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The least healthy options in your favourite takeaways - Dominos McDonald's and more,"We have more newsletters

Pizza lovers have always been divided over what you can put on a pizza.

Whether it's pineapple other fruits greens or even spaghetti an online war over what is appropriate always blows up.

But now Domino's in Australia has gone next level and added vegemite to the list of questionable pizza toppings.

The pizza outlet has created a limited-edition Cheesy Vegemite Pizza and it's had mixed reviews.

Kiwis over in Australia can now enjoy the salty slightly bitter taste of Vegemite paired with melted rich mozzarella and the fluffiness of freshly baked pizza dough.

The collaboration comes after Domino's asked social media fans earlier this year if they'll give a Cheesy Vegemite Pizza a try.

They were met with a resounding ""yes"" through almost 30000 likes and 12000 comments.

But what do people really think?

""You know you're Aussie when you get excited for Vegemite pizza (non Australians wouldn't understand)"" one Facebook user wrote.

Green is having a moment and not just on walls The color also stars in HBO’s Scenes From a Marriage in the form of a velvet sofa. Stephanie Bowen the set decorator dressed Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain’s fictional living room with a rounded love seat in an olive upholstery.

The piece of furniture is meant to be divisive—the married (spoiler: and then not) couple fight over it often while sitting on it at multiple emotional moments throughout the five-episode series. “We went through several options always questioning if this is the item that will tell the story as Mira (Chastain’s character) had a love-hate relationship with it” explains Bowen. She ultimately found the mid-century banana-shaped settee at Jen Mod a Danish modern furniture seller in Bridgeport Connecticut.

It was important to director Hagai Levi to mirror the sofa that the drama’s writer Ingmar Bergman had in his childhood home adding an extra layer of history and storytelling to an already emotionally turbulent atmosphere. Levi loved the seat so much that when production wrapped he had it shipped back to his home in Israel.

KITTS October 15 2021 (MMS-SKN) — The sixth segment of play in the 26th edition of Constituency Number Seven Dr the Hon Timothy Harris Domino League on Thursday evening October 14 saw defending champion team Tabernacle Domino Club suffer an upset defeat at home at the hands of Molineux Domino Club.

The game had started at the Tabernacle Community Centre but a village-wide power blackout at 9:07 p.m. interrupted the games that were taking place at the venue. However since the adjacent Tabernacle Police Station had a generator the teams moved under the canopy of the Forensic Department of the Royal St. Christopher and Nevis Police Force.

While losing a game is always taken in a sportsmanship manner the loss at home could not have come at a worse time for the champion team as watching the game was sponsor of the league and fellow villager Dr the Hon Timothy Harris Prime Minister of the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis.

Tabernacle which was under the command of acting Captain Lionel ‘Nabal’ Nisbett started on a high note by winning the opening game and were at one time leading 9-3. After they moved to the new venue Molineux’s Captain Ericson ‘Wixie’ Wescott upped his game and by the time Prime Minister Harris was watching the game at the new venue Molineux were trailing 8-10.

A keenly fought see-saw battle ensured and at one time Tabernacle was leading 11-9 needing only two games to carry the day but a determined Molineux pushed the games to tie at 12-12. After coming that far Molineux could not entertain any loss and by taking control they took the final game to beat Tabernacle 13-12.

The second game at the same two venues between Christ Church Domino Club and Saddlers Domino Club which was also watched by sponsor of the league Prime Minister Dr the Hon Timothy Harris had the two teams exchanging lead. Saddlers led in early stages Christ Church took over and was on the path to victory but Saddlers came back stronger to tie the game at 12-12. Saddlers a team from Constituency Number Six took the deciding game for a 13-12 win over Christ Church.

In other games former champion team Lodge Domino Club went for a kill when at the Edgar Gilbert Sporting Complex pavilion in Molineux they overrun Phillips Domino Club 13-2. At the same venue another former champion team Parsons Domino Club beat Mansion Domino Club 13-10.

Three games took place in Lodge Project where another former champion team Unity Domino Club beat Guinness Domino Club 13-8 and Sylvers Domino Club beat Ottley’s Domino Club 13-9 in games played at the old Lodge Community Centre. At the neighbouring Cuban Bar Unstoppable Domino Club won their second straight game by beating Small Corner Bar Domino Club 13-10.

At the end of the sixth segment of play in the 26th edition of Constituency Number Seven Dr the Hon Timothy Harris Domino League former champion team Unity still leads on the points standing table with 29 points. It is followed by Sylvers 24 points; Lodge 20 Points Christ Church 20 points and Saddlers 20 points.

Others in order are defending champion team Tabernacle 18 points Parsons 18 points Phillips 18 points Molineux 15 points Mansion 14 points Small Corner Bar 11 points Guinness 11 points Unstoppable 11 points and Ottley’s 10 points.

Bari Weiss says her publication on Substack Common Sense is meant to be “the newspaper for the 21st century ultimately. I’m starting it out as the op-ed page that I want to read.”

One year after quitting The New York Times Weiss has not drifted off into obscurity as detractors hoped she would. Quite the opposite: She has amassed more than 100000 subscribers including enough paying supporters to hire a staff. “I’ve made a lot more money than I ever thought was possible in journalism” she remarked to me “but I’m making less because I’ve hired four about to be five people So I’m reinvesting all of it because I really really really believe in this model.”

I recently interviewed Weiss about her business model; about free speech; and “woke orthodoxy.” The full interview is now up on the “Reliable Sources” podcast and it will be featured on air at CNN Sunday morning.

Listen to the podcast here:

In her pitch for Common Sense Weiss wrote “There are tens of millions of Americans who aren’t on the hard left or the hard right who feel that the world has gone mad.” So how has the world gone mad? That’s one of the first things I asked her.

The ‘self-censorship’ problem

“Thought crimes” are top of mind for Weiss. Her concerns have to do with “self-censorship” triggered by small but vocal groups and powerful but cowardly leaders. “You and I both know and it would be delusional to claim otherwise” she said “that touching your finger to an increasing number of subjects that have been deemed ‘third rail’ by the mainstream institutions and increasingly by some of the tech companies will lead to reputational damage; perhaps you losing your job; your children sometimes being demonized as well. And so what happens is a kind of internal self-censorship.” Here are four of her key points:

–“What’s going on is the transformation of this sense-making institutions of American life. It’s the news media. It’s the publishing houses. It’s the Hollywood studios. It’s our universities. And they are narrowing in a radical way what’s acceptable to say and what isn’t. And you and I both know there doesn’t need to be an edict from the C-suite in order for people to feel that. All they need is to watch an example.”

– “As we have learned from the Trump administration institutions are just people. Institutions are just people. And so if an institution – whose job it is to uphold let’s say liberalism broadly defined – decides not to do that anymore why should it be a surprise then that that institution becomes illiberal?”

– Leadership is key: “All of this would change if the people that are charged with upholding you know the mission of these institutions which took decades and decades sometimes longer than that to build stood up and said ‘No.’ Stood up and said ‘if you think an op-ed literally causes violence maybe journalism isn’t the right career for you.’ Until we see that happen I think we’re going to continue to see a lot of these institutions hemorrhaging the people who don’t fall in line with the new woke orthodoxy.”

– “Let’s note the fact that there is a chasm right now between what people are willing to say in their kitchen tables in the comfort and the trust of their most loved ones their family – and then what they’re willing to say on Twitter. Oftentimes it’s literally two different personas. Or at least that’s what I’ve found. I’m trying to say ‘No. Let’s have those private conversations in public.’ The only way that the culture changes is if we have the courage and the bravery to do that and to show people that you can do it and you can survive and not just survive you can thrive. And I’ve never felt freer or more excited about my work than I do right now.”

DHI,DR Horton,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZXZhbnN0b25yb3VuZHRhYmxlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzE2L2Rpc3RyaWN0LTY1LXRlYWNoZXItY29tcGxhaW50cy1tZWV0aW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,District 65 teacher protest: Educators list problems superintendent offers response,"Last Monday night’s downpour did not deter around 50 educators from making their voices heard at the meeting of Evanston/Skokie School District 65’s Personnel Building & Grounds and Finance Committee.

District 65 Educators’ Council (DEC) President Maria Barroso served as the group’s spokesperson Oct. 11 as she did at the Sept. 27 Board meeting beginning her allotted three minutes with: “I am Maria Barroso the DEC President. Again I am here to state that District 65 continues to be a toxic working environment.”

Chief among the grievances that she shared were increased workloads related to curriculum changes educators feeling micromanaged and an increase in discipline issues at school.

As the timer chimed Barroso closed her statement with “On the surface our existence is only useful at times. And we are with the students all the time.” Thunderous applause from the gathered educators and shouts of encouragement ensued as the teachers collected their signs and exited the meeting.

The RoundTable followed up with Barroso on Tuesday to learn more about the ongoing conflict and what DEC hopes to achieve with its presentations before the Board. “We’re trying to gain the respect that they need to have for us in order to be able to advocate for our working conditions to be doable bearable” she said.

Barroso said she felt that decisions are being made for educators without consulting them or seeking to hear their voices.

District’s curriculum audit

The recent curriculum review conducted by Curriculum Management Solutions (CMSI) and the subsequent changes to the curriculum are a prime example according to Barroso.

At the Sept. 27 Board meeting Dr. Jim Ferrel from CMSI presented an update noting that it is a curriculum deficit audit and hence “on the surface it’s going to look bad because we’re going to say ‘Compared to best practices this is where you’re lacking.’”

A clearly defined written curriculum emerged as one of five focus areas (with vision and accountability consistency and equity feedback and productivity the other four) based on “a review of documents policies and protocols classroom visits interviews and survey responses from 265 teachers 670 parents and 27 campus administrations.”

However Barroso pointed out the audit was performed in the spring essentially in the thick of the pandemic when some classes were hybrid and some were remote. Thus a true traditional school year was not observed. According to Barroso “The validity of that data collection is questioned a lot because I don’t know if the directions were clear to principals and to everybody what was supposed to be submitted.”

In addition Barroso said that educators did not have a seat at the decision-making table as curriculum plans were finalized over the summer and shared with administrators who then “told us educators over the summer this is what we have to do.”

In accordance with established Board meeting protocol no immediate response was made to Barroso’s comments at the meeting. But in a statement released Thursday Superintendent Devon Horton said the curriculum and instruction analysis was “conducted by a well-respected research-driven curriculum audit organization” and “We have a window of opportunity here with the pandemic as a catalyst to redesign and organize so that we can lead systemic change.”

Dr. Horton acknowledged the adjustment can be difficult but that each stakeholder has a major responsibility to address the instructional system. He added that the “processes that DEC leadership have publicly expressed concerns about are all a part of our efforts to disrupt the systemic racism that has prevented positive outcomes for all students.”

In her comments to the RoundTable Barroso said that Evanston is an amazing community and she is thankful for the education that her daughters received in the District but added that they were in school “during a time where the educators weren’t so micromanaged.” Although she supports the goal of achieving equity in the level of rigor across all District schools Barroso cautions against the nationwide trend toward excessive student assessments rather than the development of “critical thinkers and happy humans that contribute to society.”

In his statement Horton wrote that instructional materials are designed for a “typical” classroom that in reality does not exist and that “lessons need to be adapted to meet the needs of an educator’s classroom who may have emergent bilinguals students with IEPs [Individualized Educational Plans] and 504s [accommodation plans] students who have significant unfinished learning from last year and/or students well above grade level.” He said that educators have to adapt based on the needs of their students which “is the opposite of micromanaging and forcing a scripted curriculum.”

Managing school conflicts

On Monday night Barroso commented on an increase in learning environment disruptions and later told the RoundTable that “there definitely is no restorative practice when an educator and a student have had a conflict. And that needs to happen.”

Barroso said she felt that the anti-bullying initiatives though welcome are ironic given that “many of my educators feel like they’re bullied themselves with having to do the work having to do the extra work and not feeling like they have a voice.”

In his statement Horton said the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program was implemented this year to adopt a more holistic approach districtwise. In addition he wrote that last year’s Restorative Practices program rollout was impeded by the pandemic and added “In full transparency it was not implemented with fidelity and is still an area of focus and growth in the District.”

Horton added that the “District recognizes that time is of the essence in making sure that all schools have educators that are confident and empowered to fully support students through Restorative Practices. The District is addressing the concern expeditiously.”

In her conversation with the RoundTable Barroso said that there is a growing trend of educators leaving District 65 or planning to do so despite their family connections to the community or their many years of teaching in the District. According to her the Board has to acknowledge that educators “need to be able to enjoy coming to work and not being so overworked that they lose the passion and the inspiration to want to continue because they’re so overworked.” The loss of long-term educators is particularly detrimental she warned as they play an important role in mentoring new educators.

Calls for dialogue

Acknowledging that the Board manages a single employee the Superintendent who in turn manages all other District employees Barroso said “We’ve had Board people in the past that have been much more teacher-friendly.”

She invited the Board to have an open discussion with DEC executives and said that in the aftermath of her speech at the Sept. 27 meeting “only one person reached out. But I don’t want to talk to just one I want to talk to the collective.”

Horton’s statement included a list of meeting opportunities that are available to DEC representatives and said that the DEC president has rejected invitations to attend the six “Collaborative Calibration Visits” with school principals that have occurred thus far this year.

Extending an invitation to work together Horton closed his statement by writing “Ultimately all groups are working towards one goal and that is to provide the best learning environments and opportunities for all students. Across the district there are compassionate educators administrators parents/caregivers and community members that will continue to do their best for our students. Psychologist Bruce Tuckman described how teams move through these stages as forming storming norming and performing. Our district development is no different. We are looking forward to collectively getting to the norm and performing our greatest efforts together as a team. Looking forward to building that bridge together.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9rZW5vc2hhbmV3cy9uYW1lL3JvYmVydC1ob3J0b24tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzA1NDMzNDTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Horton Obituary (1941 - 2021) - Twin Lakes WI - Kenosha News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/kenoshanews/name/robert-horton-obituary?id=30543344 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9rZW5vc2hhbmV3cy9uYW1lL3JvYmVydC1ob3J0b24tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzA1NDMzNDTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Thanks to an unexpected “Giving Tuesday” gift of $50000 from the Duke Energy Foundation the North Carolina Aquarium on Roanoke Island was able to complete a planned recoating of the aquarium’s saltwater mixing basins more quickly than expected.

While it might not be common knowledge many aquariums must mix – or “create” – salt water to maintain optimum water quality for their marine environments – even those that sit on the edge of the ocean or a sound like the aquarium on Roanoke Island. Mixing salt which is specially formulated for use in aquariums along with filtered fresh water offers significant benefits for animal health and well-being according to a press release from NCARI.

At the Roanoke Island aquarium the specialized salt and fresh water are mixed in large 10000-gallon saltwater mixing basins that have extensive plumbing systems designed to help mix the salt water and distribute it to the various marine exhibits throughout the aquarium. “Although it is often laborious it is a ‘labor of love’ by the dedicated husbandry staff that meticulously ensure the quality of the salt water is ideal for all the aquarium’s marine inhabitants” stated the release.

NCARI’s saltwater mixing basins have recently been showing signs of needing a recoat and while it was on the list of improvements to happen other necessary infrastructure repairs and upgrades were ahead of it in priority.

The donation made in November 2020 by the Duke Energy Foundation the corporate foundation for Duke Energy and Piedmont Natural Gas looking for opportunities to assist high-impact nonprofits enjoyed by guests from across North Carolina which led to a call to the North Carolina Aquarium on Roanoke Island. The grant allowed the aquarium to move forward with the recoating of the saltwater mixing basins.

“It’s rare that a donation is made without specific requirements to the use of the funding and the donor lets the nonprofit decide how funds can best be used” said Larry Warner aquarium director. “We were so grateful to the Duke Energy Foundation for surprising us with this donation that will allow us to continue providing beautiful and healthy habitats.”

Recoating the salt pits was no little task. Before work could begin unique temporary plumbing re-routes had to be set up to accommodate this process. “An outside vendor worked tirelessly for almost four weeks to pressure wash decades of old salt deposits stripping the walls down to bare concrete” stated the release. “They then resurfaced and recoated all the walls with fresh coatings to help support continued excellence in water conditions for another 20 years and beyond!”

“North Carolina is home to many natural resources and ecological treasures thoughtfully featured by the North Carolina Aquarium on Roanoke Island” said Katherine Neebe Duke Energy’s chief sustainability officer and president Duke Energy Foundation. “Protecting and enhancing the biodiversity of our state is a focus of the Duke Energy Foundation.

For the first time in over 10 months the stock market is showing signs of fatigue.

In a roughly one-month stretch from early September to early October the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.16%) shed about 5% of its value. It's a drop in the bucket compared to the index's gains since the March 2020 bear-market bottom but it's a potentially stern reminder that a stock market crash or double-digit correction could be around the corner.

Fundamentally speaking a crash or correction appears likely

To be clear it's impossible to predict with any long-term accuracy when a crash will occur how long it'll last or how steep the decline will be. But given the frequency of moves lower in the market throughout history warning flags should be raised.

Fundamentally speaking there is a trio of worrying metrics. First margin debt has soared in 2021. Margin debt describes the amount of money borrowed with interest to purchase or short-sell securities. According to data from market analytics company Yardeni Research there have been only three instances since the beginning of 1995 where margin debt jumped 60% or more in a single year. The previous two instances occurred right before the dot-com bubble burst and months before the financial crisis that caused the Great Recession.

Second inflation is picking up in a big way. Crude oil settled at its highest close in seven years this past week while the core Consumer Price Index which excludes food and energy surged by its highest rate in about three decades. While some level of inflation is positive for a growing economy high rates of inflation can stifle consumer spending and bring economic growth to a halt.

And third S&P 500 valuations are stretched. As of Oct. 12 the S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stood at 37.6. The Shiller P/E takes into account inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. What's concerning from a valuation perspective is that in the previous four instances where the S&P 500 has surpassed a Shiller P/E of 30 it's eventually gone on to lose at least 20% of its value.

History says we could be headed for trouble too. Following each of the previous eight bear-market bottoms dating back to 1960 the S&P 500 has undergone either one or two declines of at least 10% within three years. In other words bouncing back from a 20% or greater drop in the broader market is a process that takes time. The fact that the market has gone almost straight up doesn't jibe with history.

Buy these safe stocks in the event of a stock market crash

While the idea of a stock market crash or even an orderly double-digit correction might not be palatable to some investors it's important to recognize one key fact: All crashes and corrections are buying opportunities for patient investors. Every single notable move lower in the S&P 500 has eventually been erased by a bull-market rally.

But going on the offensive during a big move lower in the market doesn't mean you have to buy stakes in volatile companies. If a stock market crash or steep correction does occur the following three companies are some of the safest stocks you can buy and still profit from the recovery.

Duke Energy

Sometimes boring companies are the perfect place to put your money to work during periods of heightened volatility. Electric utility stock Duke Energy (DUK -0.34%) which is substantially less volatile than the benchmark S&P 500 is one example of a very safe stock long-term investors can buy if a crash rears its head.

The great thing about electric utilities is that they provide a basic need service. No matter how well or poorly the U.S. economy or stock market are performing homeowners and renters need electricity or natural gas. With the understanding that demand for electricity and natural gas doesn't change much from one year to next for existing households and businesses Duke Energy is able to outlay capital for new projects without having to worry about a negative effect on earnings or its market-topping dividend which is currently yielding 4%.

What's exciting for Duke and its shareholders is just how much capital the company is putting to work in new infrastructure projects. In particular most of the $60 billion the company aims to spend between 2020 and 2024 will go toward renewable energy solutions. Although investing in wind and solar isn't cheap it does dramatically lower long-term electricity generation costs. As a result Duke Energy expects its compound annual growth rate to climb to between 5% and 7%. For some context most electric utilities grow by a low single-digit percentage.

Duke Energy is far from flashy but its high yield and predictability of cash flow should help conservative investors build wealth over time.

Johnson & Johnson

Another extremely safe stock that can be confidently bought by investors during a stock market crash or correction is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 0.04%). Similar to Duke Energy J&J is less volatile than the broader market and it too pays a superior dividend (2.7% yield). In fact Johnson & Johnson has raised its base annual payout for 59 consecutive years.

Healthcare stocks like J&J are highly defensive. Since we don't get to decide when we get sick or what ailment(s) we develop the demand for pharmaceuticals medical devices and healthcare services tends to remain constant no matter what's going on with the U.S. economy or stock market. This is a big reason why J&J once had a streak of more than 35 consecutive years with adjusted operating earnings growth.

What really makes Johnson & Johnson tick are its three operating segments -- consumer health products medical devices and pharmaceuticals -- each of which brings something important to the table. Consumer health is the slowest-growing but it provides predictable cash flow and generally strong pricing power. Meanwhile medical devices is perfectly positioned to take advantage of an aging U.S. and global population. Lastly pharmaceuticals have a finite period of exclusivity but brand-name drugs are responsible for much of J&J's growth and operating margin.

The icing on the cake with J&J is that it's one of only two publicly traded companies with the coveted AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor's. That's a higher credit rating than the U.S. government.

Alphabet

Just to mix things up a third and final safe stock investors can buy if the market crashes or steeply corrects is high-growth tech stock Alphabet (GOOGL -0.77%) (GOOG -0.75%). Alphabet the company behind the Google internet search engine and streaming content platform YouTube is right on par with the broader market's volatility and is likely to be buoyed by its nearly $108 billion net cash position.

Alphabet's foundational business has long been its Google search engine which defines dominance. According to GlobalStats Google has maintained between 91% and 93% of global internet search share for the trailing two-year period. This makes it the go-to platform for advertisers which are more than willing to pay big bucks for prime placement on search pages.

The company is also generating sustainable double-digit growth from YouTube and Google Cloud. YouTube has become one of the most visited social sites in the world while Cloud has clawed its way to the global No. 3 in cloud infrastructure service spending. Cloud in particular should generate beefier margins than ads which makes it a key driver of operating cash flow for the future.

Ultimately Alphabet is a company that benefits from long-winded periods of expansion. Any dip is the perfect opportunity for patient investors to pounce.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpbGxhZ2VzLW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTYvdGVlbi1saXZpbmctaW4tdGhlLXZpbGxhZ2VzLWFycmVzdGVkLWFzLWFsYWJhbWEtZnVnaXRpdmUtZnJvbS1qdXN0aWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Teen living in The Villages arrested as Alabama fugitive from justice,"A 19-year-old living in The Villages has been booked without bond at the Sumter County Detention Center after he was arrested as a fugitive from justice in Alabama.

Aden Willis Yeager was booked at about 4:30 p.m. Friday at the jail.

He had been arrested this past November in Tuscaloosa Ala. on a number of sexual extortion charges all involving five minors under the age of 17. The arrest was made after investigators with the West Alabama Human Trafficking Task Force served a search warrant at a home there.

“The initial charges come from a very short extraction of an electronic device that belonged to the suspect. At the current time all of the victims identified are out-of-state residents” the task force said in a news release issued at the time of Yeager’s arrest.

Officers with the University of Alabama Police Department’s criminal investigation division and the UA Joint Electronics Crimes Task Force assisted in the case.

His bond in Alabama had initially been set at $375000.",,,

As fall begins to settle over DC there’s no better way to spend a beautiful warm weekend morning than at one of the many flea and farmers markets around the city. My personal heaven is digging through racks of vintage clothing at the Georgetown Flea Market and greeting every dog I see while their owners shop. Vendors offer a little bit of everything from handmade resin jewelry to freshly pressed apple cider. Everyone is bound to return home with a treasure. Grab a friend and go find yourself something fun or simply enjoy the ambiance! Here are some of the best most accessible markets DC has to offer.

1. Georgetown Flea Market

The Georgetown Flea Market is my favorite for many reasons- it’s a 20-minute walk from American’s campus the perfect size for an hour of happy meandering and boasts a wide variety of items. It’s self-described as a market for antiques vintage collectibles and local handmade creations. You can wander down tables of old books cases of funky jewelry and find countless crafters with unique creations like a resin claw clip with dried flowers that I bought from ArteparaVivir Design.

My roommate found a bunch of cozy sweatshirts and fun oversized t-shirts- with her favorite repping a picture of Speedy Gonzales. Make sure to check out the vendors scattered along the sidewalk too! I found the sidewalk to have the best selection of vintage clothes and artwork. Many artists lay their paintings and posters out on the grass to wander through. My roommate and I got funky handmade clay pins from a woman selling artwork at a sidewalk table. The Georgetown Flea Market is my new go-to lazy Sunday adventure.



Sundays 8-4 1819 35th St. NW Washington DC

2. Dupont Little Flea Market

If you’re looking for some food and music along with your shopping the Dupont Little Flea Market is for you. Sprawling down 19th and Q this market offers an array of vintage and handmade goods against a backdrop of local restaurants and shops. Stroll through booths of fragrant soaps art prints and pretty terrariums while music from The Little Tiny Concert Series playing every Sunday at noon floats down the street. The vendors are incredibly friendly and take so much pride in their work. One of my favorites was a photographer selling framed photos of DC protests to keep their energy alive.

My favorite find was a fun pair of earrings made from recycled fabric that I’ll be wearing to a festival and my roommate snagged a cool glass terrarium to decorate her windowsill for only $10. You can easily spend hours exploring a little bit of everything at the Dupont Little Flea. Make a day of it like we did and stop by the Dupont Circle Farmers Market for lunch!



Sundays 10-3 at the corner of 19th and Q Streets NW Washington DC

3. Flea Market at Eastern Market

Once voted one of the best flea markets in the world The Flea Market at Eastern Market is arguably the most frequented and diverse market in DC. It’s well established and hosts an impressive group of vendors from five continents ranging from an Egyptian glass blower to a Peruvian alpaca shawl-maker. Along with imported goods you’ll find vintage clothing pottery jewelry furniture and tons of gorgeous locally-made items. The freshly baked Peruvian empanadas at Alexa’s Empanadas alone are worth the trip! The Flea Market at Eastern Market is the perfect place to find a one-of-a-kind gift or unique token for yourself and you can support global artists in the process. It’s become so popular that it just expanded to Saturdays and Sundays. Go see for yourself what all the hype is about!



Saturdays and Sundays 9-4 7th and C Street SE Washington DC

Farmers Markets

1. Dupont Circle Farmers Market

Just steps away from the Dupont Little Flea is the massive year-round Dupont Circle Farmers Market. Whatever fresh produce you need they’ve got it. Over 50 farmers set up shop covering tables with peaches jars of pickles stacks of baked goods and bouquets of vibrant flowers. Half the fun of this market is just walking around and taking in all the smells and colors.

You can find all the traditional farmers’ market foods like fruits and vegetables meat eggs cheese and jars of delicious things like jam as well as plants soaps and prepared meals. Local comfort food joint Puddin’ attracts crowds with its famous namesake dish Brown Butter Bourbon Bread Puddin’. If that isn’t enough to entice you Dupont Circle Farmers Market is dedicated to reducing food waste and making fresh nutritious food more accessible (check out their Fresh Match Pop Up Food Hub and Gleaning programs). Whether you’re looking to shop regularly for produce or to enjoy an occasional locally sourced lunch Dupont is the epitome of farmers’ market dreams.



Sundays 8:30-1:30 1624 20th St NW Washington DC

2. Mount Pleasant Farmers Market

Small but mighty the Mount Pleasant Farmers Market lies on a tiny community park overflowing with the best produce and handmade goods of the season. On a fall day locals come out to pack bags of apples pick out pumpkins and eat the quintessential fall pairing cider and donuts. At Reid’s Orchard I got a bag of apples and a “spooky” pumpkin which I’m told can be eaten in many recipes (I’ll be testing it for myself). You wouldn’t think popsicles could make the transition to fall but Jarabe Gourmet Pops had the tastiest and prettiest orange and lemon fall-inspired popsicles. This market also had a surprisingly diverse spread of meal options and other goods. Mapp’d Global Foods makes food from around the world like their Kenyan Inspired Vegan Lentil Curry. At Ozz Café a Turkish food cart I bought a gorgeous painted bowl made in Turkey. Along with this market’s great selection of items I really enjoyed how friendly and community-oriented it felt. Many vendors knew regular customers by name and made an effort to welcome you. This is one you can’t pass up!



Saturdays 9-1 3210 Mount Pleasant St. NW Washington DC

3. Palisades Farmers Market

I’m convinced you could eat every meal at Palisades Farmers Market. Its vendors cater to seemingly every food imaginable with tons of fruit and vegetable stands a variety of meats cheeses cream cheese eggs oils spices…the list goes on. As a sugar fiend I loved how many baked goods and dessert options there were. You can find everything from bread and pastries to pie and gelato here. My morning was made when I visited Les Caprices de Joelle and got a crepe! If you don’t eat sweet things for lunch like I do this market also offers savory prepared food like Chinese dumplings from The Chinese Street Market DC and empanadas from the House of Empanadas. I was also impressed by how many plants and cut flowers there were to choose from. I picked a bouquet of red orange and yellow zinnias to brighten up my apartment!

Palisades Farmers Market has a little bit of everything and deserves multiple visits. For a cheap and delicious brunch get a baked good (good luck choosing just one) and coffee at Zeke’s Coffee of DC.

From a tornado that devastated parts of South Jersey to severe flooding in Pennsylvania the damage was widespread throughout our region.

With so much rain falling across the headwaters of the Brandywine River which ends in Wilmington some residents living along the water had to be rescued from their homes after surging water overflowed the banks.

Many businesses were also devastated. Further upstream in the city the Hagley Museum and Library saw significant damage.

“It was so loud. You know the water was just like one big waterfall in the powder yard” said Jill MacKenzie Hagley’s executive director.

The powder yard is the area right along the Brandywine which used water-powered mills to grind gunpowder for the DuPont company more than 200 years ago. Company founder Éleuthère Irénée du Pont diverted part of the river to run through what are called “mill races” that turn the gears for grinding. Hagley offers tours of the mills and support buildings to demonstrate the history of the du Pont family and the company they founded at the site in 1802.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdW5kZWFkd2Fsa2luZy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8xNy90aW1lLWZlYXItd2Fsa2luZy1kZWFkLWFpci1hbWMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What time does Fear the Walking Dead air on AMC?,Next.

Tokyo Smoke opened its doors at the Eaton Centre on Saturday just one of nine stores it plans to open in partnership with commercial real estate giant Cadillac Fairview.

Fairview Mall and Sherway Gardens will also be home to a location while Ottawa shoppers will have a storefront at the Rideau Centre.

Tokyo Smoke officials say they hope to be able to reach a new demographic through the stores offering legal recreational cannabis accessories and products including beverages edibles and oils.

“This is a unique opportunity to provide a new audience with access to legal cannabis and provide education to current consumers and those who may be curious about cannabis or have questions” said Ryan Alves store manager at Tokyo Smoke CF Toronto Eaton Centre.

A spokesperson for Cadillac Fairview calls the partnership a win and a major step for the industry signalling that the stigma previously associated with cannabis continues to dissipate.

The problem when it comes to electronics timepieces and a wide range of items is that the ability for eBay to authenticate each item does not match the massive scale — and it will likely never be able to.

Anecdotally I purchased a pair of Apple AirPods on eBay last year and after learning that they were fake and notifying eBay about what the seller was doing along with numerous public comments from other buyers saying the same thing eBay did nothing to the seller. Nothing.

This is beyond wrong. Ultimately I was refunded my money only after I returned the worthless fake Apple Airpods at my own cost. I lost less than $10 but should have lost nothing. EBay protected the seller despite being a blatant seller of fake Apple merchandise to numerous unexpecting buyers.

The seller’s account name has since been changed and the messages with eBay and the buyer have vanished but the person is still selling electronics on eBay using the same account.

Surely not every case is managed so poorly by eBay but how could something so easily verifiable slip through the cracks? Again the massive scale prevents the company from actually servicing the entire ecosystem to the level that’s required — especially in the luxury watch space.

I’d love to trust eBay again but would never sell a valuable watch — with or without authentication — on the site as it currently operates today. It’s not to say you should not just that you should be very careful when doing so and always consider the significant fees which vary depending on the product category and final sales amount (watch selling rates are higher than most other product categories on eBay).

At least you can now use payments systems other than Paypal and therefore avoid a transaction fee of approximately 3%.

Nearly three decades after soccer's global governing body licensed its name to a California video game maker looking to expand its offerings the Fifa series that was born out of that partnership has become not so much a game as a cultural phenomenon.

To millions of people around the world the letters Fifa now represent not actual soccer but instead a one-word shorthand for the hugely popular video game series that has become a fixture in the lives of players as diverse as Premier League pros casual fans and even gamers with no other relationship to the sport.

Sales of the game which releases an updated edition every year have surpassed US$20 billion (S$27 billion) over the past two decades for its California-based maker Electronic Arts (EA). But Fifa has cashed in as well: Its licensing agreement has grown to become the organisation's single-most valuable commercial agreement now worth about US$150 million per year.

And now all of that money is at risk.

At least two years of talks about renewing the contract that allows EA through its EA Sports division to use the organisation's name have hit the wall according to multiple people close to the negotiations. The possibility of a permanent break after next year's World Cup in Qatar - when the current 10-year agreement ends - was made explicit in a letter released last week by Mr Cam Weber executive president and general manager of EA Sports.

In it Mr Weber raised the unthinkable: Fifa without Fifa.

""As we look ahead"" Mr Weber wrote in discussing the future of the series ""we're also exploring the idea of renaming our global EA Sports football games.""

The core of the dispute is financial. Fifa is seeking more than double what it currently receives from EA Sports according to people with knowledge of the talks a figure that would increase its payout from the series to more than US$1 billion for each four-year World Cup cycle.

The dispute is not just about money though. The talks have also stalled because Fifa and EA cannot agree what the gamer's exclusive rights should include.

Fifa would prefer to limit EA's exclusivity to the narrow parameters around use in a soccer game most likely in an effort to seek new revenue streams for the rights it would retain. EA Sports meanwhile contends the company should be allowed to explore other ventures within its Fifa video game ecosystem including highlights of actual games arena video game tournaments and digital products like non-fungible tokens.

A decision is likely by the end of the year but EA officials are already planning for a post-Fifa future. Earlier this month the company registered two trademarks one in the European Union and the other in Britain for the phrase EA Sports FC.

Both Fifa and EA Sports declined to comment publicly on the talks. But the dispute has surprised industry watchers including Mr Peter Moore who held senior roles at EA for a decade before leaving in 2017 to become the chief executive of Premier League team Liverpool. Mr Moore is now a senior executive at Unity Technologies a video game software company.

""I don't recall them ever putting out a statement saying we're in negotiations on a renewal of the licence"" Mr Moore said in a telephone interview. ""That's clearly sending a little bit of a signal.""

Part of EA's calculation is that - even if it is forced to rebrand one of the most popular video franchises of all time - it is unlikely any competitor can challenge its market dominance. EA's position has grown to almost complete control over the soccer gaming industry thanks to more than 300 other similar licensing agreements with organisations like Uefa which runs the Champions League and domestic leagues and competitions around the world.

Those deals allow EA to use the names and likeness of players world-famous club teams and prominent leagues in its game. Last Tuesday EA renewed one such deal with FIFPro the global players union.",,,,,,

At the end of the summer Steve Johnson became one of the legions of Americans curious about a new weight-loss drug called Wegovy (semaglutide). The medical device salesperson had been fasting intermittently and was exercising more but the roughly 60 lb (27 kg) he wanted to lose weren’t coming off.

In brief Weight-loss drugs have long had safety and efficacy issues but the improved performance and projected profits of treatments like liraglutide and semaglutide have pushed pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to revisit the field. Drug pipelines are filling up with new molecules that aim to help people shed—and keep off—more weight often by mimicking natural hormones that regulate metabolism. That increased investment in weight-loss drugs comes as industry academia medicine and government increasingly view being fat as a chronic disease that warrants long-term treatment. But critics say the pharmaceutical industry is pathologizing weight to sell treatments and stigmatizing people who have every right to exist as they are.

He researched Novo Nordisk’s data for the drug was impressed by the average 15% weight loss seen in clinical trial participants and in August called his doctor.

The once-weekly shot of Wegovy might be the boost he needs he told his physician. That is if he could get his hands on it.

“It’s been back-ordered” Johnson says. “At first it was a couple of weeks and then they drew it out and then I heard the end of September.”

Novo Nordisk was unprepared for the demand for Wegovy which the US Food and Drug Administration approved in early June. Social media groups are filled with people sharing tips on places that have doses in stock and people lamenting when they can’t find the drug. Company officials say it might take until the end of the year to clear the backlog.

Many industry government and academic scientists who study metabolism and appetite say the clamor for Wegovy demonstrates the need for safer and more-effective weight-loss drugs. In a field plagued by drugs with dangerous side effects and product recalls doctors have been hesitant to prescribe these products—and companies have been nervous about investing in developing new ones. The emergence of Wegovy and a handful of other drugs over the past few years coincides with a shift in the medical complex's and pharmaceutical industry’s description of people who have obesity a controversial word that is defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as anyone with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. In the past obesity was framed as a behavioral issue. Today it is seen by many as a chronic disease that because of links to other conditions like diabetes heart disease and high blood pressure warrants continuous treatment.

“The problem with obesity is that it’s a chronic illness and that it’s relapsing” says John Sharretts an endocrinologist who is the deputy director of the FDA’s Division of Diabetes Lipid Disorders and Obesity. “People lose weight and they regain and it’s complicated. The goal of weight loss is the long-term reduction of excess fat with the purpose of reducing those health consequences.”

Wegovy is one of five drugs on the market for what US regulators call “chronic weight management.” Pharma companies’ pipelines once devoid of anything related to weight loss are now flush with drug candidates.

“It’s actually quite interesting to watch the field slowly go back into the obesity area which was clearly for quite a few years a no-go zone particularly with Big Pharma” says Philipp Scherer a metabolism scientist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

The financial potential of a safe and effective weight-loss drug is staggering. About 42% of people in the US meet the CDC’s definition of obesity. And people with lower BMIs who have metabolic diseases are eligible for either Wegovy or a shorter-acting version of the drug called Saxenda (liraglutide) that was approved in 2014. Chronic weight management means years if not decades of treatment. Saxenda which is taken daily and typically offers more modest weight loss brought in more than $900 million in sales in 2020.

But this surge in development runs counter to another shift—one that says being fat is not a disease. A 2016 study from the University of California Los Angeles suggests that 29% of people who are medically defined as obese are otherwise metabolically healthy. Ragen Chastain a public speaker and writer on the subjects of fat discrimination and the pathologizing of weight says fat is a normal state of being and that calling it a disease is stigmatizing.

“This has become something that’s driven tremendous profit. In terms of what it’s done for the community—people who have been labeled—it’s driven stigma oppression” she says.

Decades of imperfect pills

The history of weight-loss drug development is a tumultuous one. From its earliest days products have been marred by side effects ranging from high blood pressure to death.

The problems started in the 1930s when 24-dinitrophenol (DNP) became one of the first chemicals used for weight loss. DNP is a mitochondrial uncoupler that works by interfering with the reactions that create and store energy in our bodies. With no place to go the energy is released as heat leading to weight loss.

You have one drug that goes off the market for whatever reason and it really shuts down for like a good decade any further pharmaceutical development. Nadia Ahmad medical director for obesity product development Eli Lilly and Company

It can also lead to uncontrolled increases in body temperature and the drug has never been approved by modern-day regulatory authorities. People can still buy DNP on the internet though and between 2001 and 2010 a dozen people died after taking it including a 28-year-old man using the drug as a bodybuilding tool. His internal body temperature peaked at 106 °F (41 °C).

In the 1960s FDA-approved weight-loss drugs were all derivatives of amphetamine which suppresses appetite. One of those pills phentermine is still widely prescribed says physician Daniel Bessesen a researcher at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. People taking phentermine on average lose between 5 and 10% of their starting weight. For people whose insurance won’t cover drugs like Wegovy it’s the best available option Bessesen says.

But this class of drugs can be addictive and cause dangerously high blood pressure so the drugs can be taken for only a few weeks at a time.

The 1970s and 1980s were a long dry spell for new weight-loss drugs. That ended in 1996 when the FDA approved dexfenfluramine as a stronger version of the previously approved weight-loss drug fenfluramine. Both drugs were part of a class of appetite suppressants called serotonergic anorectics which work by lowering the amount of serotonin in the brain. Doctors had previously paired phentermine with fenfluramine in an infamous combo dubbed fen-phen.

Then came reports of heart valve damage in people taking fen-phen. In 1997 the FDA pulled fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine off the market marking the beginning of a merry-go-round of regulatory rejections approvals and withdrawals for weight-loss drugs. Meridia (sibutramine) was approved by the FDA in 1997 and then withdrawn from the market in 2010 because of side effects that included an increased risk of heart attack. Rimonabant the first blocker of cannabinoid receptor 1 for weight loss was approved in Europe in 2006 but pulled 2 years later after the drug was linked to thoughts of suicide. Belviq (lorcaserin) a small molecule that stimulates a serotonin receptor was pulled in 2020 after 8 years on the market because it was shown to increase the risk of cancer.

Nadia Ahmad the medical director for Eli Lilly and Company’s obesity product development says this long string of safety issues and product failures is why the field has been considered such a gamble for pharma companies. “You have one drug that goes off the market for whatever reason and it really shuts down for like a good decade any further pharmaceutical development” she says.

The troubled history has necessarily raised the regulatory bar for weight-loss drugs. Today on top of requiring evidence that a new drug can allow someone to maintain a weight loss of 5–10% of their starting weight for a year the FDA also wants to see longer-term studies proving it is safe.

Safety also became more critical as the field shifted from acute to chronic use a transition that began in 1999 with a new drug called Xenical (orlistat). The pill works by blocking fat from being absorbed by the body. While it can cause constant diarrhea for some it was the first of several drugs allowed to be taken long term.

Older weight-loss drugs not only were prone to dangerous side effects but also didn’t work as well as people wanted. Losses were modest—around 5–10%—and people typically regained weight as soon as they stopped taking the drugs. This weight cycling is a source of mental health issues as people internalize the failure of those products Chastain says.

“There is something wrong with an intervention that has the exact opposite of the intended effect the majority of the time” she says. “What the weight-loss industry has done brilliantly is to take credit for the first part of that biological response where people lose weight short term and blame their clients and get their clients to blame themselves for the second part of the same biological response—when they gain the weight back.”

Not repeating history

Companies marketing and developing new drugs think they can overcome those long-standing issues plaguing the field. Part of their confidence comes from the widespread use of their drugs for different diseases. The active compounds in Saxenda and Wegovy for example have been sold under different formulations to treat diabetes since 2010 and 2017 respectively. That means there is a lot of safety information already available on those products the FDA’s Sharretts says. He uses Wegovy as an example: in the years of semaglutide use in people with diabetes safety issues have been minor. To collect more data on the drug’s heart safety Novo Nordisk is testing Wegovy in people who are clinically classified as obese and who have already had a heart attack according to Jason Brett who leads medical affairs for Novo Nordisk’s obesity and diabetes programs.

But the FDA would like more general heart data for weight-loss drugs Sharretts says.

“I think that’s something that the FDA would like to see and I think that the weight-loss community would like to see” he says.

Saxenda and Wegovy are in a class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists which mimic glucagon-like peptide 1 a gastrointestinal hormone that helps regulate glucose. Nearly all GLP-1 agonists approved in the US for diabetes also induce some weight loss. But to date Wegovy has performed the best: in a Phase 3 trial people given Wegovy alongside lifestyle counseling lost about 15% on average of their starting weight compared with about 2.5% weight loss in people given a placebo and counseling.

Some people in the treatment arm lost much more. At the end of the study nearly 35% of the 1059 people who completed the trial lost at least 20% of their body weight—a level no other weight-loss drug has achieved. These numbers motivate Johnson­—he hopes this once-weekly drug will allow him to lose as many pounds as he possibly can.

But about 20% of the people in the treatment arm didn’t finish the trial. About half those folks dropped out because of side effects like nausea vomiting diarrhea and constipation. A smaller group of people reported more serious issues like cardiovascular problems psychiatric issues and gall bladder and liver dysfunction.

The GLP-1 system is one of many metabolic targets that researchers have explored for weight loss. Significant effort has gone into exploiting hormones known to modulate appetite most notably PYY (peptide tyrosine tyrosine) leptin and ghrelin. So far targeting the GLP-1 receptor has been the most effective strategy. Few drugs based off the other targets have made it into clinical trials.

The failures to develop drugs to modulate other hormones reflect the complexity and redundancy of the biochemical signals that control our need to eat says Linda Shapiro the chief medical officer of Rhythm Pharmaceuticals a company that specializes in weight-loss drugs for people who have genetic mutations that cause weight gain. “There’s not one single highway because of course if there was a breakdown in that highway we could all starve to death” she says. “We’re really at the infancy of understanding obesity and certainly understanding genetic obesity.”

Rhythm’s weight-loss drug Imcivree (setmelanotide) is a peptide that modulates the activity of another metabolic target the melanocortin receptor 4. The drug is for people with serious genetic defects in the pathways that signal that a person is full including people with leptin receptor deficiencies. People with these mutations have what amounts to an uncontrollable physiological need to eat because their bodies cannot register that they are full.

Some of the most interesting targets in potential weight-loss drugs are analogs of hormones that act in hunger- and satiety-related metabolic pathways says Indiana University Bloomington chemist Richard DiMarchi a former Lilly researcher who sold his diabetes start-ups to Novo Nordisk. He develops small proteins for weight loss and to treat metabolic diseases.

These proteins include glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) an incretin that like GLP-1 spurs insulin secretion. Another is amylin a satiety hormone missing in some people with diabetes. And Brett says that Novo Nordisk has begun safety studies of a combination of the amylin analog cagrilintide with the highest approved weight-loss dose of semaglutide.

Lilly and Pfizer both have small molecules in development to stimulate the GLP-1 receptor. And a few companies are exploring small-molecule mitochondrial uncouplers despite the health risks of DNP another drug in that class. Josua Jordi CEO of the start-up EraCal Therapeutics which is focusing on weight-loss drugs calls these risks the “dark cloud” of DNP.

And with the popularity of drugs like Wegovy scientists are trying to engineer novel combination peptides that could promise equal or greater weight loss.

There is something wrong with an intervention that has the exact opposite of the intended effect the majority of the time. Ragen Chastain writer and public speaker

Among the most promising DiMarchi and others say is Lilly’s tirzepatide a single molecule that modulates the receptors for two hormones GIP and GLP-1. Lilly’s Ahmad says the peptide appears to affect more than one food-related pathway: in preclinical studies animals given tirzepatide are less hungry and seem to use more energy. “Most of the pharmacological therapies they have all been focused on food-intake reduction. And there hasn’t been a focus on energy expenditure” she says.

Lilly is developing the peptide for both type 2 diabetes and weight loss. Although the company has yet to show late-stage data from its weight-loss trials studies in people with type 2 diabetes suggest that tirzepatide can elicit twice the weight loss as those taking the drug Ozempic the formulation of semaglutide used to treat diabetes. But those results come with the caveat that participants were taking semaglutide doses for diabetes not the much higher dose prescribed for weight loss.

AstraZeneca is also developing a dual-agonist drug for diabetes that industry experts are watching because studies suggest it too spurs weight loss. Called cotadutide the molecule works on both the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors. Lutz Jermutus who leads the team at AstraZeneca focused on metabolic diseases downplays that effect and says the company isn’t looking to turn the drug toward weight loss right away. Instead the company’s focus is on expanding into diseases like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and chronic kidney disease.

Wegovy isn’t the end of the road for Novo Nordisk Brett says. The company is also testing whether its oral version of semaglutide marketed as Rybelsus can cause weight loss and it is heavily invested in combination drugs including semaglutide and an amylin analog. Brett like others says that the burst of activity in the development of weight-loss drugs is promising.

“The future’s bright for drug development I think for new projects and new targets” he says.

In addition at least two start-ups are focusing on weight loss. Rivus Pharmaceuticals is trying to tackle mitochondrial uncoupling safely and effectively. And EraCal is looking for completely new appetite-related pathways to drug.

DiMarchi agrees with Brett. “I think this is going to be one of the greatest successes of the pharmaceutical industry of academics of biotechs” he says of weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and what is coming down the pike. “It was not that long ago when some very respectable informed individuals were telling us this is not achievable that you’re fighting survival mechanisms.”

Shifting the burden

Kerrie Cliett is a housekeeper and gig worker in Tennessee who says that because of her job she is literally climbing stairs all day. She started gaining weight when she started a family lost some of it on one drug and then gained it back. After having her last child she weighed more than she ever had in her life. Her doctor put her on something different over the summer. It didn’t work.

It’s that roller coaster of weight loss and regain that Chastain says is so harmful to people.

Now Cliett is taking Wegovy. She lost 13 lb (5.9 kg) in the first month.

Cliett says that since she’s gained weight she’s felt people are less kind to her than they used to be.

“I’ve said time and time again one of the main motivators for me wanting to lose weight is that people treat you differently. Obviously feeling better and being healthier is a wonderful thing but it’s very difficult when people treat you like a different person” she says.

I think this is going to be one of the greatest successes of the pharmaceutical industry of academics of biotechs. Richard DiMarchi chemist Indiana University Bloomington

Ahmad Bessesen and other doctors who spoke to C&EN about treating people who want to lose weight say that these feelings along with the health issues affecting people who are at higher weights are why they think it’s important to consider clinically defined obesity a disease. Calling it a disease shifts the blame from a person’s behaviors to dysfunctional biochemistry Ahmad says.

But Chastain disagrees and says that pathologizing fat is the issue. “The fact that people who are higher weight get a health issue more often cannot be led to say ‘Well then their body size is the problem and then making them thin will solve the problem’ ” she says.

These two views create a disconnect and it’s one that is exacerbated by our body image–obsessed culture says Sarah Nutter a weight stigma and body image researcher at the University of Victoria. She agrees that weight is not a good proxy for health and is frustrated by the number of researchers and doctors who tell their patients that losing weight will alleviate other metabolic diseases. She says that for as many people who will feel stigmatized by calling fat a disease there are those who won’t be.

“I think that declaring obesity a disease can feel freeing for some people to feel like it’s not their fault and I think other people do feel incredibly stigmatized by it. And that’s the nuance right?” Nutter says. “People aren’t going to feel the same way about it. And until we are able to have messy conversations about this do a better job of bringing in multiple perspectives and multiple truths into the conversation people are going to be left out.”

In the meantime people like Cliett say they might stop taking Wegovy when they reach their goals. Doctors argue that losing just 5–10% of starting weight leads to health benefits for clinically obese people which Cliett can attest to. And Wegovy tirzepatide and potentially newer drugs are pushing average weight loss to 15% and higher. But for many people that’s not enough—their goal is to be thin. That’s something Bessesen and other doctors who spoke to C&EN say they think about regularly.

“People want to look like they did when they were 16. And there’s no treatment short of bariatric surgery that’s going to give them that” Bessesen says. “If they lose 5% of their weight only 5% their risk of developing diabetes goes down by 60%. But people aren’t excited by that.”

Chastain goes back to the prickly issue of maintenance. People in the Phase 3 study of Wegovy saw their weight loss taper significantly around week 60. And when people stopped taking the drug they started regaining weight Novo Nordisk’s Brett says. The company is testing longer treatment periods and will release more data on maintenance in a few weeks.

Why weight comes back after therapies and lifestyle changes is the big black box of the field UT Southwestern’s Scherer says. “No one has been able to touch that dial or to even define it in molecular terms—what the set point is and why is the set point so firm.”

For these long-term drugs like Wegovy the coming years will be key to understanding whether people can safely maintain their weight loss.

After weeks of trying to get the entry-level dose of Wegovy Johnson the medical device salesperson ended up asking his doctor to prescribe Ozempic instead. It’s still semaglutide. He’s been on a very low dose of Ozempic for 3 weeks and so far he’s lost 1 lb (0.45 kg). Johnson says he hasn’t experienced fat stigma the way Cliett says she has but for him losing weight isn’t a health issue alone even if it’s his primary reason for trying to lose weight.

“Both parents died at 68 from [myocardial infarction]. Neither was overweight” he says via text after a long spate of work travel. “A big thing is to fit in clothes better. A lot of people will call you ‘big guy.’ Not my favorite thing to be called.”

The question of whether being fat is a disease will continue to rage even as new drugs hit the market and people jump to them as they have Wegovy. The drugs seem to be getting safer but Nutter says our thin-at-all-costs society still drives people to tolerate some of the miserable side effects of Wegovy—nausea vomiting and constipation—day after day in order to lose weight. And on top of that are Chastain and the growing movement to end fat discrimination who question why these drugs have to exist at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,

With oil prices at seven-year highs and investors worried about supply chain problems and inflation Wall Street is on the hunt for companies that will avoid the worst of the pain of rising costs — or turn it to their advantage.

One way to do that is through pricing power which is shorthand for a company's ability to raise prices to cancel out rising costs and maintain the profits and margins that investors want to see.

This initiative which was developed in collaboration with Richmond Neighborhood Housing Services (RNHS) the Center for Community Self-Help (Self-Help) The WellNest Company the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) the City of Oakland and the San Francisco Foundation (SFF) will help reduce barriers to ADU development by offering local homeowners one-on-one project management support a more efficient permitting process affordable construction services pre-approved ADU designs created by blink!LAB architecture a customized financial product developed in consideration of potential challenges facing local residents educational resources and more.

California’s housing affordability crisis has dramatically increased the cost of living in major cities like Oakland and disproportionately affected Black residents and communities of color — which have faced decades of discriminatory lending practices racist housing policies and structural inequities. Today Black homeowners and renters in Oakland are more likely to be cost-burdened than any other racial or ethnic group. Black loan applicants are also more than twice as likely to have their applications denied by financial institutions when compared to white applicants. As a result of these disparities Oakland has experienced a steady decline of Black residents since the early 2000s as well as the displacement of low to moderate income households across the City.

“Since the founding of Richmond Neighborhood Housing Services we have been dedicated to combating redlining and housing discrimination by addressing the housing needs of low-income families as well as African American residents and other communities impacted by systemic inequities. As housing prices increase along with the widening of the racial wealth gap we believe that the construction of Accessory Dwelling Units can provide homeowners with greater financial stability as well as address Oakland’s housing shortage by creating additional units” said Nikki Beasley Executive Director of RNHS.

Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf who was involved in the design of the program said: “ADUs are an opportunity to increase economic stability and housing security in our community. I’m especially proud of the fact that this program was intentionally designed with an explicit racial equity goal. I look forward to working with the program partners to achieve that goal and bring more opportunity to more families across Oakland.”

Accessory Dwelling Units or ADUs which are secondary residential units that share a lot with a larger primary house can give homeowners greater financial stability by adding value to their properties and generating additional income through rental revenue. The construction of ADUs may also increase the supply of housing that is typically more affordable to local residents without disrupting the landscape or appearance of a neighborhood. Keys to Equity is the first program of its kind in Oakland to center ADUs as a means of creating more housing in areas that are at risk of greater displacement and expanding access to wealth-building for homeowners with a particular focus on Black homeowners and those who have been disproportionately impacted by systemic racial and economic inequities within the housing system. The program is intended to support both the creation of new ADUs as well as the renovation and legalization of existing unpermitted ADUs.

“Keys to Equity has the potential to help more residents have access to a safe reliable place to call home — which is a core part of our mission at CZI” said Priscilla Chan Co-Founder of CZI. “The tools resources and support provided by this initiative are a step in the right direction for many homeowners in the Oakland community. We’re grateful to work alongside like-minded partners who are committed to innovative solutions that increase the supply of affordable housing and address the systemic racial and economic inequities within the housing system.

As the primary administrator for Keys to Equity RNHS a nonprofit dedicated to promoting investment in and revitalization of under-resourced communities in the East Bay will manage the application process for this initiative community engagement efforts and one-on-one coaching for program participants. The City of Oakland a supporting partner and co-designer of Keys to Equity is streamlining the ADU permitting process for homeowners. Self-Help a credit union and CDFI committed to creating and protecting economic opportunity for all is the lending partner for Keys to Equity and their team has developed a customized financial product for the program that was evaluated by a cohort of homeowners of color in Oakland. The WellNest Company an East Bay-based construction firm will serve as the program’s general contractor and work closely with RNHS to keep homeowners updated about ADU project timelines and costs. The program was co-designed by CZI a philanthropic organization that provided funding support for this effort. The SFF is also a philanthropic partner for Keys to Equity.

“ADUs have the potential to help homeowners build and preserve wealth and add naturally affordable housing but we’ve seen in our work that some homeowners and communities are not well-served by current financing sources” said Steve Zuckerman President of Self-Help Federal Credit Union. “It is an honor to work with the Keys to Equity Program partners to design and offer an innovative ADU mortgage product that facilitates more equitable access to ADUs and all the benefits they offer.”

Homeowners interested in applying for Keys to Equity should complete an interest form provided by RNHS. For more information about this program and eligibility requirements please visit keystoequity.org.

“We’re incredibly excited to be the official design and construction partner for the Keys to Equity Program. Our mission at The WellNest Company is to help save lives by creating spaces where seniors maintain their dignity and independence through tech-driven innovative housing and smart care services” said Bobby Arte COO of The WellNest Company. “We can now further our mission with the wider Oakland community by building ADUs that provide housing income and flexibility to all who qualify. As third generation Oakland natives with 25 years of nonprofit work for the community under our belts we understand the positive effects of social impact and know how important this program is.”

“Keys to Equity is exactly the type of innovative and targeted approach that we need to start giving more people affordable homes. Homes where people feel safe. Homes where people can build wealth and thrive” said Fred Blackwell CEO of The San Francisco Foundation. “We are all in on housing because it is the foundation of a racially just and economically inclusive Bay Area. We are proud to support this effort to create more homes while explicitly supporting homeowners of color.”

Rising housing costs continue to ravage the community placing a massive financial strain on many. Homeowner cost burdens have sharply risen in the past few decades with Black and Latinx homeowners facing the highest cost burden out of all of the racial groups.

A big reason for this is the explicitly discriminatory housing policies ingrained in U.S. history. Exclusionary housing ordinances redlining and restrictive covenants were just some of the many policies placed in the 20th century that led to the massive inequities we see in housing today.

The rising cost of living in the Bay Area stagnating salaries and the lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our economy has made it all the more challenging for many homeowners to maintain and upgrade their properties.

Preserving and Producing More Housing with Accessory Dwelling Units

Innovative housing solutions can help prevent greater displacement in regions like the Bay Area. One of these solutions is the building of accessory dwelling units (ADU). An ADU is a residential unit that’s added to an existing home whether in the form of a garage a freestanding cottage or a part of the main house that has been converted into an additional unit. While smaller than a typical unit there are many benefits to constructing more ADUs.

Financial Stability for Homeowners

ADUs with rent-paying tenants can provide additional income for homeowners. ADUs in Oakland California are especially important because nearly one-third of homeowners are cost burdened and this burden is disproportionately faced by people of color. ADUs provide extra income to the homeowners of the single-family unit and the opportunity to boost the household’s wealth.

White families are significantly more likely to own a single-family home and the resources needed to build an ADU onto their property. But the City of Oakland plans to create targeted policies and programs to ensure that people of color and lower-income households will benefit from ADUs.

Protecting Tenants

In the past decade there has been a 25% decrease in the Black population of Oakland and housing prices are one of the most significant drivers of residential movement and forced displacement. Research shows that the average rent of an ADU in Oakland is considered affordable to a single-person household earning 60% of the area median income. Because ADUs are a low-cost way to add more affordable housing into the community they reduce displacement risks for lower-income residents and stabilize neighborhoods.

Low Cost Quicker Timeline

ADUs are less costly to build than traditional units providing local communities with a fast yet sustainable solution to the housing crisis. The average Oakland ADU costs between $175000 to $263000 and takes approximately four months to build — which is much less than the average cost of $726000 per unit for below-market housing in Alameda County California.

Flexible Housing Options

ADUs are particularly well-suited for couples small families and seniors. Additionally they can house the extended families of the homeowners bringing families together and keeping them close while still maintaining the privacy and space of a separate unit.

Increasing Equity in ADU Access

While still a relatively new idea ADUs have the potential to prevent the displacement of Oakland residents and strengthen our communities. With these benefits in mind Richmond Neighborhood Housing Services has partnered with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the City of Oakland to design the Keys to Equity program — an initiative to serve homeowners in Oakland with a focus on Black households who want to build or legalize an ADU on their property. The program provides one-on-one guidance through the development process and a suite of benefits for homeowners including customized ADU architectural designs lending products and certain subsidies for eligible homeowners in order to make ADUs more accessible to households that have been systematically excluded.

Shoppers are doing more and more purchasing online amid the pandemic and that has both companies and investors trying to best mix e-commerce and the traditional retail store business moving forward. In 2008 e-commerce sales made up just 3.6% of total retail sales in the U.S. according to data from eMarketer. Amazon saw its business grow tenfold in the 2010s Walmart further established its online platform new entrants like Wayfair emerged and almost every retail brand ensured it had a digital presence as e-commerce boomed. By 2020 online sales made up 14% of total retail sales. The Covid-19 pandemic sped that growth up even more with e-commerce sales now expected to make up 15.3% of total retail sales by the end of this year according to eMarketer. That is not expected to slow down — that figure is predicted to increase to 23.5% of total sales by 2025. ""The consumer wants a seamless experience. He or she wants to be able to interact with us in our stores as well as on our website and so building an omnichannel experience has been critical during the pandemic"" Harmit Singh CFO of Levi Strauss & Co. said at the recent CNBC @Work Summit.

Blending in-store and online shopping experiences

Levi Strauss & Co . which operates approximately 3000 stores and shop-in-shops in addition to selling its products online and in other department stores and retailers has focused on scaling up its investments in its digital experience while also keeping a priority on what a customer experiences shopping in person. In Levi's 2020 fiscal year nearly a fourth of its sales came via online shopping whether directly through Levi's platform or through the digital presence of its wholesalers. In 2015 online sales made up less than 10% of its business. Last year Levi's introduced a new experiential store in Palo Alto California as part of its push towards more direct-to-consumer sales and less wholesale. There are several digitally-focused features of the ""NextGen"" store including integration with the company's app curbside pick-ups and contactless returns and an inventory assortment that is driven by local customer data. Singh said that the company opened 100 new stores last year and has plans to open more than 100 this year. Some of those stores will be the new experiential ones the company previously announced. ""We scaled up our investments in driving more of a digital experience"" Singh said. ""We were able to test things and scale things at speeds we would have not said was possible pre the pandemic and I think it's really helped companies like ours because I think we've been able to get a lot more agile and been able to deliver the promise that we've set out to our consumers.""

The balance between the in-store and online experience during the pandemic also has led to changes in the way Levi Strauss thinks about its distribution infrastructure which has grown in importance amid supply chain challenges. Singh said that the omnichannel strategy on the consumer-facing side of the business led the company to take a look at legacy distribution centers — some that were only fulfilling products for wholesale customers while other distribution centers were servicing the needs of e-commerce consumers. It recreated the omnichannel approach for its West Coast distribution after it began the ship-from-store strategy and he said it leads to inventory efficiencies and a low cost of service. ""I think things like that will make a big difference. Now we're scaling our ship-from-store around the world and we're setting up more omnichannel distribution centers in Europe and other parts"" Singh said. Estee Lauder has also pushed to make the online and in-store experience more seamless adding things like virtual try-on and having its beauty advisors available online Tracey Travis CFO of The Estee Lauder Companies  said at the CNBC event. ""Our in-store experiences is so strong; it's fundamentally where the company has been focused for many many years"" she said. ""Making sure that we're investing in online and having as much of a high touch experience online as we do offline was critically important to make that consumer experience more seamless between online and offline.""

Deepening the online sales focus

""One of the things that certainly has happened during this pandemic is we've seen an acceleration probably [a] three- to five-year acceleration in terms of our online business across all forms"" Travis said. ""Brick and mortar is still a very very important part"" of Estee Lauder but she noted how the pandemic shifted some of the company's strategy. ""During the last 12 months the priority has been very much online and adding capability to our online channel and at the same time trying to assess how brick and mortar would recover where brick and mortar would recover and where we should be investing and where we should be disinvesting"" she said. Estee Lauder which owns brands like Clinique Mac Origins and its eponymous beauty line said that 28% of its $16.22 billion in net global sales in its fiscal 2021 year came from online channels according to its earnings report. In North America specifically online sales made up 40% of Estee Lauder's total business according to company filings. While online sales for Estee Lauder have more than doubled compared to 2019 physical retail is still a key component of the company's business. Twenty-one percent of its global sales in its most recent fiscal year took place in department stores while sales in travel retail environments such as duty-free shops in airports made up 28% of its total sales.

The model often takes to Instagram to show off her amazing body and promote her swimwear line The Elizabeth Hurley collection.

She does not mind that she's put on weight and thinks 'life's too short' to worry about dieting.

""I’m at least 10 pounds heavier than I was 20 years ago but I don’t care"" Liz told the Daily Mail.

""I probably eat a bit more now but I don’t eat takeaways and only drink sodas once in a blue moon. Life’s too short to be on a super strict diet.""

She added: ""My weakness is peanut butter - if it’s in the house I’ll stick my finger in the jar every time I walk past it""

Even though she does not work out as much any more she let fans in on how she keeps fit.

""I love working in my garden and am never happier than when wielding a strimmer. I walk my dogs a lot too"" Liz explained.

""I don’t do any set exercise but can’t sit still for long. I actually eat quite a lot but very little junk or processed foods and don’t drink much alcohol. I try to eat lots of vegetables and never eat between meals.""

Modelling her own swimwear line has helped her to feel confident as she gets older.

""I love modelling my collections and actually think feeling comfortable and confident comes with age"" Elizabeth said.

""There might be a time when I don’t want to model swimwear and move onto voluminous kaftans but currently I’m still enjoying it.""

Liz has also been working as an ambassador for The Estée Lauder Companies (ELC) as part of their Breast Cancer Campaign.

The issue is dear to her heart after losing her nan to breast cancer and encouraged people to regularly check their breasts.

""Self-checking is really important; I have personally met many women who have discovered lumps themselves including several of my close friends"" she said.

""By familiarising yourself with your own breasts it should become easier to spot or feel any changes.

""I self-check every month in front of the mirror. I would advise everyone to do the same and to try and see it as part of your monthly routine rather than as something to fear.""

There are many wonderful things about living in today’s connected world but a massive downside is a rise in materialism and consumerism. One little way we can fight these is to “shop small” at small or local businesses.

The Church has taken a stand against these downsides of globalization because materialism and consumerism are opposed to the Gospel message of detachment and generosity. Pope Francis wrote in his encylical Fratelli Tutti

“Opening up to the world” is an expression that has been co-opted by the economic and financial sector and is now used exclusively of openness to foreign interests or to the freedom of economic powers to invest without obstacles or complications in all countries. Local conflicts and disregard for the common good are exploited by the global economy in order to impose a single cultural model. This culture unifies the world but divides persons and nations… We are more alone than ever in an increasingly massified world that promotes individual interests and weakens the communitarian dimension of life … As a rule the advance of this kind of globalism strengthens the identity of the more powerful who can protect themselves but it tends to diminish the identity of the weaker and poorer regions making them more vulnerable and dependent.

He especially condemns “the drive to limitless consumption” that can be an unfortunate side effect of the global economy.

This fall as we head into preparing for Christmas let’s make it a point to shop at small businesses and local businesses. In this way we can each do our part to build a better world.

Not sure where to begin? Here are 12 small Catholic shops on Etsy to support. (For tons more ideas check out this giant list of small Catholic businesses!)",,,,,,,,,,,,

“You speak to 10 20 different people there’s going to be a mix of opinions which is one of the great elements of the race” Mr Gray told Sky News Australia.

“I think it certainly suits a couple of key contenders and maybe diminishes a couple of others. I think you’re looking at a horse like Nature Strip Eduardo they’re certainly suited by a wetter track and what that does for them is they’re speed horses and it just takes the edge off the tempo.

“Obviously Nature Strip has been to Everest before and he’s just gone too hard and it’s just set it up for someone to come over the top so I don’t think on a wet track you can go as hard so it might just take away from those horses’ running.”

Why?,"Energy company Eversource is encouraging municipalities and residents to make a plan for their trees.

Get NHPR's reporting about politics the pandemic and other top stories in your inbox — sign up for our newsletter today.

With an arboretum in Hooksett now open to the public the company wants Granite Staters to tour a variety of vegetation that is friendlier to power lines.

For Eversource trees are the leading cause of power outages especially during storms. But it’s important to keep planting them said Bob Allen an arborist who manages vegetation maintenance efforts at Eversource.

New Hampshire is the second most forested state in the country. The company says it’s planning to spend $27 million across New Hampshire for tree-trimming and removal efforts this year covering 2500 of the 12000 miles of overhead lines it maintains in the state.

Some in Eversource's New England service areas have pushed back on the company’s efforts to cut down trees saying the removal would create environmental and safety concerns  and harm property values.

Allen wants to introduce residents to the diversity of tree species that can thrive in New Hampshire and encourage people to start planting.

“When you think of New England you think of maples and oaks and ash and birch. But prior to our generations we thought of chestnut and elm and they're both gone basically because of disease invasive diseases and insects” he said. “If something comes in and we have a diversity of species we have a better chance of managing what happens when those trees get affected.”

Invasive species like the emerald ash borer provide an added challenge for Eversource’s efforts to manage the vegetation that might impact power lines. Allen says his vegetation management teams have been working to take down the dead ash trees especially in Laconia and Loudon.

Visitors to the arboretum can look at examples of trees Eversource says are short enough to safely plant near electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure.

All of the arboretum’s trees are sourced from New Hampshire nurseries and many are native species. But one tree that usually succeeds in warmer areas — the Chinese fringe tree — is thriving in the arboretum.

“It probably shouldn't be doing as well as it's doing here. And I think it's kind of an indicator of climate change” Allen said.

A changing climate may call on Granite Staters to diversify their landscaping he said. As sugar maples and white birches move north other trees that thrive in warmer climates may begin to thrive in New Hampshire.

The arboretum recently received a Gold Leaf award from the New England Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture. Eversource has three other arboretums — one in Portsmouth one at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and one in Berlin Connecticut.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZXJrc2hpcmVlYWdsZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9zdG9ybXMta25vY2tlZC1vdXQtcG93ZXItaW4tcGFydHMtb2YtYmVya3NoaXJlcy1vbi1zYXR1cmRheS1idXQtdG9ybmFkby13YXJuaW5nLXBhc3Nlcy13aXRoL2FydGljbGVfNjAyOTliZWUtMmY2NS0xMWVjLWIwMWMtOTc3Zjc5NDAxYmQ1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Storms knocked out power in parts of Berkshires on Saturday but tornado warning passes with no activity,Storms knocked out power in parts of Berkshires on Saturday but tornado warning passes with no activity,,,,,,,,,

Bids are due Oct. 19 on the proposed 125294-square-foot Broadway Street Self Storage that's been in the works for about three years on Coleman Boulevard.

An affiliate of Charleston-based Gramling Brothers Real Estate & Development wants to build the project at 415 W. Coleman between Peach Orchard Plaza and Vicious Biscuit.

The facility takes its name from a road that wraps around the back side of the property. The shorter portion of the building would be on the Coleman side.

Peach Orchard Plaza a collection of shops in a strip center will eventually be demolished and may be redeveloped as a two-story office building according to preliminary plans.

When the town annexed the tract in 2019 it allowed a structure up to 45 feet along the street front and 55 feet farther back. Sixty percent of the building at street level must be set aside for commercial uses such as retail or restaurant space.

Construction could begin by the end of the year but it depends on costs and permitting according to Mikell Harper with Gramling Brothers.

Storing stuff

A new three-story storage facility is in the works for Charleston's rapidly changing upper peninsula and two others are on the way to Johns and James islands.

The 6-acre peninsula site on land owned by Hope Real Estate Ltd. is at 62 Brigade St. off Morrison Drive.

In 2018 a five-story storage building was proposed for the site in front of several warehouse buildings.

One way to do that is through pricing power which is shorthand for a company's ability to raise prices to cancel out rising costs and maintain the profits and margins that investors want to see.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

UBS strategist Keith Parker says his firm is focused on the companies that have the most pricing power and highest stock upside. They determined which companies are most easily able to raise their prices and developed a metric that combines pricing power momentum in profit margins and the companies' exposure to input costs that could rise.

Parker only looked at companies that scored in the top 33% of their sectors and picked companies that have ""Buy"" ratings and upsides of at least 10% to UBS analysts' price targets.

The supply chain problems are getting a ton of attention right now but they won't be easily solved. Evidence is mounting that the snags will last well into 2022 even as the economy gets back on its feet. So the companies that can manage those problems might have a durable advantage.

He also said a handful of companies are looking at serious trouble identifying major downside for Occidental Petroleum and American Airlines with limited additional downside for Comerica Huntington Bancshares and Prudential.

The top picks are somewhat more diverse as the consumer discretionary technology real estate and industrial sectors are all represented.

The following companies are the ones with the most upside according to UBS and Parker's analysis. They're ranked from lowest to highest based on how far they will rise if UBS' 12-month price targets are accurate. Those upside figures were calculated as of October 14.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvc2VydmljZXMtYW5kLXNvZnR3YXJlL2lvcy0xNS1ob3ctdG8tbWFrZS1zZW5zZS1vZi1kZWxldGluZy1hbmQtbW92aW5nLWFwcHMtb24teW91ci1pcGhvbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,iOS 15: How to make sense of deleting and moving apps on your iPhone,"You may find deleting apps from your iPhone a bit trickier than before. AAre they gone for good when you delete them from your Home screen? Ever since app support for the iPhone showed up in 2008 the process to delete an app had been the same. Long-press the app icon until you enable jiggle mode (that's the official name per Apple ) then tap ""X."" Confirm you wanted to remove the app and it disappears -- no additional steps required.

But now you'll have to make a few extra taps for them to disappear. With iOS 15 you'll have to decide if you want to edit your home screen or delete the app for good. You can also remove built-in apps that you rarely use too. And you can use the App Library to store apps that you don't want to see on your Home screen but aren't ready to delete from your phone.

I'll walk you through how to remove apps for good keep them in your library and make changes to your Home screen. For more Apple news here's everything to know about Apple's October event and the latest on the iPhone 13 models. This story was recently updated.

How to move or delete apps on your iPhone home screen

There are a couple of ways you can delete an app on your iPhone. To start you can long-press an app icon until you see a pop-up menu. The actions you can then take will depend on the app. In the Mail app for example in addition to app-specific actions (like a composing a new email) you'll see two system options: Remove App and Edit Home Screen. You can share the app too.

Alternatively you can keep long-pressing the app icon for a few more seconds until all of the app icons start dancing.

Whether you select Remove App from the pop-up menu or you tap on the new ""-"" sign on the app icon while in jiggle mode you'll be presented with a brand-new prompt: Asking if you want to delete the app or move it from the Home screen.

Deleting the app will remove the app and all of its data from your phone freeing up precious storage space. Moving it to your App Library will only remove the app icon from your Home screen. The app will remain installed and you can access it at any time by swiping from right to left on your home screen until you get to your App Library.

If you're using jiggle mode to clear out unused apps keep repeating the same steps until you're given the option to delete the app from the Apple Store then tap Delete or tap on a blank area of your screen.

You can delete apps from the App Library as well. Sarah Tew/CNET

Delete apps in your App Library

There are multiple ways to do this.

Your first option is to swipe the last page of your Home screen until you see your App Library. Next use the search bar at the top of your App Library to search for the app by scrolling through the list of icons. Long-press on the app icon until you see a pop-up menu and then select Delete App. The key to seeing the menu is the long touch. Be careful not to accidentally drag the app to your home screen instead.

The other option is to find the app in its categorical folder long-press on it then select Delete App from the popup. You can then continue deleting apps with a tap on the ""X"" after triggering jiggle mode. Tap Done or leave the folder when you're finished.

The problem is Dedina had never heard of a Santa Cruz conspiracy. Few people had.

“The only thing from Santa Cruz on my phone was videos of my kids surfing there” Dedina said. “I love the fact that some lawyer in a really expensive suit sitting in some horrible office trying to find evidence that we were in some kind of conspiracy with Santa Cruz had to look at videos of my kids surfing.”

That’s where the laughter stopped.

The lawyers found no evidence to back up their claim. But that did not stop the industry from continuing to use its legal muscle to try to intimidate Dedina who leads one of the poorest small cities in the region.

The mayor became a target after Imperial Beach filed a lawsuit against ExxonMobil Chevron BP and more than 30 other fossil-fuel companies demanding they pay the huge costs of defending the city from rising seas caused by the climate crisis.

Imperial Beach’s lawsuit alleges the oil giants committed fraud by covering up research showing that burning fossil fuels destroys the environment. The industry then lied about the evidence for climate change for decades deliberately delaying efforts to curb carbon emissions.

The city’s lawsuit was among the first of a wave of litigation filed by two dozen municipalities and states across the US that could cost the fossil-fuel industry billions of dollars in compensation for the environmental devastation and the deception.

Dedina says his minority majority community of about 27000 cannot begin to afford the tens of millions of dollars it will cost to keep at bay the waters bordering three sides of his financially strapped city. The worst of recent storms have turned Imperial Beach into an island.

One assessment calculated that without expensive mitigation measures rising sea levels will eventually swamp some of the city’s neighbourhoods routinely flood its two schools and overwhelm its drainage system.

Imperial Beach’s annual budget is $20m. Exxon’s chief executive Darren Woods was paid more than $15m last year.

“We don’t have a pot to piss in in this city. So why not go after the oil companies?” he said. “The lawsuit is a pragmatic approach to making the people that caused sea level rise pay for the impacts it has on our city.”

That’s not how Exxon the US’s largest oil company saw it. Its lawyers noted that Imperial Beach filed its case in July 2017 at the same time as two California counties Marin and San Mateo. The county and city of Santa Cruz followed six months later with similar suits seeking compensation to cope with increasing wildfires and drought caused by global heating.

Exxon alleged that the sudden burst of litigation and the fact that the municipalities shared a law firm specialising in environmental cases Sher Edling was evidence of collusion.

Exxon filed lawsuits claiming the municipalities conspired to extort money from the company by following a strategy developed during an environmental conference at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla 25 miles north of Imperial Beach nine years ago.

The meeting organised by the Climate Accountability Institute and the Union of Concerned Scientists produced a report outlining how legal strategies used by US states against the tobacco industry in the 1990s could be applied to cases against fossil fuel companies.

Dedina was also targeted by one of the US’s biggest business groups at the forefront of industry resistance to increased regulation to reduce greenhouse gases the National Association of Manufacturers and a rightwing thinktank the Energy & Environment Legal Institute.

The manufacturing trade group was behind the efforts to obtain data from Dedina’s phone and documents in 2018. In its public disclosure request to the mayor’s office NAM called Imperial Beach’s lawsuit “litigation based on political or ideological objections more appropriately addressed through the political process”.

Exxon is attempting to use a Texas law that allows corporations to go on a fishing expedition for incriminating evidence by questioning individuals under oath even before any legal action is filed against them. The company is trying to force Dedina two other members of Imperial Beach’s government and officials from other jurisdictions to submit to questioning on the grounds they were joined in a conspiracy against the oil industry.

“A collection of special interests and opportunistic politicians are abusing law enforcement authority and legal process to impose their viewpoint on climate change” the oil firm claimed. “ExxonMobil finds itself directly in that conspiracy’s crosshairs.”

A Texas district judge approved the request to depose Dedina but then a court of appeals overturned the decision last year. The state supreme court is considering whether to take up the case.

The target on Dedina is part of a wider pattern of retaliation against those suing Exxon and other oil companies.

In an unusual move in 2016 Exxon persuaded a Texas judge to order the attorney general of Massachusetts Maura Healey to travel to Dallas to be deposed about her motives for investigating the company for alleged fraud for suppressing evidence on climate change. The judge also ordered that New York’s attorney general Eric Schneiderman be “available” in Dallas on the same day in case Exxon wanted to question him about a similar investigation.

Healey accused Exxon of trying to “squash the prerogative of state attorneys general to do their jobs”. The judge reversed the deposition order a month later and Healey filed a lawsuit against the company in 2019 which is still awaiting trial.

But similar tactics persuaded the US Virgin Islands attorney general to shut down his investigation of the oil giant.

Patrick Parenteau a law professor and former director of the Environmental Law Center at Vermont law school said the attempt to question Dedina and other officials is part of a broader strategy by the oil industry to counter lawsuits with its own litigation.

“These cases are frivolous and vexatious. Intimidation is the goal. Just making it cost a lot and be painful to take on Exxon. They think that if they make the case painful enough Imperial Beach will quit” he said.

If the intent is to kill off the litigation against the oil industry it’s not working. Officials from other municipalities have called Exxon’s move “repugnant” “a sham” and “outrageous” and have vowed to press on with their lawsuits.

Dedina described the action as a “bullying tactic” by the oil industry to avoid accountability.

“The only conspiracy is [that] a bunch of suits and fossil-fuel companies decided to pollute the earth and make climate change worse and then lie about it” he said. “They make more money than our entire city has in a year.”

The city’s lawsuit claims it faces a “significant and dangerous sea-level rise” through the rest of this century that threatens its existence. Imperial Beach commissioned an analysis of its vulnerability to rising sea levels which concluded that nearly 700 homes and businesses were threatened at a cost of more than $100m. It said that flooding will hit about 40% of the city’s roads including some that will be under water for long periods. Two elementary schools will have to be moved. The city’s beach regarded as one of the best sites for surfing on the California coast is being eroded by about a foot a year.

Imperial Beach sits at the southern end of San Diego bay. Under one worst-case scenario the bay could merge with the Tijuana River estuary to the south and permanently submerge much of the city’s housing and roads.

The city has received some help with creating natural climate barriers. The Fish and Wildlife Service restored 400 acres of wetland next to the city as a national wildlife refuge which also acts as a barrier to flooding and is expected to restore other wetlands together with the Port of San Diego. A grant is paying for improved equipment to warn of floods.

But that still leaves the huge costs of building new schools and drainage systems and adapting other infrastructure. Dedina said that without the oil companies stumping up it won’t happen.

“People ask how did you go against the world’s largest fossil fuel companies? Isn’t that scary? No. What’s scary is coastal flooding and the idea that whole cities would be under water” said the mayor.

“Honestly bring it on. I can’t wait to make our case. I can’t wait to take the fight to them because we have nothing to lose.”

The agreement to include the FEP at Mossmorran is in addition to an earlier announced Memorandum of Understanding to capture and store emissions from gas terminals at the St Fergus complex at Peterhead which includes ExxonMobil’s joint venture gas terminal.

The initial phase of Acorn which is bidding to be in the first wave of carbon capture clusters to be announced by the UK government has the potential to deliver more than half of the country’s target of capturing and storing 10 million metric tons per year of CO2 by 2030.

When expanded further it will have the potential to store more than 20 million metric tonnes per year of CO2 by the mid-2030s.

Martin Burrell plant manager of Fife Ethylene Plant said: “The Acorn project has the potential to capture and store CO2 emissions from Scotland’s largest industrial centre which is an economic engine for the country.

“This agreement allows us to explore the potential for significant emissions Exxon Mobil Corporation reduction through carbon capture and storage and ensure Scotland continues to benefit from vital manufacturing facilities such as Fife.”

The Fife Ethylene Plant recently completed a £140 million investment programme to upgrade key infrastructure and introduce new technologies that will significantly improve operational reliability and performance.

A further project is underway to install an enclosed ground flare.

On schedule to be operational by the end of 2022 the unit is designed to significantly reduce noise light and vibration and it is estimated the investment will reduce the use of the plant’s elevated flare by at least 98 percent.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFicm9la25ld3MuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTcvbmV3cy9ndXlhbmEvb2lsLXNwaWxsLXVubGlrZWx5LWJ1dC1yZXNwb25zZS1wbGFuLWNyaXRpY2FsLWZvci1leHhvbi1sZWQteWVsbG93dGFpbC1wcm9qZWN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oil spill unlikely but response plan critical for Exxon-led Yellowtail project,"While a large oil spill is seen as being an unlikely outcome of the ExxonMobil-led Yellowtail Development Project an environmental study has recommended that the company be required to commit to regular response drills simulations and exercises as part of needed preparations in the event of a worst case scenario.

The consultants who prepared the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and the Environ-mental Impact Statement (EIS) for the project have recommended that national authorities consider embedded controls mitigation measures management plans and oil spill preparedness as conditions of issuing an environmental authorization for the project which is expected to pose only minor risks to Guyana’s environmental and socioeconomic resources while potentially offering significant economic benefits to the citizenry.

They agreed that multiple controls have been embedded into the project design to prevent a spill from occurring and that a large spill that affects the Guyana coastline and/or other regional coastlines is “unlikely.” However they said “given the sensitivity of many of the resources that could potentially be impacted by a spill (e.g. Shell Beach Protected Area; marine mammals; critically endangered endangered and vulnerable marine turtles; and Amerindian fishing and other communities reliant on ecosystem services for sustenance and their livelihood) we believe it is critical that EEPGL commit to regular oil spill response drills simulations and exercises—and involve appropriate Guyanese authorities and stakeholders in these activities document the availability of appropriate response equipment on board the FPSO and demonstrate that offsite equipment could be mobilized for a timely response.”

EEPGL – Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited – is Exxon’s local affiliate which on behalf of itself and its co-venturers Hess Guyana Exploration and CNOOC Petroleum Guyana Limited has sought an environmental authorization from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the project which is the fourth project development in the eastern half of the offshore Stabroek Block.

By way of a public notice the EPA yesterday announced that the EIA and the EIS for the project have been submitted and it invited members of the public to make written submission upon reviewing them. The EPA had determined based on an initial assessment that an EIA was required for EEPGL’s application for environmental authorization. It is intended to provide the factual and technical basis required by the EPA to make an informed decision on EEPGL’s application.

The EIA “was prepared by a team of consultants including Environmental Resources

Management (ERM) an international environmental and social consulting firm with a local registration in Guyana and extensive experience in the preparation of EIAs for offshore oil and gas development projects; SLR Consulting (SLR); and the Guyanese consultancies

Caribbean Engineering & Management Consultants Inc. (CEMCO) the University of Guyana

Centre for Study of Bio-logical Diversity (CSBD) and Leon Moore Nature Experience (LMNE).”

It states that the area that will be developed as part of the project is located approximately 203 kilometers (approximately 126 miles) northeast of the coastline of Georgetown Guyana.

It says the project will consist of the drilling of approximately 41 to 67 development wells (including production water injection and gas re-injection wells); installation and operation of Subsea Umbilicals Risers and Flowlines equipment; installation and operation of a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel in the eastern half of the Stabroek Block; and project decommissioning.

The initial production is expected to begin by end of 2025–early 2026 with operations continuing for at least 20 years. It is noted that the Project is expected to employ up to 540 persons during development well drilling approximately 600 persons at the peak of the installation stage and 100 to 140 persons during production operations.

According to the EIA the planned activities of the Project are predicted to have negligible residual impacts on most physical resources (air quality marine geology and sediments and marine water quality)—with potential moderate residual impacts on greenhouse gas (GhG) emissions no impacts on coastal biological resources negligible to minor residual impacts on most marine biological resources (with potential moderate residual impacts on special status marine fish) and negligible to minor residual impacts on socioeconomic resources—with largely positive impacts on socioeconomic conditions and employment. It explains that these predictions are based on the fact that the bulk of the project activity will occur approximately 203 kilometers (approximately 126 miles) offshore and the project will capture and re-inject associated natural gas (that which is not used as fuel on the FPSO) back into the targeted Project reservoirs treat all required wastewater streams prior to discharge to the sea have a very small physical footprint and use Marine Mammal Observers and “soft starts” during seismic surveys to reduce the potential for auditory injury to marine mammals.

‘Unlikely’

Although a large marine oil spill is considered unlikely and the probability of reaching the Guyana coast is low given the sensitivity of many of the resources that could be potentially impacted by a spill it was concluded that preparation for spill response is warranted. Unplanned events such as a potential oil spill the EIA says are considered unlikely to occur because of the extensive preventative measures employed by EEPGL. Nevertheless EEPGL has conducted oil spill modeling to evaluate the range of likely spill trajectories and rates of travel in the unlikely

event of a spill. The EIA says the location of the project offshore prevailing northwest currents the medium nature of the Yellowtail and Redtail fields’ crude oil and the region’s warm waters would all help reduce the severity of a spill. It further says stochastic modeling of an unmitigated subsea release of crude oil from a loss-of-well-control event indicates a less than 5 percent to 40 percent probability of oil reaching the Guyana coast without taking into consideration the effectiveness of any oil spill response and the low likelihood that such a spill would occur while modeling of an unmitigated 2500-barrel (400 m3) release from an FPSO offloading spill indicates no impact to the Guyana coast.

“Although the probability of an oil spill reaching the Guyana coast is low a subsea release of crude oil from a loss-of-well-control event would impact marine water quality marine sediments and marine biological resources found near the well. Marine turtles and marine mammals would be particularly susceptible to impacts from an oil spill due to the need to surface to breathe and the resulting inhalation risks” it notes.

Additionally it says baleen whales feed near the surface where oil would be entrained so an oil spill could foul their baleen plates and expose them to ingestion of oil as well as inhalation of volatized hydrocarbons. Further should spilled oil reach the coast in Region One it says the risks of oiling nesting beaches could pose inter-generational risks to marine turtles. Other physical and biological resources such as air quality seabirds marine fish and marine benthos could also be impacted but the EIA notes that current speeds in the Project Development Area regularly exceed 1 meter per second and spilled oil would travel rapidly to the north and/or west depending on the season.

The EIA also says a spill could potentially impact Guyanese fisherfolk if commercial fish and shrimp resources were impacted. The magnitude of this impact would depend on the volume and duration of the release as well as the time of year at which the release were to occur.

Regardless of seasonal trends in abundance or spatial distribution among the major taxonomic groups the EIA says effective implementation of the Oil Spill Response Plan (OSRP) would reduce this risk by reducing the ocean surface area impacted by a spill and thereby reducing potential exposure of these species to oil.

Oil spill modeling indicates that transboundary impacts could potentially occur for the largest spill scenarios considered and the unmitigated modeling results for these scenarios indicate there is the potential for oil to reach portions of a number of countries in the Caribbean. “Potential impacts on resources and receptors in these other countries would be similar to those for Guyana” it notes while adding that there are some additional resources that could potentially be affected.

The EIS and EIA are available on the EPA’s website and can also be copied at the EPA’s office the National Library in Georgetown and the Regional Democratic Council offices in all 10 administrative regions."

But it is also a slowly-paced and (mostly) one-location exercise of a type that can often elude mainstream audiences. Luckily it features something up its sleeve or perhaps a different article of clothing that guaranteed to get the conversation going. It does indeed feature Oscar Isaac in his birthday suit much to the surprise and delight of social media.

When Isaac and co-star Jessica Chastain appeared on The View on Friday it was to the hosts’s credit that they waited a full three minutes and forty-five seconds before bringing the matter up. The conversation began with an analysis of the series’s themes with Joy Behar self-deprecatingly calling fans of the show “nosybodies”—an undeniable aspect that creator Hagai Levi admits has always been a part of his work. But after some back-and-forth with Chastain about her process her 20-year-friendship with Isaac and the importance of changing some of the gender roles from the Ingmar Bergman original Sunny Hostin went in.

“There was a full-frontal nude scene everyone” Hostin said stone-faced as if she were a prosecutor before a judge. “I’m so sorry” Isaac retorted.

“I’m feeling objectified right now—she gets the deep questions?” the actor then joked. “What the hell’s goin’ on here?!”

He then explained that he is shown sensitive footage for approval but that he “saw it on a laptop quite dark and I didn’t notice what was happening down there.” Only afterwards did he realize what was captured when it was “clear as day on the big TV there it’s there for everyone to see.”

Isaac who earlier joked how “theater kids are always naked” didn’t seem too upset about it.

But Chastain chimed in with more of a backstory. “I said to Hagai [Levi] who wrote and directed the series in the very beginning I said ‘I’m comfortable with all the nudity but any part of my body that you show you’re going to have to show the same with Oscar.’”

The five episode HBO series debuted at a marathon screening at this year’s Venice Film Festival and featured one of the all-time great red carpet arrivals.

Washington though was inspired ...

The motivation for the Washington Football Team as a franchise to use Sunday as a way to pay tribute to the late great Sean Taylor may have been dubious - ""the black cloud'' and all of that.

But the team's honoring of Taylor is sincere.

And so is the way some members of this year's edition of Taylor's old team seemed sincere as well.

The Kansas City Chiefs were the NFL Week 6 visitors to FedEx Field and this Patrick Mahomes-led team despite its early-season struggles is a frightening force. The Chiefs showed much of that in a 31-13 win that drops the WFT to a disappointing 2-4.

Said WFT Coach Ron Rivera: ""I thought we would've handled the adversity a little bit better.”

But Washington - also burdened by early-season struggles and here playing in too many ways just as sloppily as Kansas City played - certainly performed with effort ... and with at least one very obvious desire to tip the hat (and the helmet) to Taylor.

That obvious gesture came courtesy of the team’s young defensive star Chase Young the defensive end who wrapped his facemask in tape in the the unmistakable pattern that Taylor wore during his playing days.

Different helmet. Different team name. Different color of facemask.

But a tape job that was identical.

Taylor’s No. 21 was retired at halftime of this game against the Chiefs. And yes the lead-up was ""screwed up'' as team president Jason Wright conceded.

But the spirit of Taylor - the star safety of the 2000's who was murdered in a 2007 burglary of his home - was present here.

Is that enough? Not on the scoreboard of course.

Mahomes was 32 of 47 for 397 yards and two TDs. There were the two interceptions but that didn't help the WFT enough. Darrel Williams had two rushing TDs and Travis Kelce (eight catches 99 yards) and Tyreek Hill (nine catches 76 yards and a score) ran free in the Washington secondary.

Young and the defense sacked Mahomes three times but that wasn't enough. Nor was QB Taylor Heinicke throwing for just 182 yards. Nor was a running game keyed by Antonio Gibson playing with a nasty shin injury while gaining just 44 yards.

Said Heinicke: ""It's frustrating. We just didn't execute well. We felt like we had a good game plan. We just didn't execute it well.""

In addition to a “good game plan”? Young's gesture. Gibson's effort. It counts for something.

""Sean Taylor Day'' isn't going to fix any Dan Snyder problems or any Jon Gruden scandals. But a losing team has to keep trying. At least coach Rivera's fellas do that.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthbnNhc2NpdHkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9uZmwva2Fuc2FzLWNpdHktY2hpZWZzL2FydGljbGUyNTUwODE3ODcuaHRtbNIBTmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmthbnNhc2NpdHkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9uZmwva2Fuc2FzLWNpdHktY2hpZWZzL2FydGljbGUyNTUwODE3ODcuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jackson Mahomes says his Tik Tok dance on logo of late Washington star was accident,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.kansascity.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Residents in the Beach Leslieville and along the Danforth may have been noticing more of these bikes being used for courier deliveries over the past few months.

By ERIN HORROCKS-POPE

Torontonians have been receiving FedEx packages delivered by e-bike couriers for the past year as many local residents may have been noticing.

The pilot project was launched by FedEx Express Canada to reduce carbon emissions from deliveries with more Canadians’ than ever before making online purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic.

When the initiative first launched in Toronto it started with only three bikes. After a successful pilot over the summer of last year the program now has more than 40 bikes running in five targetted neighbourhoods.

Communities such as the Beaches Leslieville and the Danforth were identified as target neighbourhoods for the project based on density and congestion issues.

The bikes allow for couriers to get around the city more easily avoid traffic and remove the worries of having to park far away or in less-than-ideal stopping situations.

“It’s definitely easier to get around the city” said Jeff Gilbert the senior operations manager of FedEx Express Canada.

“Using the bike lanes allows (couriers) to avoid a lot of the traffic congestion and (they) don’t have to worry about city parking.”

The e-bikes being used by couriers are “pedelec” bikes a type of electric bike where pedalling is assisted by a small electric motor. So in neighbourhoods such as the Beach which are full of steep hills the couriers don’t have to dread the uphill terrain but can have some fun instead.

With winter approaching and snow and ice being an unavoidable fact of the season the bikes are equipped with snow-tires and will continue being used providing the presence of safe weather conditions. Couriers are outfitted with winter gear to stay dry and warm on their ride.

Since launching last year the project has been welcomed by Torontonians. According to Gilbert FedEx couriers are often stopped for photos and conversation as they ride their delivery routes.

“The project has been very well received and it’s our goal to get as many bikes out there as possible” Gilbert said.

After such success in Toronto the program is now expanding to more Canadian cities with new pilots being put in place until Spring 2022. If the pilots are successful the program will expand within those cities as it did in Toronto.

FedEx has invested more than $2 billion towards its’ goal of obtaining carbon neutrality by 2040. According to Gilbert FedEx is focussing on three things as the company works to make this goal a reality: vehicle electrification natural carbon sequestration and sustainable energy.

In addition to the entire FedEx parcel pickup/delivery fleet is set to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2040 the company will also strive to continue its efforts of reducing fuel consumption used by its’ aircrafts.

Both total and student attendance set records in the Fifth Third Bank record book.The Owls (5-1 2-0 Big South Conference) were led by a strong performance by the team's defense. Kennesaw State allowed only 31 rushing yards which marked the third lowest in program history.recorded a career-high in both tackles (12) and tackles-for-loss (3) while helping the defense post its first shutout since Apr. 3 2021 against Robert Morris.

Following today's game Shepherd is now tied for the FCS lead in rushing touchdowns.The Owls and the Aggies (3-3 2-1) were in a defensive bout for the first half of Saturday's game. At the half the game had only seven total points complementary of a three-yard touchdown run by Shepherd. This was the first time NC A&T had been held scoreless before the half since Nov. 16 2016 against North Carolina Central.North Carolina A&T was able to move the ball down the field on its first drive of the game but missed a 25-yard field goal attempt to get on the board. For the next four drives each defense held strong and did not allow the opposing offense to get anything started.Kennesaw State forced a punt at the beginning of the second quarter and started with the ball on its 20-yard line. The offense moved the ball 80 yards down the field and scored on the three-yard touchdown run by Shepherd. The drive was highlighted by a 34-yard reception toto push the ball into Aggie territory. This reception marked the longest of Smith's career and broke his previous record of 14 yards set last week at Hampton (Oct. 9). Smith finished the game with two catches for 64 yards another career high.On the ensuing drive North Carolina A&T had one first down before being forced to punt. During the attempt freshmanbroke through the Aggies defensive line and got a hand on the ball. Kennesaw State recovered the block on its 39-yard line. This was the 10blocked punt in Kennesaw State's seven-year history and first since Mar. 13 2021 versus Charleston Southern.The seven total points in the half marked the lowest combined score in a Kennesaw State football game at halftime since its inaugural season in 2015 versus Garner Webb (Oct. 17). The Owls' defense allowed only eight rushing yards through two quarters.Kennesaw State would strike again late in the third quarter on a six-play 44-yard drive. Shepherd found Smith again on a 29-yard pass that moved the ball to the one-yard line. Shepherd pushed the ball in for a score on the next play recording his 11rushing touchdown of the year.The Owls entered the fourth quarter up 14-0. Prior to today's game KSU held a record of 52-1 when having a lead going into the last frame. The Aggies were unable to beat-the-odds and extended the Owls' current win streak to 19 when leading after three quarters.The Owls secured their seventh consecutive win inside Fifth Third Bank Stadium. The team is back in action next Saturday Oct. 23 for a Big South road matchup with the Campbell Camels.

WHY A&T DIDN'T GET THE ""W"": The Aggies never got the running game started. A week after three running backs combined for 186 yards the Aggies posted a season-low 31 yards. It was the worst Aggies rushing performance since they rushed for 20 yards in a 42-20 loss at Norfolk State on Sept. 30 2006. In addition the lack of a running game made play-action ineffective forcing the Aggies into a season-high 35 pass attempts.

WHY KSU GOT THE ""W"": The Owls gave the ball away three times on Saturday with two fumbles and one interception. However the Aggies could not capitalize on any of those turnovers. On the first KSU turnover the Aggies got it 1st-and-10 at their 37-yard line and lost a yard in three plays. After another KSU fumble the Aggies took over at the KSU 44 but Andrew Brown eventually missed a 36-yard field goal. Finally a Henry Daniel interception gave the Aggies the ball at their own 47 but moved the ball only six yards in three plays.

CRUCIAL: Down 14-0 with 13 minutes remaining in the ballgame the Aggies received the ball at their own 20. After 10 plays the Aggies faced a 3rd-and 11 at the KSU 24. Fowler connected with Ron Hunt  who just missed getting the first down to extend the drive. Therefore the Aggies faced a 4th-and-inches from the KSU 14. The Aggies rushed to the line to run a quarterback sneak. It appeared Bhayshul Tuten pushed Fowler over the marker for the first down. But after a measurement it was determined Fowler was a few inches shy of the first down. Replay officials upheld the call and the Owls took over with only 6:16 remaining in the game.

THE STORY: KENNESAW Ga – The North Carolina A&T football team failed to score a point for the first time in seven years. Thirteenth-ranked Kennesaw State University held the Aggies to just 21 yards rushing in a 14-0 win over the Aggies at KSU's homecoming at Fifth Third Bank Stadium.

The Aggies had gone 70 straight games without being shut out. The last time it happened the Aggies were ironically in Atlanta where they lost to S.C. State 13-0 at the old Georgia Dome.

A&T had their opportunities despite the Owls solid defensive play. The Aggies had an excellent opening drive. They converted 4 of 5 third downs and Jalen Fowler (6-foot-4 235 R-JR QB Spartanburg S.C.) completed 4 of 7 passes for 58 yards including a 32-yard completion to Zach Leslie (6-4 210 GR Lawndale N.C.).

After moving the ball 67 yards over 16 plays the Aggies called on the ordinarily reliable placekicker Andrew Brown (5-10 167 FR Lexington N.C.) to give them a 3-0 lead. But with a swirling wind throughout the stadium Brown the reigning two-time Big South Conference special teams player of the week missed to the right.

The Aggies defense gave the A&T another opportunity to score in the second quarter when defensive lineman Karfa Kaba (6-3 265 R-SR Laurinburg N.C) recovered a fumble by KSU quarterback Xavier Shepherd at the KSU 44.

Aided by a KSU unsportsmanlike penalty the Aggies moved the ball to the 19. But Brown missed from 36 yards.

Meanwhile the Owls capitalized on fourth downs and good field position. The Owls converted all five of the fourth downs they attempted on Saturday night. That includes a 4th-and-2 from the Aggies 40 in the second quarter as Shepherd looked stopped at first on the quarterback keeper before he lounged forward for the first down.

Shepherd then completed a 34-yard pass to running back Irving Smith before running it in from three yards out to give KSU a 7-0 lead.

""No one has stopped them on 4th-and-1 all season"" said Washington about the Owls who are fifth in the nation in fourth-down conversions. They are 100 percent so that didn't start with us tonight. It's a part of their offense. It's what the triple option does.""

KSU's second score was scored thanks partly to good field position which the Owls seemed to have throughout the second half. After a 37-yard punt from Mike Rivers (6-0 170 JR Wilmington N.C.) the Owls took over at the Aggies 44. Another completion from Shepherd to Smith this one for 29 yards set up a 1-yard TD run by Shepherd to give the Owls a 14-0 lead.

The Aggies had one more chance to score. The Aggies went 11 plays in 66 yards and it had the ball 4th-and-1 from the KSU 14. A&T rushed to the line to run a quarterback sneak. With teammate Bhayshul Tuten (5-9 191 FR Paulsboro N.J.) pushing him from behind it appeared Fowler had the yard he needed.

Instead the play led to a measurement that showed the Aggies about four inches shy of a first down. Replay officials upheld the call giving the Owls a 1st-and-10 with 6:16 remaining in the game.

""I thought we had it"" said Washington. ""We wanted to challenge it but the official said when didn't have to. It was disappointing.'

The Owls secured three first downs on the drive to run out the clock.

The Aggies (3-3 2-1 Big South) lost in Big South Conference play for the first time. The Owls improved to 5-1 overall and 2-0 in the Big South.

QUOTABLE: ""They were good tonight. I didn't think they (KSU) were this good coming into the game. We thought they were a good defense but not shutout good. I thought their movement up front was very good. But I thought a lot of the stuff that happened was on us. I thought they knocked us off the ball tonight. We allowed too much penetration so it was more of what we did not do.""

(Oct. 16 2021) – Atlanta United 2 lost 4-2 to Memphis 901 FC Saturday night at AutoZone Park. Abdoulaye Diop scored his first goal for the club Ajani Fortune netted his second of the season and 16-year-old academy player Luke Brennan made his professional debut. The loss eliminated Atlanta from playoff contention.

ATL UTD 2 weathered a series of Memphis attacks in the first half before finding a penalty against the run of play just before the break. Fortune attempted a long diagonal ball from right side but it was picked off by 901 FC’s Mark Segbers. However he hit a weak back pass to the goalkeeper and David Mejia ran on to the ball as he dashed into the penalty area. Segbers immediately fouled Mejia giving ATL UTD 2 a penalty kick and earning a yellow card for denying him the opportunity. Diop stepped to the spot and scored with strike to left side of goal. Cody Cropper got a piece of it but it was hit with plenty of pace and found the back of the net.

Memphis equalized in the 53rd minute. Kadeem Dacres nearly rounded Vicente Reyes but Josh Bauer cleared the ball away from goal. However Roland Lamah collected ball inside box and put a shot on goal where Caleb Wiley appeared to clear it off the line but it was ruled to have crossed the line.

Memphis took the lead just three minutes later after Atlanta failed to clear a cross and Dacres scored at the back post. Laurent Kissiedou slipped Kyle Murphy in into the box behind ATL UTD 2’s defense where he scored to extend Memphis’ lead to 3-1 in the 60th minute.

Fortune pulled one goal back in the 64th minute. ATL UTD 2 gained possession after a Memphis throw in and charged forward as Mejia and Robbie Mertz combined down the middle of the field. As Mejia entered the 18-yard box the ball was poked away but Fortune followed the play and curled a shot into the left side of goal for his second of the season.

Memphis restored its two-goal lead in the 69th minute. Dacres led a counterattack and played Murphy down the right side. Murphy put a shot on goal where Reyes saved it but he pushed it directly into the path of Alan Winn where he tapped home the goal from inside the six-yard box.

ATL UTD 2 (8-14-10 34 points) will return to action for its season finale Wednesday Oct. 20 against FC Tulsa at ONEOK Field (ESPN+ 8:00 p.m. ET).

If you’ve ever driven through Allegan on your way to Lake Michigan chances are you’ve seen this structure. I know it as the former Shiver Shack perhaps you know it as the now-closed Sweet Temptations but this little hut located just off M-89 in Allegan originally started as the Brown Derby.

The Brown Derby was a local drive-in burger joint one of only two in Allegan at the time. The other being Corky’s Drive-In which is still operational to this day and has been voted the Best Burger in West Michigan.

The Brown Derby used to be a hoppin’ joint back in the day. My mom even recalls local bands playing on the rooftop on Saturday nights. After closing sometime in the early 80s The Brown Derby morphed into Millie’s Aloha. Millie’s was another burger joint but this time new owners of the Belden family ran it with a Hawaiian flair!

Once Millie’s closed in 1993 the building changed hands several times with each subsequent new owner convinced they could make mini-golf happen there. Eventually the Fortney family turned the hut into an ice cream shop known as JJ’s Shiver Shack. Many celebrations took place at the Shiver Shack including several of my own birthday parties. Both my sisters even started their first jobs at the Shiver Shack!

After selling the Shiver Shack the new owners continued the ice cream tradition this time branding it as Sweet Temptations. In 2020 Sweet Temptations opened in a bigger location just down the road from the original location leaving the hut once again empty and the mini-golf course out back inoperable.

What’s next for this unique space?

An application dated November 2020 shows the space is set to be converted into a retail marijuana establishment- one of four sets to open in Allegan within the coming year. Coincidentally the lot is located next to a McDonald’s for easy munchies access! Where’s your favorite spot to grab a tasty treat in Allegan these days?

NASA's Lucy mission embarks on a 12-year journey to explore the Trojan asteroids two separate groups orbiting just beyond the planet Jupiter. The Lucy spacecraft will study eight asteroids during the mission duration which is the most asteroids for any singular spacecraft mission to date.

The question is often raised as to 'why do we explore our solar system?' What is the purpose and what do we hope to learn from Lucy's mission to this unexplored area of our solar system? Scientists strive to uncover more about the beginnings and changes to the planets and our solar system with the long-term goal of becoming a multi-planetary species. Asteroids are literally the fossils of early planet formation. The Trojan asteroids offer a unique opportunity to study multiple bodies with varying characteristics. These asteroids range in color from grays to reds indicating where they formed in relation to the Sun. Yet they ended up grouped together in a mutual orbit over 530 million miles (853 million km) away from the Sun. The mission's principal investigators hope to learn more about how the planets were created and ended up in their positions within the solar system by examining each asteroid's surfaces ages and compositions.

As the first solar-powered spacecraft operating further from the Sun than any previous one Lucy's solar panels are expansive. Once fully extended the two solar panels each nearly 24 feet (7.3 meters) in diameter could cover a five-story building. The mission success will hinge on the proper deployment of the solar panels approximately one hour following launch. Once operational in space the panels will generate up to 504 watts of electricity – equal to the necessary power for the washing machine you use.

The spacecraft and mission's name Lucy is for the fossilized skeleton of an early female hominid discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. The skeleton in turn was named Lucy when one of the expedition members sang The Beatles song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" in celebration of their find.

Keeping with the uniqueness of the Lucy mission overall the spacecraft will carry a plaque as a time capsule for future descendents of Earth to discover. The plaque shows the mission date and position of the planets on its launch date. It also includes messages from various influencers scientists artists poets and activists from the present and recent past including all four members of The Beatles. With Lucy predicted to stay in a stable orbit once the twelve-year mission is completed this plaque may be a reminder of our times' thousands of years from now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL3NjaWVuY2Uvc3RvcnkvbmFzYS1sdWN5LXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyZWQtc3BhY2VjcmFmdC1wcm9iZS10by1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZS1qdXBpdGVyLWFzdGVyb2lkcy0xODY1NDEyLTIwMjEtMTAtMTbSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWF0b2RheS5pbi9hbXAvc2NpZW5jZS9zdG9yeS9uYXNhLWx1Y3ktc29sYXItcG93ZXJlZC1zcGFjZWNyYWZ0LXByb2JlLXRvLWludmVzdGlnYXRlLWp1cGl0ZXItYXN0ZXJvaWRzLTE4NjU0MTItMjAyMS0xMC0xNg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nasa to launch first space probe to study Jupiter asteroids,"Nasa was set on Saturday to launch a spacecraft called Lucy on a 12-year mission to explore for the first time a group of rocky bodies known as the Jupiter Trojan asteroids gathering new insights into the solar system's formation.

Additionally Lucy will do three Earth flybys for gravity assists making it the first spacecraft to return to our planet's vicinity from the outer solar system.

""Each one of those asteroids each one of those pristine samples provide a part of the story of the solar system the story of us"" Thomas Zurbuchen associate administrator of Nasa's Science Mission told reporters on a call.

Lucy's first encounter will be in 2025 with the asteroid Donaldjohanson in the Main Belt between Mars and Jupiter. The body is named for the discoverer of the Lucy fossil.

Between 2027 and 2033 it will encounter seven Trojan asteroids -- five in the swarm that leads to Jupiter and two in the swarm that trails the gas giant.

The largest of them is about 60 miles (95 kilometres) in diameter.

Lucy will fly by its target objects within 250 miles (400 kilometres) of their surfaces and use its onboard instruments and large antenna to investigate their geology including composition mass density and volume.

A DIAMOND IN THE SKY

The Jupiter Trojan asteroids thought to number well over 7000 are leftover raw materials from the formation of our system's giant planets -- Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune.

Scientists believe they hold vital clues about the composition and physical conditions in the protoplanetary disk from which all the Sun's planets including Earth formed.

They are broadly grouped into two swarms — the leading swarm is one-sixth a lap ahead of Jupiter while the trailing swarm is one-sixth behind.

""One of the really surprising things about the Trojans when we started to study them from the ground is how different they are from one another particularly with their colours"" said Hal Levison the mission's key scientist.

Some are grey while others are red — with the differences indicating how far away from the Sun they might have formed before assuming their present trajectory.

Lucy the fossil was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974 and helped shed light on human evolution. The space mission's name was chosen with the hope that it would shed light on the solar system's evolution.

The paleoanthropologists who discovered the hominin remains named her after the Beatles' song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" which they were playing loudly at the expedition camp.

Lucy the probe will in fact be carrying a diamond beam splitter into the sky -- the Lucy Thermal Emission Spectrometer (L'TES) which detects far-infrared radiation to map asteroid surface temperatures.

By measuring the temperature at different times of day the team can deduce physical properties such as how much dust sand or rock is present.

The 550-kg Xihe satellite will monitor the Sun for three years. Until now China has had a solar monitoring network on the ground however it did not access to the optical data outside the atmosphere. The Xihe satellite the first solar observation satellite by China will aid the country to fill that gap.

About China’s first solar observation satellite The Xihe satellite is China’s first solar observation satellite. It is equipped with an imaging spectrometer known as the Chinese H-alpha Solar Explorer (CHASE) that will enable observation of the deep-red H-Alpha line of the solar spectrum thereby providing data for scientists to study solar flares or eruptions on the surface of the Sun. The Xihe satellite has been developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). The model of the satellite was put up for a showcase at the Zhuhai Air Show in September 2021.

Xihe Satellite: Naming Weight Lifespan Orbit The satellite has been named after a Chinese mythological figure Xihe the Mother Goddess of the Gods of the Sun. The Xihe satellite weighing 550-kg (110 lbs) has been designed for a lifespan of three years. It will observe the Sun until the solar maximum in 2025. It will be in a Sun-synchronous orbit around the Earth. The Xihe satellite will record the changes in speed and atmospheric temperature during solar eruptions provide data for studying the dynamics and physical mechanism of eruptions. Ulta-stability and ultra-high accuracy are some of the key salient features of the Xihe satellite.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL25ld3Mvb3Bpbmlvbi9zdW5zaGluZS1zZWN0b3Itd2h5LXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyLWlzLXRoZS1icmlnaHRlc3Qtc3BvdC1pbi1pbmRpYXMtcmVuZXdhYmxlLWVuZXJneS12aXNpb24tNDMyNjcxMy5odG1s0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxOC5jb20vYW1wL25ld3Mvb3Bpbmlvbi9zdW5zaGluZS1zZWN0b3Itd2h5LXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyLWlzLXRoZS1icmlnaHRlc3Qtc3BvdC1pbi1pbmRpYXMtcmVuZXdhYmxlLWVuZXJneS12aXNpb24tNDMyNjcxMy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sunshine Sector: Why Solar Power is the Brightest Spot in India’s Renewable Energy Vision,"From Konark in the east to Modhera in the west and from Anantnag’s Martand temple in the north to Suryanar Kovil Kumbakonam in the south the Sun God has been part of Indian life from time immemorial. While sunlight has always been associated with health energy and prosperity in common belief it is only in the last few years that India has started to tap into literal solar energy.

Given India’s tropical geography harnessing the power of sunrays for the country’s ever-growing energy requirements was always a no-brainer. The National Solar Mission launched in 2010 took the first steps towards formally tapping into naturally abundant solar energy. In the last few years India has taken a place of prominence in this key component of a renewable power shift that’s underway globally.

At the Conference of Parties or COP21 in Paris in 2015 India outlined its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) to achieve its broader carbon goals. India’s fourth INDC is dedicated to renewable power and it states: “To achieve about 40 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and low-cost international finance including from Green Climate Fund (GCF).”

From 2 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity in 2014 India now has 44 GW of installed solar capacity. Although the near-term target of 100 GW has been impacted by two years of Covid-19 induced roadblocks India has pledged to install 450 GW of renewable power by 2030. A substantial part of this target will be met via solar power.

That India attaches the highest importance to the growth of the solar sector was also underscored recently by Prime Minister Narendra Modi meeting Mark Widmar CEO of First Solar on his September trip to the United States where the Quad leaders met. Widmar was one of only five CEOs with whom PM Modi interacted on this trip.

As the economy emerges from the shock of the pandemic there have been encouraging developments which indicate that there is renewed interest in India’s solar ambition and scaling. Both the government and the private sector efforts are coming together in this critical area and at the right time just as the economic momentum picks up.

In April this year the government approved the implementation of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme titled ‘National Programme on High-Efficiency Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Modules’. This PLI will aim to achieve the manufacturing capacity of GW scale in high-efficiency solar PV modules with an outlay of Rs 4500 crore. As per media reports nineteen companies had bid for this PLI across areas like manufacturing polysilicon wafer and cells and modules. This represents the value chain for establishing solar plants.

Just this week the government gave a go-ahead for an expression of interest for a 1 gigawatt-hour battery energy storage system as a pilot project. As the experience of countries that have a high mix of solar shows energy storage is a critical part of maintaining a stable grid that feeds from solar power. Large-scale storage solutions will help in the greater adoption of solar power across the economy.

Coinciding with the policy push India’s largest private-sector conglomerate Reliance recently invested $29 million as a strategic Series C lead investor in Germany-based NexWafe a manufacturer of wafers for solar cells. Reliance has also recently acquired Norway-based REC Solar Holdings from China National Bluestar. These manufacturing investments indicate a shift in the private-sector approach to vertical integration in solar energy.

The fundraising and investing spree continues in enhancing renewable capacity otherwise. Reliance in yet another investment recently bought a 40% stake in Sterling & Wilson Solar a Shapoorji Pallonji group company. Adani Green has acquired SB Energy in India’s largest renewables deal pegged at $3.5 billion. UK-based Actis a large investor in the renewables space in India is set to commit an additional $850 million to this sector over the next few years. Acme Power a leading Indian solar firm is investing in green hydrogen in a big way. ReNew Power recently became India’s largest publicly traded renewables company listing on NASDAQ.

India has also recognised the importance of showcase projects powered by solar energy. The Puratchi Thalaivar Dr MG Ramachandran Central Railway Station in Chennai meets 100% of its day’s energy demand via solar power. Kochi Airport became the first airport globally to run exclusively on solar power a few years ago. Delhi Metro has been using solar power from a large solar plant in Rewa Madhya Pradesh for its operational as well as auxiliary power requirements.

Since 2019 India has been running the Pradhan Mantri-Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) programme. This scheme aims to solarise the agricultural power requirement by promoting solar water pumps. The solarisation of agricultural feeders themselves is being tried by several states.

India has also taken the international lead in mainstreaming solar energy for better environmental outcomes and reducing fossil fuel dependency. The International Solar Alliance (ISA) is one of the two treaty-based international organisations based in India. Set up with joint sponsorship from France the ISA is working on several initiatives to popularise and catalyse the adoption of solar energy globally. Today 80 countries have signed and ratified the ISA framework agreement.

Given a facilitative policy environment and an ever-growing demand-side activity it was a matter of time before the supply-side advancements happened on the manufacturing part of the solar energy landscape. With an ambitious solar power installation target there’s a big local market to tap over the next decade. Additionally India is also leading the way for global innovation and solar adoption push. India is well-positioned to become the global manufacturing hub of low-cost high-energy solar panels.

CLEVELAND — Speaking to reporters after the game Cleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski discussed his team's 37-14 loss to the Arizona Cardinals at FirstEnergy Stadium.

What follows is a full transcript of Stefanski's postgame press conference courtesy of the Cleveland Browns Media Relations department.

“Injuries (RB) Kareem (Hunt) with the calf there… All of these injuries we have to get some imaging on them to know the severity. (QB) Baker (Mayfield) was the left shoulder and (LB) Jeremiah (Owusu-Koramoah) was the right ankle. Again I will update you as you as I get information. Bottom line is first of all credit to the Cardinals. We got beat. They did a nice job. Their players and coaches did a nice job and we got beat. Minus-three turnover margin and 13 points off of turnovers. We are a 3-3 football team and we played like it. We were just very very average and that is my responsibility to get it fixed. That is what we have to do because we have to turn right around and come back in here Thursday night and find a way. Really disappointed. Again we just have to find a way to clean this stuff up.”

On if it is good to play on Thursday night or if the team needs more time for injured players to heal:

“These Thursday night games everybody is in the same boat. The guys have to fight scratch and claw to get to Thursday night. It is hard but the bottom line is we have a game and we are going to meet tomorrow and start on the Broncos first thing in the morning.”

On if there is any concern about RB Kareem Hunt calf injury potentially being an Achilles injury or if it is simply a calf injury:

“Calf.”

On Beckham’s shoulder injury after returning to play:

“Yeah I do not have much more information. Like you said he came back in but we will have more information tomorrow.”

On if RB Nick Chubb might be able to play Thursday particularly after Hunt was carted off of the field today:

“I do not know. I have to see how the next 48 hours go.”

On the Browns pass defense in the past two games:

“Anytime you lose – and we have lost these last two games – we have bunch of areas that we have to address and we have to fix. The answer is never one thing but we have to get to the bottom of it. Again that is my responsibility to ultimately get to the bottom of all of this and then give the guys an opportunity to go play and give them an opportunity to succeed. I do not think I did that today.”

On the impact of not converting on fourth down specifically in the red zone:

“We have not been good on fourth down. It is frustrating. It is another one that we have to fix. We have not done a good job. I have to get guys open is the truth.”

On if the Browns’ defensive struggles are more concerning given the number of open opposing WRs for big plays in the past two weeks:

“Listen we lost the game and we lost last week so there is a concern. We need to fix it in the areas that we identify we need to fix and we have to get them corrected.”

On the four defensive penalties on the Cardinals scoring drive:

“I would have to look at the four to give you a better answer. We have to play clean. We did not play clean. We can’t make it close for the officials and I thought too many times we made it close.”

On if he noticed if Browns players were getting bothered by the officiating:

“I did not see the players get bothered by it no.”

On how many days the team will be on the practice field this week:

“Typically what you will do is we will walkthrough tomorrow have a version of a practice on Tuesday and then likely a walkthrough or maybe a little bit more on Wednesday.”

On QB Baker Mayfield’s two fumbles and one interception:

“I would have to look at them. We offensively have to take care of the ball. We were doing a pretty good job of it going into this game but to have three versus a team that had taken the ball away that is frustrating. The plays itself I would have to look at each of them.”

On game planning knowing the Browns would not potentially have the two starting Ts:

“We had a decent idea that those guys (T Jedrick Wills Jr. and T Jack Conklin) were not going to make it so I would tell you that is our job as coaches to find a way. Whoever is available to us we have to find a way. That is where we have to be problem solvers. Those guys battled their butts off. Thursday night we have to get the crew ready to go. We have to get back out there and whoever is out there we have to go find a way.”

On using empty formations on offense early in the game:

“They were in some big personnel so there were some advantageous looks we felt to spread them out.”

On if he still has faith that defensive coordinator Joe Woods can fix the Browns defense:

“Yes. We are a 3-3 football team which means we are average across the board so we all have to get better.”

On the message to the team after losing back-to-back games for the first time since he has been head coach:

“Pretty simple for this one is we got beat. We got outplayed. We got outcoached. Tip your cap to the Cardinals. That is a good football team. We got beat and it does not feel good but we have to lick our wounds we have to come in tomorrow and move on. That is just how you have to do it when you have a game Thursday night.”

On Beckham’s performance and the incompletion on fourth-and-four in the fourth quarter:

“I would have to look at it obviously but there are some opportunities and he made a couple plays on the ball. Again on those fourth downs I have to make sure we are putting the guys in better position.”

On the Hail Mary at the end of the first half:

“That was a big play and even the last completion to WR Anthony Schwartz on the sideline there helped. Baker did a nice job of buying time and put plenty of air under it and (WR) Donovan (Peoples-Jones) made a nice play. Not enough plays out there on the field. That is where we have to do a better job as coaches. We have to make sure that we are putting these guys in positions to succeed.”

On if he expected Cardinals Head Coach Kliff Kingsbury’s absence might affect their operation:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vbGVhZGVycy8yMDIxLzEwLzE2L3RoZS1maXJzdC1iaWctZW5lcmd5LXNob2NrLW9mLXRoZS1ncmVlbi1lcmHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The first big energy shock of the green era,"N EXT MONTH world leaders will gather at the COP 26 summit saying they mean to set a course for net global carbon emissions to reach zero by 2050. As they prepare to pledge their part in this 30-year endeavour the first big energy scare of the green era is unfolding before their eyes.

The panic is a reminder that modern life needs abundant energy: without it bills become unaffordable homes freeze and businesses stall. The panic has also exposed deeper problems as the world shifts to a cleaner energy system including inadequate investment in renewables and some transition fossil fuels rising geopolitical risks and flimsy safety buffers in power markets.

Beckham hurt his right shoulder in the second quarter of the Browns' 37-14 loss. He re-entered the action with 9:55 left in the third quarter.

A three-time Pro Bowl selection Beckham finished with five catches on eight targets for 79 yards.

Quarterback Baker Mayfield said he didn't know at first whether Beckham would return.

“I could tell he got up kind of gingerly"" Mayfield said. ""I went in at halftime asked him how he was doing and he was going to come back in. He's tough so he wants to be in there playing and helping us out.”

Cleveland Browns quarterback hurt again:Baker Mayfield says injured shoulder 'feels like s***' but he expects to play Thursday night

The Browns had announced Beckham was questionable to return to the game his fourth back since he suffered a season-ending torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee on Oct. 25 2020 against the Cincinnati Bengals.

Although coach Kevin Stefanski said he would have more information about Beckham's injury on Monday OBJ returning against the Cardinals (6-0) would seem to be a good sign he'll be able to play Thursday night when the Browns (3-3) host the Denver Broncos (3-3).

“He's a dog"" wide receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones said. ""The guy gets hurt and that affects your body and your mental game but he goes back out there and keeps fighting which says a lot about him and the way he feels about the team.”

With 9:24 left in the first half Beckham caught a 17-yard pass from Mayfield and fell on his right shoulder as he was tackled by cornerback Marco Wilson.

Beckham immediately ran to the sideline and was shown on Fox's telecast grimacing while he sat on the Browns' bench.

“He was walking off screaming at the top of his lungs” Fox sideline reporter Laura Okmin said of Beckham on the television broadcast.

Beckham was later examined in the medical tent on the sideline. After Mayfield threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Peoples-Jones allowing the Browns to cut their deficit to 20-7 with 5:06 left in the second quarter Beckham jogged to the locker room with medical personnel.

Another key Cleveland Browns player hurt:Running back Kareem Hunt carted off against Cardinals with calf injury

On Beckham's second play back in the game he caught a 24-yard pass from Mayfield and home crowd chanted ""OBJ.""

Beckham didn't fare as well on fourth-and-4 from the Cardinals 7-yard line. He failed to secure a pass from Mayfield creating a turnover on downs with 12:06 left in the fourth quarter.

“I would have to look at it obviously but there are some opportunities and he made a couple plays on the ball"" Stefanski said. ""On those fourth downs I have to make sure we are putting the guys in better position.”

But while we have to wait three years for the return of the world's greatest sporting event (or just four months for the winter rendition) Milwaukee won't have to wait nearly that long to see the return of one of its signature events as the Gold Over America tour will bring some of the globe's most incredible gymnasts to Fiserv Forum on Saturday Oct. 16.

This year's tour brings plenty of remarkable athletes worth flipping out about – including the GOAT Simone Biles viral gymnastics phenom Katelyn Ohashi 2016 team gold-medalist Laurie Hernandez and recent Tokyo Olympians Jade Carey Grace McCallum MyKayla Skinner and Jordan Chiles. Before she takes the mat in Milwaukee we got a chance to chat with Chiles about her experience in Tokyo her plans for the future the increasing spotlight on mental health in athletics and where she plans to put her Tokyo silver medal.

OnMilwaukee: I have to start with the obvious question: What was it like going to the Tokyo Olympics – and not just the Olympics but one of the strangest Olympics in its history?

Jordan Chiles: It was an interesting experience I do have to say – but I loved every last minute of it. If I could I would go back and do it all over again. I think honestly the only reason why it was an interesting experience was like that was because of yes COVID and all of that. But at the end of the day we all just had to realize that we made it to a huge gymnastics competition and for all the accomplishments we’d done in the past this was our reward. So everything that we just did was very very memorable and we have a lot of memories we’ll take back from that. And it was an amazing experience.

And not only did you take back memories you took back a silver medal. Do you know where you’re going to put that or do you have any special plans for it?

As of right now I really don’t know where I’m going to put it. It’s gonna be hidden for sure and it’s only coming out occasionally when I need it come out. But other than that it’s gonna be hidden and nobody will ever figure out where it’s at. (laughs)

How much exploring did you get to do in Tokyo? Was there any of that at all and if not how did you pass the time in between events games and the downtime?

Unfortunately we weren’t allowed to sightsee because of COVID protocols. We had to stay in our bubble and we had to quarantine for 14 days before we could really do anything – and by the end of that 14 days we were already going home. So there was really no time for us to go out and we couldn’t even watch the other Olympic games that were happening because we had to stay in our bubble that we had.

Personally I would go back as a vacation to go and sightsee and visit little areas around there. Their culture is amazing; the people are amazing and so nice. I love it. Other than that I would say ten out of ten – recommend. If you’re trying to go on a vacation to Tokyo go – because it’s amazing.

Is there a part of you that feels like you missed out on the spectacle of the Olympics on some level?

Yes and no. I wanted to watch the other games that were happening – especially track and field. Other than that we were still able to go to the Olympic Village. We were still able to meet other people if we were in the Village. But honestly this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing so not every Olympics is going to be the same. You’re going to meet different people; you’re going to see different things. Obviously this one’s a lot different compared to the other ones because of the whole pandemic and everything – and hopefully it’s going to be the last one. But this one is going to be written in a lot of history books because of what happened and how it all happened.

Yeah you’re always going to be a part of such a moment in history – which has to feel strange and exciting and weird at the same time I imagine.

(Laughs) It does. It is very interesting how I’m going to be in those moments with everyone else – who is way above me with what they’ve accomplished. But being in that same world is gonna be really cool.

I don’t know if this is looking ahead too early but are you already looking ahead to Paris 2024 then? What’s the future for you?

So as of right now I’m not looking too far into Paris because we have the tour. That’s the thing I’m focusing on right now because that’s another huge accomplishment: going on a gymnastics tour and being able to visit different cities and showing the world “Look this is me; I have a whole different side of me.” And then I have school; I go off to UCLA in the winter so that’s going to be really fun and cool.

But I can tell you that ’24 has been up in the air. I’ve thought of it but I’m just taking things day by day month by month just to see how my body and my mind can stay focused. Because that’s what it’s all about: making sure you’re healthy in both ways. But we’ll see! I can’t give you a specific answer but we’ll see. You never know. (laughs)

You brought up the mental and physical sides of the sport which were obviously under the magnifying glass this past Olympics. What were your feelings about the conversation going on around everything? Was it frustrating to hear the takes or was it nice to have that information – like the “twisties” – out there for the general public to know about?

I’m happy it’s out. I’m 100 percent all for what had happened. Because there’s a lot of things that the outside world doesn’t know about gymnasts and what we go through behind the scenes. I wish everybody could see behind the scenes and understand why we do a lot of the things we do. Because then they’d understand “Oh so this person did this; that makes sense because of what was going on.”

Mental health is something that should’ve been spoken upon a long time ago but you have to have that right person – and Simone was that right person. She was able to go out there and speak and do what she did. She’s the GOAT for a reason. She’s the GOAT in many different ways. There’s different sides of her and there are a lot of sides that people have yet to see – and I’m happy that this side came out and that people were able to see that.

Yes there were rude comments here or there but those people don’t exist they don’t matter because she is who is she. So having that ability to come out and do what she did was an amazing thing and it inspired a lot of people. It inspired a whole new direction for her. That’s an amazing thing. Naomi Osaka: What she did was an amazing thing. It’s important for everybody to make sure they’re healthy in any type of way: mentally physically emotionally. So having the ability to come out and speak on that is an amazing thing.

I just feel like if I was feeling any level of discomfort or uncertainty or mentally in a strange place I can’t imagine a worse thing to do than jumping and flipping several feet into the air and trying to land it. It can be a dangerous sport if you’re not smart about those things.

Yes exactly. And I wish people could see that. But they think that we do a lot of this stuff for them. If they want us to perform in a certain way we have to be healthy in order for them to be happy. It is what it is. They’re human. They’re people. You can’t control what they say. All we can do is control what we do with ourselves.

As for this tour are the routines going to be similar to what they saw at the Olympics or is this going to be new material new show new approach?

We’re not going to be doing our Olympic routines because that’s going to be a lot considering that we’re going to over 30 cities. It’s going to be kind of like a pop concert. Think of Beyonce going to every city and just enjoying what she does. That’s what we’re going to be doing. There’s going to be a bunch of LED lights spoken word social media interactions – it’s going to be really fun. It’s going to be something you wouldn’t expect – but you’re going to be like “I want to go to that tour again next year.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZXRpbnNpZ2h0cy5ldC1lZGdlLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LXRyZW5kcy1pbXBhY3RpbmctcGF5bWVudHMtYW5kLWNvbW1lcmNlL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vZXRpbnNpZ2h0cy5ldC1lZGdlLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LXRyZW5kcy1pbXBhY3RpbmctcGF5bWVudHMtYW5kLWNvbW1lcmNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Technology Trends Impacting Payments and Commerce - ET Edge Insights,

She happily went back into the office full time last month.

“In the kind of work I do it’s beneficial to collaborate in person with colleagues” said Brett 40 of Northern Liberties. “Working from home made everything 10 times harder. Instead of being able to pop over to someone’s desk and have a five-minute conversation where you resolve something it took three days to get a Zoom on the schedule.”

She found hours of online meetings exhausting and missed the energy from collaborating in person. She also prefers a separation between home and work. Brett who has obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD craves the structure and routine of going into the office.

“It benefits my mental health more to have to leave my house get on the subway be in a different environment and engage with people” said Brett who also cohosts the mental-health-focused podcast Mind in View.

As companies prepare their return-to-work plans employers and employees must include in the equation the unique mental health benefits offered by each work style. Any and all plans are weighed against the health risk. But although the pandemic has proven that some workplaces can successfully function remotely some workers nonetheless still crave the collaboration and socializing that comes from reporting to an office. Other workers never want to return to commuting and enjoy being able to do a load of laundry between meetings.

If there’s one conclusion that can be drawn thus far about the post-pandemic workplace one size does not fit all and flexibility is key.

Brett is part of the 63% of respondents of a LinkedIn survey who cited collaboration as the main reason for returning to the workplace. According to the survey which was conducted between May 22 and June 4 socializing with colleagues and clients was close behind at 62% while looking forward to doing focused work enjoying workplace perks and advancing faster in a career were tied at 47%.

For those who reported a positive experience working remotely throughout the pandemic 49% said they believed they were safe from COVID-19 45% felt less stress without the anxiety of a daily commute and 34% feel happier at home the survey found.

A preference to remote work is especially strong among millennials and Gen Zers according to a May report from Citrix Systems a workplace software company.

About 90% of respondents born after 1981 said they have no interest in returning to office work full time once the pandemic is over. More than half prefer a hybrid model that lets them work from home most of the time while 18% want a hybrid model that has them work from the office more.

FMC Corp. chose a hybrid model when phasing its 450 to 500 employees back to its Center City corporate office in June. The plan included feedback from employees through live webcasts and conversations with department heads.

“It allows employees up to two days of remote work whether from home or some other remote location and three days in the office” said Ken Gedaka FMC vice president of communications. “We heard that flexibility was something employees were very much interested in.”

The company also added flexible hours to accommodate employees’ individual needs. For example a parent can get a child to school and come in later and then stay later at the end of the day. Employees who prefer to work in the office for four or five days are able to do so. Beyond the pandemic FMC’s plan recognizes a shift in workplace trends.

“You can see where the general work environment is going with companies announcing much more flexibility for employees” Gedaka said. “We needed to listen to those trends and take action.”

Jeremy Tyler assistant professor of clinical psychiatry in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania said “employers should be mindful that it’s not going to be a one-size-fits-all for employees.”

“There will be some individuals very excited to get back and some folks who are going to be feeling stressed about the prospect of having to go back potentially full time” he said. “Both sides need to work together communicate and understand each other’s position.”

Megan Whitman has worked for Comcast for five years currently as a manager in the customer experience department. When the company created its return-to-work policy employees were surveyed for their preferences. Whitman’s department has opted to remain remote for the foreseeable future.

“Prior to the pandemic I was out all day from 8 am to 9 pm” said Whitman 31 of Brewerytown. “I don’t do that anymore. It’s nice to cut the commute time out and have more flexibility in terms of little breaks throughout the day.”

Whitman feels more productive now though she recognizes the need to create stronger boundaries between work and home life. Her dog Sadie and cat Riggins keep her company and she spends a lot of time with colleagues on Zoom but she understands the need for in-person socialization.

“It’s so easy to walk into my [home] office and look at stuff when it’s 9 p.m. or a time when I wouldn’t ordinarily work” she said. “And I have to make a special effort to get out to avoid not seeing human beings or leaving the house other than to walk the dog.”

With so many people having spent a year and a half working from home the transition back into an office five days a week could be daunting said Thea Gallagher clinical psychologist and cohost of Mind In View with Brett. A transitional period would give everyone time to adjust.

“Sometimes we fear change and transition” Gallagher said. “Both employers and employees should not make decisions out of fear because then you’re not hearing each other collaborating and working together to figure out what is best for everyone.”

With just seven employees Center City law firm Nochumson P.C. is now back in the office full time but employees have flexibility to work from home once a week.

“When people were exclusively working remotely we were doing really well” said managing partner Alan Nochumson. “But part of law is working together and physically being here. Especially from a training perspective because we do have a younger workforce that’s important.”

Now that Brett is back in the office she’s reflected on how things are different from when she worked from home.

“As with any big change there are moments of missing things including being able to walk my dog at lunch and saving money on to-go coffees” she said. “But in terms of my mental health I’ve already noticed an improvement just by going to a space where I can interact with others collaboratively get real-time feedback that isn’t in a vacuum and have authentic energy exchanges. Most important to me my home is my sacred space again untainted by the daily stressors of work.”

Jim’s first family home was Lanehead Farm Dalleagles near New Cumnock where his mum and dad and sister Ona farmed until the 1970s. Moving to The Knowe at Kirkconnel gave the family more scope to concentrate on hill sheep Welsh Black and Hereford cows.

Jim attended P7 at Kelloholm Primary and then moved to Sanquhar Academy. During these his formative years he honed his impressive negotiating skills before going to Wallacehall Academy as his final stop in compulsory education – there he gained his legendary Higher in woodwork!

After a year’s practical at Brocklie Craigie milking cows and socialising with local Young Farmers to form lifelong friendships he was all set for further study. Auchincruive agricultural college beckoned – where some of his antics such as letting pigs loose in the halls of residence and sinking boats on a college exchange are still part of family and college legend.

When he left Auchincruive he went to work with the Fatstock Marketing Corporation (FMC) and so his 40 years of working in the fatstock trade began. He served his apprenticeship in abattoirs across Scotland and then was out on the road in his wee Fiesta Sunburst rattling up and down farm roads in the South-west drumming up business.

Not long after this Jim met Sally Wallace at a dance at Auchincruive. He called the next day to ask her out but as Sally recalled when bravely delivering his eulogy: “I had a bit of a dilemma as my parents had always told me that there were only two boys that I wasn’t to go out with … and they were both called Jim Kennedy.”

Despite that inauspicious start they later married and their journey began at The Knowe with Jim farming full time. Around the farm Jim was able to fashion most things from wood – using that legendary qualification again – and some dodgy welding also helped keep things running.

Jim never let the grass grow under his feet and was always fond of coming up with new income streams. At one time farming rabbits was the route to fame and fortune. Sally recalled: “We had 200 rabbits eating like mad and a broken supply chain – cue rabbits going to a game dealer in Thornhill and many local children getting pet rabbits that were a bit larger than they expected!”

Their own family followed – Lauren was born in 1989 and Caroline in 1990 with son Wallace arriving in 1992 and he quickly became his right-hand man.

Diplomatic relations with Jim’s parents broke down and Jim went back out on the road with Lawrie and Symington procuring cattle for the then all-new Electronic Auction Systems Europe (EASE). The family then moved to Lyonston in 1991 and Jim applied his DIY skills and single-mindedness to the garden and another phase evolved.

Next ‘big idea’ was vegetable growing. Who else had leeks wrapped in disposable nappies in their polytunnel carrots growing in barrels and onions too big for a frying pan? The culmination of this was winning a UK national championship and him being crowned Cauliflower Dundee!

Jim also became involved in the local Round Table rising to chairman and having more mad adventures including rebuilding Santa’s sleigh – that Higher woodwork again – and is still used in Maybole every Christmas.

Around this time Jim and Sally started Carrick Primestock. Jim was out on the road and Sally worked at home on the myriad of paperwork that comes with buying and re-selling livestock. Carrick Primestock emerged as a reliable way of targetting cattle and sheep where they needed to go but only after they had spent many long days and long nights building the business procuring cattle and sheep from across scotland.

Jim was in his element meeting people talking on the phone drawing stock and being on the road. As a relentless communicator he was an early adopter of car phones and mobiles making family outings and gatherings punctuated by his mobile ringing – he was never too busy to return calls.

It wasn’t much of a surprise then that Jim also took a keen interest in agri-politics and his famous negotiating skills were put to use at the Cairnryan blockades flying the flag for Scottish beef against heavy imports of Irish beef. This interest ultimately led him to become the Scottish Beef Cattle Association’s national chairman. For a man that always said he didn’t do politics he always seemed to be in the thick of it!

Back at Lyonston the family started to diversify the business – back into farming! Calves were bought for the children and that’s when the next phase began. Carcase and live competitions usually saw Carrick Primestock at the top of the leaderboard at the likes of the Scottish Premier Meat Exhibition Scottish Winter Fair (LiveScot) Christmas shows and the Highland.

He won the prestigious Scotbeef Silver Steer for the best carcase at the Premier Meat Exhibition twice and on one of those occasions also won the Italian plaque the Aberdeen-Angus trophy and the lamb championship in one day.

Sheep were an enduring part of Jim’s life starting with Suffolks and Bluefaced Leicesters. After that Wallace and Jim soon became a force to be reckoned with in the sheep rings especially when Beltex and Charollais sheep arrived on the scene.

The Beltex breed is where Jim’s ‘obsession with big bottoms and sheep collided’ and the Kennedys made many friends and had lots of fun on weekends away at tup viewings and at shows culminating in his chairmanship of the Beltex Sheep Society.

Veteran Scottish farming champion John Cameron told The Scottish Farmer: “The Scottish livestock industry and indeed livestock producers throughout the industry will be deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Jim Kennedy.

“Jim had real comprehensive knowledge of both the sheep and cattle worlds and was always willing to give his good advice and help to anyone. He willingly gave of his expertise as a member of the council of the then newly-formed Scottish Beef Association and was also active in Beltex sheep circles.

“He didn’t suffer fools gladly and he always called a spade a spade but he was someone in whom you could have complete trust as well as enjoying his good company and many many people who benefited from his wise counsel and friendship will miss him greatly.”",,,,,,,,,

Robberson thanked “our wonderful group of employees for their work ethic and believing in the Robberson way of doing what is right ethically and morally. I would like to thank you our customers for your years of loyalty allowing us to grow and give back to the community.”

“Last but definitely not least I want to thank our partner vendors with whom we established long-term working relationships"" he said.

“I am pleased to say that the new owners Kendall Ford of Bend have retained our existing employees grandfathering their employment dates and benefits so you can look forward to the familiar faces you have seen over the years” Robberson wrote concluding his message by saying: “Thank you for a great 64 years.”

On Tuesday the Michigan Strategic Fund board approved $26 million in Good Jobs withholding for the Dearborn automaker as well as a smattering of other assessment exemptions totaling about $10 million. The state will forego all income taxes generated by the expansion for a period of up to 10 years.

In return Ford plans to invest $1.45 billion and create 3000 new jobs spread over two facilities in Dearborn and the city of Wayne. The company also says its considering Wayne as the location for a new autonomous vehicle production center according to a state memo.

“Ford is proud to be America’s number one producer of vehicles and the largest employer of UAW-represented autoworkers” Joe Hinrichs president of Ford said in a statement. “We appreciate the strong support from the State of Michigan and our local government partners as we continue to invest in our operations and people in Michigan.”

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called the Ford expansion “great news for Michigan auto workers their families and our economy as a whole”

The award of the Good Jobs incentive on Tuesday comes just two weeks before the program is set to sunset on Jan. 1 2020. Before adjourning for the year lawmakers failed to take up legislation from state Sen. Ken Horn (R-Frankenmuth) that would have extended the program and increased the cap to $500 million.

The Ford incentive leaves just $5.6 million left of the initial $200 million that had been allocated for the program according to figures from the Michigan Economic Development Corp. (MEDC) the quasi-governmental nonprofit that administers the state’s economic development incentives.

“We certainly are hopeful that the Legislature will take that up when they come back in the new year” said Jeff Mason president and CEO of the MEDC. “I think its a very effective tool and I think 11200 high paying jobs and $6.4 billion of private investment reflect that.”

Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles also received a Good Jobs for Michigan incentive as part of its metro Detroit expansion announced earlier this year.

What Ford India failed to achieve was sustainability.

BHPian pqr recently shared this with other enthusiasts.

However the findings put forth to members of the Team BHP here like any other study is susceptible to error.

On 9th September 2021 Ford has announced its exit from India. With more than 25 years of existence in India Ford has sold over 12 lakhs passenger vehicles here. Ford’s compatriot General Motors has sold around 8.8 lakhs cars in India under two different brands – first Opel and later Chevrolet before leaving the Indian market in 2017. Contrasting to this East Asian automotive companies have found a better foothold in the Indian market which Europeans are also struggling to achieve.

Entering later than Ford in the post economic liberalization era Hyundai has sold 5 times more cars in India till date and reached to 17% market share pinnacle of the Indian passenger vehicle (PV) industry. The Korean brand has even dwarfed the sales bar of Japanese global automotive giants (Toyota and Honda) in India.

Ford has tasted success as well as failures with different products here in India. In due course of existence it has touched the highest PV market share of 4% on the back of the success of generation-1 Figo (primarily diesel version). What Ford India failed to achieve was sustainability thereafter.

At any given point in time only one car in Ford’s Indian portfolio did all the heavy lifting and supported 50%+ volume. Other products were either not so successful or worse – nonexistent in the portfolio. In early years its portfolio was dominated by mid-size sedans namely Ikon and then Fiesta Gen-1 followed by Figo Gen-1 hatchback and now Ecosport since its 2013 launch.

So in long run Ford India has always remained one car wonder with Endeavour as icing on the cake. To achieve sustainable market share automakers need to have a successful product portfolio continuously updated in line with the latest market trend and with a staggered product-life-cycle (PLC) curve. This helps companies to maintain healthy cash flow and fend off their territory from the competition. It’s not that Ford India didn’t try they tried very late and missteps took a toll on the whole company.

Products

Ecosport has remained the most successful product in Ford India’s portfolio followed by Figo gen-1 and Fiesta gen-1. Ikon too can be considered iconic of course in its own right. Profit loaded Endeavour helped to lend slight premium brand imagery to Ford in India.

Then there were massive flops like – Fiesta gen-2 Fusion and Mondeo in respective segments. But the real products which actually doomed hell for Ford in India were - Figo gen-2 and Aspire (a product tailor-made to fit into the unique taxation policy India has for sub 4m passenger vehicles). The strategic direction was fine but at times the execution was not so good.

Ford India Corporate Strategy – shifting gears

1995 - JV route

Ford has started its Indian journey by signing a 50-50 joint-venture (JV) partnership with Mahindra (Mahindra Ford India Ltd) in the mid 90s. Then Ford was the second largest automotive company in the world. Modified European Escort launched in late 1996 was the first offering of JV in India. It used to come to India in completely-knocked-down (CKD) form and later was assembled at Mahindra’s Nashik plant. JV and CKD operation was presumed as a low risk way to enter and explore the newly opened Indian market post liberalization of the economy in the early 90s.

1998 - Export oriented manufacturing plant

By March 1998 Ford took its ownership to 72% renamed the company Ford India Private Limited and later increased its holding further. As a next strategical step Ford decided to set up a new plant in Maraimalai Nagar in Chengalpet district 35 km from Madras (now Chennai) with a 1 lakh annual production capacity and future expansion possibility of up to 250000 units. The first car to roll out from the plant was Ikon. Ikon was based on the European Fiesta mark IV hatchback designed and engineered in Germany and the United Kingdom especially for India. Initial localization was 70% in phase manner it was taken up to 90%.

Ford India has also started exporting CKD kits of Ikon to South Africa Brazil and Mexico without engines because initially 1.8L diesel engine 1.3L and 1.6L petrol engines were imported from Britain South Africa and Spain respectively.

And by 2002 65% of passenger vehicle export from India was comprised of Ford Ikon. The export oriented plant has deleveraged risk of product’s performance in the local market to a certain extent and increased cost synergy by economies of scale. Several other manufacturers have also used export lead plant template to start their Indian manufacturing journey e.g. Hyundai-KIA GM Nissan-Renault alliance and Volkswagen.

Localization was an important lever for Ford or for any automaker in India to keep cost in check due to import duty structure and development of foreign exchange (could be adverse as in today’s date). This is why from 2002 they started sourcing petrol engines and transmission from Hindustan Motors Halol based plant located in Gujarat.

With the success of Ikon Ford continued with this strategy of picking European car and reengineering in small R&D set-ups in Europe and launching it in India. On similar lines Fiesta Gen-1 was the next breakthrough for Ford in India. Though diesel engine and gearbox were imported and petrol engines were assembled by Hindustan motors for Fiesta Gen-1 at Halol plant.

Meanwhile in 2001 Ford also launched the made-in-Belgium Mondeo which was a flop due to its high price. 2004 witnessed two new launches from Ford India - global Everest (called as Endeavour in India) a true blue SUV and Fusion (first crossover) was brought in through CKD route while former was super hit (then) and later was a massive flop as it was too expensive.

In 2005 Mahindra sold its remaining stake in the company to completely end the partnership. As per media reports - Mahindra got a lot of insights and learnt the best global practices in manufacturing which is later used in developing Scorpio in fact in 2002 Scorpio has certain parts borrowed from Ford Escort’s parts bin. In turn Ford learned about the Indian market to expand its dealership network.

2009 - High volume game

Without a hatchback in the portfolio Ford’s presence was limited to 35% of the total Indian PV market size then. With the turn of the decade Toyota (with Etios twins) and Honda (with Brio and Amaze) too has had similar plans. Tried and tested strategy came to rescue – European Fiesta mark V platform was re-used to build Indian Figo gen-1. 1.4L TDCi diesel engine won the heart of Indian buyers again. Over 80% of Figo gen-1 sold were with a diesel heart. Suddenly Ford’s volume jumped multi fold due to competitive pricing but the poor petrol engine was a laggard and limited its overall volume potential. Though 2013 facelift failed to bring sustainability to the nameplate and volumes dipped thereon.

2011 ‘One Ford’ strategy in India

2011 saw the launch of all new Fiesta gen-2 (India) the outcome of much famed strategic direction from Ford’s then global CEO Alan Mulally. The intent was to produce global products with very high backend cost synergy and sell in multiple markets across the globe.

India specific Fiesta gen-1 was relegated and rebranded as ‘Classic’. Guess what Fiesta gen-2 was a sales disaster. Mere 8300 copies could find a home with Indian families.

But all was not bad with the ‘One Ford’ strategy. As a next product - Ecosport developed in Brazil for global markets has actually kick started an all new segment in India – sub 4m monocoque crossover (SUV). Wait not really the first sub 4m crossover which has gone unnoticed was Rio (rebadged Chinese Zotye T200) from Premier Auto Limited (PAL) launched in 2009. It was assembled at PAL’s Pune plant from imported CKD kits produced in China.

Deep localization and all new manufacturing plant

To gain a strong foothold in the Indian market Ford decided to go for deep localization in 2011 and benchmarked market leader Maruti’s most profitable products – Swift and Dzire. For that Ford has built an all new plant in Sanand Gujarat with an annual capacity of 240000 units and an overall investment of a billion dollar. The plant was meant to serve as a hub for global compact car manufacturing. Well product performance results came out in 2015 which were so disastrous that Ford has to wrap up its whole operation in India by 2021. More on that later.

2016 – Scouting for local partner

With the dismal performance of Aspire and Figo Gen-2 (developed under ‘One Ford’ umbrella in Brazil and deeply localized in India) by the end of 2016 Ford realized that its whole billion dollar investment in compact product development and the new plant has turned into bad assets. Solo it could not go anywhere by putting good money behind bad and started to look out for a partner who could lend a shoulder to carry on their baggage. And they found an old friend who was also struggling with a slew of product failures (KUV100 TUV300 Marazzo Alturas). Theoretically it was a move to share future product development risk in form of a joint venture. The deal was struck by mid-2017 and both have started working on a new arrangement of cooperation.

The deal has manifested in a new structure of ownership where Mahindra will take 51% control and Ford will own the rest. Mahindra’s platform was supposed to underpin three new SUV’s for Ford in India. The new entity was supposed to be operational by mid-2020.

After a new succession plan was drawn at Mahindra in 2020 there was a change in leadership in 2021. CFO becoming CEO of Mahindra and Mahindra seems like a clear indication of what key focus is for Mahindra now – sustainable long term profitability. CFO by nature has to be prudent and prudence lies in not owning an ailing asset without any foreseeable redemption – in this case it seems it was Ford’s India operation and in general multiple times bankrupt SsangYong from Korea.

2021 – Ford’s Indian market exit strategy

To say goodbye is pretty easy and simple on paper. And Ford did it in

September 2021 after the fallout of the Mahindra deal early in 2021. In general it seems the public is a little less shocked as they witnessed a similar spectre in 2017 General Motors (Chevrolet brand) redux.

Body style & segment share analysis

Sedan

Escort (1996-2000)

Escort was the first offering of JV in India with the option of a petrol or a diesel engine. A mid-size sedan by today’s standard but back then it was considered a premium sedan by many (₹ 730000 price) as many Indian’s weren’t that wealthy in just liberalized economy and millennials were teens or babies. Then it was competing against the likes of Opel Astra Daewoo Cielo and later with Honda City and Mitsubishi Lancer. Escort’s CKD kits were assembled at Mahindra’s Nashik plant. Ford has modified European Escort’s air conditioner suspension setup and raised ground clearance to suit Indian road conditions. Engines were also modified to deliver higher efficiency and suit bad fuel quality in India.

Escort received a tepid response back then as Indian customers were sensitive to pricing and fuel economy. Still Escort gained 6% of sedan market share at a given point of time but then it was Ford’s guinea pig to test Indian waters.

Ikon (1999-2003-2008-2010)

Ikon was the second product of Ford in India was smaller than Escort and came at an entry price of ₹ 499677. The company claimed that 70% of its content were localized at the time of launch. It was designed and engineered in Germany and the United Kingdom but built in India to compete against Maruti Esteem and Fiat Sienna then. Came with Endura 1.3L Rocam 1.6L petrol and Endura 1.8L diesel engine which were Euro II compliant all were imported till 2002. The marketing campaign was quite exciting as they came up with the hinglish tagline ‘Josh machine’. And Ikon did deliver that josh to Indians by taking Ford India’s sedan segment market share to the highest ever level of 18% in 2000 and became the second best-selling sedan in the country after Hindustan Motors - Ambassador. It continued to hold 2nd position till 2002 just behind Hyundai’s Accent before Tata’s budget sedan Indigo took over pole position in 2003.

In 2003 Ford has launched a facelift of Ikon with a new 1.3 Rocam engine with a lower price tag. Ford has started sourcing petrol engines and transmission locally from now defunct Hindustan Motors. This helped ford to sell the highest number of Ikons in a single year (2004) and maintained 3rd position in the overall sedan segment till 2004. In 2005 it handed over the baton to Fiesta nameplate and continued to sell alongside Fiesta gen-1 thus both together covering a wider price spectrum.

In 2008 Ford launched facelift-2 with a new 1.4 TDCi diesel engine from Fiesta gen-1. Diesel did small magic sales crossed the 12000 mark towards the fag end of PLC. In fact Ikon did enjoy quite a long PLC of 10 years as Ford India kept on altering variants and repositioning of Ikon throughout the lifecycle.

Mondeo (2001-2005)

The new millennium in India started with new found wealth and to capitalize on the same automakers started bringing in premium sedans to India from their global portfolio. Two possible routes were adopted – CKD with some localization or completely-build-unit (CBU). Ford brought in made in Belgium CBU Mondeo with both petrol and diesel engine option to India. To suit Indian driving conditions Ford has adapted suspension set up from the Mondeo sold to Norwegian police where cars sometimes have to travel on unpaved surfaces. Well Honda was quite successful with petrol only CKD assembled Accord. Mondeo bombed on the sales chart. Ford has had out-priced CBU Mondeo in the segment. It was not alone Opel’s CBU Vectra met an even worse fate.

Fiesta gen-1 (2005-2008-2011-2014)

Though Ikon was based on European Fiesta hatchback but never worn that nameplate. So as the time came to introduce Ikon’s successor (next generation) Ford decided to use Fiesta nameplate in India. Ikon’s template was used and parts were borrowed from Fusion launched by Ford in 2004. A major change was the 1.4 TDCi diesel engine engineered and developed in Australia. It was a gem of an engine fuel efficiency was brilliant. Indians lapped for the diesel powered version and it used to command over 85% of total sales. Fiesta started its journey at 3rd position in the entire sedan segment just behind Honda City (2nd gen) and Tata Indigo.

By 2008 facelift came surprisingly sales settled around 15000 units thereafter. By then it seems Maruti Swift Dzire (length 4.16m) launched in 2008 took the diesel customer away with its attractive price range of ₹ 5.4 lakhs- ₹6.7 lakhs as Fiesta’s diesel range started at ₹ 7.2 lakhs. Though they were in a slightly different league within the sedan segment the value proposition of Swift Dzire diesel (Fiat sourced engine) was very enticing and Fiesta’s cabin was not very spacious either. What Fiesta’s PLC curve suggests is that Ford wasn’t that good with managing mid-life of product or was it too much lethargy and complacency.

Fiesta gen-2 (2011-2014-2015)

Dead on arrival - short lifecycle short story.

Well it came out of Ford’s global one product strategy with a new set of competitive 1.5L Ti-VCT petrol and 1.5L TDCi diesel engines. Ford India has out priced it. Lack of space at the back compared to entrenched rival what this segment of buyers keenly look for was missing and bland rear end styling too didn’t go too well with potential Indian customers. So it failed miserably and how. Re-positioned facelift came in 2014 only with diesel engine and failed miserably again.

By the way it was the first Ford product in India to wear Aston Martin’s front grill design by virtue of Ford owning Aston Martin till 2007.

Figo Aspire (2015-2018-2021)

Indian sub-4m sedan segment is very unique in the world due to all new tax system introduced in 2006 and then manufacturers also started getting innovative to fit in the right product and take advantage of lower tax rate and fulfill the emotional need of sedan buying customers in India.

Tata was the original innovator they bought a chainsaw and chopped off the boot of Indigo sedan (Indica hatchback based sedan) and sold it by the name of Indigo CS (compact sedan) and it did wonder. Maruti could not take advantage then as they already launched 4.16m long Swift Dzire with 1.3L naturally aspirated petrol engine in 2008 by sticking an abnormal boot to the Swift hatchback here solution was glue stick and not a gruesome chainsaw. But then they continued with glue stick solution when Swift second generation was introduced in 2011 this time they were having a car that fits into length criteria of sub4m by design and not by default of course as well as engine criteria of 1200cc and results were remarkable since 2012. Maruti Dzire has always been ‘the sub4m segment sedan’ – commanding over 55%+ sub segment share at any given point of time. Uniquely the hatchback body style of each brand was donor product for all sub 4m sedan products.

It is not that Honda (with Amaze) and later Hyundai (with Xcent) tried to dislodge Dzire perched at the top rung of sub 4m sedan segment ever since its entry. Dislodging Dzire has never happened but then they emerged as a strong challenger and garnered respectable segment share.

Ford India wanted to crack open the lucrative sub 4m sedan segment with an all new strategic direction - When in Rome (India) do as the Romans (Maruti) do. Though Aspire was based on Ford Ka (Figo gen-2 in India) developed in Brazil under one Ford strategy. That has manifested in a competitively priced tin can contraption which scored 3 stars in GNCAP frontal offset crash test and was found with body shell integrity - UNSTABLE.

Wait a minute this is not how Ford used to make cars in India since its entry nor the reason why Indians bought Ford cars. A segment of Indian customers bought Ford’s car - for perceived strong build quality balanced ride and handling nature and juicy diesel. For fuel efficient tin cans they always have had relatively unsafe but reliable – Japanese and Koreans. It seems that Ford’s original DNA was severely compromised and a loyal customer base shunned Ford’s sub 4m sedan. With an all new value proposition Aspire was not able to even challenge Tata’s Zest or Tigor and was relegated to the bottom rung of sub 4m sedan segment to rot and die. And thereby flaming the entire much touted billion dollar investment in all new plant and product development. However detuned 1.5 TDCi diesel engine from Ecosport was best in the segment and worthy to mention that it was also having a 1.5L petrol engine with dual clutch transmission as an option at the time of launch but when it comes to overall performance the experience was spoil by the lackluster body and 1.2L naturally aspirated petrol engine was lame at the best. Ironically it came with segment first 6 airbags for the top end version.

Even the 2018 facelift was hammered down by third gen Dzire with all new A pillar design (finally to differentiate from Swift) and later by global Honda Accord inspired second gen Honda Amaze.

Ford Fusion (2004-2007-2009)

As the name suggests it was a fusion of oversized hatchback with the versatility of MUV like space as Ford claimed and semi SUV styling as media told their audience. For the Indian audience it was just con‘fusion’. Priced at ₹ 620000 ex-showroom Delhi with only 1.6L naturally aspirated petrol engine at the time of launch was way above Hyundai Getz’s price tag of ₹ 540000 for top end variant and somehow reached in executive sedan price territory. That made it instant flop! Ford’s expectation was to sell in the range of 6000 to 12000 units a year. But it lasted with marginally less than 10000 units sales in its entire lifespan.

2007 sales bump was due to the introduction of a re-positioned facelift with a 1.4L TDCi diesel engine borrowed from Fiesta Gen-1. But it failed again and Ford has to discontinue it in 2009. Some say it was way ahead of its time but in reality its price was way too ahead of the competition. Don’t believe in the reasoning of price theory then recall the introductory price of 1.5L naturally aspirated petrol Ecosport in 2013 – ₹ 559000!

So in summary - when people first saw Fusion they thought - “It's a Bird... It's a Plane... It's Superman” in this case it turns out to be err… Superflop!

Hatchback segment

Figo Gen-1 (2010-2013-2015)

Till 2009 Ford was not fully mainstream in India as it used to sell sedan and premium SUV only and its participation was limited to 35% of the Indian PV market then. So finally Ford took that plunge by 2010 in a highly competitive and relatively low margin hatchback segment with Figo gen-1. It was based on global Fiesta hatchback Mark V and in the interest of cost synergy parts were drawn from the then Fiesta gen-1 parts bin. With huge cost synergy it was launched at a very competitive price point. Similar to Fiesta it was having a highly fuel efficient 1.4 TDCi diesel engine and a lame 1.2L naturally aspirated petrol engine but it was carrying traditional virtue of Ford’s in India - strong build quality balanced ride and handling and juicy diesel. 1.4L TDCi diesel engine was an immediate hit and Ford was selling more than 74000 copies a year by 2011 and the PV market share of Ford India reached an all-time high level of 4%.

As far as build quality is concerned though it was awarded 0 Star in GNCAP rating in 2014 - without any airbags still the body shell integrity was found to be stable just like VW’s Polo hatchback. Cars with 0 Star rating usually score a 0 point but in the case of both Polo (5.42) and Figo (2.63) there was a score above 0. What it means is that – if Figo gen-1 have had twin front airbags in the base variant it would have fared quite well in the frontal offset (40%) crash test at 64 kmph.

Facelift came in 2013 but by then Hyundai too launched Grand i10 as the name suggests it was a grand version of i10. With all fresh entry Grand i10 took the shine away from Figo as later was looking aged even with the facelift. Sales dropped drastically for the next two years in succession. So it became a typical Ford way of goofing up with mid-life product management for the second time.

Figo Gen-2 [B562 project] (2015-2019-2021)

To rebuild Figo gen-1’s initial success Ford has gone for deep localization by bench-marking Maruti’s ever successful Swift hatchback. Again it was based on Ford Brazil’s Ka. Design wise it was wearing Aston Marin’s front grill. But then it was quite a departure from Figo gen-1’s inherent character of being fun and perceptive safe build. And thus it seems to become a sales dud on arrival. Though 1.5L diesel engine was very good.

Facelift came in 2019 with an all-new 1.2L dragon series petrol engine and same old 1.5L diesel engine but couldn’t save the nameplate and again received the same lukewarm response.

More recently Ford has introduced a 6 speed torque converter for the Figo 1.2L engine a welcome move though but way too late isn’t it!

Freestyle (2018-2021)

To revive Figo’s sales Ford India brought in a crossover version even before actual Figo gen-2’s facelift and at a relatively lower price point. It has a lot of cosmetic upgrades in form of several glossy black parts cladding all around front skid plate smoked out headlamps and roof rails to show off its outdoorsy credentials. Also the suspension set up was altered to enhance ground clearance. It seems to be price re-positioning effort by Ford India marketing department. Well volumes were slightly better than Figo gen-2’s first few years of launch and then it fizzled out. If fundamentals are weak in first place product cannot survive.

SUV/Crossover segment

Endeavour Gen-1 (2003-2007-2009-2014-2015)

Ford’s SUV journey began in India with the introduction of a true blue ladder-chassis Endeavour at a price point of ₹1290000 with a 2.5L turbo diesel engine in 2003 and wholesale started from January 2004. The Endeavour was brought into India via CKD route from Auto Alliance (JV between Ford and Mazda) plant in Thailand. It was a tailor-made product for the Asian market based on the popular Ranger pick-up platform and was first launched in Thailand in March 2003 by the name of Everest. Since the Everest brand was already in use by the maker of spices in India Ford has rechristened it as Endeavour for India.

It quickly struck chords with the Indian customer segment who wants to show off their muscle power – buyer segment was someone in easy to read words – politicians and contractors. A politician in those days aspire to buy imported Toyota Landcruiser or Prado but those who could not afford had a choice in Ford Endeavour and those who can’t afford Endeavour settle down for Tata Safari or Mahindra Scorpio relatively poor wannabe have to settle even further down to Mahindra Bolero. Look another way round then Tata Safari or Mahindra Scorpio owners finally got something like the next natural upgrade option. Some say that Tata’s designers were also got obsessed with Endeavour’s popularity and the 2005 facelift was inspired by Ford Endeavour.

2007 facelift received a power bump of 33 bhp and some feature upgrades. Sales improved further but Mitsubishi Pajero took away considerable market share by then.

In 2009 Ford again gave proper facelift along with an all new 3L diesel engine at ₹ 1799000 for 4X4 automatic transmission and ₹ 1599000 for the 2.5L 4X2 manual transmission variant (Ex-Showroom Delhi). It also received a new dashboard with a 7” touchscreen based infotainment system. But then it was the year when Toyota has introduced Fortuner in the Indian market and started expanding the segment further. Remarkably Endeavour’s volume kept its head above the 3000 mark till 2011. But thereafter it was showing its age and Fortuner was eating up its share.

In 2014 Endeavour received its last facelift and was priced ₹1983000 for a 2.5L engine with a manual transmission and two-wheel drive while the 3.0L came with an automatic transmission and in 4x2 at ₹ 2128000 and 4x4 ₹ 2306000.

Endeavour Gen-2 (2016-2019-2021)

Introduced in 2016 it was a more sophisticated upmarket and rounded SUV than the previous generation sporting much wanted features in India - panoramic sunroof and two diesel engine options - 2.2L and 3.2L torque monster (its turbo spooling noise was like music for die hard semi-truck fans). Given the product attributes it seems as it attracted a new buyer segment as well. Toyota Fortuner gen-2 introduced in 2016 even with lack of features remained Indian politicians favorite ride but then those who need those features bought Endeavour – business owners. Sales started at an annual rate of 6500+ and with continuous feature upgrades it maintained consistency.

With the 2019 facelift it got a successful chance to eat into Fortuner’s market pie.

In 2020 a new era of emission norms kicked in and Ford responded with an under powered 2L diesel engine mated to a capable 10 speed gearbox. Fun was relatively less but the feature list was still better than the competition and it soldiered on. Feature(s) and equipment(s) deletion to reduce cost and improve margin became a habit for Ford in India though it is not much appreciated by Indian customers.

MG was successful in taking away market share from both Fortuner and Endeavor with the launch of real-estate on wheels called Gloster. But its end customer segment seems a little different again those who were looking for more features besides sheer size. That is a big achievement for MG India as others failed to gain even a toehold in this space like Mahindra Alturas with its relatively low entry price tag and a good feature list.

Ecosport (2013-2018-2021)

All new ingredients and all new recipe to create something definitive and incredible that is what Ford Ecosport was. A global product developed in Brazil with India as a major base of production. With two petrol and a diesel engine option it was launched at a very aggressive price point of ₹5.59 lakhs and it was a runaway hit. 1L EcoBoost branded turbo-petrol engine made its debut in India. It looks like SUV and drives like a fun hatchback and soon caught the fancy of the Indian audience giving impetus to all new sub 4m monocoque crossover(SUV) segment.

For the first three years Ecosport had a free run as virtually there was no competition which gave Ford India a chance to raise the price and earn handsome profits. Indians were making a beeline to get one and that made Ford India way too much complacent and in some instances arrogant too.

The first time Ecosport faced competition and sales decline was after the introduction of Range Rover inspired Maruti’s Brezza in 2016. Panic could be seen on Ford India’s face as they slashed the price of diesel powered Ecosport by a whopping ₹ 112000 for the petrol version it was in the range of ₹ 53700 to ₹ 87400. But then Brezza with only diesel drivetrain option expanded the segment size and Ecosport continued its momentum.

In the wake of competition Ford India in 2016 introduced a halfhearted minor facelift by adding flickering tube light like DRL around headlamp which can hardly be distinguished during the day thus defeating the very purpose. However there were some feature upgrades on all other variants.

2017 saw two new entrants and further segment expansion. Lack of proper facelift means Ecosport was feeling the heat in the segment it actually kick started and sales continued to remain stagnant despite a growing segment.

2017 end was the time when Ford India has brought in a proper facelift with all new headlamps with proper LED DRL new grille bumper instrument cluster and touchscreen based SYNC 3 infotainment system. Ford’s all-new 1.5L Dragon series of petrol engine made its Indian debut in EcoSport mated to 5 speed manual or 6 speed torque converter transmission. Market too responded well with sales reaching back to 51000 level of 2014.

But then came the massive Auto industry decline of 2019 but the entry of Hyundai Venue and Mahindra XUV 300 helped the segment to expand further by eating into an adjacent segment of the sedan with a similar price point. Time for generation change was due and in absence of one Ford India has gone for another downward revision of price up to ₹ 57000 to counter competition. It seems to slash price was the only weapon left in arsenal of Ford India’s marketing department.

2020 saw a general COVID 19 induced decline. But Ford was able to upgrade their mainstay 1.5L diesel engine to comply with BS6 emission norms with LNT+DPF based exhaust-gas-after-treatment process with a slight price increase. But later DPF clogging became another nightmare for Ford and its customer in India.

Interestingly 2021 sales of the sub 4m monocoque body crossover(SUV) segment has already crossed 4 lakhs size that’s largely because of new entrants like Nissan Magnite and Renault Kiger adding all new low-end-price-spectrum and KIA Sonet stretching the higher side of the price spectrum. Also there was another Ecosport facelift in the pipeline which unfortunately will not see the light of the day anymore!

Ford’s Export business

In 2017-18 Ford contributed 25% of Indian PV export. It is an interesting business model championed by Ford and later successfully followed by Hyundai VW and Nissan. In fact VW and Nissan manufacturing units survived in India due to the export of Polo/Vento and Sunny (best seller in Mexico called Versa in the local market) to Mexico respectively. They have built export oriented plants thus producing left hand driven cars on the same assembly line. Since 2014 Ford India was exporting more cars from India than selling in the local market.

For certain years Ecosport also happens to be the best exported car from India as well. Shortfall in domestic demand was well compensated by export volume. At times Ford India was prioritizing export over domestic demand as well thus creating artificial scarcity for certain variants. Figo Gen-2 was exported and sold in other markets by the name of Ka.

New Greenfield plant - Sanand Gujarat

During the 2009 planning phase capacity at Tamil Nadu based plant was appearing to be nearly full with all new products lined up by Ford then – one of the major global production base for Ecosport and new global Fiesta for the Indian market.

That might have necessitated a new plant requirement. That could be done by Greenfield expansion of their existing plant. But only 250000 units overall capacity expansion was possible at the said location. But then sops would have been limited as they already have had existing benefits in place from the state government. So they must have started scouting for new benefits in some other states with similar geographical advantage of proximity to the seaport for exports as India was envisaged as a base for a compact car and small engine manufacturing.

They zeroed it down to Sanand in Gujarat where Tata Motors had established (relocated) Nano (PV) production plant in 2009 which is having proximity to an export oriented port. So they built a separate state of art greenfield production plant with a billion dollar investment (including product development) in Sanand Gujarat with an annual capacity of 240000 units and an engine capacity of 270000. Since these two products bombed badly in 2015 production capacity remained underutilized due to a lack of domestic uptake.

It was the export which later accounted for 70% of production still kept some momentum alive. With some export market demand drying up Ford was struggling badly with the fixed cost of the Sanand plant. And write-off of product development cost might have even eroded the net worth section of the company’s balance sheet. That means Ford need to infuse fresh capital to keep business going.

Conclusion

Product failure is part and parcel of any business. Even Maruti and Hyundai have delivered failed products based on their own yardstick. But the key is to learn – not only from one’s own mistake(s) but from others as well as later is free of cost and of course not to repeat. MG and KIA’s recent success the resurgence of Tata Motors PV Business Unit and Nissan India are testimony of the fact that gaining share in the Indian market can be challenging but not unfathomable - only with the right product (read it as attributes which Indian customers and consumers actually value) at the right price.

Ford has been rewarded with a good market share for their efforts – remember how Ikon was the second best-selling sedan for three successive years in India Ecosport kick started an all new growth segment. But then not having a proper vision for product portfolio expansion mismanagement of product life cycle (lethargy and complacency is a bad cocktail) and on top heckling with its own perfected DNA especially what a given set of customer segment does value in India was the cardinal sin committed by Ford in India.

In a bigger context Ford India was not even having a proper vision and solid product roadmap for India. At home they are good at making pick-up (light trucks) and SUVs and in Europe they have been quite successful in selling hatchbacks what respective market demands. In fact they now have a purpose built electric SUV/crossover platform too in their American portfolio. Indian taste is by and large similar to the USA for SUVs and chrome and not for pick-up though. So after the success of Ecosport (2013) in India they should have a clear roadmap for SUV/Crossover but then they never had.

For turnaround - Tata came back with an entirely new SUV/Crossover portfolio even an electrified version of Nexon. Fallacy became a trap for Ford in India.

From a corporate strategy point of view retrenchment from a particular market or segment is not a bad thing to do. Look at General Motors they exited the European and Indian market in 2017. End result – their margin has improved on a consolidated level PSA turned around Vauxhall and Opel brands (owned earlier by GM) in Europe.

While the COVID-19 pandemic forced many businesses to rapidly enable remote work the overall success of telework initiatives and the existing investments in making them possible means that for many this option is here to stay. Even as restrictions were lifted many employees continued to work from home either full time or part time.

The flexibility and autonomy provided by a work from anywhere model make it extremely attractive to workers making it a must-have for many organizations to maintain and attract the best talent. Of course this model relies on a much more distributed network edge and the ability for individuals both inside and outside of the corporate network to access applications on-site and in the cloud.

To ensure business continuity regardless of where employees are located users must be able to gain access to the tools and resources they need without encountering bottlenecks or significant latency all while keeping security a top priority in an ever-evolving threat landscape. For partners this presents an opportunity to offer their customers SD-WAN with ZTNA capabilities which are crucial for addressing these issues.

The Role of SD-WAN in the Modern Workforce

The primary role of SD-WAN is to support the user experience. A good SD-WAN solution minimizes problems associated with latency jitters and packet loss. It also provides more dynamic application steering based on SLA from branch offices and home networks alike regardless of whether those applications are hosted on-premises or in the cloud.

A 2020 IDG Research Services report indicates that SD-WAN adoption grew from 35% to 54% between 2017 and 2019 with more expected in the coming years making it one of the most rapidly adopted technologies in the last decade. And now with organizations using SD-WAN to support working from anywhere instead of traditional branch offices ensuring this technology is used in a way that promotes functionality while maintaining security is vital.

Many traditional SD-WAN solutions come with little if any security. This is obviously a problem in a work from anywhere world where SD-WAN is used for remote access to applications that store transmit and process sensitive information. Threat protection must be embedded in any SD-WAN solution in such a way that doesn’t impact performance – otherwise users will find workarounds that may compromise security.

Most SD-WAN vendors don’t offer solutions with enterprise-grade security. And what is available is often very basic and may not be able to keep up leaving easily exploitable gaps. With this in mind partners must offer their customers a security solution that is fully integrated and robust with policies and protocols communicated among different network environments ensuring consistent enforcement and avoiding performance-killing security bottlenecks.

Enabling Maximum Security with Zero Trust Network Access

As the old network perimeter breaks down zero trust network access (ZTNA) steps in. In fact a key element of ZTNA is the location independence of the user. ZTNA enables secure access to applications regardless of whether the user or application is inside or outside the corporate network. Users may be on the corporate network working from home or traveling on the other side of the globe. Similarly applications may be on-premises in a private cloud or on the public internet.

Due to these capabilities ZTNA can offer customers better security control and user experience compared to older VPN technology. The traditional VPN relied on a secure network perimeter with everything inside the perimeter being trusted and everything outside only able to gain access through a secure VPN tunnel. In contrast ZTNA assumes no user or device can be trusted until proven otherwise essentially providing security at every single instance of a user accessing an application.

With ZTNA verification and application access are the same for all users. ZTNA can also simplify management by enabling easy configuration and enforcement of role-based access control. User-friendly ZTNA solutions include a secure automated encrypted tunnel that allows instantaneous connection between the user device and the ZTNA application proxy point as soon as that access is requested.

Integration of Security and Networking Is Key

As their customers embrace the work from anywhere model partners must ensure their security follows data and applications from end to end. Moreover any viable security solution must keep up and adapt readily to underlying network changes to avoid leaving gaps or negatively impacting user experience or functionality. This is only possible if security and networking function as a unified system.

Security requires visibility and control with centralized orchestration to remain manageable. Point solutions from multiple vendors make this impossible especially as networks become more distributed and access from anywhere becomes more common. A viable security solution is one in which actionable intelligence is shared across the entire network and threat response functions as part of a coordinated system. By prioritizing the use of an integrated platform that features crucial elements such as SD-WAN and zero trust network access partners will guarantee robust security for their customers that outperforms stitched-together point solutions every time especially when those platforms enable automation and policy consistency.

He and his neighbors blamed it on consolidation in the beef industry stretching back to the 1970s that resulted in four companies slaughtering over 80% of the nation’s cattle giving the processors more power to set prices while ranchers struggled to make a living. Federal data show that for every dollar spent on food the share that went to ranchers and farmers dropped from 35 cents in the 1970s to 14 cents recently.

It led Kemp to launch an audacious plan: Raise more than $300 million from ranchers to build a plant themselves putting their future in their own hands.

""We’ve been complaining about it for 30 years"" Kemp said. ""It’s probably time somebody does something about it.""

US GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATING RISING BEEF PRICES DURING CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

Crews will start work this fall building the Sustainable Beef plant on nearly 400 acres near North Platte Nebraska and other groups are making similar surprising moves in Iowa Idaho and Wisconsin. The enterprises will test whether it’s really possible to compete financially against an industry trend that has swept through American agriculture and that played a role in meat shortages during the coronavirus pandemic.

The move is well timed as the U.S. Department of Agriculture is now taking a number of steps to encourage a more diverse supply in the beef industry.

The Biden administration last month said it was concerned that the meatpacking industry was ""pandemic profiteering"" announcing that the USDA will invest $1.4 billion in assistance to food processers harmed during the pandemic.

According to Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller pushing back against the big processers is the right move for ranchers and would benefit both ranchers and consumers.

""Ranchers have been getting screwed long enough it is time we fight back. This is how we do it we go head to head with the big processors."" Miller told Fox News.

Still it’s hard to overstate the challenge going up against huge well-financed competitors that run highly efficient plants and can sell beef at prices that smaller operators will struggle to match.

The question is whether smaller plants can pay ranchers more and still make a profit themselves. An average 1370-pound steer is worth about $1630 but that value must be divided between the slaughterhouse feed lot and the rancher who typically bears the largest expense of raising the animal for more than a year.

David Briggs the CEO of Sustainable Beef acknowledged the difficulty but said his company’s investors remain confident.

""Cattle people are risk takers and they’re ready to take a risk"" Briggs said.

Consolidation of meatpacking started in the mid-1970s with buyouts of smaller companies mergers and a shift to much larger plants. Census data cited by the USDA shows that the number of livestock slaughter plants declined from 2590 in 1977 to 1387 in 1992. And big processors gradually dominated going from handling only 12% of cattle in 1977 to 65% by 1997.

Currently four companies — Cargill JBS Tyson Foods and National Beef Packing — control over 80% of the U.S. beef market thanks to cattle slaughtered at 24 plants. That concentration became problematic when the coronavirus infected workers slowing and even closing some of the massive plants and a cyberattack last summer briefly forced a shutdown of JBS plants until the company paid an $11 million ransom.

'THE 'FIVE' ON RISING FOOD GAS PRICES

The Biden administration has largely blamed declining competition for a 14% increase in beef prices from December 2020 to August. Since 2016 the wholesale value of beef and profits to the largest processors has steadily increased while prices paid to ranchers have barely budged.

The backers of the planned new plants have no intention of replacing the giant slaughterhouses such as a JBS plant in Grand Island Nebraska that processes about 6000 cattle daily — four times what the proposed North Platte plant would handle.

However they say they will have important advantages including more modern equipment and they hope less employee turnover thanks to slightly higher pay of more than $50000 annually plus benefits along with more favorable work schedules. The new Midwest plants are also counting on closer relationships with ranchers encouraging them to invest in the plants to share in the profits.

The companies would market their beef both domestically and internationally as being of higher quality than meat processed at larger plants.

Chad Tentinger who is leading efforts to build a Cattlemen’s Heritage plant near Council Bluffs Iowa said he thinks smaller plants were profitable even back to the 1970s but that owners shifted to bigger plants in hopes of increasing profits.

Now he said ""We want to revolutionize the plant and make it an attractive place to work.""

Besides paying ranchers more and providing dividends to those who own shares the hope is that their success will spur more plants to open and the new competitors will add openness to cattle markets.

Derrell Peel an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University said he hopes they’re right but noted that research shows even a 30% reduction in a plant’s size will make it far less efficient meaning higher costs to slaughter each animal.

Unless smaller plants can keep expenses down they will need to find customers who will pay more for their beef or manage with a lower profit margin than the big companies.

""We have these very large plants because they’re extremely efficient"" Peel said.

According to the North American Meat Institute a trade group that includes large and mid-size plants the biggest challenge will be the shortage of workers in the industry.

It’s unfair to blame the big companies and consolidation for the industry’s problems said Tyson Fresh Meats group president Shane Miller.

""Many processors including Tyson are not able to run their facilities at capacity in spite of ample cattle supply"" Miller told a U.S. Senate committee in July. ""This is not by choice: Despite our average wage and benefits of $22 per hour there are simply not enough workers to fill our plants.""

The proposed new plants come as the USDA is trying to increase the supply chain. The agency has dedicated $650 million toward funding mid-size and small meat and poultry plants and $100 million in loan guarantees for such plants. Also planned are new rules to label meat as a U.S. product to differentiate it from meat raised in other countries.

""We’re trying to support new investment and policies that are going to diversify and address that underlying problem of concentration"" said Andy Green a USDA senior adviser for fair and competitive markets.

After a few steady years of some remarkable improvements when it came to health tracking — SpO2 monitoring fall detection aFib alerts ECG and EDA scanning — it feels like smartwatch and fitness tracker innovation has plateaued.

This year all of the improvements to the three major wearables were mostly cosmetic. The Apple Watch 7 got a larger screen — which admittedly is a big improvement. So too did the Fitbit Charge 5 whose display is now in color. Samsung’s watches got a bit of a redesign too. And all of them look great but it’s more than aesthetics I’m after if I’m looking to upgrade from say an Apple Watch 6 .

Don’t want to take my word for it? Then how about Marques Brownlee ’s?

But where was the blood pressure monitor? Where’s the glucose monitor? Thermometer? We’ll have to wait for future Apple Watches to get those capabilities it seems. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal  Apple does have bigger health plans for its watches  but we’ll have to wait until next year at the earliest.

Yes the Galaxy Watch 4 has bioelectrical impedance analysis but I don’t want a smartwatch to tell me how fat I am.

I’m not overly surprised that the Fitbit Charge 5 doesn’t have anything groundbreaking; it essentially inherited features from the Fitbit Sense  which was launched a year ago. Now that Fitbit has some premium fitness trackers I would expect the bulk of innovative features to show up in them before trickling down.

More importantly where’s the longer battery life? All three of the devices mentioned have the same battery life as the previous generation — about 18 hours with the Apple Watch and the Galaxy Watch 4 and about 5 days with the Fitbit. While the FItbit’s endurance is acceptable — though it drops by a lot if you use GPS — one of the main reasons why I prefer to use one of the best running watches rather than an Apple Watch for workouts is that I know my Garmin will still be good for another few days. If I could go an entire weekend — two days 48 hours — without having to recharge a smartwatch I’d be happy.

In 2020 Fitbit impressed me with the Fitbit Sense which introduced a number of new health-tracking features that really seemed to push the smartwatch category forward. This year I was really looking forward to seeing how Apple and Samsung would respond. It didn’t help that all the rumors from Jon Prosser got me worked up too.

I get that we can’t have major innovations every year to smartwatches. It’s tough to cram a lot of new tech into gadgets this small. Maybe I’m asking for too much but I was really looking forward to something more than this.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthbnNhc2NpdHkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9hcnRpY2xlMjU0OTUzNjM3Lmh0bWzSATdodHRwczovL2FtcC5rYW5zYXNjaXR5LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvYXJ0aWNsZTI1NDk1MzYzNy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These local college grads competed in and won Kansas City Marathon titles on Saturday,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.kansascity.com', port=443): Read timed out.

On a long enough timeline running dry on a smartwatch battery seems inevitable. I’ve personally had a watch fail to charge overnight simply because it slipped off the charger. Jetsetters know that on long trips recharging isn’t always a possibility — whether because you’re busy there’s no power nearby or you don’t have the right accessories handy. Wherever you are you can also simply forget to charge which isn’t difficult with a device that’s effectively an extension of your arm.

These issues make the battery life of some watches problematic. Samsung claims that the Galaxy Watch 4 can last 40 hours but real-world demands like GPS and activity tracking cut into that figure meaning you’ll probably end up charging every day regardless. Apple Watches are even worse rated at just 18 hours. Buyers may even have to charge twice a day if they engage in sleep tracking or long-distance running.

The more seamless and integral smartwatches become the more battery life matters. Devices are for example trending towards a growing list of health sensors — but that could be counterproductive if it reduces the time you can keep a device on your wrist.

The seven-day goal

Jimmy Westenberg / Android Authority

Why aim for a week-long battery? First assuming light usage in most cases a number of smartwatches have already hit that mark or surpassed it. The Fitbit Sense can theoretically last six days or more and some standard Garmin devices will go up to two weeks. At the extreme the Garmin Enduro and Coros Vertix 2 are both rated around two months or longer the former being a nearly unkillable solar model. All of these figures involve ideal scenarios of course but seven days should be an achievable minimum.

A week creates a standard with room to breathe.

From an owner’s perspective a week creates a standard with room to breathe. It becomes possible to forget about charging for a day or two and have time left. It solves problems not just for travelers but for hikers who may be extremely dependent on GPS yet trying to avoid packing bulky batteries or solar panels. It feels absurd really that anyone should need a watch charger for a weekend getaway when “dumb” watches can run for months or years.

A week of casual wear also translates into a few days of more demanding use. My weightlifting sessions regularly top two hours — with some shorter-lived smartwatches power evaporates in front of my eyes. If I strap on a Garmin though I can complete a week with battery to spare. Even two or three days of non-stop use is preferable to having to charge every night.

Why don’t smartwatches have longer battery life?

Several obstacles have conspired to make smartwatch battery life difficult chief among them ergonomics. On a technical level there’s nothing whatsoever stopping companies from slapping gigantic batteries on your wrist. But such devices could quickly become too heavy or uncomfortable for all-day wear much less tossing and turning in bed or lifting dumbbells at the gym. Wearable engineers are constantly striving to balance smartwatch battery life against other concerns.

One of those is software support. The very thing that makes smartwatches sexy is what they’re capable of — switching from Spotify to a navigation or smart home app within a matter of seconds for example. That demands a power-hungry processor not to mention a quality display and a slick interface. The Apple Watch has terrible battery life precisely because it’s a polished jack-of-all-trades whereas vendors like Coros and Garmin make fitness-oriented devices that can afford to sacrifice features like display resolution and robust on-device software.

Wearable engineers are constantly striving to balance smartwatch battery life against other concerns.

The dilemma is such that companies have come up with clever tricks to reduce power consumption. Mobvoi for instance added a secondary low-power display to its TicWatch Pro line while Fossil chose to introduce custom battery modes to Wear OS optionally disabling some sensors. Newer devices with an “always-on” screen are typically scaling back brightness and refresh rates whenever you lower your wrist.

Less practical interests are at play as well specifically aesthetics and profit margins. Companies like Fitbit could enlarge their batteries if their devices were as big as Garmin’s but they opt for smaller form factors instead — and sometimes it’s explicitly to look as sleek as possible. We know this because they regularly market tinier watches and trackers towards women complete with stereotypically “feminine” bands and colors. Fashion often trumps utility so even Garmin sells products like the Lily. Related: The best fitness trackers

Margin pressure comes from part costs. It’s not just a question of the batteries themselves — since improving longevity sometimes means upgrading chips displays circuitry and/or casing the bills can add up. These expenses then have to be absorbed or passed along to the consumer and neither scenario is appealing from a corporate perspective. As it is high-end smartwatches can be pricey accessories for even pricier smartphones.

What are the odds of more watches hitting the one-week mark?

On a broad basis they’re pretty good. With a number of devices already beyond that point it should only be a matter of time before the necessary tech spreads and the standard becomes commonplace.

In the short term though that will mostly be among fitness-oriented or less feature-rich models. For flagship do-it-all watches like those from Fossil or the Apple Watch we could end up waiting years. Makers are still racing to outdo each other with added features and performance and by now it’s a precedent that in exchange customers are willing to charge daily.

There is some reason to cross our fingers. Though the Galaxy Watch 4 never lived up to rumors of a week-long battery Samsung does seem invested in pushing smartwatch battery life further. That could put pressure on rivals especially since the appeal of better batteries is obvious. If so wearable makers will probably seize on any opportunities to deliver a breakthrough though even then they’ll have to decide what design and financial costs they’re willing to pay.

It’s also up to us as shoppers. Some people may be stuck with a particular watch for ecosystem reasons but there is flexibility and those of us who can should vote with our money. It’s time for smartwatches to be as convenient as their predecessors.

The program is taking off right here in the Buckeye state.

What You Need To Know GE is investing $100M globally and $5M in Cincinnati to increase diversity of young people in engineering



The program hopes to reach more than 3500 students in Cincinnati



Cincinnati is one of four inaugural cities to launch the program



The program will allow engineers to mentor students and show them a pathway to becoming an engineer

A handful of students from Princeton City Schools are among the first to get a preview of what the program will look like.

On Oct. 15 the students got the chance to meet a future mentor at the GE Aviation Learning Centre.

Alisha Davis-Kent is a Test Systems Evaluation Engineer at GE who is passionate about mentoring this next wave of students.

“It’s that partnership with them” Davis-Kent said. “It’s someone believing in them that the world needs them.”

GE’s Next Engineers program aims to increase the diversity in engineering.

It's something Davis-Kent wishes she had when she was younger.

“For me to be able to hear that there are kids that will be exposed to these opportunities and the possibilities that exist in this world of engineering is really exciting” Davis-Kent said.

The program is a $100 million commitment by GE globally $5 million is going to be used in Cincinnati to reach more than 3500 students.

The program will begin with ‘Engineering Discovery’ where 13-14 year old's will meet and explore the field with engineers like Davis-Kent.

Seventh-grade student Lester Parker said meeting engineers shows him that his dreams can be achieved.

“It is really amazing that I have this opportunity because I see an engineer like me” Parker said. “That’s African-American like me. We don’t see many African-American engineers.”

That makes him feel empowered.

“That I can do anything” he said.

Rising ninth-graders will have the chance to take part in a weeklong engineering camp over the school break.

The largest portion of the program is the ‘Engineering Academy’ an 80-hour per year program encouraging them to pursue engineering degrees which can lead to scholarship opportunities.

Princeton City Schools Superintendent Tom Burton said the new program is a game-changer for all students in the region.

“That commitment is so critical” Burton said. ""So we’re going to have so many great opportunities for our students to learn to dig deeper in engineering and a pathway that’s achievable.”

Tenth grade Princeton High School Student Layla Kato's mother is also an engineer which sparked her interest in the program.

She said this opportunity offers more inspiration to reach her goals.

“I think the world needs a lot more female engineers a lot more female of color engineers” Kato said. ""I think it’s really great to see that more are coming out and starting to follow the pathway that is created for them. I just want to follow in my mom’s footsteps and Alisha’s footsteps.”

Ninth grade Princeton student Jared Farley has been coding already for the past two years and said this new program is only going to make his interest in engineering stronger.

“Getting to meet an engineer tells me that anything is possible” Farley said.

Cincinnati is one of four inaugural cities selected for the program.

They will work hand-in-hand with the University of Cincinnati to implement the program.

Davis-Kent sees it all as a chance to pay it forward.

“We don’t just want it for us we won’t to be selfish about it” she said. “What we wanna do is continue to build a world that works. So that requires innovators thinkers developers software engineers — that’s a broad spectrum there. So that’s the opportunity that we have here. Not just to develop the next engineer for GE but to develop the next engineer that will ultimately have an impact on the world.”

Japanese investigators at Osaka University analyzed data from heart failure patients who underwent iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (I-123 MIBG) SPECT scans. They found patients with higher levels of blood-flow defects on SPECT scans were significantly more at risk of dying from cardiac events than those with low levels.

""I-123 MIBG-SPECT data accurately identified subjects who were at risk of poor outcomes because of cardiac causes"" wrote first author Dr. Masahiro Seo a cardiologist at Osaka General Medical Center and colleagues.

Recognizing patients in these settings is important to prevent readmissions because of heart failure the authors wrote.

Determining how much blood the heart's left ventricle pumps out with each contraction (left ventricle ejection fraction or LVEF) is a cornerstone for identifying patients at risk of sudden cardiac death. As LVEF declines often due simply to age the risk of death increases.

Patients in this study had been diagnosed and hospitalized for heart failure with ""preserved"" ejection fraction (HFpEF) which occurs when the left ventricle can pump well but may be stiff so that it cannot relax and fill with blood as well as normal.

""The precise risk stratification of patients with HFpEF is clinically relevant for physicians to optimize medicine and prevent adverse outcomes"" the researchers wrote.

I-123 MIBG-SPECT imaging measures the activity of nerve cells in the heart muscle which may be overstimulated to compensate for defects in blood flow. The ""uptake"" of 1-123 MIBG by stimulated nerve cells is visible on SPECT images. Yet no information is available on the prognostic value of cardiac I-123 MIBG-SPECT in patients with HFpEF according to the authors.

In this prospective study Seo and colleagues studied data on 148 patients admitted with HFpEF who underwent cardiac I-123 MIBG-SPECT imaging (BrightView Philips Healthcare) prior to discharge from the hospital. They measured the uptake of I-123 MIBG in 17 regions of the left ventricle of the patients and then calculated an average total defect score by adding the scores of each of the 17 segments.

All of the patients in the study had follow-ups at least every one or two months for an average of 2.4 years. During the follow-up period 61 patients experienced cardiac events: 49 patients died including 23 cardiac deaths. Fifty-three patients experienced emergent heart failure hospitalization.

The analysis revealed total defect scores on I-123 MIBG-SPECT were significantly associated with cardiac events. Patients with high total defect scores had a significantly greater risk (63%; hazard ratio [HR] 4.69) of cardiac events than those with middle (40%; HR 2.46) or low (20%; HR 1.0) total defect scores the authors found.

""These results indicate that obtaining I-123 MIBG-SPECT analysis would provide additive prognostic value in patients with HFpEF"" they wrote.

The researchers noted studies show the prevalence of heart failure in patients with HFpEF is rapidly increasing and carries a high economic burden worldwide. This is the first study to demonstrate the prognostic significance of cardiac I-123 MIBG-SPECT imaging in nonischemic heart failure patients with preserved LVEF and suggest adding I-123 MIBG-SPECT findings to conventional imaging could improve risk stratification in patients they added.

""Further investigation on the therapeutic implication targeting cardiac sympathetic nerve dysfunction in HFpEF is warranted"" Seo and colleagues concluded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbGNhbGlzdGVjaC5jb20vY3RlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMCw3MzQwLEwtMzkyMDM3NSwwMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Medical device giant Medtronic to acquire Israel's Triple Jump for $300 million | Ctech,"Medical device company Medtronic is in advanced negotiations to purchase Israeli startup Triple Jump for $300 million Calcalist has learned. This acquisition comes on the back of an investment made by Medtronic in the Israeli company in 2020 which also included an option to buy Triple Jump.

Triple Jump CEO Assaf Guy denied the deal in a call with Calcalist and said there are no ongoing negotiations.

According to the Israeli Corporations Authority the investment was made via Covidien which Medtronic purchased in 2015. Triple Jump is developing a unique small insulin pump patch that is placed on the patient’s body. The patch has mobile connectivity capabilities and will be included in a future artificial pancreas system.

Triple Jump which is based in the northern town of Yokneam was founded in 2015 by CTO Guy Shinar and Ofer Yodfat. Shinar was the CEO of X Technologies that was sold to Guidant for $200 million in 2003. Yodfat was also one of the founders of Medingo which developed an insulin pump and patch and was sold in 2010 to pharma giant Roche for around $170 million. In 2012 Roche shut down Medingo's operations in Israel and fired all 150 employees.

Among Triple Jump's additional investors are Elixir Medical Corporation Hong Kong investment fund Wealth Strategy Holding and veteran entrepreneur Dov Moran.

8.1 / 10

SCORE Sonos Beam Gen 2 $499 at Best Buy $499 at B&H Photo-Video $400 at Amazon Pros All-in-one system offers astoundingly wide sound

Choice of Alexa or Google Assistant onboard

One of the best streaming music apps around Cons Expensive

No dedicated Dolby Atmos speakers

Not able to compete with systems with subs

With the right movie or TV show a soundbar with Dolby Atmos onboard can help transport you out of your living room and into another world -- from the nuclear wastelands of the Outback to the battlefields of Europe. Yet not all Atmos soundbars are created equal. Some include physical upfiring drivers and some like the Sonos Beam Gen 2 rely on fancy processing to create Atmos effects. After listening to the new Beam I was surprised at how good that processing can sound.

The $450 Sonos Beam Gen 2 is a tweak of the company's original Sonos Beam soundbar and adds Atmos compatibility as well as a better processor. Without changing the physical design beyond a new grill or adding any extra speakers the Beam Gen 2 does indeed sound bigger than before. It's not worth upgrading if you have the original -- save up for the Sonos Arc instead -- but for people looking to explore Dolby Atmos who want built-in voice assistant(s) and best-in-class whole-home music streaming the Sonos Beam Gen 2 is a great choice.

Ty Pendlebury/CNET

Sonos isn't for everyone though as it can be costly to build a whole-home system especially if you need to buy the $449 Port adapter for an existing stereo. The Sonos ecosystem is excellent however and no other company offers the same level of support for music streaming services. As an alternative you can buy a full 5.1.2 system with ""real"" Dolby Atmos for only 50 bucks more -- the excellent Vizio M512a. It does sound better but it involves a lot more boxes with wires and no Wi-Fi or voice assistant built-in.

What it is

Apart from a couple of key improvements the Beam Gen 2 is very very similar to the original Beam. It has the same size (2 foot wide) the same shape and number of speakers. These drivers consist of four elliptical midwoofers one central tweeter and three passive bass radiators. Actual upfiring drivers which are required for ""true"" immersive playback are absent on the new Beam.

Instead the Gen 2's main upgrades are on the inside with a more powerful processor and a new phased array (which can operate five separate audio zones versus the original's three). The two new arrays are dedicated to surround and height information and provide the simulated Dolby Atmos playback.

The other notable upgrade on the Gen 2 is HDMI eARC compatibility which brings with it HDMI 2.1 and Dolby Atmos streams. If your TV doesn't have an HDMI port you can use the HDMI-to-optical adapter in the box for Dolby Digital 5.1 decoding.

The Beam is also a smart speakers and offers a choice of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. The onboard microphone array appears to be the same as before and was reasonably sensitive to my commands -- even when the movie is blaring.

Why would you choose this speaker over a host of cheaper soundbars? Because it's Sonos. Whether you have an existing Sonos system -- say a One or two -- or are looking to strike out into home streaming Sonos still offers one of the most robust music platforms available. There are dozens of supported services from Apple Music to TuneIn to Sonos' own Radio HD. The speaker also boasts Spotify Connect and Apple AirPlay 2.

Ty Pendlebury/CNET

The Beam 2 comes with a night mode to reduce the impact of explosions when you don't want to disturb the neighbors in addition to a voice-enhancement feature. Unlike much of its competition the Sonos does not offer a music mode -- instead everything is ""wide.""

Adding a Sonos subwoofer and Sonos One rear channels to the Beam brings the total to $1600. Ty Pendlebury/CNET

Setup is simple and straightforward and the app walks you through each step. If you have an iOS device you can take advantage of Sonos TruePlay which requires you to wave the phone around the room for 2 minutes to calibrate the beam-forming technology. You may look and feel silly but based on my tests it does work.

Like all Sonos soundbar systems the Beam is able to be supplemented by additional speakers. The most cost-effective upgrade is a pair of Ikea Symfonisk surrounds for $198 -- they add the needed ambience for surround soundtracks and are fairly unobtrusive at the same time. Adding a pair of Sonos Ones ($419) is overkill -- especially as using them as surrounds disables the microphones anyway. You could buy the microphone-free One SLs but that would still cost $398.

You can also forget the Sub -- at almost twice the price of the Beam the $800 sub is a better match for the Arc (which paradoxically doesn't need it as much as the Beam does). The company sorely needs a $400 subwoofer -- and a $100 adapter for existing speakers while it's at it.

For my testing I used a Samsung QN65Q80T TV connected via HDMI eARC with an Oppo UDP-205 as well as a Roku Ultra .

How it sounds

The question I most wanted to answer was ""Does the Beam Gen 2 justify the $50 increase compared to the original Beam?"" The simplest answer is ""yes.""

The idea of any home cinema system Atmos or otherwise is to create a bubble of sound. The Beam managed to do so despite the fact that all of its speakers are housed in a from a single enclosure.

Compared to the original Beam the Gen 2 was certainly able to generate more atmosphere with Mad Max: Fury Road for example Iit flung effects all around and seemingly from back of me which is quite a feat without physical rears. The original Beam also offered a large bubble but the sound was focused more toward the front of the room. On the other hand neither speaker was able to generate above-the-head effects which occur in the scene where the little girl asks ""Where are you?"" for example.

The Gen 2 offers a clearer sound than the original which helps to make it more understandable during TV shows and adds an airiness when watching movies. While the sound of the Beam changes when you add a sub -- offering the appearance of an instant upgrade -- the Gen 2 sounds more like the sub-connected Beam all the time whether the sub is on or not.

The Beam's top panel Ty Pendlebury/CNET

I also compared the Gen 2 to the Vizio M512a-h6 a multi-speaker Atmos system in the same price range. The Vizio offers excellent music and movie replay and its impact was obviously helped by the included sub. I started with Turnstile's Alien Love Call -- featuring Blood Orange -- and found the uncharacteristically psychedelic track was suitably swirly on the Vizio while the just-there kick drum was quick and fast. The track held up surprisingly well on the Beam too where the swirliness suited the speaker perfectly and though the bass was not as deep the vocals were clearer.

Next I shifted to the audio-visual achievement that is the movie 1917 in Dolby Atmos. While it was able to offer a sense of height as a fronts-only system the Beam couldn't compete with the Vizio in surround effects. There was no front to back movement in the flares that fly overhead at 1hr 08min for example. However the pings of the rifle shots as our hero scarpers deeper into the ruins did have a greater sense of urgency on the Beam.

So far the Beam was keeping up but when I fed them both a meaty soundtrack -- the lobby shootout scene from the Matrix -- the Vizio shined. Ambience was better immersion was better and I could hear the synth bass soundtrack all the way through whereas it only peaked through occasionally on the Beam. If you want home theater oomph and don't care about the rest get the Vizio.

Should you buy it?

If you own the Sonos Beam you sadly won't be able to get the upgrades that the Gen 2 offers via a software update and it's not worth buying again just for a little more ambience. The Beam is definitely a great upgrade for people who own a Sonos One and want to expand their systems although the true upgrade is in the bigger and better-sounding Sonos Arc.

The Sonos Gen 2 benefits from the addition of Dolby Atmos while keeping all the things I love about the original. If you want a compact attractive system with a bunch of useful features it's my top pick at this price. That said Vizio's M512a is still the leader for the money with better sound and more inputs to play with.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzE3L3Rpa3Rvay1nZW4tei1ub3N0YWxnaWEtbWlsbGVubmlhbHMtZmFzaGlvbi1tdXNpYy10cmVuZHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TikTok fuels a surging market for early 2000s nostalgia,"Share on email (opens in new window)

Older brands trends and technologies are making a comeback as younger consumers desperately chase slower less chaotic times. The big picture: TikTok's algorithm makes it easy for flashback items to resurface and quickly go viral both on its platform and eventually on other social networks.

Plenty of Gen Z TikTok users have gone viral making fun of Millennials but Gen Z TikTok users are also fueling nostalgia for Millennials' heyday: Trends from the early 2000s are driving the new throwback economy.

Between the lines: The pandemic dramatically sped the shift to digital media remote work and virtual social activities.

But most Americans — including a majority of Gen Z — say life was better before social media according to new polling from John Della Volpe director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics.

What's next: Other generations will get their turn in the nostalgia rotation too.

Vintage stores are seeing a surge in young consumers looking for vintage clothing from the 1980's and 1990's. And pop music that's going viral through TikTok today from newer artists like Doja Cat and Dua Lipa is reminiscent of the 1980's signature dance-pop sound.

U.S. vinyl sales last year topped CD sales for the first time since 1986 in part thanks to record collectors using the app to find community and inadvertently going viral. Vinyl sales are up more than 100% for the first half of the year.

The bottom line: Whether it's reviving old trends or starting new ones TikTok is where Gen Z sets the tone for what's cool.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L21lZXQtYXZlcnkta3Jpc3Rlbi1wb2hsLWVzbWUtcHJpbmNlLW9uLWdlbmVyYWwtaG9zcGl0YWwvYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet Avery Kristen Pohl: Esme Prince on 'General Hospital',"Avery Kristen Pohl. Photo Credit: Joanna DeGeneres

Actress Avery Kristen Pohl chatted with Digital Journal’s Markos Papadatos about portraying Esme Prince on the hit ABC daytime drama “General Hospital” and being an actress in the digital age.

Pohl has taken Port Charles by storm thanks to her manipulative and vindictive portrayal of Esme Prince which has been well-received by fans and cast members alike.

Playing Esme Prince on ‘General Hospital’

On playing Esme on “General Hospital” she said “Well Esme is an incredibly complex individual so it has been a pleasure to get into her headspace and portray her as a character. This will be the most time I have spent with a character in my career thus far so I’m looking forward to seeing how she evolves as a person.”

“Esme is constantly assessing everyone around her as if every conversation is just ammunition to use against people later! I have really enjoyed getting to learn how to empathize with a character who can go to such extremes to support her own agenda” she explained.

Working with Nicholas Alexander Chavez

Pohl had great words about working with her co-star Nicholas Alexander Chavez as Spencer Cassadine. “Nicholas has been fantastic” she exclaimed.

“Nicholas is a really great actor to bounce ideas off of. He is very giving in every scene which is so helpful to play opposite of. It’s also very fun to choose what we share with each other in terms of our characters and what we find to be more beneficial to keep to ourselves. After all every conniving relationship has its fair share of secrets” she elaborated.

Inspirations

Regarding her daily inspirations as an actress she said “The people around me are who I use most as my source of inspiration and that can be from a work or performance point of view or just from the motions of day-to-day life. My family has been a great support system for me so I owe a lot of credit to them and their patience over the years!”

The digital age

On being an actress in the digital age Pohl said “The entertainment industry is constantly evolving and just like anything else you have to be prepared to adapt and adapt in a timely fashion.”

“There are so many benefits to the digital age such as more opportunities for people outside of Los Angeles. That being said nothing beats an in-person audition or acting class with the face-to-face feedback you receive” she said.

“Streaming is wonderful in that there are more job opportunities for actors and we’ve really entered uncharted territory in terms of providing art and a sense of escapism during a global pandemic” she added.

When asked how she handles being dialogue-heavy on the show Pohl responded “The producers at ‘General Hospital’ were great about trying to ease me in a bit in terms of dialogue and page count.”

“It started out with about 10 to 20 pages per day and then progressed up to 60 to 80 depending on the day and week. The brain can be trained like a muscle so it just takes a little bit of time and consistency and you’re on your way to learning multiple episodes worth of dialogue every day” she said.

Advice for young and aspiring actors

For young and aspiring actors she said “Only pursue this industry if you truly love your craft. Find a good community of actors to bounce ideas off of who can be supportive and also push you! And in terms of auditioning as a young actor just keep putting yourself out there as much as possible; after all it only takes one yes!”

“This is an industry that will naturally offer you a lot more no’s so take the wins when they come around. Everyone is on their own career path so while it can be super easy to compare yourself to others just keep in mind that the right project will come around at the right time. Finding a team that is excited about you and offers you great opportunities makes all the difference in the world” she said.

Success

On her definition of the word success Pohl said “Success in some ways can certainly be measured in a quantitative state of dollar figures or followers on social media but on the other hand I think success is incredibly subjective. Success to me put simply is the product of years of hard work and dedication.”

“Everyone’s success will look different at various stages of their careers” she said. “For example what I would consider being a success five years ago won’t look the same as my measure of success 10 years down the line. At the end of the day I think we should be striving towards bettering ourselves at our crafts as well as individuals.”

For her fans and supporters she concluded “I hope you are being kept on your toes by Esme and keep tuning in to ‘General Hospital.’ We couldn’t do what we do without our GH fans.”

I have loved NASCAR for as long as I can remember. I will miss the old-style stock cars. But I truly believe the NASCAR Next Generation cars will make NASCAR racing more exciting.

Generation-6 Cup Cars Next-Gen Cup Cars Engine Naturally-aspirated V8 Naturally-aspirated V8 Transmission 4-speed manual 5-speed sequential manual Rear axle Solid live rear axle Transaxle and independent rear suspension Body styles Two: superspeedway and short track One design for all tracks

Read on for the Next Gen car ultimate guide overview or take a deep dive into specific systems in the following articles from our series:

NASCAR Next Generation cars make a half-ton more downforce

Until 2021 every NASCAR team maintained separate cars for the oval tracks and road courses. But with its Next Generation NASCAR wanted one race car that could do both.

Aerodynamics defines Cup cars designed for the oval tracks. The entire right side of their body is a single flat panel. This panel keeps the cars stable while turning left at high speeds. The Next Gen cars achieve similar stability with nearly one thousand pounds of additional downforce instead.

NASCAR engineers used several tricks to increase the downforce generated by the Next Gen cars. As you might guess the Next Gen spoilers and the splitters beneath the grill are more aggressive. The new vehicles also have hood vents. After air exits the radiator it flows over the windshield and the roof pressing the car down.

The full-length “underwing” revolutionizes NASCAR aerodynamics

You can increase downforce by pressing down on a car. However you can also increase downforce by creating a vacuum beneath the car. This is why the Next Gen cars will feature NASCAR’s first full-length underwing. This aerodynamic element expels any air moving beneath the vehicle.

The Next Gen underwing ends in a cluster of vertical fins called a diffuser. Engineers designed these fins to reduce turbulence behind the car. For this reason it should be easier for drivers to pass one another.

There is a downside to downforce. With hundreds of pounds of added downforce the Next Gen cars require much more power to move forward.

The NASCAR Next Generation engines: 670 horsepower

The engines beneath NACAR Cup car hoods are electronically fuel-injected 358 cubic-inch (5.86 Liter) V8s. They use traditional (not overhead) cams so pushrods operate their valves. This is why they are often called pushrod engines. The engines in the 2022 Next Gen cars will be identical to those used in the 2021 sixth-generation cars–with one significant difference. NASCAR Next Gen engines will be allowed to make hundreds more horsepower.

Every NASCAR V8 is built by a manufacturer (currently Ford Chevrolet or Toyota) and maintained by the racing team. They are theoretically capable of approximately 850 horsepower. But since a high-profile 1987 crash NASCAR has limited engines to about 410 horsepower.

But it takes a lot of power to push a car forward when its body produces thousands of pounds of downforce. So because of the Next Gen car’s increased downforce NASCAR will allow the teams more powerful engines.

Restrictor plates swapped for “tapered spacers”

NASCAR uses a restrictor plate to limit the teams’ engines. This plate is a 1/8th-inch piece of aluminum mounted atop the intake manifold. It has four officially sized holes and limits the amount of air and gas flowing into the engine.

For recent seasons NASCAR engineers have also created “tapered spacers.” The spacers are one inch tall. Instead of straight-cut holes they have funnels that increase flow into the engine.

Officials have settled on an aggressive aerodynamics package to slow the new cars down on the superspeedways (Talladega and Daytona) with a seven-inch spoiler. On the other tracks the teams can run four-inch spoilers. On the Superspeedways the teams will be running 510 horsepower tapered spacers. Elsewhere they are allowed approximately 670 horsepower.

Despite all the major changes to downforce and horsepower the NASCAR Next Generation cars are almost exactly the same speed as the sixth-gen cars. After a Daytona drafting test with a pack of Next Gen cars William Byron said his lap times were “within a second or two” of the outgoing cars.

Next Generation Cars shift with a Corvette-style transaxle

In the NASCAR Next Generation car the transmission and rear axle are combined into a single unit. There are several reasons engineers changed the drivetrain layout. But here’s the rub: the full-body underwing would not fit under the traditional solid rear axle. The Cup car drivetrain needed to change for aerodynamic purposes and NASCAR chose a transaxle.

Combining the transmission and rear differential reduces the overall weight of a race car. Moving the transmission to the back of the vehicle better balances your drivetrain weight front-to-back. Without a transmission at the front of a car you can move your engine back and reduce weight on the front wheels.

Overall a front-engine rear-transaxle sports car handles very well. For this reason Chevrolet has used this layout for the last three generations of the Corvette. Racing is catching up to tried-and-true sportscar technology with the NASCAR’s Corvette-style transaxle.

The Next Gen car has three pedals and a floor-mounted shift lever. But instead of an H-pattern the shifter only moves forward and backward. The new shifter is similar to a “ratchet” shifter used in drag racing.

Drivers can pull the shift lever back to shift up and push it forward to shift down. The new transaxle transmission has five forward gears and one reverse gear. You can dive into the Next Gen transmissions if you want more details.

The NASCAR Next Generation Cars: more “stock” than current stock cars

NASCAR Cup cars are very different than the stock cars they represent. Unlike Mustangs Camrys and Camaros these race cars are thin bodies mounted on space frame chassis. That said the Next Gen cars are closer to “stock” than the sixth-generation cars.

For example the Mustang Camaro and Camry have ridden on independent rear suspension for years. The Next Gen car finally brings independent rear suspension to NASCAR.

You can’t order the Mustang Camaro or Camry with fifteen-inch steel rims. The Next Gen car also rides on modern eighteen-inch forged aluminum rims.

Finally the Next Gen car has a symmetrical body. Overall the new race car will handle much more like a modern muscle car. The NASCAR Next Generation car is closer to a “stock” car. You might even say NASCAR is returning to its roots. Add in the fact that NASCAR now sees more passing and wheel-to-wheel racing and there’s a lot to love about the latest car design.

With oil prices at seven-year highs and investors worried about supply chain problems and inflation Wall Street is on the hunt for companies that will avoid the worst of the pain of rising costs — or turn it to their advantage.

One way to do that is through pricing power which is shorthand for a company's ability to raise prices to cancel out rising costs and maintain the profits and margins that investors want to see.

The Season 3 premiere of Succession which aired Sunday night on HBO picks up in the aftermath of Kendall alleging publicly that his father Logan personally oversaw the decades-long cover-up of sexual exploitation and intimidation at Waystar Royco. As Kendall and Logan organize their own defenses the rest of the family is sent scrambling to figure out how legally vulnerable they each might be in the impending war.

And in the final 10 minutes of the episode a new character the high-powered attorney Lisa Arthur (Sanaa Lathan) is introduced indicating that this season is headed toward the legal drama genre. To analyze the ongoing action and offer legal advice to the characters TIME interviewed three corporate lawyers and Succession fans: Holly J. Gregory the co-chair of Sidley Austin LLP’s global Corporate Governance and Executive Compensation Practice; Kai Haakon E. Liekefett the partner and co-chair of Sidley’s Shareholder Activism Practice; and Louis Pierro a founding partner of Pierro Connor & Strauss. Here are excerpts from those conversations.

What do you think of Succession and how accurate is it?

Liekefett: I watched each season twice because I loved it so much. It’s literally what I do for a living: I’ve represented public companies like AT&T Box and Fujifilm in proxy battles and similar matters.

Gregory: It’s a wonderful show. They’ve done a great job of drawing this dysfunctional family and dysfunctional company just brilliantly. It depicts some real-life situations that happen on real boards although in the extreme. I’m getting ready to teach an ethics class and I’m going to base hypotheticals on the show to teach lawyer ethics. It’ll be fun.

Pierro: When I saw the first episode I said ‘Goodness gracious there’s our lives.’ Many companies that are dominated by a character like Logan Roy end up with a number of dysfunctional people around them because that person has 100% of the power in the company and no one else really has empowerment. So they tend to be a bit misfit in their roles as CFO or COO. That is extremely accurate to this type of company.

I was a part of a board meeting yesterday where the dad owned the company and died. Mom now owns the company there’s a buyout agreement for mom—and it was just a hornets nest among the widow and the four children each of which had their own lawyer there at the table. So those dynamics are real but I think the characters are just a bit embellished.

Have there been any parts of the show that have been inaccurate?

Liekefett: One of the few cringeworthy moments in my view was during the infamous board meeting in episode eight when the so-called vote of confidence failed. In return Logan fires half of the board. That is legally impossible as far as I’m concerned. The CEO cannot fire its board it’s the other way around.

How often do you see scenarios of a son and a father vying for control of a company?

Pierro: My practice of 37 years has been focused on trusts and estates tax and business planning. Very often all of those things are woven together because the estate plan of a business owner has to include their succession plan. In the case of Logan Roy he just isn’t ready to let go. I do see that all the time—and the impact that has on the kids who are waiting around saying ‘O.K. when is it my turn?’ But I haven’t seen too many cases where one of the children tried to jump up and pull that business out before dad was ready to let go.

Gerri serves as general counsel for Waystar but also becomes deeply wrapped up in the family’s politics and drama. How do general counsels deal with this kind of situation—in which they may have conflicting loyalties to varying family members as well as the company itself?

Liekefett: This is actually not rare. Yesterday I spoke to a general counsel of a major public company where the board and the CEO may have diverging interests because of a takeover situation. The eternal question for the general counsel of a company in this kind of situation where there’s a power struggle between the board and the CEO is ‘Who is my client?’

Gregory: There’s only one answer to that: the board is Gerri’s client and the ultimate authority in the company. But it gets more confused when you have a large controlling shareholder on the board which is what you have here. Counsel has legal responsibility to the board but with the pragmatic reality that the controlling shareholder can take action to not reelect the board depending on his level of control. Given Gerri’s allegiance to Logan and other people in the family she clearly is not thinking of the board as her ultimate client.

Pierro: I represent a company which is owned by five siblings. One of them is in the controlling position but the other four siblings have raised a number of issues. My duty of loyalty in that case is to the company as I am corporate counsel. So when push came to shove I had to recommend to the CEO that he get personal counsel to represent him individually in what ended up being a shareholder battle.

Kai you deal with proxy battles for a living. What do you think of the show’s depiction of that aspect?

Liekefett: In the last 20 years proxy fights have become very very common: where insurgent dissident shareholders hostile bidders hedge funds or others nominate a competing slate. And then you essentially have an election campaign where you’re trying to win the hearts and minds of shareholders. Like in politics both sides typically have these election campaigns where they hire private investigators for opposition research. It can get pretty dirty.

Succession depicts the proxy fight pretty well although they made a couple of slight mistakes. In this day and age in America whenever a company is faced with a hostile takeover through a tender offer they adopt a so-called poison pill. When the board of Royco was faced with the tender offer from Sandy and Stewy they could have easily adopted a poison pill by saying “10% is the maximum that Stewy and co. can acquire.” In which case then it goes to the proxy fight. So they didn’t do that part well—but when they start to depict the proxy fight in season two they do that really well. They even have one advisor right: they mention one of the top proxy solicitation firms called D.F. King.

How do Kendall’s public allegations against his father impact Waystar’s proxy battle against Sandy and Stewy?

Liekefett: In the proxy fight world we use a lot of terminology from political elections and we are always concerned about the so-called ‘October Surprise.’ This is the ultimate October Surprise and the nightmare of any defense attorney that something like this would happen shortly prior to the annual meeting. If that were to happen in my practice we’d probably be dead in the water.

With that level of dysfunction—where the son of the CEO and chairman goes out and accuses his father of these kinds of wrongdoing—shareholders in 99 out of 100 situations would say ‘O.K. enough said. I don’t even care who is right father or son. The level of dysfunction here is so unbearable that we need some adults in the boardroom. Anything is better than the status quo we need some fresh faces here as directors.’ It would be the death knell of any proxy fight.

Do you think jail time is on the table for the various members of the Roy family?

Pierro: If Kendall had gotten convicted there are a lot of variables. What did he know when did he know it? As we’ve watched criminal prosecutions are not always clean and easy. We have some real life examples like the Trump Organization: where companies have been found to violate tax laws and the CFO has been prosecuted other people in the company are being investigated the company itself is being prosecuted—but the CEO of the company has not yet been touched. So you have to build the chain of evidence.

From the prosecution side I think they would have had a tough time pinning Kendall with a serious crime. He wasn’t in a position where he was in charge of that and there were certainly enough other people involved that his culpability could have been spread around and would have been hard to pin down.

In the first episode of the third season the services of the attorney Lisa Arthur are requested by both Kendall and Logan. If both offers were extended to you whose business would you take?

Pierro: If you look at Logan he is a flawed character but he has a unified purpose: he has always wanted control has always crushed other people for that control and stepped on other people and probably in the course of this committed crimes. Kendall is probably a more sympathetic character who was put on the altar of sacrifice by his father. And so certainly my sympathies would lean towards Kendall. But I think if you wanted to back the winner in that race then it would be Logan.

Liekefett: I would go for the client who looks a little bit less guilty has deeper pockets and is more likely to pay our bills. But that’s the problem: Logan appears to be way more guilty but he has way deeper pockets. He’s still the largest shareholder and is extremely influential. It’s tough to choose. I certainly would take a retainer up front.

In the episode Logan debates with Gerri about whether Waystar should cooperate with the feds. How common is it for corporations to refuse to cooperate?

Pierro: It’s a strategy of many corporations to obfuscate deny and hide. With the feds it depends on who’s doing the investigation and how much of a pitbull they are. But in the corporate world evidence is disappeared all the time. That is a common practice unfortunately.

And corporations have a shield that no one else has and an immunization from liability for the individuals in the corporation for the most part. I mean if you go back to Enron for example when they had the scandal and all of the workers were grifted out of their pensions and their stock tumbled. One of the only people that got prosecuted was Ken Lay who was the Logan Roy of Enron. But most of the other people managed to kind of go out the back door and didn’t get brought into the limelight. So corporations have a great ability to obfuscate and to push blame off into other directions where it’s very difficult to pin down any one person unless you have that smoking gun.

Should Tom and Greg use the company lawyers or should they look for outside counsel?

Gregory: They have both undertaken actions that are more than dodgy. They have both engaged in a cover-up: Tom being the driver of the cover up and Greg helping him while also trying to protect his own backside by retaining documents. They’ve both taken actions that violate the company’s code of conduct and also likely violate law. They can’t be advised by the company’s counsel at this point because they have interests that conflict with the company’s interests with respect to their unethical and potentially unlawful conduct. They need their own counsel and they need separate counsel from one another.

Liekefett: One of the highlights of the show for me was the testimony in the senate. And I don’t think any lawyer would have allowed these two to be in front of congress so unprepared. It becomes abundantly clear these guys have a huge legal problem that is separate and distinct from the company’s legal issues. They need their own counsel and they need to learn how to plead the fifth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYnVsZ2FyaWFubWlsaXRhcnkuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTcvdS1zLWZpcnN0LWNvbHVtYmlhLWNsYXNzLW51Y2xlYXItc3VibWFyaW5lLXdpbGwtY29zdC04LTUtYmlsbGlvbi_SAWpodHRwczovL2J1bGdhcmlhbm1pbGl0YXJ5LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzE3L3Utcy1maXJzdC1jb2x1bWJpYS1jbGFzcy1udWNsZWFyLXN1Ym1hcmluZS13aWxsLWNvc3QtOC01LWJpbGxpb24v?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. first Columbia-class nuclear submarine will cost $ 8.5 billion,"WASHINGTON – The first Columbia-class strategic nuclear submarine to be developed in the United States equipped with intercontinental ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads will cost about $ 8.5 billion learned BulgarianMilitary.com according to documents considered in the US Congress.

Funds for the purchase of the first such submarine have already been allocated its construction is underway. A contribution was also made to the construction of a second such submarine.

These strategic missile carriers should replace the outdated Ohio class submarines. A total of 12 Columbia-class submarines capable of carrying 16 Trident II D5 ICBMs with MIRVs are to be built and deployed to the US Navy by 2031. The submarines will replace the 14 obsolete Ohio-class strategic submarines currently in the US nuclear triad each carrying 20 Trident II D5 missiles.

It is expected that six submarines will be deployed at the Bangor Pacific base Washington state and six more at King’s Bay Georgia on the Atlantic. On combat patrols in the world’s oceans there will be at least eight such submarines simultaneously. The rest will undergo ongoing maintenance at the bases.

According to Congress documents a total of $ 109.8 billion is expected to be spent on the submarine replacement program in the coming years.

The advanced strategic nuclear submarines of the Columbia class are designed for 42 years of service. Construction is carried out at the shipyards of General Dynamics Electric Boat and Newport News Shipbuilding.

The US Navy emphasizes that the program for the construction of new Columbia-class missile carriers is currently a priority for the US strategic nuclear forces.

U.S. Congress also has questions

The United States Congress has its questions according to the American portal USNI News. For example whether the situation with Covid-19 will not significantly impact plans to develop the program. Meaningful questions that Congress also asks are: how accurate are the costs; whether they will not affect other fleet costs; what the likelihood is that prices will increase and whether there will be no industrial problems knowing that the United States is currently building Virginia-class submarines.

Moscow is not sleeping either

On the other side of the planet Russia is also developing its new submarines and missiles to the arm. At the end of last year we announced a new missile Russian test which is anti-submarine. The newest Russian frigate “Admiral Kasatonov” has performed the Barents Sea waters tests as we reported earlier this year.

So far the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation’s press service does not provide information on the type and model of the missile but only concludes that the test was successful as part of a series of qualified Russian tests fleet in the area. Military analysts suggest that the Russian missile is an entirely new development of the military-industrial complex. According to a Russian MoD press release a Russian nuclear submarine strictly monitored the launch movement of the missile and the target’s hitting.

(AP Photo/LM Otero File)

(NEXSTAR) – The price of just about everything is going up right now. Sometimes it’s obvious – like at the meat counter or the car dealership – and sometimes it’s more subtle like in the grocery store aisles.

That’s because in lieu of raising prices many manufacturers are choosing to shrink packaging instead – a trend called “shrinkflation.” General Mills got called out for doing it to their family-sized cereals downsizing the boxes from 19.3 ounces to 18.1. Tillamook owned up to making their tubs of ice cream 8 ounces smaller. Each roll of toilet paper you buy may have fewer sheets than it did a year ago. That jug of orange juice now suddenly has a larger cut-out that makes up the handle.

“It is a real form of inflation” said Bailey Norwood head of Oklahoma State’s Department of Agricultural Economics. “The price is going up but the price tag you see in the grocery isn’t going up the quantity is going down. … I understand how people wouldn’t like it because it does seem kind of sneaky.”

If you’re grocery shopping on a tight budget and are trying to avoid getting duped by shrinkflation make sure you’re calculating the per-ounce price of goods. That could involve whipping out the calculator but often the grocery store will do the work for you – just read the smaller print on the store’s price label.

Pay attention to the per-ounce price if you’re trying to avoid sneaky higher prices. The ketchup on the left is 12 cents per ounce for example and the organic option is 18 cents per ounce. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)

While shrinkflation may seem like a money-grab by companies tricking people into spending more Norwood said it could be the lesser of many evils among continued supply chain disruptions shipping container delays and shortages.

“The companies have to do something. They realize they can’t supply the normal amount at the normal price” he said. “Something’s got to give.”

To cope with rising costs companies are essentially left with three options Norwood said:

Manufacture and package everything exactly the same and raise the price. This may be the most straightforward option but it could end up pricing out some customers altogether. Lower the quality of ingredients to lower the cost of producing the good and keep the price lower. But in this case the brand’s reputation could be at stake and customers end up with a lower-quality product. Ration the product so you can keep the product on the market but just at smaller quantities. This is the shrinkflation option.

“You have to ask yourself what’s better: A little less cereal in the boxes or 5% of people are going to encounter stock-outs?” Norwood said.

As things return to normal eventually will prices go back down? No one knows Norwood admitted.

More air in that bag of chips? Fewer flakes in your cereal box? You're not imagining it: ""Shrinkflation"" a tactic used by industry to hide price increases is back in vogue.

Facing the post-pandemic inflationary surge partly fueled by bottlenecks in global supply and trouble finding workers companies are under more pressure to deal with rising costs.

Consumer advocate Edgar Dworsky who has followed the phenomenon he calls downsizing for quarter of a century says he has identified dozens of products in recent months that have seen sneaky price increases.

He found goods ranging from Charmin toilet paper rolls to Cheerios cereal to Royal Canin canned cat food where the size or weight has shrunk but the price remains the same.

In September food giant General Mills maker of Cheerios flagged the soaring costs for materials and labor to justify conventional price increases but also changes to ""PPA"" -- price pack architecture -- a technical term for the adjustment of size or quantities.

While these small changes in size could pass largely unnoticed in the past the internet era puts them in the spotlight.

On the social network Reddit the ""Shrinkflation"" group has 14500 members who share their discoveries though mostly tongue-in-cheek rather than to protest.

""It's definitely more insidious because shrinkage at least for me is less noticeable than a price increase"" Jonathan Khoo 44 a software designer in Oregon told AFP.

But ""it's the delay in finding out that you've been played"" that makes the tactic ""much worse"" than a straightforward price hike he said.

Pierre Chandon professor of marketing at the Sorbonne University's INSEAD behavioral lab said shoppers feel they have been scammed because ""most consumers have a mistaken idea that the quantities are standardized regulated"" which is only true for a few with rare exceptions like alcohol.

""Since we assume that the weight is fixed we do not look at it"" Chandon said.

- 'Bad shoppers' -

Fellow Oregon resident Brian Johnson winced when he recently saw that a container of trendy local ice cream brand Tillamook lost six ounces dropping to 48 ounces (to 1.42 liters from 1.65 liters).

""I know that companies are doing this because consumers have a price point for items based on years of experience. They expect to buy a container of something within a price range"" the 52-year-old data scientist said.

Dworsky known as ""Mr Consumer"" said companies ""don't take a step like that lightly.""

""They did the calculation"" and if they get a handful of complaints ""they send a couple of bucks in coupons to the consumer to get them to keep buying.""

In fact there are no documented examples of shoppers revolting against a product that has shrunk and even the members of the Reddit group hardly ever call for a boycott of a brand.

""Perhaps we have learned that this is normal and that if we are fooled it is because we have been bad shoppers"" Chandon explained.

Anand Krishnamoorthy a marketing professor at the University of Central Florida said that even after the cost spikes have receded ""there is no incentive"" for brands to revert to their original size.

Examples of shrinkage can be seen in many other sectors -- from tiny urban apartments to legroom on airplanes -- but ""where we notice it the most is consumer packaged goods.""

""Consumers don't understand sizing as much as they do prices"" Krishnamoorthy said.

Chandon the Sorbonne professor sees a silver lining in the health benefits of smaller package sizes.

""We know that the more there is the more we eat"" he said and now ""we are returning to what were normal portions not so long ago.""

Old El Paso is the beloved Tex-Mex brand many of us turn to for assistance with Taco Tuesdays. Its tacos fajitas enchilada and burrito bowl dinner kits are things families can reach for when they want both convenience and flavor. The company undoubtedly earned new fans when it introduced Bold Nacho Cheese-Flavored Shells in 2014.

Kyrie Irving refusing to get vaccinated for the coronavirus has put the franchise in a lot of trouble. Fans were finally hoping to see the power trio of Kevin Durant James Harden and Kyrie in action without any health issues.

But it seems like that could be a while. Because unless Irving changes his mind he will probably be benched for upcoming games. While this is a topic everyone is debating over a question started hovering around. Of course all three of them are some of the best stars in the league right now. However they do not rank the same when it comes to minting money. So who is the richest amongst the Nets’ big three?

Kevin Durant comes out on top in money rankings

As per Celebrity Net Worth KD’s net worth is $200 million which includes his on-court and off-court earnings. The four-year contract that he signed with the Brooklyn Nets this summer is alone a $164 million contract. However his profits aren’t just limited to the hardwood floor.

His lucrative deals with big brands like Google Nike Alaska Airlines Panini and many others also contribute to his earnings. Not only that but he also keeps himself involved in smart investments like Coinbase Lime Scooters Caffeine TV. Most recently he has also shown interest in tech startups such as Postmates and Acorns.

And let’s not forget the media company that he built from the ground up called ‘Thirty-Five Media’ which has produced “The Boardroom” for ESPN.

Then there is James Harden whose net worth is $165 million. Before joining the Nets he had only played for two other teams the Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder. This meant that he could get Supermax deals.

Harden could have risen up the rank if only he had accepted the $50 million a year offer from the Rockets and becoming the first player in NBA’s history to do so. But it was clear that he was very desperate to leave that franchise and start afresh. Finally Kyrie Irving stands third amongst them with a $90 million net worth.

Kyrie like the others has a big income from his ventures outside of basketball. Of course his contract with the Nets which is under some decision-making at the moment pays him heavily but so do these other deals. He collaborates with 2k Sports Nike General Mills and many more. However Kyrie is still younger than his other two teams so chances are he can bag bigger deals in the future if he stays healthy.

Kevin Durant had a head start compared to these two as he was drafted before them. He did not waste any time establishing himself and proving what his potential is to bag these big deals. Can any of the others surpass him in the near or far future?

Stalling on the road can result in a crash increasing the risk of injury for the occupants of the car and their fellow motorists. The recall includes the following models:

2021 Cadillac Escalade

2021 Cadillac Escalade ESV

2021 Chevrolet Suburban

2021 Chevrolet Tahoe

2021 GMC Yukon

2021 GMC Yukon XL

The faulty component that caused this recall is the “Fuel Pump Power Control Module” part #13537053.

Recall summary

The recalled Cadillac Escalade Chevy Suburban Chevy Tahoe and GMC Yukon SUVs contain a faulty fuel pump power control module. The module is a small computer that delivers power to run the car’s fuel pump which in turn delivers fuel to the engine.

The defective control module may fail causing the fuel pump to shut down which may starve the engine of gasoline and stall the car. GM blamed the defect on the supplier Vitesco but did not provide a specific cause for the fault.

The recall is based on 617 related complaints and 229 reports of stalls drawn from warranty claim data. GM said it was not aware of any injuries related to this issue to date.

Recall risks

Stalling out on the road puts the car at risk of being hit by faster-moving traffic. Read more about the risks of stalling and what to do if your car stalls in this article about a recent Chrysler recall.

Warning signs

Drivers may notice a few different “symptoms” if this problem is occurring:

The check engine light may illuminate. The engine is running rough. The vehicle may enter into a “reduced power” mode causing sluggish acceleration.

Other related recalls

General Motors recalled the same Escalade Suburban Tahoe and Yukon vehicle models over a recent power steering failure that affected 26847 SUVs.

In June there was a Cadillac Escalade recall because of faulty airbag warning lights as reported. The recall also included Tahoe Corvette Suburban and Yukon vehicles.

There was a Chevrolet Tahoe recall in March because of the risk of flat tires.

There have been many Chevy recalls including one in October 2019 for unintended braking.

The repair

GM dealers will replace the power control module on the recalled Chevy Tahoe Suburban GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade SUVs for free. All owners will be officially notified about the recall starting November 8 but the repair is already available. Customers are eligible for courtesy transportation if they are concerned about driving their cars.

The US Defense Department said Friday that it is committed to offering condolence payments to relatives of the 10 people who were killed in an errant US drone strike in Kabul Afghanistan in August. The statement was to some extent mea culpa for the controversial drone attacks but it was also undoubtedly a utilitarian gesture by the US rather than a heartfelt move.The errant drone strike has put the US into several moral dilemmas. Washington has been strongly condemned by the international community especially by local Afghan people. Over a month after the attacks the US offered a condolence payment in a bid to save face. Meanwhile considering that the US may need to deal its relationship with the Taliban well in the future and try to influence Afghanistan the statement of the US Defense Department is also to some extent a gesture to the Taliban.However far more than 10 Afghan civilians died during US troops' withdrawal from Afghanistan. In the deadly blast outside of Kabul's airport on August 26 about 170 people died with at least 200 wounded. It was later proved that most of the dead were shot to death by US troops at the scene. Not to mention more than 47000 Afghan civilians were killed in the Afghan war over the past two decades.The US has kept silent about compensation for casualties of these civilians. This is partly because the US' war responsibility in Afghanistan may be difficult to define from a legal perspective. But this reflects that the US' attitude toward the deceased is based on the principle of benefiting the US. The US' war responsibility in Afghanistan is a mess. Afghanistan has poor ability to hold the US legally accountable. The subject of accountability is also not clear. Unless the US initiates a serious investigation itself it would be hard to hold the US legally accountable for the series of crimes it committed in Afghanistan.But the drone attack that killed 10 Afghan civilians including seven children has been exposed to the world under media pressure. The follow-up measures proposed by Washington look more like a stopgap measure even a perfunctory move to minimize the issue. Besides it is unlikely that Washington will offer a face-to-face apology to relatives of the 10 Afghan people as they have demanded. Instead Washington will likely characterize the whole affair as a mistake in decision-making obscuring it in the form of condolence payments and avoid more explicit responsibility. According to media reports most ex gratia payments are small - usually between $2500 and $5000. One of the condolence payments issued in 2019 was only $131.Over the past 20 years whether it was during the Afghanistan war the Iraq war or the global war on terrorism the US actually paid the price for its attitude and irresponsible behavior. The US has used drone strikes and targeted elimination to attack. But as said by Chris Woods director of the UK-based monitoring group Airwars ""You cannot bomb cities and towns without significant civilian harm.""At the same time the irresponsible actions of US soldiers such as burning the Koran and blaspheming Islam have intensified the anti-US sentiment among the Islamic countries. This provides the soil for the breeding of extremism and terrorism.The US' utilitarianism has brought disaster and suffering to the world. It has also caused great losses and troubles to itself. But it seems the US still has not figured out that what goes around comes around.The author is a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of the Shanghai International Studies University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FzaWEtcGFjaWZpYy91cy1vZmZlcnMtdW5zcGVjaWZpZWQtcGF5bWVudHMtZmFtaWx5LXRob3NlLWtpbGxlZC1ib3RjaGVkLWRyb25lLWF0dGFjay0yMDIxLTEwLTE2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. offers payments relocation to family of Afghans killed in botched drone attack,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-offers-unspecified-payments-family-those-killed-botched-drone-attack-2021-10-16/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FzaWEtcGFjaWZpYy91cy1vZmZlcnMtdW5zcGVjaWZpZWQtcGF5bWVudHMtZmFtaWx5LXRob3NlLWtpbGxlZC1ib3RjaGVkLWRyb25lLWF0dGFjay0yMDIxLTEwLTE2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5kZW1vY3JhY3kubmV0L2VuL3RoZS1nbG9iYWwtbm9ydGgtY2F1c2VkLXRoZS1jbGltYXRlLWNyaXNpcy1ub3ctaXMtdGhlLXRpbWUtdG8tcGF5LWl0cy1kdWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Global North caused the climate crisis. Now is the time to pay its dues,"“Africa contributed just 3% of global emissions yet we are the continent which ... is already paying the biggest price” said Gabon President Ali Bongo Ondimba.

“Every day the thunderstorms seem more violent flooding is more frequent and droughts more severe ... our crops are failing. People are being forced to flee their homes becoming climate refugees"" he added. “Sea levels are rising potentially drowning cities ... The oceans are turning to acid and salt is penetrating croplands causing further serious challenges to food security.”

In theory wealthier countries have already committed to significant amounts of climate finance: in 2009 they agreed to climate finance targets that included $100bn a year each year between 2020 and 2025. However last month Oxfam analysed current pledges and found that the total actually committed for that period falls $75bn short.

Zambia is much more a victim of climate change than its driver. The country’s per capita emissions amount to 0.4 tonnes per person per year. The average US citizen is responsible for 16 tonnes. And while it’s going to be possible – with investment – to deal with some of the impacts that climate change will cause for countries like Zambia much of what is to come isn’t the kind of thing you can just adapt to.

And this is where ‘loss and damage’ comes in. If the first pillar of climate change negotiations is mitigation – how can we work together to stop carbon emissions? And the second is adaptation – how can we change to cope with the changing climate? Then loss and damage is the third – an idea originally muted in the 1990s by small island states but gaining increasing traction.

Results of colonial destruction

Until 1890 the people of what’s now Zambia organised themselves into different civilisations with different languages histories and ways of being. Over the next decade the area came under the rule of Cecil Rhodes’ British South Africa Company partly through violent military conquest and partly through a deal King Lewanika of Barotseland signed to protect against the Portuguese.

Up until the 1960s despite its rich mineral wealth the country was treated as triply peripheral: as it was on the fringe of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) which was itself on the fringe of the British empire’s important Cape Colony (now South Africa).

Over just 70 years Zambia went through a dizzying series of mergers and demergers treated like the subsidiary of a company rather than a human society: Barotziland–North-Western Rhodesia and North-Eastern Rhodesia were merged into Northern Rhodesia and then again to be part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland also known as the Central African Federation before eventually securing independence in 1964 after which the country was ruled by the independence leader Kenneth Kaunda until 1991.

However like many colonies Zambia’s economy had been built for mineral extraction rather than wealth retention and was left heavily reliant on copper exports. In 1970 the price of copper collapsed on the global market. And Zambia wasn’t the only newly independent mineral-rich country: a group of countries with a vast percentage of the world’s oil between them had formed themselves into OPEC jacking up the price of oil.

Like most other countries without major oil reserves Zambia’s debt to Western Banks ballooned – from $800m to $3.2bn. Eventually the IMF bailed the banks out but forced a programme of economic liberalisation upon Zambia that crippled its economy.

This economic collapse is visible in the country’s carbon emissions which fell from 0.9 tonnes per capita in 1970 to 0.3 tonnes in 1990: a grim story of impoverishment. Between 1990 and 2003 wages fell child mortality increased life expectancy fell and the number of people living on less than $2 a day increased from 6 million in 1991 (75% of the population) to over 9 million by 2003 (85% of the population).

In 2005 after the successes of the global Jubilee Debt Campaign Zambia had around $4bn of debt cancelled and was finally able to expand its economy and in turn its carbon emissions started to grow.

In August Zambia’s ostensibly social democratic party the Patriotic Front lost the presidency to the centrist-liberal United Party for National Development.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2VudGVycHJpc2UucHJlc3Mvc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLzEwLzE3L2VneXB0cy1iYWxhbmNlLW9mLXBheW1lbnRzLWZsaXBzLXRvLXN1cnBsdXMtaW4tMjAyMC0yMDIxLWN1cnJlbnQtYWNjb3VudC1kZWZpY2l0LXJpc2VzLTU1ODA0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Egypt's balance of payments flips to surplus in 2020-2021 current account deficit rises,"Egypt’s balance of payments flipped to a surplus of USD 1.9 bn in the state fiscal year ending 30 June 2021 compared with a deficit of USD 8.6 bn in the previous fiscal year when the early days of the covid-19 pandemic wiped out tourism and slowed global trade. “This improvement proved the ability of the Egyptian economy to quickly recover from the crises that hit the global economy” the central bank said in a statement (pdf) released over the weekend that enclosed the figures.

What’s the balance of payments? You can think of it as the delta between all of the money that comes into the country thanks to things that bring in money (tourism exports Suez Canal revenues FDI remittances etc) and the money we send outside the country (largely thanks to imports of everything from food to fuel).

Our current account deficit widened by USD 7.2 bn in the state fiscal year ending 30 June 2021 closing FY 2020-2021 at USD 18.4 bn compared with USD 11.2 bn the previous year a fact the CBE attributed to a “noticeable drop in tourism revenues” thanks to the impact of the pandemic on tourism. (Diving a bit deeper we think the current account deficit actually shrank from USD 5.7 bn in 3Q2020-21 likely on the back of rising remittances and portfolio investments.)

Our biggest gainer was remittances which rose by 13.2% y-o-y in FY 2020-2021 to USD 31.4 bn up from USD 27.8 bn the previous fiscal year. Inflows rose almost 30% to USD 8.1 bn in 4Q up from USD 6.2 bn in the same period last year the CBE noted last month.

Thank you carry traders: Portfolio investments also turned positive this year recording a net inflow of USD 18.7 bn this year compared to a net outflow of USD 7.3 bn in the FY2019-20. Egypt’s high real interest rates have kept it as one of the most attractive emerging markets destinations for the carry trade as the CBE kept interest rates on hold for the past seven MPC meetings. We’ll have to wait until 28 October to see if last month’s spike in inflation coupled with the chance of a Fed tapering will drive it to buck the trend.

And despite supply chain disruptions global port lockdowns (not to mention a ship which will not be named) Suez Canal revenues saw a slight rise of 1.7% to USD 5.9 bn up from USD 5.8 the year before.

Trade deficit widened last fiscalyear: The non-oil trade deficit widened to USD 42.1 bn from USD 36 bn in FY2019-2020 a 16.7% increase due to non-oil imports rising 15.2% y-o-y to record USD 62.1 bn from USD 53.9 bn.

Foreign direct investment for the year also dipped 30% y-o-y to USD 5.2 bn from USD 7.5 bn which the statement attributed to continued blowback from the pandemic.

It was not a good year for tourism: Tourism revenues dropped by half during the fiscal year to record USD 4.9 bn down from USD 9.9 bn during FY2019-2020 mainly due to the impact lockdowns and travel restrictions (thanks red list). That said tourism is en route to recovery with arrivals averaging 400k people per month — a near 40% increase in monthly average figures prior to the pandemic. This is only expected to get better as a number of nations lift these travel restrictions including the UK which took us off the red list last month. Bookings to Egypt and Turkey from the UK have soared 400% since our removal from the red list an Easyjet executive told the Guardian last week.

MORE GOOD NEWS ON THAT FRONT– Russia will lift remaining covid-related restrictions on flights to Sharm El Sheikh and Hurghada from November 9 Russian state-run outlet TASS reported the government’s coronavirus task force as saying last week. Other countries to see restrictions lifted on the same date include Tunisia Thailand the Netherlands Sweden Norway Iran Slovenia and Oman according to Reuters.

Russia has been gradually reinstating direct air links with Hurghada and Sharm El Sheikh since August 9 when direct flights between Moscow and the two coastal cities were resumed after a six-year hiatus following the 2015 Metrojet crash in Sinai. Since then Russia has twice upped the number of flights between Moscow and the two Egyptian resorts to reach as many as 25 per week and expanded flights to other Russian cities outside of Moscow.",,,

In a classic Texas football rivalry match Duncanville High School faces off against Cedar Hill High School. The schools compete in the District 11-6A football conference. Duncanville is currently ranked number 1 while Cedar Hill is ranked number 2 according to MaxPreps.

Globe Life Field opened in 2020 as the home of the Texas Rangers Major League Baseball team. The stadium has been used for concerts and rodeos but this will be the first-ever football game. The in-house Rangers marketing agency REV Entertainment said the football field will be arranged to sit from left field to first base.

The field is one of only five synthetic turf baseball fields in the nation. The synthetic surface makes it reasonably easy to change the field from a baseball configuration to a football field. The field was changed this week ahead of the announcement.

The high-powered high school game will play prior to the Lockheed Martin Commanders’ Classic presented by USAA game scheduled for Nov. 6. The game will feature the U.S. Airforce Academy against the U.S. Military Academy.

“We are excited that the first football game at Globe Life Field will feature two of the area’s top high school teams in Duncanville and Cedar Hill” said Sean Decker President of REV Entertainment. “This important regular season matchup will be a great preview to our first college game in this facility.”

In recent years the Duncanville Panthers have been excelling with two State Championship appearances and a State Semi-Finals match. Head coach Reggie Samples has his team at 5-1 with the only loss on the season against Mater Dei a nationally top-ranked campus in California. The Panthers defeated Waxahachie 52-3 last Friday.

Cedar Hill finished 2020 with a 12-2 record and high hopes going into 2021. They currently sit at 4-3 coming off a devastating shutout loss to hometown rival DeSoto this week. The Longhorns’ two other losses were against Allen and Rockwall.

“This is always a big district match up and we are excited to play at a great venue” Head Coach Carlos Lynn said in an email. “Should be lots of fun for the athletes and fans.”

The game is currently set for a kick-off time of 7:30 pm on Friday October 22. Cedar Hill will be the home team for the inaugural football game under the bright lights of Globe Life Field.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9uaGwvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zMjQxOTI1OC9qaW1teS1oYXllcy1mYW1pbHktaG9wZXMtc2hhcmluZy1zdG9yeS1zYXZlLWxpZmUtZmVudGFueWwtY29udHJpYnV0ZWQtZm9ybWVyLW5obC1wbGF5ZXItc3VkZGVuLWRlYXRo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jimmy Hayes' family hopes sharing his story 'can save someone's life' after fentanyl contributed to former NHL player's ...,"Former NHL player Jimmy Hayes had cocaine and fentanyl in his system when he died his family told The Boston Globe on Sunday.

Hayes was found dead at his home in the Boston suburbs on Aug. 23 the day after celebrating his son's second birthday. He was 31.

""I hope getting Jimmy's story out there can save someone's life"" Hayes' father Kevin told the Boston Globe. ""If this can save someone from the pain great. It's just so sad. I pride myself on being pretty mentally strong. I'm a street guy. But there's just no formula for this. You have a beautiful All-American boy who made a terrible mistake and it cost him his life.''

Jimmy Hayes' wife Kristen told the newspaper that she received the toxicology report from the Massachusetts state medical examiner on Friday. She took the call when she was en route to New Jersey to attend a Devils-Blackhawks game which featured a pregame tribute for Hayes.

""I was completely shocked'' Kristen told the Globe. ""I was so certain that it had nothing to do with drugs. I really thought it was a heart attack or anything that wasn't that [drugs]. ... It didn't make any sense so it was hard. I was hoping to get a different phone call when they called. I was hoping to get some clarity and I was shocked to hear that it was that. ... He never showed any signs of a struggle at home.''

Kevin Hayes said that 16 or 17 months ago he noticed ""a little change"" in his son's behavior.

""I went to him and I said 'I think there might be a problem here with pills'"" Kevin Hayes told the Globe. ""He had had an injury for a while and I think he started taking the painkillers and they get you. I said 'Jim I think I see a problem here.' And he's 31 years old so I can't tell him to go get help. So I said 'When you want help I'll be here for you pal. Let me know.'

""He called me three weeks later and said 'Dad I'm hooked on these pills. I got injured and I started taking them and I never got off.' And I said 'Well let's get you some help.' He went to a place up in Haverhill. So he gets help and everything was on the path to recovery I thought. But this [expletive] is so powerful.''

Hayes' father said it was important to share his son's story because he didn't want him to be ""stigmatized as a junkie.""

""Because he wasn't. Jimmy helped everyone"" Kevin Hayes told the Globe. ""Some of the stories I've been hearing. He never said no. [Former Bruin] Torey Krug told me they used to go to Children's Hospital. Jimmy'd fall in love with a kid then go back a week later. And a week later. He was just a wonderful kid but this addiction ... is just so powerful.""

Hayes who was born and raised in the Boston neighborhood of Dorchester became a local hero after winning a national championship with Boston College in 2010 then eventually playing for the Boston Bruins. Thousands showed up for his wake in Dorchester on Aug. 29 with mourners lining the streets including many young athletes wearing Dorchester Youth Hockey jerseys.

Hayes a 2008 second-round draft pick of the Toronto Maple Leafs played seven NHL seasons for the Blackhawks Panthers Bruins and Devils. In 334 games he scored 54 goals and 55 assists.

Hayes last played professionally in 2019 and had been a co-host of a podcast called ""Missin Curfew.""

His younger brother Kevin Hayes Jr. is a forward for the Philadelphia Flyers.

Kristen Hayes released a statement Monday saying ""Although we are shocked and heartbroken beyond words I choose to remember my husband and the boys' father through the enormous love and joy that he brought us and so many others. This battle does not define him and I will still tell my boys every day to be like Jimmy. Jimmy touched so many lives while he was here by living so generously and open-heartedly and I hope his story can continue to make a positive impact especially for anyone who is struggling with the grips of substance abuse.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzE2L3Nwb3J0cy9ob2xseXdvb2Qtc2NyaXB0LWxpZmUtdG9ueS1kZW1hcmNvLXdhcy1ib3N0b25zLWNoYW1waW9uLW5vcnRoLWVuZHMtcHJpZGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,“A Hollywood script of a life”: Tony DeMarco was Boston's champion and the North End's pride,"“A Hollywood script of a life” said Richard Johnson longtime curator of the Sports Museum and a pal of DeMarco’s for more than 30 years. “In fact if someone wrote the Tony DeMarco script a producer would throw it back and say ‘C’mon no one’s going to believe this . . . Come back with something real.’ ”

Tony DeMarco was fearless and ferocious in the ring an undisputed world welterweight title holder the son of Italian immigrants born in the North End and raised but a short walk from Paul Revere’s house.

Tony DeMarco one-time welterweight champion of the world died Monday at the age of 89.

Long before we started to boast that Boston is the city of champions DeMarco was the city’s champion a glorified local boy best known for the night he brutalized Johnny Saxton at Boston Garden to win his title in 1955 and equally admired for the two nights that he and legendary Carmen Basilio beat one another from pillar to post DeMarco each time folding up in the 12th round.

Basilio’s first win at War Memorial Auditorium in Syracuse N.Y. came only 70 days after DeMarco’s title-clincher against Saxton. DeMarco never snatched the title back including in his rematch with Basilio the Upstate Onion Farmer before a jam-packed Boston Garden Nov. 30 1955.

“Hey [Basilio] stopped me” a matter-of-fact DeMarco said just a couple of years ago upon finally being inducted in the International Boxing Hall of Fame. “That’s it.”

DeMarco who lived in recent years in a West End apartment around the corner from where he defeated Saxton died Monday at age 89. His mass of Christian Burial will be held Tuesday morning at St. Leonard’s in the North End near the statue that stands in his honor close by the corner of Hanover and Fleet known as Tony DeMarco Way.

“Tony DeMarco is the greatest undisputed champion in the history of Boston” said Al Valenti whose grandfather Rip Valenti was DeMarco’s manager and promoter. “I think a lot of us fail to realize that players like [Larry] Bird and [Ted] Williams and [Tom] Brady — all of them great — didn’t grow up on Fleet Street in the North End. They’re not Bostonians. Tony was pure Boston.”

Mario DelMonaco now 90 was sitting in the Garden balcony the night that DeMarco fighting in his 52d pro bout beat Saxton the way a kitchen broom beats a scatter rug hanging from a clothesline.

“I saw all of Tony’s fights” said DelMonaco reached at his home in Roslindale recalling DeMarco’s championship night. “I remember I was so nervous . . . and finally he knocked him out!”

DelMonaco’s son Michael 62 recalled his dad telling him that North Enders routinely went to church the day before DeMarco’s bouts and prayed for the pride of Fleet Street.

“The whole North End was at church” said Michael.

On April 1 1955 a modest crowd of 8704 filed into the Garden for DeMarco’s bout with Saxton. It was one of the 28 bouts the 5-foot-5-inch 145-pound DeMarco would have on Causeway Street over his 14-year career. His final 10 bouts were all at the Garden — over a span of five years he fought on average every six months at the Garden.

DeMarco trained at the adjacent New Garden gym. He also fought at Braves Field Fenway Park the Boston Arena and Mechanics Hall. Not even John Kiley the well-known organist played as many joints.

The tape of the Saxton fight available on YouTube is a frightening reminder of how savage the sport was in the day. The two fought into the 14th round which ended at 2:20 on a technical knockout DeMarco punching Saxton senseless along the ropes with a flurry of lefts and rights. The Globe’s Jerry Nason wrote that DeMarco landed 17 consecutive shots to Saxton’s head.

Saxton “upright and senseless” according to Nason never hit the deck. Referee Mel Manning finally stepped in at least a half-dozen shots too late and declared the TKO.

As a triumphant DeMarco returned to his celebratory corner a rubber-legged Saxton meandered around in a stupor making ready to punch. Saxton age 78 died in 2008 diagnosed with pugilistic dementia.

DeMarco’s real name was Leonardo Liotta. Friends and family members called him Nardo. With a local priest’s help he forged documents and took the name of a North End friend enabling him to turn pro at age 16. Another local boy who became quite famous Leonard Nimoy lived just blocks from the Garden in the West End. Mr. Spock and Mr. DeMarco/Liotta were born less than 10 months apart.

The night DeMarco beat Saxton his sister Mary ran to a Garden pay phone to tell his parents the news. They were only a few blocks away on Fleet Street in the five-room apartment where 23-year-old Tony still lived.

“He won!” Mary shouted through the phone.

Their Nardo was the new world champ.

“God” said his mom “is with my son.”

North Enders streamed into the DeMarco’s Fleet Street apartment. In a follow-up call from the Garden around 12:30 a.m Tony listened to his mom implore him to get home.

“Nardo” she said “you’re keeping these people waiting.”

A dutiful DeMarco hot-footed it home embraced his well-wishers and by 1:30 a.m. he was sitting in a Friend Street eatery with Rip Valenti for a victory dinner.

“The greatest night Little Italy ever had” John Ahern wrote two days later in the Globe.

Al Valenti is spending the weekend writing DeMarco’s eulogy a daunting task one that will require the sort of focus and determination that the one-time world’s greatest fighter brought to the ring.

“His life” said Valenti “was an epic journey.”

That is likely due to the fact visitors were unable to gather on campus in person in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Families of sophomores who were unable to attend during their students’ first year on campus were particularly well represented.

“Drop-off last year was very quick and we weren’t really able to meet anyone” said Liz Kelley whose son Jack is a sophomore. “That made sense of course but I’m really excited to have the opportunity to come back this year and spend a little more time here with Jack.”

The Schornstein family from New Jersey felt the same way. “We miss him!” said Dr. Iris Schornstein about her son Benjamin a sophomore studying computer engineering. “We wanted to come and see how he’s doing how he’s settling in.” The family also planned to tour the engineering buildings where Benjamin takes classes.

Another parent of a sophomore the renowned journalist and broadcaster Soledad O’Brien delivered the weekend’s keynote address during Friday evening’s welcome festivities.

In her address O'Brien said that a variety of challenges since the COVID-19 pandemic’s onset have been “an opportunity to show that Brown students can grow and those students have. And they had to acquire more strength and compassion and humanity and generosity and yes wisdom.”

That growth not only among Brown students but in young people across the country manifested itself in fervent activism tackling the most critical challenges of our time O’Brien said. She pointed out that young people voted in record numbers in 2020. They spoke out against police brutality and racial injustice in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. And they’re leading the charge to demand action to combat climate change.

O’Brien urged students and all attendees to take the lessons of the pandemic with them as they move forward in their lives.

“I think we have learned over the past tumultuous 18 months that we have to work as a group not as a lone wolf in the world” she said. “This year is going to be a group effort and we’re going to need to work together to help keep each other safe. We actually are responsible for the other people around us. Despite the obstacles get up every day and keep pushing forward.

“Let’s make sure that the new ‘us’ is an even better ‘us’” she concluded.

Something for everyone

Families had the opportunity to take in a full slate of events over the weekend. Faculty shared insights on the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for which a Brown faculty member played a leading role. A panel of Brown experts discussed the risks of social media violence and social isolation among adolescents. Dean of the College Rashid Zia discussed how the Open Curriculum enables a rich individualized education in an atmosphere in which diverse ideas and perspectives are shared and exchanged.

In order to win their first World Series title in 32 years they needed a miraculously comeback that had only been done a handful of times in the history of the game.

I'm sure by now you know they did exactly that. Winning three straight elimination games to dispatch of the pesky Braves and advance to the World Series.

One year later and they might have to do it again.

Austin Riley homered and hit a walk-off RBI single in the bottom of the ninth and the Atlanta Braves rallied to win Game 1 of the 2021 National League Championship Series 3-2 at Truist Park on Saturday night.

""Well we threw up some hits. We just couldn't get the hit when we needed it"" said Dodgers' manager Dave Roberts after the loss. ""There's a situational at-bat in there that I'll take our guy anytime and we didn't come through. We had a couple other opportunities and CT [Chris Taylor] being a little aggressive and got hung up there late not giving Mookie a chance with two outs. It happens. It's baseball.""

Roberts was referring to Chris Taylor's baserunning blunder in the top of the ninth that ended the Dodgers chance of taking the lead and stealing Game 1.

Bellinger hit a pinch-hit single to center field but Taylor hesitated while trying to run first to third. He stopped halfway and then got caught in a rundown to end the inning.

""It was just a bad read"" said Taylor of the mistake. ""I saw it barely got over Albies' head and I thought I could get to third. I didn't realize Joc [Pederson] had it that quickly and I tried to stop. I should have kept going or if I could go back and do it over again I would have just stopped at second.""

A wild end to the top of the 9th! 😱 pic.twitter.com/24ZLeIsoLp — MLB (@MLB) October 17 2021

Instead of perhaps heading into the bottom of the ninth with a lead and Blake Treinen on to get the save the Dodgers went into the final frame in danger of a walk-off loss.



The damage began with a one-out single by Ozzie Albies.

The Dodgers Achilles' heel all season long has been their inability to hold baserunners. They allowed the second most stolen bases in baseball in the 2021 season and aggressive teams like the Atlanta Braves love to exploit their opponent's weaknesses.

Albies quickly stole second on the first pitch Treinen threw putting him in scoring position for Riley who had already hit a game-thing homer earlier in the game. On the next pitch Riley lined a slider down the left field line for a walk-off win that sent the crowd of 41815 into a frenzy.

""Once I got on I told him [first base coach Eric Young Sr.] that I'm going so I can be in scoring position for Riley"" said Albies. ""I'm pretty sure he's been hot. He's going to do the job. No doubt.""

""Absolutely I want to be in that moment"" said Riley. ""You dream of that as a little kid. It was huge. That was my first [walk-off] ever. I've come up in quite a few situations earlier in the season and wasn't able to get it done but to get it done tonight was awesome.""

The Braves were aggressive to begin the game as well.

Eddie Rosario led off the bottom of the first inning with a single to right field. He promptly stole second and advanced to third on a ground out. One pitch later he would score on a wild pitch by Dodgers' reliever Corey Knebel giving Atlanta a 1-0 lead.

The Dodgers were forced into a bullpen game because of what it took for them to even get to this point. They needed Walker Buehler to pitch on three days rest in Game 4 and it took everything from Max Scherzer to earn the save and close out the San Francisco Giants in Game 5 of the NLDS.

Julio Urias pitched the bulk in that game and with Clayton Kershaw out for the entirety of the postseason with an injured left elbow the Dodgers were without any reliable starting pitchers for Game 1.

The NLCS is a seven-game series and therefore a little more akin to the regular season. So Knebel started for the second straight game with a well-rested bullpen that included Justin Bruhl and Evan Phillips—on the roster for the first time this postseason—behind him.

On the opposite mound was Max Fried easily the best pitcher in the NL since the All-Star break. The lopsided pitching matchup favored the Braves making it fair to favor Atlanta in Game 1.

But Fried was not at his best. The southpaw who grew up in Santa Monica rooting for the Dodgers surrendered a hit in each of the first six innings of his start.

""I felt like I was fighting myself at times not executing two-strike pitches as well as I would have wanted"" said Fried of his start in Game 1. ""Defense just made some really nice plays again. Obviously Austin's big hit to get us back tied. The only thing I was trying to do was just to keep it tied right there and give us an opportunity.""

Fried was unable to protect the Braves slim lead because the Dodgers would respond in the top half of the second. A.J. Pollock hit a two-out double and Taylor followed with an RBI single that tied the game.

Fried wiggled out of jams throughout the night but he was unable to evade a blast off the bat of Will Smith in the top of the fourth inning. Smith provided the Dodgers with a 2-1 lead when he connected on an 0-2 fastball for his third home run of the postseason.

""That's a really good prepared team. They're probably one of the best prepared teams in the league they know exactly what I'm going to be bringing to the table and they had a really good game plan"" said Fried. ""They hit some balls hard and were looking for pitches in certain areas and that's what good teams do.""

Pitching on 16 days rest Tony Gonsolin who started two games of the 2020 World Series against the Tampa Bay Rays last season entered in relief in the fourth inning and surrendered a home run to Riley that tied the game at 2-2.

Fire the laser!



Austin powers one out! pic.twitter.com/23KdmEwWgd — MLB (@MLB) October 17 2021

""I was trying to be short to the ball. I felt here lately especially on fastballs I've been a little long fouling pitches off that I feel like I could do some damage with"" said Riley of that at-bat. ""He threw me two sliders the pitch before so I just always be on the fastball was able to put a good swing on it and hit it over the fence.""

Entering the bottom of the ninth the Dodgers emotional intensity had reached a fever pitch. For 19 consecutive innings the Dodgers were either deadlocked in a time game trailing by one or clinging to a brief one-run lead. Now that streak will carry over into Game 2 on Sunday.

""Runs are at a premium and they did a good job keeping us off-balance so move on tomorrow and try to get back after it"" said Dodgers' shortstop Trea Turner who had two of the team's 10 hits in Game 1. ""I think we out hit them they just out scored us which is part of the game. But when you have people on base good things happen just a matter of getting that one more hit and getting those hits with runners in scoring position.""

The Dodgers did out-hit the Braves 10-6 on Saturday night and would go on to leave seven runners on base and were a combined 1-for-8 with runners in scoring position.

Those numbers will have to change if the Dodgers want to even the series before heading back to Dodger Stadium."

Credit Suisse suffered losses of close to US$5.5 billion from the default of Archegos Capital Management. In the latest in a series of articles Bob Currie reports on the role played by a lack of effective risk technology and failure to learn lessons from past defaults

The market value of Archegos Capital Management’s investment holdings fell sharply during the week of 22 March 2021 driven by a slide in the price of a number of single-name tech stocks particularly ViacomCBS in which Archegos had a large and heavily leveraged position. This triggered a chain reaction that resulted ultimately in the hedge fund’s default.



A 170-page report by a Credit Suisse Group special committee makes detailed and critical observations about the engagements of the investment bank and specifically its prime services division with Archegos in the lead up to the fund’s closure.



The report analysed in a series of articles in Securities Finance Times presents the findings of a Credit Suisse Group Special Committee on behalf of its board of directors into the circumstances that led to the Archegos’s collapse and the large financial losses and reputational damage sustained by the investment bank (subsequently referred to as the ‘Special Committee report’).



This event resulted in combined losses of more than US$10 billion for the prime services divisions of global investment banks including Credit Suisse (CS) Morgan Stanley Nomura and UBS.



Learning lessons



Among the major conclusions to emerge from this report covered in the first part of this article published in SFT Issue 284 on 17 August 2021 the investigation found that CS had failed to learn from past risk situations.



For example in March 2020 CS sustained a US$214 million loss following the default of Malachite Capital Management another hedge fund which was a client of CS’ equity derivatives business. Like Archegos Malachite’s transactions were statically margined (for further discussion see SFT Issue 284). Both buy-side firms had losses substantially exceeding their potential exposure (PE) and stress scenario limits.



Although circumstances leading to the Malachite default in March 2020 differed in significant ways from those that precipitated Archegos’s collapse there were also commonalities (see box opposite). Some remedial action had been implemented after Malachite but other fundamental issues that CS had failed to tackle also re-emerged with Archegos.At the heart of this failure the Special Committee finds that “CS failed to address a culture that encouraged excessive risk-taking and injudicious cost cutting as well as a complex and siloed organisational structure that impeded the swift identification understanding and escalation of risk” (p 30).



This culture prevailed even though Malachite apparently generated relatively modest revenue — US$6.9 million over the term of the relationship — relative to the risk borne by CS (p 15). The Special Committee drew a similar conclusion with regard to the Archegos default 12 months later.



Following the investigation led by its Internal Audit team CS took steps to ensure that its equity derivatives division did not service other clients with profiles similar to Malachite. This process also triggered a programme known internally as Project Copper intended to improve the bank’s ability to identify early warning of a default event and to reinforce controls and escalation procedures with a primary focus on OTC derivatives transactions.



Among other changes Project Copper created a new committee the Investment Bank (IB) Counterparty Oversight Committee (CPOC) co-chaired by the IB chief risk officer and its chief operating officer along with senior IB executives including the global head of equities.



At the instruction of the CRM team (see box below) Archegos was one of a small number of counterparties that were discussed at the initial CPOC meeting held in September 2020. Significantly neither of the co-heads of the prime services division — the division within CS containing prime brokerage and prime financing sub-units which had the largest exposure to Archegos — were CPOC members and neither was asked to attend the meeting.



The committee report notes that in practice CPOC did not discuss Archegos again for a further six months not until 8 March 2021 and by this time the client’s risk exposure had surged dramatically (for a more detailed analysis see SFT 284).



In the meantime during the autumn of 2020 Archegos’s swap business was migrated from one UK-based CS entity Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd (CSSEL) to another Credit Suisse International (CSi) with the transfer completing in December 2020. This the report notes was partly an attempt to wind down CSSEL. However in so doing it also transferred the client’s activity to an entity (CSi) that had a “higher stress scenario appetite” — a tolerance for larger risk exposure to the hedge fund counterparty (p 17).



The CRM reportedly backed a case for an accommodative approach indicating that Archegos was a “significant relationship” for the prime services division and given that Archegos was also doing business with other prime brokers across the Street a sudden margin increase could potentially result in “irreversible damage to the client relationship” (ibid).



Mixed messages



Following an annual credit review of Archegos at the end of 2020 CRM took the decision to downgrade Archegos’s credit rating from BB- to B+ thereby placing the hedge fund in the bottom third of CS’ hedge fund counterparties by credit rating (p 18).



But even while downgrading Archegos’s credit rating CRM recommended raising Archegos’s potential exposure limit from US$20 million to US$50 million — advice that was a departure from the bank’s standard position that a B+ rated hedge fund should typically have maximum PE of no more than US$10 million.



In February 2021 the business began taking steps to move Archegos to dynamic margining. However internal calculations (provided by the software engineering team responsible for transitioning clients to dynamic margining platforms) estimated that under CS’s existing prime brokerage dynamic margining framework this would require the fund manager to post an additional US$3 billion in margin raising the total margin for its swaps portfolio to US$4 billion.



Fearing the impact this would have on the business relationship the head of Prime Services Risk (PSR) proposed applying a more forgiving dynamic margining framework for Archegos — one that would create an average margin of 16.3 per cent requiring the client to post an additional US$1.3 billion on implementation. A written proposal was sent to Archegos on 24 February but it was ignored by the hedge fund the report says despite repeated follow up from CS (p 20).



Archegos default



The value of Archegos’s concentrated positions dropped rapidly in the week of 22 March 2021 reversing the upwards momentum that these positions had experienced for several months leading up to its default. The price of its largest position ViacomCBS fell 6.7 per cent on 22 March and further in the days that followed. US$600 million in excess margin that the fund manager had with CS on 23 March was eliminated by these movements in the market and CS requested a further US$175 million in variation margin (VM) which Archegos paid (p 22).



With the valuation of another significant long position Tencent Music Entertainment Group falling 20 per cent on 24 March CS took a decision to issue a US$2.7 billion VM call the following day. Responding to this request Archegos’s COO told CS’ co-heads of prime services and its head of equities that evening that the buy-side firm did not have sufficient liquidity to meet margin calls the following day to CS or its other prime brokers.



In the course of 25 March CS’s legal department prepared Event of Default notifications setting into play CS’s contractual right to demand full return of all outstanding balances in case of a default including any failure to pay margin when it was required (p 125).



By the evening on the 25th March Archegos informed its prime brokers on a group call that although it had US$9 to $10 billion in equity it had US$120 billion in gross exposure (US$70 billion long US$50 billion short). It asked its prime brokers to enter into a standstill agreement whereby these PBs would not push Archegos into default while it took steps to wind down its positions. The hedge fund indicated that it was committed to making all PB and swap counterparties whole by liquidating assets to cover the shortfall owed to each dealer. However it said that it needed to liquidate assets carefully so as to “not tip the market”.



In the face of this request CS indicated that it remained firm in its commitment to issue a termination notice which it sent by email the same evening and by hand delivery on 26 March specifying 26 March as the termination date.



On the morning of 26 March CS was approached by Archegos and told that Goldman Sachs was executing block sales of some ADR positions and invited CS to be involved. CS subsequently participated in three Goldman Sachs-led block trades selling stock in Baidu Tencent and Vipshop Holdings (p 127).



Alongside this CS indicates it executed algorithmic trading on that day designed to stay within 2-3 per cent of average daily volume. It ultimately sold slightly more than US$3 billion notional on 26 March approximately US$1.25 billion being sold through Goldman Sachs block sales.



Archegos and its PBs held another call on 27 March including CS Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs Nomura UBS Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank. The fund manager again asked for a forbearance agreement.



Without Archegos in attendance these PBs discussed the potential for a managed liquidation where PBs would send positions for review to an independent counsel or other trusted third party and lenders would be offered a percentage range within which they would be allowed to liquidate their overlapping positions.



CS Nomura and UBS indicated their interest in moving ahead with this managed liquidation. Several other banks including Deutsche Bank Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to be involved (p 128).



The Special Committee report indicates that on 28 March CS stepped into a managed liquidation agreement with UBS and Nomura. Following this agreement CS liquidated approximately US$3 billion through block sales of overlapping positions on 5 April and US$2.2 billion on 14 April 2021. It liquidated other Archegos positions through open-market algo trading — and by 22 April 2021 it had liquidated 97 per cent of its Archegos exposure (p 128).



CS indicates in line with its public reporting that it lost US$5.5 billion as a direct outcome of the Archegos default and the subsequent unwind. Drawing on public information it indicates that Nomura lost close to US$2.5 billion Morgan Stanley approximately US$1 billion and UBS lost US$774 million.



Deutsche Bank Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo are reported to have suffered “immaterial losses” (p 129)



Plain sight



As reported in the preceding section of this article Credit Suisse’s internal investigation into the Archegos failure arrived at the following damning conclusion: “no one at CS — not the traders not the in-business risk managers not the senior business executives not the credit risk analysts and not the senior risk officers — appeared to fully appreciate the serious risks that Archegos’s portfolio posed to CS (p 129).



These risks it notes were not hidden. They were in plain sight from at least September 2020 when CPOC first met and CS senior leaders discussed Archegos’s concentrated long-biased volatile equity swap positions. “Yet no one at the bank acted swiftly and decisively to try to mitigate the risks posed by Archegos. And when CS finally took steps to mitigate the risks the actions it took were ineffective too little and too late”.



It concludes that the business should never have put on such large concentrated positions with Archegos particularly without securing adequate margin. It indicates that the prime services business was aware that Archegos’s portfolio was highly concentrated and also that its portfolio holdings with CS were severely undermargined (p 131).



For example at a CPOC meeting on 8 March 2021 a representative from the bank’s client risk management (CRM) team indicated that Archegos was an outlier in the prime financing swap book with gross market value (GMV) exposures of US$20 billion when compared to the next largest client of US$5 billion. CRM also noted that Archegos had a net-long bias at this time of more than US$7 billion compared to the next-largest long-biased client at US$1.5 billion (p 20).



The CPOC also flagged up Archegos’s single issuer concentration including a US$3.3 billion position which represented more than 8 per cent of the outstanding free float. At this meeting CPOC discussed potential difficulties in liquidating Archegos’s portfolio should this become necessary given the size and concentration of these positions.



Additionally the business missed multiple opportunities to “right-size” Archegos risk. Prime services saw its relationship with the fund manager as “significant” contributing revenue of US$16 million in 2020 and this was expected to rise to US$40 million in 2021 on the basis of appreciation in Archegos’s positions. The business was intent on growing its relationship with the hedge fund recognising that it was competing for this business with multiple other prime brokers (p 133). Consequently the business pushed for an “accommodative approach” to risk refusing to take forceful steps and remaining reluctant to have difficult conversations with and about Archegos.



Risk employees failed to appreciate Archegos’s true risk despite a series of red flags says the Special Committee report. (p 138) CRM learned from Archegos that other prime brokers were charging higher margins and were dynamically margining Archegos’s swaps portfolio. CRM also had access to non-public information confirming that Archegos had concentrated exposure to the same single-name positions with other prime brokers as it held with Credit Suisse (p 27).



“This information — that Archegos maintained similar positions across the Street that CS was the only PB using static margining and that CS’s margin rates were lower than those of other PBs — should have sounded alarm bells” says the report (p 138).” The CRM employees that were privy to this information did not appear to appreciate its importance and failed to escalate the information to more senior risk or business managers.



A similar myopia applies to Archegos’s limit breaches. Rather than viewing the breaches as symptomatic of a much larger problem CRM and the prime services business were focused on eliminating the breaches without considering the larger significance.



Consequently the CRM did not insist that the business take immediate steps to reduce Archegos’s exposure — by having Archegos sell down its concentrated positions and reduce its portfolio — and instead resorted to “superficial fixes” such as raising Archegos’s PE limit from US$20 million to US$50 million and raising Archegos’s scenario limit from US$250 million to US$500 million (p 139).



Technology and data failures



The Special Committee finds that the prime services business did not prioritise investment in technology that would have assisted in managing risk more effectively. The PSR had identified a relatively inexpensive fix for bullet swaps that subject to the client’s consent would have automatically recalculated IM based on the current mark-to-market value of the portfolio. This fix would have cost approximately US$150000 — a relatively small investment given the size of Credit Suisse’s subsequent losses against its Archegos exposure — but the business did not prioritise or fund this (p 146).



It was also slow to adopt automated technology that would have enabled it to dynamically margin swaps. Despite the systems limitation the Special Committee says that dynamic margining could have been agreed with Archegos at any time and implemented manually — even though this would have been cumbersome and time consuming for CS to operate.



CS already had an automated means to margin swaps dynamically (through cross-margining with prime brokerage) when these were conducted in the same legal entity. However the systems for dynamically margining were inadequate within CS for clients such as Archegos whose swaps and PB accounts were held with different legal entities (see SFT Issue 284 for further discussion).



Notwithstanding by September 2020 CS had developed the capacity to dynamically margin swaps regardless of whether the client had a PB account or in which legal entity this account was held. However the Special Committee finds that Archegos was not on the list of clients that the business had prioritised for transition to dynamic margining despite the increasing risks presented by this client (p 147).



More generally the report finds that risk divisions had struggled with “fragmented ineffective technology” during the year leading up to the Archegos default along with data quality issues that impaired its ability to assess counterparty and portfolio credit risk in a timely manner. “These issues were well known but not sufficiently addressed before the Archegos default” says the report.



For example the systems employed by the CRM team only displayed a counterparty’s aggregate portfolio and not individual position data. This impeded CRM’s ability to see full details of the risks presented by a client. Further CRM only received verified data for scenario limit breaches on a monthly basis — although it could access “rough” scenario data twice per week. “This posed ‘undue risks’ given that Prime Services had a number of hedge fund clients with volatile positions that could change significantly intra-monthly” concludes the report (p 147-8).





In managing its relationships with buy-side clients CS indicates that it operates multiple lines of risk defence. The business unit in this case the prime services division provides the first layer of defence with each business employee directly responsible for protecting the bank against losses. Prime services maintains an in-house risk management unit named Prime Services Risk (PSR) that among other duties sets margin rates and manages other risk controls in dialogue with traders and clients.A bank-level risk division Credit Risk Management (CRM) provides a second line of defence responsible for evaluating credit risk across all of the investment bank’s business lines while acting independently of any individual business unit. This includes conducting annual counterparty risk reviews assigning an internal credit rating to the counterparty and setting counterparty trading limits for the prime services division and other business units."

“Wittenberger Bus is a great family owned company very similar to GO Riteway” he said. “Right now the Bast family is talking to company owner Fred Wittenberger.”

Hartford City Administrator Steve Volkert said a deal between the transportation organizations makes sense. “Having a locally owned and operated bus company is very advantageous to the service you’re going to received” said Volkert. “Hartford is glad it will still have a service and we wish the Wittenbergers the best moving forward.”

On a history note: Wittenberger Bus Service has been in the family three generations.

According to the company’s website the business was started by Calvin J. Wittenberger in the mid 1940’s. It was picked up by Calvin’s son Gene Wittenberger and later by Gene’s son Fred. Wittenberger Bus contracts with the Hartford School District and provides special education busing and extra curricular event busing.

According to the company’s website “Wittenberger Bus Service has been serving the Hartford area for over 60 years. Our longevity and success comes from developing a partnership with the schools we serve providing assistance and helping them make the difficult decisions that face the educational system today. We accomplish this by providing a trained responsive staff and well maintained equipment. We strive each day to provide quality service emphasizing safety efficiency and cooperation.”

GO Riteway’s origin also began three generations ago with Riteway Bus Service Inc. in 1957. According to the GO Riteway website “Over the next 60 years it continued to expand and provide the best most dependable and safest transportation for business travelers tourists students and local residents.

“Our fleet consists of school buses motor coaches shuttle coaches limo coaches executive sedans and vans. While we are based in Wisconsin we also own Cardinal Buses in Indiana and will go anywhere in the United States.”

Hamilton said a final notice on the transaction with Wittenberger Bus will be released shortly.

Wittenberger Bus Service had an inhouse meeting with staff Tuesday morning. Calls have been placed to owner Fred Wittenberger and more information will be posted when details become available.

With the anticipation of Hasbro possibly creating their own Rangers many fans are eager to know what they might do. With many other possible combinations there is a lot of potential concepts that could start the next generation.

With the deal between Toei and Hasbro being over the likelihood of seeing Power Ranger exclusives increases with adaptions for three unused Sentai currently ruled out. There have been originals such as The Omega Rangers and HyperForce but never a full live-action team.

Considering the brands and experience that Hasbro has the company could ultimately make its own concepts that could go beyond imagination. Here are some of the best themes that Hasbro could work with for a new team of Rangers.

1. Vehicle Theme

This is automatically going to be the one theme that Hasbro could excel at. With the amount of experience from working with Transformers they could create an epic gimmick for the toy line of a brand new Ranger series. This would also fill the hole for the desire to see Kirameiger adapted as the series was the latest vehicle Sentai that featured the use of gems in the design.

This is also a great time for the theme as the Transformers franchise is starting to dive more into the Beast Wars spin-off for both TV shows and movies meaning that both shows wouldn’t be competing against each other. Other variations of this category could include engines and even machines.

2. Space Theme

As Kyuranger would be difficult to Adapt with the amount of Rangers another Ranger team could be forged so that the fans could get this type of series. With the success of Power Rangers in Space it wouldn’t be a surprise if fans got excited for another series in this genre.

RELATED: CHOUJIN SENTAI JETMAN’S ENDING HAD SOME MASSIVE PROBLEMS

Even movies like Guardians of the Galaxy have shown the popularity of the concept. Plus there are a lot of different ways a Ranger team could be made within this Theme including various galactic vehicles or even xeno-type zords.

3. Magic Theme

The only time that Magic has truly been a part of Power Rangers was during the series Mystic Force and Ninja Steel. Due to the different types of magic seen in fiction there are many ways to make a Ranger series in this category. This theme could also be combined with many different concepts but it would be unexpected if Hasbro used it as a basis.

It’s possible that Dungeons and Dragons could be used as inspiration if the Theme was used plus there was excitement when people originally thought Ryusoulger would be a dragon-based series.

4. Sci-fi Theme

Much like the genre this could include a range of specific concepts within the science fiction category. From advanced technologies to Interdimensional travel a Ranger team based on these concepts could produce so much exciting content for fans to enjoy. Even though this category would naturally be paired with space it could still apply to Earthbound Rangers with its use having unlimited potential.

5. All-new Supernatural Power Rangers Theme

This is one theme that Power Rangers has yet to tackle fully. This includes folklore monsters and even superpowers relate to this category. Considering the popularity of Stranger Things it would great basis for a new type of Power Rangers. The same could be said for monsters as even the Henshin! Table-top RPG has a template for a horror-influenced Ranger team.

6. Reuse of Dinosaur Theme

Since Dinosaurs are heavily linked to Power Rangers it would make sense if this type of concept is used again. However it’s unlikely that the Theme will follow so soon after Power Rangers Dino Fury.

The day Hasbro creates their own dino Ranger Team will likely start a new era. As a result they may go all-out on the concept to make it the new mascot of the franchise to take over from the Mighty Morphin series.

All these different themes could allow Hasbro the chance to produce new sets of Rangers Zords and items in their arsenal. With the aim to ultimately produce amazing toys and merchandise for fans to collect and enjoy. Whichever theme they choose for their first creation it will certainly be one of the biggest events in Power Rangers history if Hasbro decided to take this path.

What do you think would be a great Powers Rangers theme? Do you want to see Hasbro create Original Ranger shows? Is there a specific concept you’d want in the show? Let us know on social media or in the comments below and keep following The Illuminerdi for more Power Rangers content.

Let’s give a big thanks to Joe for making sure to get photos of all the cool stuff he got to check out while wandering around the Fall Meet at Hershey. I so want to come to this event and might just need to make it happen in 2022.

Here’s our second gallery of photos from the show and if you missed any don’t worry there is a link below to see them all!

(Words and Photos by Joe Grippo) Sing it with me…” It’s the most wonderful time of the year…” no not Christmas it’s time for the AACA Hershey Eastern Region Fall Meet. The Hershey AACA meet is an absolutely massive antique automobile parts and accompanying accoutrement swap meet and car show. How massive? It is held in the parking lot of the Hershey Amusement Park and the adjacent Giant Center arena; it has been said that if you walk every aisle you would cover nearly 30 miles! The Antique Automobile Club of America has hosted the event since 1955 it consists of over 9000 flea market spaces over 1000 car corral spaces and hundreds of show cars. We regularly attend for multiple days to try and take it all in we are usually unsuccessful. Each year the show attracts visitors from all over the United States and many countries throughout the world. It is a must-do for car folk of all descriptions. Not too many places you see Jay Leno haggling with some old grizzled swap vendor over some odd-ball valve for a long-forgotten White Steam Car.

Automotive parts are one thing but if you are looking for some garage art Hershey is the spot. Vintage signs and advertising ancient tools and equipment and inconceivably rare memorabilia are there for the purchasing but a word to the wise…pack heavy prices are way up. The Fall Meet car corral runs around the perimeter of the swap meet area and is worth the trip by itself. You will see glorious chromed machines from the 50’s and 60’s door handle to door handle with 60’s muscle and 70’s era malaise land yachts. Add in brass era oddities trucks of all flavors unique imports a variety of motorcycles and the always staggering array of survivors and recently unearthed barn finds and your head will be swimming in all the motorized goodness.

We ended each day with an evening visit to the RM Sotheby’s auction held at off-grounds at Hershey Lodge. As if the swap meet didn’t blow your mind all day the docket of cars and trucks on display for all the looky-loos like me to drool over will finish the job. Duesenberg’s Auburns and Cadillacs and the like from the Great Gatsby era are offered up for the more well-heeled enthusiasts and collectors.

If you have never been to the AACA Hershey Fall Meet and you have even a remote interest in old cars you need to. Seriously.

Get your BangShiftin’ butt to Hershey Pa next year during the first full week of October 2022.

Pro tip: wear comfortable shoes and bring loads of cash.

Image Credit: Panagiotis Kyriakos/iStock/GettyImages

Especially around treat-laden holidays like Halloween or Valentine's Day it can be difficult to navigate the candy aisles when you're on a gluten-free diet.

Following a gluten-free plan involves avoiding wheat rye and barley (and these grain's derivatives). But you don't have to keep your sweet tooth totally reigned in around the holidays — there are plenty of candy and chocolate brands that are free of gluten ingredients.

Is Candy Gluten-Free?

There's no one way to make candy — a stroll through the candy aisle says it all as there are seemingly endless brands and varieties. For sugar fans this is fabulous news but for those following a gluten-free diet this makes shopping challenging.

For the most part chocolate is made of cocoa bean liquor cocoa butter sugar lecithin (a soy-based ingredient) and vanilla according to the National Confectioners Association. Gluten isn't a primary ingredient but different chocolates can have different add-ins — like pretzels or graham crackers — which may not necessarily be safe on a GF diet.

Candy is often made with a mix of different ingredients including corn syrup artificial flavors hydrogenated oils and food coloring among others according to New York-Presbyterian.

While the most basic candy ingredients don't contain gluten that doesn't mean any candy you buy will be safe to eat. It's important to look for gluten-free varieties and brands (more on that below).

How to Find Gluten-Free Candy

Even if the candy you're buying doesn't contain gluten ingredients there may still be a risk for cross-contamination which occurs when gluten foods come in contact with other ingredients either through manufacturing or preparation according to the Celiac Disease Foundation.

Advertisement

You can avoid cross-contact by choosing your brand carefully. To play it safe avoid candy unless you can be certain it's gluten-free.

First look for a ""Gluten-Free"" label on the front package of the product. This label is regulated by the Food & Drug Administration and signifies that the food you're eating has less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten which is generally safe for people with celiac disease to eat.

If you want even more security buy candy that is labeled ""Certified Gluten-Free"" and assessed by qualified third parties such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). The GFCO has especially strict standards certifying foods that have only 10 ppm of gluten or less according to the organization's website.

If a product doesn't have a gluten-free label read the ingredient list of any package you decide to buy and look out for any gluten-based ingredients and check the allergen listing for wheat or gluten.

In a sterile triage room in Boston a nurse offered Yannira Castillo condolences on losing her baby. Castillo looked at her husband and her mother with panicked eyes as she felt her composure disintegrate.

Soon a doctor appeared at the side of her hospital gurney and made a promise. He took her hand in his and Castillo remembers him saying: “‘You’re going to be okay. Your baby is going to be okay.’”

Castillo was nearly 24 weeks pregnant still in her second trimester. The fetus was teetering on the edge of viability and her body was inexplicably delivering it. The contractions were coming with a force and fury that frightened her. She prayed as hard as she knew how.

Caught between the nurse’s condolences and the doctor’s assurances Castillo had no idea why she had gone into labor or what to do about it. Neither did the medical profession.

“Every time I’m asked by a patient ‘why did this happen?’ My answer is typically ‘we don’t know.’ And I’m tired of having to answer ‘we don’t know’” said George Saade the chief of obstetrics at the University of Texas Medical Branch and the former president of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine the professional organization for obstetricians who specialize in high-risk pregnancies.

One in 10 babies is born preterm; that is more than three weeks before the baby’s due date. And despite the anguish hundreds of thousands of families go through each year — and the billions of dollars it takes to care for the children — little is known about what causes premature births or how to prevent them.

The best care that medicine has to offer women like Castillo relies on techniques that are sometimes more than a century old. The result is that many preterm births are unexpected and unexplained. At a time when medicine is creating technologies to edit human genes and developing highly effective COVID vaccines in under a year the lack of investment in maternal care has doctors in the field sounding the alarm.

The cost of knowing so little is enormous. Medical bills for people who are born preterm total $17 billion each year and much of that cost is borne by Medicaid the taxpayer-funded program that covers nearly half of all births in the United States. Once economists add the medical care of the mother the price tag of special education that some preterm children require and lost wages and productivity for the preemies who have disabilities lasting into adulthood the annual cost swells to $25 billion. But the economists behind that figure say it’s an underestimate; the real number could be twice as much or more.

""We are worse than any other field of medicine and yet we're left alone to flounder."" George Saade

Saade says it doesn’t have to be this way. He blames the staggering cost on a severe lack of research and investment in prematurity estimating that maternal care is a century behind the rest of medicine. He is one of a growing number of obstetricians and medical experts who say the field is neglected by society — and failing patients as a result.

“We have an urgent crisis” said Rahul Gupta when he was the chief medical and health officer at the March of Dimes the leading nonprofit focused on maternal and infant health. “It’s almost a perfect storm what’s happening and it’s literally ignored.”

“There is no doubt that premature birth is the most important problem facing obstetrics today” said Roberto Romero who runs the National Institutes of Health or NIH’s research branch that studies pregnancy. “The consequences of premature birth can last a lifetime.”

“We are worse than any other field of medicine and yet we’re left alone to flounder” Saade said.

A GBH News analysis found that more drug trials went toward treating erectile dysfunction than preterm birth in women. The disparity was more striking when narrowed to industry-funded trials. Data: GBH News analysis of clinicaltrials.gov; data visualization by Hannah Reale

A GBH News analysis found that clinical trials aimed at preventing preterm births lag far behind trials aimed at other conditions. In the United States since 2000 there have been more drug trials for erectile dysfunction than for prematurity in pregnant women. There are 15 times the number of clinical trials about breast cancer than about preterm birth in women. Finally our analysis found there are more than double the number of clinical trials about infertility — helping women get pregnant — than about preterm birth — helping women stay pregnant.

Experts at the forefront of calling for change have pinpointed the barriers that keep obstetrics a century behind. They say progress in preventing preterm births is possible but it will take a diverse cast of characters — from lawmakers to drug companies and social activists — to make it happen.

‘The Last Frontier’

Castillo spent a decade fearing a preterm delivery. Two of her older children had been born early: They never made it to their 40-week due dates or even the 37-week finish line that would designate them ‘full term.’ Instead they were born at 32 weeks and 29 weeks each spending time in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit or NICU before coming home. While Castillo wanted another child she worried she would have another preterm baby — another so-called “preemie.”

Castillo and her husband eventually pushed their anxiety aside and got pregnant again. Castillo remembers telling her doctor: “Whatever you have to do to keep this baby in just do it.”

Every Friday she got injections of synthetic progesterone.

She got a cerclage a surgery to stitch her birth canal closed.

When she felt pain in her lower back Castillo said her doctor gave her an order: “‘You have to stop working and you need to do bedrest.’” She stayed in bed and frantically Googled to find something that might help.

But at just 23 weeks into her pregnancy the pain morphed into contractions. At the hospital she was given magnesium sulfate to stop labor. But she says it didn’t work. Months shy of a full-term pregnancy and despite the medical interventions Castillo’s son — Matteo — was born a few minutes after midnight at exactly 24 weeks of gestation. Matteo’s due date had been at the end of June. He arrived on an overcast day in mid-March.

It was clear from Matteo’s first cries that the nurse’s condolences had been a mistake. But pediatricians say it can take years to know whether preemies born at that stage will “be okay” as Castillo’s doctor had promised.

When he was born Matteo weighed just one pound nine ounces. His hand couldn’t close around his mom’s pinky. “My pinky was so big and his hand was just so so tiny. So skinny. My god …” Castillo remembered her voice trailing off.

Babies born as early as Matteo cannot breathe on their own. They cannot eat on their own. They cannot regulate their own body temperature. Their brains are still largely smooth having not yet developed all the natural grooves and folds. Their skin is translucent. Their eyes are fused shut.

Castillo quit her job.

She spent 116 long days with Matteo in the NICU. Holding him on her chest for long stretches Castillo tried to create a sense of calm amid the hospital hubbub. She says she kept wondering how medicine was able to keep this fragile baby alive but it couldn’t keep him from being delivered early.

To this day Castillo said “they never knew what was going on with me.”

As with most spontaneous preterm deliveries doctors have guesses: Maybe it was an infection. Could her progesterone levels have been too low? Perhaps it was a condition inelegantly called an “incompetent cervix.” Or it could have been a half-dozen other things.

Clinicians are often unable to determine the culprit. And so they try all the interventions available even if they’re outdated and it’s unclear if they work.

That’s what happened to Castillo.

“We keep reusing the same ideas. There has not been innovation. There have been really no new therapeutics” said Michal Elovitz a professor and high-risk obstetrician at the University of Pennsylvania adding that the interventions that do exist often fail to prevent or treat preterm labor. “It’s egregious.”

""They never knew what was going on with me."" Yannira Castillo

Progesterone occurs naturally in the body and is known to keep the uterus quiet to keep it from contracting. For 50 years clinicians have given women additional progesterone in the hopes of fending off a miscarriage or preterm birth. But there’s a vigorous debate in the medical community about whether the injections of synthetic progesterone that Castillo received actually work. The Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research suggested withdrawing the drug from the market while The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends it as “the only treatment currently available.”

The first cerclage to sew shut the cervix was performed in the 1950s but — even today — it’s hard to figure out who the procedure helps and who it doesn’t.

Bedrest has been around for hundreds of years but there’s “absolutely no evidence for bedrest” said Elovitz. It’s on par with the recommendation Castillo found while desperately Googling: sleep with your legs elevated.

And the magnesium sulfate that Castillo received when she was already in labor? It has been used to try and stop contractions for a century but “it’s not been shown to prevent preterm birth more than 48 hours” Elovitz said. That short window is hopefully just long enough to give the fetus steroids which can improve a preemie’s outcomes including helping their underdeveloped lungs mature more quickly.

“Every few weeks you get a publication that revolutionizes the way we treat some condition in other fields of medicine. We don’t see that in pregnancy” said Saade. “Women’s health is the last frontier.”

A Stubborn Problem and Its Consequences

While there haven’t been advances in preventing preterm births there has been extraordinary progress in caring for preemies when they do arrive early.

“We’ve seen this pretty dramatic reduction in the risk that a preterm baby is going to die” said Paul Wise co-director of Stanford’s Prematurity Research Center. “However the risk that a baby is going to be born prematurely in the first place has been stubborn. It hasn’t gone down.”

Many people trace the improvements in preemie care back to late fall 1963.

That’s when the world held its breath for 39 hours after First Lady Jackie Kennedy gave birth to a son five and a half weeks early. He was airlifted from Cape Cod to Boston and doctors desperately tried to save him but they failed. Patrick Bouvier Kennedy’s short life had a big impact. There was suddenly an investment in preemie research an infusion of resources a sense of urgency. Soon NICUs were proliferating. And it wasn’t long before a medical specialty was created to care for preemies and other newborns.

Fast forward a half century to 2017. Kristi Magida was just 23 weeks pregnant — 17 weeks before her due date — when her water broke. She knew it was serious when the nurse at her obstetrician’s office told her to call her husband. Magida rushed by ambulance to a hospital in Boston where their daughter Becca was born. Weighing one pound seven ounces Becca was whisked off to the NICU. The smallest preemie diapers the hospital had were about the size of a credit card yet they were far too big. After nearly eight months in the hospital Becca made it home.

“Pretty much the whole world stopped for the first year” Magida said. “I don’t remember thinking about anything except how to keep that kid alive.”

In the NICU Becca was covered with wires and machines surrounded by a chorus of beeps and buzzes. The list of possible complications is long and the earlier the infant is born the longer the list. Preemies are more likely to experience bleeding in the brain scarring in the lungs holes in the heart infections in the intestines vision loss and hearing loss among other challenges. And as the infants grow into children they are more likely to have autism attention deficit disorder intellectual disabilities and learning disabilities.

The NICU team helped Becca through multiple bouts of pneumonia. Doctors fixed a vessel in her heart. Becca got a tracheotomy to help her breathe and a feeding tube to help her eat.

At age four Becca is now in preschool. She loves outer space and cooking. She’s learning to read and write. But her path is still bumpy. While her tracheotomy and feed tubes were removed about a year ago she has partial paralysis of her vocal cords and her speech is severely delayed.

“She was nearly three before she said the word ‘mommy’” said Magida. “That’s a big reminder that she’s been through a lot.”

While NICU care can be remarkably effective it can also be remarkably expensive. Economists say the newfound ability to save ‘extremely premature’ babies — or those born before 28 weeks of gestation — contributes substantially to the cost of prematurity to society. In just the first few months medical bills for the earliest preemies are regularly hundreds of thousands of dollars sometimes over a million.

But the consequences are more than just a dollar figure.

“The unfortunate reality is that even babies that end up in the NICU and receive that excellent treatment can still end up having lifelong health challenges” said Stacey Stewart current president and CEO of the March of Dimes. Eighty percent of babies born at Becca’s gestation have at least one severe disability in adulthood including intellectual disabilities and autism.

And it’s not just the preemie. It’s the mother’s health too. After a preterm birth women are at higher risk for their own medical issues later in life. For example Elovitz said a woman who had preterm preeclampsia or high blood pressure — which can trigger an early delivery — is at the same risk of cardiovascular disease as an active smoker. And Elovitz added “that risk never goes away.”

Prematurity is “one of the most impactful conditions that we know of” said Saade.

That impact is not evenly distributed. There are nearly 400000 premature babies born in the United States every year. Within that group there are “significant persistent and very troubling” disparities according to Richard Behrman and Adrienne Stith Butler who wrote a report on prematurity for what was then the Institute of Medicine. The chance of an African American baby being born prematurely is almost 50% higher than the chance for a white baby and that number climbs even higher for extremely premature infants.

While researchers have worked to tabulate the medical toll and the economic cost — and who bears the brunt of those burdens — the emotional consequences of prematurity are sometimes left undiscussed. “It’s traumatic” said Elovitz. “Preterm birth is one of the most untenable burdens that women have to deal with.”

Allie Hershey knows firsthand. After undergoing fertility treatment in order to conceive Hershey and her husband were elated to discover they’d more than succeeded: they were pregnant with twins.

But one Saturday morning midway through her pregnancy Hershey was driving home from a haircut when she knew something was wrong. She rushed to their home and soon she was on the bathroom floor delivering the twins.

“They were alive and breathing and crying” Hershey remembered. “And in that moment you think ‘Well maybe maybe this won’t be horrific.’”

But she was only 21 weeks along just past the halfway mark of her pregnancy and just shy of the viability threshold. The twins lived only a few hours. Hershey and her husband received their death certificates along with their birth certificates.

A little over a year later the Hersheys had a little boy named Emmett. He was also born early but he was further along at 32 weeks. After nearly two months in the NICU Emmett came home. Now each night when the Hersheys tuck him into bed they tell him the twins — Caleb and Gabriel — are keeping him safe.

Hershey says she never knows exactly when she’ll be flooded with emotions about the twins. It’s taken years to slowly release the feelings of guilt: What if I’d called my doctor earlier? And the unanswered questions still nag her: Why me? What caused this?

She’s far from the only parent facing the fallout of preterm birth. Prematurity is a leading cause of infant mortality in the United States: of the roughly 20000 children who die each year before their first birthday two in three are born preterm.

“That’s a lot of dead infants. A lot of infants who miss the opportunity to grow up and contribute to society” said Scott Grosse a health economist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Experts say the medical financial and emotional consequences all point to one answer: invest in prevention. But that has not happened. A GBH News analysis found in the past 20 years in the United States that for every four clinical trials that focus on helping preemies once they are born there is just one clinical trial focused on preterm birth in the mother. “Neonatal studies” or studies on newborns “are much simpler easier and less costly” said Saade.

The lack of research about pregnancy and preterm labor means many of the basics remain unknown. How does labor even start whether preterm or at term? How it is that the cervix can disappear during delivery and then reappear in minutes? How exactly does the placenta function? Obstetricians have guesses but not answers. And while researchers have identified a long list of risk factors — from wildfire smoke exposure to maternal age to a previous early delivery — they do not know how these risk factors work together to actually trigger early labor.

“This is far more complex than anything else we do in medicine” said Romero of the NIH.

Unlike the rest of medicine in pregnancy there are two patients instead of one: the mother and the fetus. And they can have incompatible needs. Unlike many other diseases which can develop over years or decades the window in pregnancy to identify who is at risk and address it is short. “Everything is compressed into a few weeks” Romero said.

Further a whole host of things can cause prematurity whereas many other medical conditions can be traced to a clearer root cause. And while much of medicine can turn to lab animals for hints that doesn’t work well in prematurity research. “Rats mice guinea pigs sheep even non-human primates…these models don’t have preterm births” said Saade.

Stewart of the March of Dimes said our lack of knowledge is costly: “If we’re not going to invest on the front end we have to expect that we’re going to pay dearly on the back end and that’s what we’re doing.”

Three Hurdles

When obstetricians lament the shortcomings of their field and the poverty of options for addressing prematurity their focus turns to three major hurdles that stand in the way of more research: insufficient funding fear of studying pregnant people and drug companies that are hesitant to invest.

The first challenge is that there is not enough research funding on pregnancy care and preventing prematurity. “This is not a priority for the NIH or other institutes who can actually move the needle forward” said Elovitz.

The National Institutes of Health is the largest funder worldwide of basic and clinical biomedical research. Nestled under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services the NIH has an institute dedicated to the eye to aging to cancer to dental issues to alcoholism to drug abuse to neurological disorders and strokes — and 14 others. Yet Elovitz pointed out there is no institute specifically dedicated to researching women’s health.

Research on reproduction falls under the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development or NICHD. The result Elovitz said is the study of maternal health and pregnancy competes against a litany of childhood issues for limited funding.

In a statement a NICHD spokesperson said issues of maternal and pregnancy health are prioritized and that they “work within the budget allocated by Congress.” In 2020 the NIH spent roughly 1.3% of its budget — or $550 million — on pregnancy research and about 1.1% of its budget — or $444 million — on preterm birth low birth weight and newborn health research. In contrast the NIH spends about 7% of its budget — or $3 billion — on HIV/AIDS research which has around 35000 new infections in the United States each year compared to nearly 400000 preterm births. The NIH does have an Office of Research on Women’s Health but unlike an NIH institute it does not do or fund research. Instead it is tasked with advocating for and facilitating research.

The second factor at play is “a literally unhealthy reluctance to include pregnant women in clinical trials” according to Alan Guttmacher a former NICHD director. There is a long history of viewing medical research on pregnant women as too risky too potentially harmful.

A small number of tragedies contributed to this hesitation — like when in the 1950s and early ’60s thalidomide was prescribed for morning sickness but caused birth defects. The federal government cemented this mindset when it categorized pregnant women as a ‘vulnerable’ group in need of added protections in clinical research said Anne Drapkin Lyerly an obstetrician and bioethicist at the University of North Carolina. Pregnant women were categorized as vulnerable alongside children prisoners and people with intellectual disabilities despite being able to give their own consent. That designation was removed in 2017 though the change didn’t go into effect for more than a year but Lyerly says it scared off researchers: studying pregnant women came to be seen as not only complicated but “ethically suspect.”

Efforts to protect pregnant women from medical research — rather than through medical research — ultimately means there is limited scientific evidence to guide their care. Despite recent efforts to address the knowledge gap the reality is still that many drugs used during pregnancy have never been properly studied in pregnant people. That leaves doctors grappling with an array of questions without good answers: Does this drug work? Is it safe? Does it cross the placenta to the fetus? How do you know the right dose when a woman's kidneys which can filter out drugs are working overtime during pregnancy?

Such questions matter more when pregnancy becomes highly medicalized as it often does for those at risk of preterm birth. But the lack of scientific evidence affects almost all pregnant people. Half of pregnant women take at least one prescription drug at some point during their pregnancy and when over-the-counter drugs are included that figure shoots up to over 90%. At the same time 98% of all drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration since 2000 do not have sufficient data to know whether or not they pose a risk to a fetus.

“In pregnancy there is a profound dearth of evidence to guide care” said Lyerly. “The impact has been a mix of medical harm and uncertainty.”

The third big hurdle experts say is that what knowledge we do have isn’t being turned into new therapeutics. It is typically the private sector — particularly drug companies — that take on this complex and costly task. Without this final piece Saade said any other research is “almost wasted.”

The primary deterrent for industry? “It’s largely the fear of a lawsuit” said Bob Ward a retired neonatologist and professor emeritus at the University of Utah who has consulted for drug companies. He says pharmaceutical companies have been burned by trials in which a persuasive lawyer and a sympathetic jury blame an unrelated malformation like a cleft lip on a medication used in pregnancy. In the end the drug company pays millions.

Ward said from their perspective it’s just not worth getting involved in prematurity compared to other more lucrative and less risky areas of medicine. Returning to an earlier example GBH News found that over the past two decades there have been more drug trials nationally to address erectile dysfunction than to address preterm birth in women — and yet erectile dysfunction has attracted four times more industry-funded drug trials.

Numerous drug companies including Johnson & Johnson Eli Lilly and Novartis declined interviews. However representatives from Ferring Pharmaceuticals wrote an article in 2021 acknowledging that the pipeline for new therapeutics in obstetrics “looks bleak.” They point to the other hurdles — “scientific and ethical complexities” as well as liabilities — to explain why “obstetrics is seriously left behind.”

‘Willing to Think Big’

Experts say that in order to solve a problem like prematurity research will need to go from neglected to prioritized. But they say it’s possible. Researchers look to two models from elsewhere in medicine — cancer and pediatrics — for how funding has been allocated research has been facilitated and drug companies have been incentivized.

“We’ve had so far two cancer moonshots right — two! Nixon and Obama. Have we had a pregnancy moonshot? No” said Saade.

The data agrees with Saade. In 2020 the NIH put more than $7 billion dollars — 16% of its budget — toward cancer research and nonprofits spent billions more. As the GBH News analysis found in the last two decades in the United States there have been 15 times more clinical trials about breast cancer than about prematurity in women. Even after adding in all the trials on prematurity that focus on the children breast cancer still has almost three times as many clinical trials. But in the United States the conditions exact a similar toll on society. Researchers quantify the burden a disease takes by measuring the number of years lost to disease disability and early death and when considered alongside a whole slew of other conditions breast cancer and prematurity end up being close neighbors. Yet breast cancer and cancer more generally receives far more attention and resources.

But it hasn’t always been that way.

“People wouldn’t even use the word cancer. If they mentioned it they whispered: ‘The big C’” said Claire Pomeroy president of the Lasker Foundation a nonprofit aimed at encouraging medical research.

Throughout the first half of the 1900s cancer was seen as incurable and shameful but it started to come out of the shadows in the 1950s ’60s and ’70s. This was no accident; it was a conscious and concerted effort. A driving force behind this change was a woman named Mary Lasker.

“She was relentless” said Pomeroy. “She understood that this was a big problem and the solutions needed to be big but Mary was willing to think big.”

Mary Lasker fought her battle on two fronts. First she set out to get the public on board. She did things like make sure the word ‘cancer’ could be said on the radio — which hadn’t been allowed — and convince the Ask Ann Landers advice column to write about the need for cancer research. Next she turned her eye to government funding for research. She spent decades lobbying politicians with the rallying cry: If you think research is expensive try disease. She won a Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Congressional Gold Medal for her activism but perhaps the best reward was President Nixon signing the National Cancer Act of 1971.

Mary Lasker placed a full-page ad in the Washington Post in 1969 to push for increased funding toward cancer research.

Speaking at the signing ceremony Nixon said: “Everything that can be done by government everything that can be done by voluntary agencies in this great powerful rich country now will be done.”

With an injection of research funding and far more public awareness cancer prevention detection and treatment has been transformed. For example widespread pap smears and mammograms have meant cervical cancer has seen a 71% drop in mortality since 1969 and breast cancer mortality has dropped by 40% since 1989.

“Cancer research has shown us what can be done” said Elovitz. “We need to be brave. We need to be bold.” In other words there needs to be a Mary Lasker of prematurity.

Yet scientists and clinicians acknowledge that in important ways understanding and preventing preterm birth may be more complicated than fighting cancer. There’s both the reluctance to testing new treatments during pregnancy and the hesitancy from big pharma. But experts argue these challenges can be overcome: just look at advances in pediatric medications in the past 20 years.

“Children were being completely left out. People maintained that it was unethical to test drugs in children that they were too delicate” said Ward the retired neonatologist. Historically drug companies also steered clear of pediatrics seeing little financial upside to developing new therapeutics for this demographic. “The market for medications in children is tiny” said Ward who also served as chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Drugs and pushed for legislative intervention.

And a couple of bipartisan laws — one in the 1990s and one in the 2000s — changed the landscape. One law essentially offered pharmaceutical companies a financial incentive if they studied their drugs in children. The other law required new drugs to be tested in children if the disorder was likely to occur in children. And for all the drugs already on the market the NIH stepped in to facilitate the research that was needed.

“We have seen a dramatic increase in the study of drugs in children and for pediatrics as a group about 50% of the drugs now approved have been studied and labeled for children” said Ward. Before the legislation passed he estimated 90% of drugs used in children were not studied in children.

“Pediatric clinical trials participation has evolved from ‘not ethical’ to ‘not ethical not to.’ The same will hopefully occur in obstetrics” write Zhaoxia Ren and Anne Zajicek two physicians at the NIH.

A Nightmare and a Miracle

Matteo Castillo was nearly four months old when on July 4th he left the hospital for the first time. Yannira Castillo said the freedom to take her child home felt wonderful and terrifying. She barely slept at first staying up to make sure Matteo remembered to breathe something for which he often needed help while in the NICU.

The hospital had given Castillo and her husband strict instructions to keep Matteo close to home. He needed time to grow and strengthen without the burden of battling germs from the outside world. “We didn’t go out at all” said Castillo. “We stayed home for the first two years of his life.”

During those early years there were failed hearing tests and classes on how to help Matteo learn to eat. Pediatric physical therapists and speech therapists visited the house. Castillo her husband and their older children poured everything into Matteo. They knew the data: the majority of infants born at Matteo’s stage end up having at least one severe disability. They watched anxiously to see if Matteo would inch past the milestones that other kids cruised by. They watched to see if the doctor’s promise — “your baby is going to be okay” — would be fulfilled.

Now Matteo is five years old and has just started kindergarten. Castillo says she still worries about all the stumbling blocks prematurity scatters along a child’s path especially the ones that don’t surface immediately. She wonders about autism and attention deficit disorder. She frets about Matteo’s lungs still checking on his breathing every night. But in the morning when Matteo wakes up happy and eager to get to school she quiets her worries and lets herself exhale trusting that the nightmare has become a miracle.

She smiles to herself remembering an early fall day a few weeks ago when Matteo was outside his grandmother’s house in Chelsea Mass. He spotted a little kid across the fence on the neighbor’s porch and as the family watched from a distance the two boys struck up an easy conversation. The young neighbor explained that he’d been born with only one leg. “And Matteo started telling the kid ‘Oh I was in the hospital when I was born too. I had a lot of tubes in my face’” recalled Castillo.

By almost any metric Matteo has far surpassed ‘okay.’ He has thrived. But experts say that for Matteo Castillo for Becca Magida for Caleb and Gabriel Hershey for Patrick Kennedy and for the nearly 400000 preemies born each year true success would be preventing premature births in the first place.

Editor’s note: This reporting project was undertaken with support from the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism’s 2020 Data Fellowship. In the interest of full disclosure author Gabrielle Emanuel’s son is among the 1 in 10 children born preterm.

Methodology: The GBH News data analysis focused on clinical trials rather than observational studies or basic research since experts indicated that clinical trials can lead directly to changes in patient care. We used the federal database at clinicaltrials.gov to compare the investment in prematurity research with the investment in other conditions. We limited the focus to trials that were conducted at least partially in the United States between 2000 and 2020; in 2000 the database was made public and many more studies were obligated to register. We ran a search for trials using the term “preterm birth” and the search engine automatically included related terms such as “premature” “preterm” “prematurity” and “early onset of delivery.” Next we applied a filter under “recruitment” to exclude all incomplete trials (withdrawn suspended terminated). With the resulting database we sorted results by age to see how many of the studies are focused on children (<18 years old) and how many focused on adult women. By a cursory review of the trials it appeared the studies focused on adult women were often aimed at preventing prematurity during pregnancy whereas the studies that focused on children were often aimed at treating premature children. The database was further sorted to see how many drug trials were conducted compared to other types of interventions such as dietary supplements. The analysis also noted the funding source for each trial. Interventions that were at least partially funded by industry were marked as industry-funded. The same process was then used for a series of other medical conditions including erectile dysfunction breast cancer and infertility. This methodology was reviewed by several academics as well as an outside data journalist."

Background information

The Hollywood actor was born on the 7th of November 1989 in Los Angeles California United States of America. He was christened Barron Nicholas Hilton II by his parents Kathy and Richard Hilton. So what is Barron Hilton II's age? At the time of writing this he is 31 years old.

Barron's family is one of the richest families in real estate and hotel businesses in the world. This wealth can be traced back to his great grandfather Conrad Hilton who acquired his first hotel in Texas after World War I.

Barron Nicholas's father Richard Hilton is Conrad Hilton's grandson and the entrepreneurial blood flows in his veins. He started the Hilton and Hyland company and got married to actress and fashion designer Kathy in 1979. The union produced four children.

Barron is the third out of four children and his siblings are Paris Nicky Hilton and Conrad Hilton III. The first two are into fashion and entertainment like their mother while the last boy has been in different controversies including drugs and restraining orders.

Barron Hilton II's job

Like his sisters Barron's job must have been influenced by his mother's involvement in the entertainment industry. However he also took the business DNA of his father.

As an actor Barron has been in movies like Spring to Winter Montauk Rosewood: The Best Version of Yourself and Three Deaths. He wrote and directed a short film En Passant in 2015 and has been on a couple of shows and documentaries alongside his sister Paris and mother.

Besides Barron helps his father in managing the family business. At some point also he was the Marketing Vice President at Bernstein Equity Partner.

Personal life

A restaurant in Pointe Milou St. Barts brought Barron Hilton II's girlfriend to him in 2016. Tessa von Walderdorff and the actor hit it off immediately and about a year later in September 2017 Barron proposed to his sweetheart with a diamond ring.

Fast forward to June 2018 Tessa became Barron Hilton II's wife. The couple tied the knot at the venue of their first meeting and family and friends attended it.

Barron Hilton II's baby

Interestingly Tessa and her husband announced that Barron's first baby was on its way and on the 11th of March 2020 the couple had their first child delivered. They named the baby girl Milou Alizée Hilton. The Milou in her name was in honour of the place where the romantic and family journey began.

Scandal

Barron keeps a relatively low profile compared to his other siblings but that does not mean he has not had his fair share of controversy. In 2008 at the age of 18 the model physically assaulted an attendant at a gas station after driving in the wrong direction for a suspiciously long time.

This was the first sign of a possible Barron Hilton II's drugs abuse. His lawyer pinned the incident on amnesia. However in 2011 a judge asked him to pay a fine of $4.9 million which included a $4.6 million fine for the damages done to the fuel attendant earlier.

More so the actor was at the receiving end of a physical assault in 2013 in Miami when he shared a picture of his badly cut and swollen face on social media. He accused actress Lindsay Lohan of being the brain behind the beatings he received although he could not prove it.

Barron Hilton II's Instagram

Like most celebrities the 31 year old businessman is on Instagram where he shares posts about his family and business with close to 400000 enthusiastic followers.

How much is Barron Hilton II worth?

Thanks to his activities in front and behind the cameras the Hollywood actor commands a net worth of around $5 million. Besides he is a Senior Vice President at his father's Hilton and Hyland company and an active associate of the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation.

Since the millionaire makes the majority of his fortune from real estate it is only fair that Barron Hilton II's house is a luxurious mansion befitting his status.

Generational wealth is created by someone in the older generation and sustained by the upcoming generation. Barron Hilton II's house businesses bordering real estate and hotels contribute to the development of Conrad Hilton Snr's financial legacy in a section of American's economy.

HD,Home Depot,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzEwLzE2L2x1bWJlci1wcmljZS1hcmUtc3VyZ2luZy1ob21lLWRlcG90LWxvd2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Surging Lumber Prices Good or Bad News for Home Depot and Lowes?,"Lumber prices have been going through unprecedented volatility since the pandemic onset.

Lumber prices have been on a wild ride since the pandemic onset. The price measured per thousand board feet was around $400 in December 2019 before the outbreak. It fell to $236 in April 2020 before skyrocketing over the next year reaching almost $1700 in May this year. The price started crashing as economies were reopening falling to nearly $400 in August. Now it's surging again trading at $755 as of this writing.

Home improvement retail giants Home Depot (HD -0.29%) and Lowe's (LOW -0.47%) sell a lot of lumber to professionals and do-it-yourselfers. Therefore changes in lumber prices can have a significant impact on their business. Let's look at Home Depot and Lowe's and see if the recent lumber prices increase is good or bad news.

Increasing lumber prices decrease spending at Lowe's

Lowe's last reported quarterly financial results on Aug. 18 for the three months ending July 30. Its fiscal third quarter will include results for August September and October. And the price of lumber did not start rising again until mid-September. So for the first half of its third quarter lumber prices hovered at lower levels. Lowe's investors are hoping management secured purchases for large quantities of lumber at those prices.

Lowe's merchandise inventory was already up to $17.3 billion as of July 30 an increase from $13.8 billion the same time last year and $655 million of that was related to higher prices for commodities primarily attributed to lumber.

From a customer viewpoint management noted that folks pulled back spending on projects that required lumber in the mix. That's a typical consumer response; when prices go up quantities purchased decrease. However management also noted that when the cost of lumber was falling in the first few weeks of August customers were spending more on the commodity.

Thankfully Lowe's has implemented digital pricing protocols at most of its stores reducing the time employees spend walking around adjusting the prices of products to account for changes in materials cost. That capability might be paying for itself during all the lumber price volatility. Still the rapidly changing prices and especially increases in lumber prices are not good news for Lowe's and it's likely discouraging some customers from going forward on projects they would otherwise undertake.

Home Depot has a customer-friendly policy on lumber prices

While commodity price volatility is harmful to Lowe's it is more so for Home Depot. The company has a customer-friendly policy on the matter that could be detrimental to near-term profitability. Here is CEO Craig Menear addressing the company's stance on lumber-price volatility:

[When it comes to pricing goods] ... we always have a philosophy that we want to lead the market down and lag going up to remain as competitive as possible for our customers and that actually created an impact which in this quarter was unique that we normally don't see.

That means Home Depot absorbs higher prices for a while before passing them along to customers and drops prices soon after commodity prices decrease. In other words Home Depot is willing to take a hit on profit margins to provide customer-friendly pricing. This policy may gain customers' loyalty over the long term but hurts profit margins during such volatile price changes as what's going on with lumber right now.

Fortunately for both Home Depot and Lowe's they operate with healthy gross profit margins and can absorb decreases in the metric with minor damages. Furthermore Home Depot's customer-friendly policy is apparent in its decreasing gross profit margin while Lowe's expanded from 2020 onward (see chart). The trend is likely to continue with Home Depot suffering more damage to gross profit margins with lumber price volatility.

Still this is no reason to choose Lowe's over Home Depot when considering a home improvement retailer stock to buy. The benefits of Home Depot's policy could come forth over the long term through higher customer loyalty.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vc3R0aG9tYXNzb3VyY2UuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvMjAyMS8xMC8xNy9qdWRnZS1kZW5pZXMtYmFpbC1tb2RpZmljYXRpb24taW4taG9tZS1kZXBvdC1tdXJkZXItY2FzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge Denies Bail Modification in Home Depot Murder Case,"Justin Matthews – jailed on murder charges in the shooting death of Keoner Baron on Sept. 4 in the Home Depot parking lot on St. Thomas – has been denied a modification to his $1 million bail with the judge noting that he was already free on bond in an unrelated stalking case when the slaying occurred.

Matthews 23 has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and 10 other counts in the killing of Baron 20 on a Saturday afternoon as she sat under a tree in the parking lot waiting for a ride home following her shift at the store.

At Matthews’ arraignment on Sept. 24 Territorial Public Defender Samuel Joseph wrote in a motion for bail reduction that “the Magistrate Court’s order in this matter is tantamount to a denial of bond. Even with a reduction to $100000 the defendant’s bond would be substantial that he’d likely be unable to post it.”

Joseph said Matthews would reside with a third-party custodian – his grandmother – in Estate Contant and would be subject to strict house arrest with electronic GPS monitoring 24 hours a day seven days a week.

The V.I. Attorney General’s Office opposed the motion and on Oct. 12 Superior Court Judge Denise Francois issued an order denying Matthews’ request to convert his bail to an unsecured bond or reduce it to $100000.

“Matthews is charged with a long list of violent crimes including using a firearm to commit a murder in a public parking lot utilized by members of the community. Matthews has admitted to shooting and killing the victim in this case. Notably during the commission of this crime Matthews was already on bail from a previous case … where he is accused of stalking and disturbing the peace. Matthews has shown he is a danger to the community and he cannot abide by less stringent bail conditions. His request will be denied” Francois wrote in her order.

Matthews was free on an unsecured $2000 bond on charges of stalking and disturbance of the peace/threats in an unrelated case from June 20 2020 when the Home Depot shooting occurred according to court documents. He has pleaded not guilty in that case.

According to an exhibit filed by V.I. Attorney General Denise George in opposition to the bail reduction request Matthews repeatedly engaged in threatening behavior towards the woman in the stalking case starting in December 2019 when he overtook her vehicle as she was driving her daughter to school “stopped directly in front of her took out a duffle bag from his trunk pulled out what appeared to be a gun and demanded to know where her boyfriend … was located.”

Several more incidents followed where Matthews would see the woman and trail or circle her in his car and in one case stop and stare at her for a long period of time according to the exhibit.

According to an affidavit filed by V.I. Police Detective Shenika Simon in the murder case Matthews and Baron had been dating for about two years and she had broken off the relationship three days before she was killed.

Home Depot surveillance video showed a silver vehicle approach Baron in the parking lot and stop.

“She appeared to be having a conversation with the individual inside of the vehicle and then she walked off and walked towards the area where she was shot” said Simon.

“The individual inside the vehicle rolled up the window and drove in the direction where Ms. Baron was sitting. The vehicle was in the area for about five minutes before traversing Southward in the Home Depot parking lot and heading in an eastern direction (left turn) towards Donoe roadway” said Simon.

“I observed that at about 1710 hrs an unknown individual attired in a black shirt stone wash short jeans pants ran in the direction where Ms. Baron was seated. The individual approached Ms. Baron and fired a shot at her and she raised her hands and she fell on the ground. The individual continued to fire several more shots at Ms. Baron” before running off Simon wrote in her affidavit. She said officers collected 11 9mm shell casings at the scene.

Witnesses to the shooting gave police a description of the vehicle and its license plate said Simon.

Detective V. Carr heard the 911 call and realizing he knew the car and its owner traveled to Matthews’ residence in Estate Contant and took him to the Criminal Investigation Bureau for questioning said Simon.

Matthews at first said his vehicle was stolen at gunpoint as he stopped on the side of the road in the Donoe area to remove a bucket from the trunk and that he reported it in a call to 911 according to the affidavit.

After further investigation revealed no such call had been made Matthews was brought back to the police station the following day and admitted to shooting Baron after they got into an argument over her speaking to another man the affidavit said.

Along with first-degree murder domestic violence Matthews is charged with second-degree murder domestic violence four counts of unauthorized use of a firearm first-degree assault domestic violence third-degree assault domestic violence unauthorized possession of a firearm unauthorized possession of firearm ammunition and reckless endangerment in the first degree.

His trial is set for Feb. 14 in Superior Court on St. Thomas.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL3dpLWFtYmVyLWFsZXJ0LXVwZGF0ZS1tYWpvci1oYXJyaXMtbWlzc2luZy1taWx3YXVrZWUtd2lzY29uc2luLzExMTM5Nzc5L9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL2FtcC93aS1hbWJlci1hbGVydC11cGRhdGUtbWFqb3ItaGFycmlzLW1pc3NpbmctbWlsd2F1a2VlLXdpc2NvbnNpbi8xMTEzOTc3OS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WI Amber Alert update today: Major Harris 3 still missing after Milwaukee homicide suspect Jaheem Clark found dead: police,"The WI Amber Alert was activated on Saturday Oct 16 and remains in effect

The Hocus Pocus actress 45 said she ""would love"" to return for the upcoming Disney+ sequel to the 1993 cult classic in which Bette Midler Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy will reprise their roles as the witchy trio.

""I haven't heard anything"" Shaw told Entertainment Tonight on Friday. ""I know it's so disappointing. I would love to do the sequel. It would be so much fun. I think there's just a different storyline with younger people but why can't we all come back in some way?""

She also had a theory for where her character Allison would be 28 years later after teaming up with Max (Omri Katz) and Dani (Thora Birch) to save the children of Salem Mass.

""I feel like she and Max are still together but I think Allison's from Salem and he always wants to be in California. I think they did some sort of compromise and maybe she's in Salem when the witches come back you know visiting her mom or something"" Shaw said.

A sequel to Hocus Pocus was first rumored to be in the works back in 2019. Disney later confirmed the news in December 2020 announcing that director Adam Shankman (2007's Hairspray) would helm the follow-up.

Last October Midler 75 revealed to FOX 5 that she Parker 56 and Najimy 64 had all agreed to return. Filming was scheduled to begin this fall.

""They want to make a movie they've asked us if we were interested and of course all of us said yes"" said Midler at the time. ""I'm game I'm totally game.""

She also told PEOPLE ""They presented us with an outline and after we picked ourselves up off the floor because it's been 27 years we looked at it and I think all of us agreed that it was pretty great.""

Midler Parker and Najimy starred in 1993's Hocus Pocus as the Sanderson sisters a trio of witches who are accidentally resurrected 300 years after being burned at the stake for preying on the children of Salem. Teenage Max his little sister Dani and his new crush Allison must then save the town and send the witches back to their graves.

Adding a fresh coat of paint is one of the most impactful (and affordable) ways to completely transform a space. But without the right paint roller the DIY you saw on Pinterest becomes more of a headache than a simple before-and-after. “It’s sort of like putting the cheapest gas in a Ferrari” says Nicole Gibbons founder of Clare. “If you’re using premium paint you should be using the most premium materials. The supplies you choose are one of the most important things that impact how your project is going to turn out.”

With the right roller painting a room can be an easy—and dare we say relaxing—experience. We tapped reno pros to find the best paint rollers for the smoothest finish no matter your project or level of expertise. With these no-fail picks you’ll want to refresh every room in your house.

A Few Things to Keep in Mind

Easy-to-grip frames: If you’re going to be painting for a while you’ll want a roller frame that’s both comfortable and ergonomic. According to Gibbons most roller frames you’ll find at a paint store are designed for professionals and not the average DIYer. She recommends one with a thin soft grip or using an extension pole for even more control and speed.

Length: While a bigger roller might seem more efficient when painting a larger surface it’s actually much harder to hold and control according to Connie McKinney senior product manager at Sherwin-Williams. “If I’m painting a standard room a 9-inch roller is going to be the one I choose” she says. But for smaller surfaces like molding or that awkward space between a counter and a window a 4-inch roller will work and be much speedier than just a brush.

Material and fabric: There are three kinds of materials that roller covers are made out of: wool microfiber and foam. For the smoothest application Gibbons suggests using microfiber as it has a tight stipple pattern and holds more paint. “Woven naps tend to have more texture which means you can leave texture marks on the wall you’re painting” she says. “The more woven your nap is the smoother the results.” However wool covers can be useful when using oil-based paint.

Type of painting surface: The thickness of the roller you need also known as the nap depends on the surface you’re painting. The standard roller nap is ⅜ inch but if you’re painting something really textured like stucco walls or brick you’ll need a thicker nap to get into those grooves and work the paint into all the nooks and crannies. McKinney recommends going up to ½ inch or higher in these cases.

Our Top Picks

Best Overall: Purdy White Dove Roller Cover

Shop

The average home painter wants a tightly knitted roller that will leave behind a uniform color without any loose fibers left behind. Made of woven Dralon an acrylic fiber the Purdy White Dove does just that and can be washed for several reuses. “This roller is going to leave a really smooth finish” says McKinney. “It’s going to have that tight stipple pattern so it will have a uniform look to it and leave no lint behind.” Plus at 9 inches long and with a ⅜-inch nap it’s the ideal length and thickness for most rooms and it works with all paint types.

Best Starter Kit: Clare 7-Piece Kit

Shop

Beginners will appreciate this kit from Clare that has everything you could possibly need for a standard paint job. It comes with a plastic drop cloth painter’s washi tape a 2-inch paintbrush a roller frame a 9-inch roller cover a metal tray and a tray liner.

The roller has a ⅜-inch nap which is ideal for painting smooth–to–lightly textured surfaces. It’s made of a premium German microfiber that creates a clean application with minimal splatter and it works particularly well with Clare’s paints and primer.

“Our products are designed to give the best performance with our paint and customers who are novice painters achieve quality results” says Gibbons. “The roller is really high quality has virtually no shedding and helps achieve the smoothest possible application.”

Best Value: Home Depot Polyester Paint Roller Cover

Shop

While most roller covers aren’t terribly expensive this six-pack is particularly economical. The polyester paint roller covers are 9 inches long and have a ⅜-inch nap which makes them ideal for most standard walls. They’re best for use with nonfinish coatings on smooth to semi-smooth surfaces and can be used only once—which makes them a good option for anyone who has one small project or doesn’t want to bother with washing covers.

Shop

More experienced painters can benefit from a larger roller which can cover twice the amount of wall in one swoop (or tackle more annoying tasks like painting a ceiling). This one is 18 inches long and has a ⅜-inch nap with premium woven fabric for a smooth finish. Note that because the roller is longer it will also be heavier so you’ll want a longer roller frame and an extension pole for better control.

Best for Textured Walls: Wooster Pro Super Roller Cover

Shop

Using a standard ⅜-inch nap on a textured wall is going to leave lots of little grooves unpainted (and leave you frustrated). Enter this roller cover which goes up to 1 ¼ inches thick meaning it will get into even the spaces between bricks easily. Designed for extra-rough surfaces it resists matting which is especially important as cheaper covers are likely to shed or rip from the texture of the wall.

Best for Big Projects: Wagner Spraytech Electric Powered Roller

Shop

If you’re spending your day painting multiple walls and want to make the most of your time any help is appreciated. This electric-powered roller from Wagner attaches to the paint can and automatically reloads your roller for continuous painting. You can control the flow using a button on the handle and the design eliminates back discomfort from repeated bending down and the risk of accidentally knocking over a paint can which is all we can hope for when tackling a huge paint job. The 16-foot hose also makes it possible to reach the tippy-top of walls or the ceiling.

Ask Domino

Q: What roller material gives the smoothest finish?

Tightly woven microfiber gives the smoothest finish on a standard wall. It has a minimally textured surface that will leave behind less of a stipple effect compared to a wool roller cover. “​​Microfiber also holds more paint so you spend less time dipping your roller into the tray to reload your roll with paint” says Gibbons.

Q: What’s the best way to clean and dry a paint roller after use?

A quality roller cover can be used multiple times—as long as it’s cleaned correctly. To clean a roller McKinney recommends using a 5-in-1 tool and scraping paint off the roller and back into the paint can. “You’ll be shocked at how much paint is in that roller cover” she says. “This will save so much time in your utility sink.” From there you can roll off any remaining paint onto a piece of cardboard before rinsing the roller cover with some mild soap until the water runs clear. Then just leave it out to air-dry.

Q: My paint roller keeps shedding fibers into the wet paint. Help!

If your paint roller starts shedding Gibbons recommends stopping your project immediately and getting a new quality roller cover—otherwise it will just keep shedding. However there are a few things you can do to prevent shedding in the first place. McKinney recommends rinsing your roller before dipping it into the paint to remove any loose fibers and to prime it to hold more paint. She also advises painting less visible areas first such as a closet which gets any inconsistencies out of the roller before you paint a wall in a high-traffic area like a living room.

The Last Word

Picking out the right paint roller depends mostly on the type and size of the surface you’re painting. Once you figure that out you can adjust the material length and nap of the roller to best fit your project and get rolling. Purdy’s White Dove Roller Cover is a great all-rounder that leaves a smooth even finish but if you’re a DIY rookie opt for ​​Clare’s 7-Piece Kit which includes all the tools and accessories you need.

Nigeria’s foods manufacturer has recorded an all-time high revenue of N109.5 billion an increase of 36 percent over N80.4 billion for the financial year ending March 2021. The company’s Operating Profit grew faster than revenue at 39 percent from N5.4 billion in full year (FY) 2020 to N7.6 billion in FY 2021.

The board during its 12th annual general meeting (AGM) held in Lagos Thursday October 14 equally recommended the payment of 7 kobo per share as dividend for the year subject to shareholders’ approval. FY 2021 was the company’s best performing year ever revenue-wise as it crossed the N100 billion mark for the first time ever joining an exclusive league of Nigerian companies with over N100 billion annual revenue.

Increased production output pioneering new ways of selling developing relationships with new customers all over the country across traditional and modern trades and more efficient operational capabilities at its factories in Apapa Sagamu and Ikeja were key contributing factors to the revenue increase.

The company also informed shareholders of its 10-year-plan to increase investment in innovative product development and advanced technology infrastructure with continued focus on operational efficiency and local content development as the key strategic drivers for increasing shareholder value and growing market share during the next financial year. It therefore reiterated its commitment to sustainable growth within the industry and the provision of affordable staple foods to Nigeria’s fast-growing population.

Lanre Jaiyeola the managing director Honeywell Flour Mills Plc. said the company will continue to seek innovative solutions for feeding the ever-growing Nigerian population using affordable and easily accessible foods while simultaneously combating inflation and rising food prices.

“In the past financial year we achieved record production and sales volumes driven by consumer food products which also achieved record sales volume. Our investment in a new Pasta factory at Sagamu paid off greatly as we grew Pasta sales by over 40 percent to meet the generated demand for our Pasta products” Jaiyeola said.

According to him developments in the past 12 months have encouraged the company to sharpen its focus and embark on a 10-year journey towards creating more value for its shareholders. Jaiyeola posits that Honeywell continues to focus on its competitive advantage and improve on product offerings in order to exceed its consumers’ expectations while increasing market share and delivering value to shareholders.

“Consequently we have commenced a 10-year evolutionary journey that will see Honeywell Flour Mills transition to become Honeywell Foods. Our aim is to offer a portfolio of food products manufactured from a wide range of raw materials drawn from local sources that offer good nutrition and contribute to a healthier and balanced life. Our aim also aligns with the Federal Government’s commitment to achieving the United Nations 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development Goals that seeks to ensure access to safe nutritious and sufficient food” Jaiyeola said.

Oba Otudeko chairman board of directors Honeywell Flour Mills acknowledged the complexities of the past financial year while highlighting the company’s steady growth and its focus on the future. “When the financial year 2020/2021 commenced few could have imagined what the year had in store for the company and the world. We responded by working collaboratively towards the execution of our corporate goals guided by clear priorities; keeping our people safe and motivated ensuring supply of our food products to consumers across the length and breadth of the country and caring for the communities where we operate. Despite the inevitable disruption to our business we delivered a strong performance in very challenging circumstances” he stated.

Otudeko while commenting on the future drive of the company said Honeywell is committed to investing in the needed capabilities the know-how and the talent to continue to create value. “While we expect market conditions to remain tough and the effects of COVID-19 may be with us for the foreseeable future our company has shown the capacity to withstand shocks and emerge stronger. And with consumer behaviour evolving faster than ever we are adapting to this new reality by executing with speed in order to deliver competitive returns and meet the needs of our multiple stakeholders” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cmVjb3JkLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvc2NvdHRpc2gtbmV3cy9wcm9iZS1zY290cy1wcGUtc3dlYXRzaG9wLWJyYW5kZWQtMjUyMzE2NTHSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXJlY29yZC5jby51ay9uZXdzL3Njb3R0aXNoLW5ld3MvcHJvYmUtc2NvdHMtcHBlLXN3ZWF0c2hvcC1icmFuZGVkLTI1MjMxNjUxLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Probe into Scots PPE 'sweatshop' branded a 'whitewash',"Something went wrong please try again later.

Bosses investigating bullying at a £58million taxpayer-funded PPE factory have been accused by an MSP of a whitewash.

Executives from US firm Honeywell met Richard Leonard to discuss claims by whistleblowers that they were badly mistreated while working at their complex in Newhouse Lanarkshire.

But Leonard was told their own internal investigation had found none of the allegations could be confirmed.

It comes as more whistleblowers come forward to complain about the company including a former soldier who claimed being on patrol in Afghanistan was better than working at Honeywell.

Leonard plans to write to UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid about Honeywell’s working practices and the behaviour of its management.

He said: “I believe the company’s investigation into themselves was a whitewash. It was an exercise in self-denial obfuscation and cover-up. The outcome was clearly pre-judged.

“That Honeywell choose to use a phrase like ‘cannot confirm the allegations’ suggests they cannot deny them either.”

Last month five female whistleblowers told the Sunday Mail that workers were forced to meet unrealistic targets of making 600 medical grade masks per hour for use by doctors and nurses on the NHS.

The women who are aged between 50 and 65 also claim they were timed by managers as they did their job and went to the toilet intimidated as they stood over them and ordered not to leave their seats. Some who struggled to meet targets or took days off sick were reprimanded or lost their jobs.

After our September 12 article Honeywell’s Romina Kananishoo contacted Leonard to say the claims would be investigated. The former Scottish Labour leader had hoped to meet the Honeywell boss in person at the plant near Bellshill. But she chose to do the meeting by video conference from her office in Brussels with two executives from their UK HQ in Berkshire.

Staff claimed they were forced to work in sweatshop conditions after the factory’s air conditioning system failed and when they brought their own fans in they were told not to use them.

Several more ex-staff have come forward after reading about our investigation. One 50-year-old woman who asked not to be named claims she was told to “get off the site” by a line manager after she asked for a day’s holiday.

And a 40-year-old man who also asked not to be named claims he was dismissed in April for taking two days off after he had a reaction to a Covid vaccine. He was also reprimanded for taking time off when his son was ill.

The ex-soldier says he was treated badly during his seven-month stint despite telling bosses he suffered PTSD after serving in Afghanistan. He added: “Helmand Province was better than Honeywell. You couldn’t go to the toilet without permission listen to music talk or laugh.”

Honeywell said: “We conducted a thorough internal review including interviews with employees.

“We went through the concerns and found they were false unsubstantiated or taken out of context.

“We also made it clear to Mr Leonard we welcome the opportunity to meet the anonymous workers who spoke with him so we can better understand their concerns.

“We held this meeting by tele-conference to ensure his safety and that of our co-workers during this time of pandemic.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2luZGVwZW5kZW50cHJlbWl1bS9sb25nLXJlYWRzL2hvdy10aGUtaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQtc3RhcnRlZC1hbm5pdmVzYXJ5LWIxOTMyNzQxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Andreas Whittam Smith: We began as a start-up and we're still innovating 35 years on,"You often read about start-ups. Thirty-five years ago in October 1986 The Independent was one such publishing its first ever issue. Start-ups generally comprise a group of friends with an ambitious project in their minds who get together in one of their homes to make plans and seek useful contacts. In the case of the outstandingly successful Microsoft for instance Paul Allen a programmer at Honeywell purchased a magazine that described the first microcomputer. He immediately rushed round to his school friend Bill Gates to show him. The rest was history as they say. Or to take a famous 19th-century example Marks & Spencer began operations when Michael Marks and Thomas Spencer acquired a permanent stall in Leeds covered market in 1894. Again the rest was history.

The Independent began in this way but with an important difference which I shall come to. I and two colleagues on The Daily Telegraph Matthew Symonds and Stephen Glover drew up plans to launch a new daily newspaper in October 1986 which was to be The Independent. None of us had been considering this daunting step for long. We began the planning in 1985. We launched a year later. Glover and Symonds were in their early thirties and I was nearly 50.

There were a number of aspects of the Fleet Street of the day that we didn’t like. Most newspapers were stridently political with right-wing views in the ascendant. Left-of-centre arguments got an outing only in the Daily Mirror and The Guardian. But by the 1980s third-party politics had arrived.",,,

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

Local businesses business leaders and organizations in Ulster County will be honored this week during a recognition awards dinner on Thursday Oct. 21.

Additionally the Len Cane Heart of Ulster County award will be presented posthumously to Tommy Keegan of Keegan Ales.

Business of the Year: Howmet Fastening Systems

Howmet Fastening Systems has been a staple of the Ulster County economy for decades though it has operated from the Kingston Business Park under different names according to information from the chamber. The company employs 100 people and makes fastening tools for a variety of industries. It also designs manufactures and assembles hydraulic and pneudraulic tools power rigs and battery tools used to install fasteners in the aerospace and other industries.

“We are greatly honored to be recognized as the Business of the Year by the Chamber and UCEDA” Eileen Larocca the company’s Human Resources Manager said in a press release. “As a member of the community since the 1940s and our transformations from Electrol Hucktrol Huck Alcoa Arconic and now Howmet we continue to prioritize being a strong community partner.”

Idle power consumption on 120V power we saw around 12-14W idle. We generally assume these nodes will use 9-12W idle so this seems to be a bit higher than we normally expect but it is a few watts not an enormous gap. Again we do see power consumption creep slightly higher over time if dust accumulates in the fan/ heatsink and we had a new unit here. Still directionally this is where we would expect.

The power supply for this unit is a 90W HP power adapter from the company’s notebook line. As you would expect you can use the adapters from the company’s notebooks with this machine. We did get into this 89-91W range during our benchmarking so we would have liked to have seen a larger power supply. With USB charging ports it feels like this needs to be a higher capacity unit. Again a larger power supply also starts to mitigate some of the benefits of moving to a smaller form factor.

At idle the system is not silent but it is very quiet if working from 1M away. Below 40-60% load the noise was acceptable but running at 100% load for extended periods of time will ramp fans. We will quickly note that the 65W TDP EliteDesk 800 G6 units with GPUs and one should expect more fan noise with those higher-power options. We also would expect a GPU-equipped unit to come with a larger power supply.

Key Lesson Learned for TMM

In this series we wanted to also focus on some key lessons learned. Since we have already tested well over a dozen different models we are taking away key pieces of advice from each that we wanted to share.

The key lesson learned here is clearly around the 35W v. 65W version. Having both and having used both for some time the question is simply: Is it worth getting the 65W version?

The allure of the 65W version is additional performance. Having a system that can hit higher turbo clocks also means that it can hit performance levels more akin to a modern desktop PC yet in a 1L form factor. That is not something lost in terms of its appeal. Realistically the Core i5-10500(T) is great because it brings 6 cores/ 12 threads to this segment that only a few generations earlier was annually refreshing parts at the 4 core/ 4 thread level. This is a massive generational jump. As a result the Core i5-10500T probably feels more like a Core i7 of a generation prior and the Core i5-10500 feels maybe 1-2 steps above that.

Still there are trade-offs. For that additional performance one gets higher power consumption. There is a perforated top that limits the ability to stack these units as clearly thermals are a challenge in the 65W version. When the fan ramps it is very noticeable. HP’s design does not just put the perforated top above the fan inlet instead it is almost the entirety of the chassis meaning this is not one I would look forward to from a dust perspective. As these units age they tend to accumulate dust anyway and as a result fans spin up to higher speeds.

We also spent quite a bit more on this unit. Although we also got 8GB more of memory we still had a ~$150 premium without the memory.

Personally I do not think this changes my opinion of recommending 35W over 65W units for TinyMiniMicro. I thought perhaps it was substantially different in this generation but it appears as though it is not.

Final Words

Overall HP has a very nice package with the HP EliteDesk 800 G6 Mini. Now that we have tested both the 65W and the 35W versions we have an appreciation for the platform.

This generation offers a lot of value with the newer Core i5-10500 offering a 6 core / 12 thread solution in just 1L. That includes clock speeds of up to 4.5GHz on this CPU and up to 4.8GHz on the i5-10600. Looking back to the 6th and 7th generation core-based systems only a few generations prior this is absolutely massive in terms of performance gains and just compute capacity in these 1L PCs.

Again HP needs to fix its poor USB port speed labeling as Dell and Lenovo are leading in that. It may seem like a minor nit but picking up and finishing this review a few months later I needed to look up the port configuration.

Overall HP has a great hardware platform. I shared a bit of my personal perspective on this but I do also realize that there are many who will simply prefer getting the faster HP EliteDesk 800 G6 Mini 65W TDP CPU version. Still it was great getting to take another look at the 35W v. 65W options that this segment offers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy90aGUtMTEwMC1ocC10ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC1zLXBsYWlkLXBsdXMtaXMtYmFjay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 1100-HP Tesla Model S Plaid Plus Is Back,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy90aGUtMTEwMC1ocC10ZXNsYS1tb2RlbC1zLXBsYWlkLXBsdXMtaXMtYmFjay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoaXMtZ3JlZWstc3RhcnR1cC13aWxsLWxhdW5jaC1hLTMwMDBocC1zdHJlZXQtbGVnYWwtdWx0cmFjYXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Greek Startup Will Launch A 3000-HP Street Legal Ultracar,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3RoaXMtZ3JlZWstc3RhcnR1cC13aWxsLWxhdW5jaC1hLTMwMDBocC1zdHJlZXQtbGVnYWwtdWx0cmFjYXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndoYXRoaWZpLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RoZS1ocC1wcm9qZWN0b3ItY2MyMDAtaXMtYS1zZXJpb3VzbHktYWZmb3JkYWJsZS1wb3J0YWJsZS1wcm9qZWN0b3LSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The HP Projector CC200 is a seriously affordable portable projector,"HP Projector has launched a portable projector into the world to provide a more budget-friendly option than the likes of the Anker Nebula range. The HP Projector CC200 is a bedside or coffee table-type device with an LED light source and some relatively short-throw/big screen potential.

It's a Full HD resolution unit with a 2 x 3W speaker system built in that can produce an image of up to 80-inch at a distance of 2.1m. Around the back is all you need to connect to a laptop hard drive or even an external speaker thanks to two USB slots an HDMI and a 3.5mm audio-out.

What you don't get is any built-in wireless technology or smart platform. Instead HP Projector suggests pairing the CC220 with a streaming stick and has even created a bundle for the States that includes one.

All the same it seems like a slightly odd way of doing things given that the HP Projector name has been licensed by the GAC Technology Group a company that claims to be a ""world-leading designer and manufacturer of innovative smart projection solutions"". Still if that's what helps keeps the price competitively low then why not?

The HP Projector CC200 uses LCD technology to create its picture and the 200 lumens light source is rated to last up to 20000 hours. There's a motorised lens for focusing (via the remote control) with a 1.2:1 throw ratio.

If this sounds like the portable projector for you then make sure that the 20 x 13 x 14cm (HWD) form will fit your plans.

The HP Projector CC200 is available to buy now in the States bundled with an 84-inch screen and a Roku Express streaming stick for just $260. It's also coming soon to Amazon. We'll bring you details on worldwide availability when we have them.

Photo: 7X Design

Such one-of-a-kind creation made a sumptuous appearance at this year's Concours of Elegance held at Hampton Court in England. The British automotive coachbuilding firm named 7X Design presented their latest work of engineering art based on the Lamborghini Huracan calling it the 7X Rayo. The German high-performance donor machine had been taken through a comprehensive conception and fabrication process which after months of painstaking effort and dedication resulted in a veritable one-off hypercar able to embarrass anything on the road and wow anyone behind the steering wheel.As stated above the base platform for the 7X Rayo was the LP 610-4 variant of the Lambo Huracan powered by the famous 5.2-liter naturally aspirated Audi/Lamborghini V10 engine. Offering a generous output of 610 hp and 413 lb-ft (560 Nm) of torque it targets all four wheels through a highly efficient four-wheel-drive system and a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. From a standstill a stock Huracan can reach 62 mph (100 kph) in just 2.5 seconds and will keep on going until reaching its 212 mph (341 kph) top speed. Not a bad place to start from.Of course the exterior appearance is the main highlight of the unique 7X Rayo. The design language unequivocally resembles the Lamborghini star model of the '70 the Miura featuring curvaceous and flowing lines a protruding nose and splitter and the all-too-famous eyelashes that help guide the airflow over the headlights. The body has been completely reworked using carbon fiber and keeping only a few remains from the original Huracan such as the windows headlights taillights and mirrors. Otherwise every other body panel has been recreated from scratch using 7X Design's custom coachbuilding techniques.The firm worked closely alongside Envisage Group in Coventry. Besides giving birth to an alluring automobile they also improved the aerodynamic performance of the vehicle. From a 0.39 drag-coefficient value as seen on a stock Huracan  they obtained a much lower ratio of just 0.279 in Rayo's case. The main goal of this collaboration was to design Rayo's body paneling in such a way that would not interfere with Huracan's structural chassis integrity.Although the front fascia is still reminiscent of a Lamborghini albeit the modern Huracan or the classic Miura the rear of the Rayo is completely bespoke holding little to no resemblance to the donor machine. For starters it features a meshed grille that surrounds the taillights and sits above a massive diffuser. Laterally two generous round exhaust tailpipes make their way through the rear bumper and glorify the ten-cylinder orchestra on every tap of the throttle.Speaking of the engine the Rayo got a significant power upgrade boasting more than three times the power versus the donor Lambo. Yes that's right. Do the math and realize that the Rayo produces more than 1800 hp! Allegedly the exact number sits around the 1875 hp mark but it could very well reach the 2000 hp threshold.How were these mind-boggling numbers even possible? Well 7X Design turned to Underground Racing  an established American tuning company specialized in working with Lamborghini V10 and V12 powerplants. They fitted the Rayo with two mid-mounted turbochargers and alongside much more undisclosed mechanical wizardry that resulted in a rocket on wheels that could reach a declared top speed of 300 mph (482 kph). Speaking of the wheels the Rayo sits on HRE alloys because of the brand's official ratings for speeds exceeding 260 mph.The cost of this distinguished endeavor has not been disclosed but we can safely assume that this kind of commission can dig very deep in one's pockets. Regarding this matter 7X Design specifies on their website that ""a complete project can be done for €12 million plus the cost of the donor vehicle"" and that ""considerably complex and detailed builds can cost more."" In other words bespoke coachbuilding is the game of a large number but when passionate and knowledgeable characters come together the results can be fantastic.A veritable hypercar a machine that is built upon an already excellent base platform while taking cues from the all-time classics the 7X Rayo is a modern coachbuilding masterpiece that proves that this traditional art of craftsmanship must be kept alive."

LOUISVILLE Ky. — The Belknap companies had deep roots in Louisville offering everything from hammers to guns and bikes to bells.

The 9-story warehouse in downtown Louisville was also home to a system of underground tunnels connecting their buildings.

Increase competition caused its downfall and eventually and the late David Jones of Humana purchased it. He wanted to clear it out for a tree-lined plaza that would connect to the Waterfront.

The building would later be considered for implosion.

Once word of the Belknap building’s implosion began to spread a new opportunity popped up.

MTV and Warner Brothers decided the implosion would be a perfect opportunity to promote their new movie Demolition Man starring Sylvester Stallone Wesley Snipes and Sandra Bullock.

A special “blow up party” was held and Warner Brothers added even more fire rigging up extra explosives and providing complimentary hardhats to commemorate the event.

A large “Countdown to Demolition” banner hung from the historic building as stars were flown into Louisville and people purchased tickets to participate.

Then it was time. Everyone turned their attention to the Waterfront warehouse. Within seconds the building goes down following a series of booms.

WHAS11 News asked the stars what they thought after the implosion.

“It was heavy man – you know I saw the other on like when we did it in the movie. That’s always a very spectacular event” Snipes said.

Stallone added “Very uplifting. Very uplifting.”

After the blast it wasn’t over for everyone. For many it was an opportunity for souvenirs. Fans who were lucky grabbed bricks from the site.

Once security closed off the area the beloved bricks were off limits.

The coveted Belknap bricks became a reminder of the historic building’s star-studded end.

The site of the implosion now houses Humana's Waterside Building -- a completely renovated and partially re-built space that has offices a conference center gym and restaurant.

Sinwell former IBM branch manager who spearheaded relocating the company's offices to the Inner Harbor dies,"John W. Sinwell the former IBM Baltimore branch manager and senior location executive who spearheaded the move of the company’s St. Paul Street offices to the Inner Harbor in the 1970s died Sept. 25 at Lankenau Medical Center in Wynnewood Pennsylvania after being injured in an automobile accident. The former Roland Park and Ruxton resident was 85.

“I’ve always described John as a Renaissance man but not quite Thomas Aquinas” said Samuel J. “Sam” Palmisano former chair and CEO of IBM with a laugh. “He was very smart a mentor and a great tennis player who was totally well-rounded and devoted to his family.”

Mr. Palmisano said he was hired at IBM by Mr. Sinwell and Hoyle Miller Jr. after he graduated from the Johns Hopkins University in 1973.

“You needed a lot of coaching and they were great teachers when you’re a young person in such a large company” Mr. Palmisano said. “They gave you feedback would reach out and help coach you.”

Patricia J. Mitchell who retired from IBM where she was vice president of global sales operations remained a close friend.

“John W. Sinwell was an icon in IBM. He chose to stay in Baltimore for his family even though he could have risen through the IBM corporate ranks nationally” Ms. Mitchell wrote in an email. “He was instrumental in the IBM building at 100 East Pratt Street as the anchor for the renaissance of the Inner Harbor.”

John William Sinwell son of Paul Sinwell a Baugh Chemical Co. manager and Sarah Sinwell a homemaker was born in Fort Dodge Iowa and later moved to Baltimore with his family.

After graduating in 1953 from McDonogh School he entered Washington and Lee University where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and in 1957 earned his bachelor’s degree. In 1960 he obtained his master’s degree in business administration from the University of Virginia Darden School of Business where he was inducted into the Raven Society and Omicron Delta Kappa.

Mr. Sinwell went to work in 1960 in IBM’s Baltimore office in sales and later moved to the company’s offices in Richmond Virginia and Cleveland before returning to the city. From 1968 until his retirement in 1989 he was branch manager and senior location executive.

“John was a district manager in Cleveland when his then-wife wanted to move back to Baltimore” recalled Mr. Palmisano who stepped down as CEO in 2001 and retired in 2012. “And it proved to be the perfect choice for his family and the right thing for him to do. It was a trade-off.”

It was during his tenure as branch manager that Mr. Sinwell began lobbying IBM to move its Baltimore office from St. Paul Street to the Inner Harbor.

IBM purchased the two-acre site from the city that is bounded by Pratt Calvert Light and Lombard streets for $1.42 million where it planned to erect a 10-story building with the first floor devoted to retail space while the upper floors were offices.

Construction on 100 East Pratt St. designed by famed architect Dr. Pietro Belluschi and Emory Roth & Sons rose on the site in 1973. IBM and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. were the earliest tenants when the building was completed in 1975 which was then owned by the IBM Real Estate Division.

“He helped to lead the further investment in the site and commercial success of downtown with IBM’s construction of the 28-floor tower behind the original building” wrote Marion Sinwell “Missy” Smith of Wiltondale in a biographical profile of her father. “When 100 East was sold to Boston Properties in 1997 for $137 million it set a record for the sale of a single Baltimore office building.”

During his years with the company Mr. Sinwell came to be viewed as an astute leader and a mentor to many of its employees. After taking an early retirement from the company in 1989 ? he had moved to Rosemont Pennsylvania in 1986 — he taught for two years at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania while consulting with corporate and nonprofit clients.

In 1986 Mr. Sinwell married the former Suzanne Gerard and after her death in 2010 he moved to Waverly Heights a Gladwyne Pennsylvania retirement community.

A lifelong tennis enthusiast Mr. Sinwell had been a member of the Junior Davis Cup team when he was in college and “acting ball-boy for storied players including Wimbledon champions” his daughter wrote.

He was a former member of the Baltimore Country Club where he played tennis and also at the Merion Cricket Club in Philadelphia and at the Hillsboro Club in Hillsboro Beach Florida. In order to keep his connection to the University of Virginia green he was a member of the Farmington Club in Charlottesville Virginia.

Mr. Sinwell helped seed the Frederick S. Morton Fund that recognized “both young leaders in their second year of the MBA program at the University of Virginia and allow them to select the faculty member who most inspired them” his daughter wrote.

He also enjoyed spending time with his family and grandchildren which gave him an “opportunity to dispense his wit and wisdom to the next generation” Ms. Smith wrote.

A private celebration-of-life gathering will be held in Philadelphia and a memorial service will held at noon Oct. 29 in the old chapel of the Episcopal Church of the Redeemer 5603 N. Charles St. where he had been a communicant.

In addition to his daughter Mr. Sinwell is survived by his son Andrew B. Sinwell of Dallas; two stepsons Caldwell Hart of Sharon Connecticut and Chris Hart of Wayne Pennsylvania; a sister Ann Gabor of Chapel Hill North Carolina; and 13 grandchildren.

In addition Intel has released Lava a software framework to build neuromorphic apps both on conventional and neuromorphic hardware.

Our second-generation chip greatly improves the speed programmability and capacity of neuromorphic processing broadening its usages in power and latency constrained intelligent computing applications.

The idea behind neuromorphic computing is using a processor modeled after the brain with neurons and synapses to carry through computing tasks.

Introduced three years ago Loihi 2's predecessor has been used by some 250 researchers to build solutions to control drones or robot arms optimize train schedules search databases and to learn to identify different odors.

Loihi 2 attempts to circumvent a number of limitations of the original architecture including its reduced flexibility limited numerical precision and congestion between interconnected Loihi chips among others. This required to redesign some of circuits of the processor which ended up including 1 million neurons up from 125000 in half the size using Intel 4 process previously known as Intel 7nm.

Among the improvements in Loihi 2 it is worth to mention increased precision thanks to spike signals that carry both timing and magnitude parameters; enhanced programmability with support for arithmetic comparison program control flow and more which expands the set of spiking neural network (SNN) models that can be trained. Loihi 2 also improves its learning capabilities and speed.

Alongside Loihi 2 Intel has also released Lava an open source software framework that aims to make it easier to build neuromorphic applications by providing a set of building blocks. What makes neuromorphic programs different from traditional ones is they are strictly event-based and asynchronous which makes them more time-dependent.

Lava applications allow neuromorphic platforms to intelligently process learn from and respond to real-world data with great gains in energy efficiency and speed compared to conventional computer architectures.

Lava maps to heterogeneous hardware including non-neuromorphic platforms. The latter is a great feature for anyone wishing to experiment with neuromorphic programming on conventional CPUs/GPUs.

Inspired by Communicating Sequential Process (CSP) the basic building blocks in a Lava program are processes which encapsulate state and behaviour. Lava's standard library provides a number of higher-level processes that implement various kinds of neuron models neural network connection topologies IO processes and so on. Processed are then combined and used in algorithms such as optimization deep learning and more.

You can find a short tutorial on installing and using Lava on Lava's GitHub repo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzE3L2ludGVsLWNlby1nZWxzaW5nZXItYXBwbGUtY2hpcHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel CEO wants to compete against Apple,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2021/10/17/intel-ceo-gelsinger-apple-chips on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzE3L2ludGVsLWNlby1nZWxzaW5nZXItYXBwbGUtY2hpcHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9pbnRlbC1jZW8tcGF0LWdlbHNpbmdlci1ob3Blcy10by13aW4tYmFjay1hcHBsZS1ieS1vdXRjb21wZXRpbmctaXQtMTE2MzQ1MTUzNDPSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2ludGVsLWNlby1wYXQtZ2Vsc2luZ2VyLWhvcGVzLXRvLXdpbi1iYWNrLWFwcGxlLWJ5LW91dGNvbXBldGluZy1pdC0xMTYzNDUxNTM0Mw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger hopes to win back Apple by outcompeting it,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-hopes-to-win-back-apple-by-outcompeting-it-11634515343 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9pbnRlbC1jZW8tcGF0LWdlbHNpbmdlci1ob3Blcy10by13aW4tYmFjay1hcHBsZS1ieS1vdXRjb21wZXRpbmctaXQtMTE2MzQ1MTUzNDPSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2ludGVsLWNlby1wYXQtZ2Vsc2luZ2VyLWhvcGVzLXRvLXdpbi1iYWNrLWFwcGxlLWJ5LW91dGNvbXBldGluZy1pdC0xMTYzNDUxNTM0Mw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9zYXBwaGlyZS1yYXBpZHMtd2l0aC1oYm0tcGljdHVyZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Shows Off Multi-Chiplet Sapphire Rapids CPU with HBM,"Intel formally confirmed that select 4th Generation Xeon Scalable 'Sapphire Rapids' processors will feature on-package HBM memory late last year but the company has never demonstrated an actual CPU equipped with HBM or revealed its DRAM configuration. At the International Symposium on Microelectronics hosted by IMAPS earlier this week the company finally showcased the processor with HBM and confirmed its multi-chiplet design.

While Intel confirmed on numerous occasions that Sapphire Rapids processors will support HBM (presumably HBM2E) and DDR5 memory and will be able to use HBM either with or without main DDR5 memory it never showcased an actual HBM-equipped CPU until this week (thanks to the picture published by Tom Wassick/@wassickt).

As it turns out each of four Sapphire Rapids chiplets has two HBM memory stacks that use two 1024-bit interfaces (i.e. a 2048-bit memory bus). Formally JEDEC’s HBM2E specification tops at a 3.2 GT/s data transfer rate but last year SK Hynix started to mass-produce 16GB 1024-pin known-good stacked dies (KGSDs) rated for a 3.6 GT/s operation.

If Intel opts to use such KGSDs HBM2E memory will provide Sapphire Rapids CPU a whopping 3.68 TB/s peak memory bandwidth (or 921.6 GB/s per die) but only for 128GB of memory. By contrast SPR's eight DDR5-4800 memory channels supporting one module per channel and offering 307.2 GB/s will support at least 4TB of memory using Samsung's recently announced 512GB DDR5 RDIMM modules.

It is also noteworthy the HBM-equipped Sapphire Rapids comes in a large BGA form-factor and will be soldered directly to the motherboard. This is not particularly surprising as Intel's LGA4677 form-factor is pretty narrow and the CPU does not have enough space on its package for HBM stacks.

Furthermore processors that require a very high-performance memory subsystem like HBM tend to feature loads of cores that work at high clocks and feature a very high TDP. Keeping in mind that HBM stacks are also power-hungry it may not be easy to develop a socket that would feed an HBM-equipped beast. Therefore it looks like HBM-equipped SPRs will only be offered to select clients (just like Intel's Xeon Scalable 9200 CPUs with up to 56 cores) and will mostly be aimed at supercomputers.

Another thing to note is that the shape of the SPR chiplets on the image are rectangular rather than square (as on early images of Sapphire Rapids in LGA4677 packaging). The author of the image said that it comes from an Intel chart ""given by an Intel employee and labeled SPR and verbally noted as Sapphire Rapids."" That said it looks like HBM-supporting Sapphire Rapids CPU might have a different chiplet configuration than regular SPR processors (at the end of the day regular Xeon Scalable CPUs do not need an HBM interface that takes die space).

Intel's Sapphire Rapids processors will feature a host of new technologies including PCIe Gen 5 support with CXL 1.1 protocol for accelerators on top a hybrid memory subsystem supporting DDR5 and HBM Intel’s Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) as well as AVX512_BF16 and AVX512_VP2INTERSECT instructions designed for datacenter and supercomputer workloads and Intel's Data Streaming Accelerator (DSA) technology just to name a few.

Earlier this year we learned that Intel's Sapphire Rapids uses a a multi-chip package with EMIB interconnects between the die unlike its predecessors that are monolithic. While the number of cores is something that depends on yield and power (some reports indicate that SPR will feature up to 56 active cores but the actual chiplets may carry as many as 80 cores) it is evident that the 4th Generation Xeon Scalable will be the first to use Intel's latest packaging technologies and design paradigm.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL21hcmtldHMuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0b2Nrcy90aGlzLWNoaXAtdGVzdGluZy1jb21wYW55LWhhcy1nZW5lcmF0ZWQtYmV0dGVyLW9uZS15ZWFyLXJldHVybnMtdGhhbi1pbnRlbC1hbWQtbnZpZGlhLWFuZC10ZXJhZHluZS0xMDMwODcwNzU10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Chip-Testing Company Has Generated Better One-Year Returns Than Intel AMD Nvidia And Teradyne,"The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) has advanced about 34% over the past year outperforming the Nasdaq Composite Index which clocked in gains of about 23% for the same period.

Semiconductor companies were among the beneficiaries of the COVID-19 pandemic. The work-from-home and study-from-home trends necessitated computers accessories gadgets and phones which are powered by chips.

The semiconductor shortage that ensued also worked in the industry's favor.

SEC had considered an application from Proshares for Bitcoin Strategy ETF

If SEC approves the application It will be the first time any crypto assets are listed on New York Stock Exchange

The ETF is expected to launch on Oct 18 under the ticker $BITO.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission accepted the registration from Proshares for Bitcoin Strategy ETF to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange’s Arca. This is another milestone for the crypto-based platform in the United States.

Yet there is no formal approval given by the SEC at the time of writing. But the Proshares announcement seems like an agency is not in the mood to block the listing at this point.

SEC publicized a notice on Oct. 16 the authority has raised the greenlight for the registration of Securities from Proshares Trust’s Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund. This will give exposure to the crypto asset with future contracts. Note that it will not boost the spot market.

Moreover Proshares filed a post-effective amendment prospectus in which it stated the expected launch of the ETF could be on Oct 18 under the ticker $BITO.

“It’s an encouraging sign for the future of crypto to see SEC Chairman Gensler get comfortable in helping mainstream investors more easily access bitcoin exposure” ETFStore President Nate Geraci said. “The availability of a bitcoin ETF will now bring more investors under the crypto tent and facilitate greater education across the space.”

If the SEC approves the application from Proshares then it will be listed on the Newyork Stock Exchange market Arca. An analyst from news giant Bloomberg James Seyffart posted the tweet in which he stated that the Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF would be listed with the ticker symbol BITO with 95 Basis points.

As per the current scenario SEC could only approve futures ETFs this year as SEC chairman Gary Gensler gave a sign in the comment that he will not allow a spot market ETF to launch in near future. The SEC has always cited market manipulation as a reason to reject the ETFs.

Several other companies including Invesco and Valkyrie also applied to launch similar ETFs. These applications can also follow ProShares in the weeks ahead.",,,

Belson is the founder of numerous successful medical device companies such as Neoguide Systems (acquired by Intuitive Surgical in 2009) Vascular Pathways (acquired by CR Bard in 2014) Zipline Medical (acquired by Stryker in 2019) Qool Therapeutics Radiaction Medical and Emboline. He also serves as an independent board member at a number of prominent Israeli companies such as GI View and Ceretrieve.

GIBF is a Chinese medical investment fund established in 2016 in partnership with the Government of Guangzhou the capital of Southern China. The first fund which is valued at about $100 million has so far made 12 investments in Israeli medical device and digital health companies.

GIBF recently announced it was closing its second fund which was planned to amount to about $300 million and will focus on Western pharmaceutical companies that develop innovative drugs in phase 2-3 of clinical trials.

As part of the collaboration announced Sunday GIBF invested in two of Belson’s new companies: $4 million in Modular Surgical which develops innovative endoscopic tools including for robotic surgeries; and $3.5 million in Follisave which develops a novel solution for preventing hair-loss in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy especially women with breast cancer.

“My activity has focused so far mainly on the American market. However for many years I was looking for the right pathway to operate also in China which is the fastest growing medical device market worldwide” Belson said.

“When I met with GIBF people I realized this is the best model currently available for foreign medical device companies to remove concerns regarding their IP protection while building their own value in the huge Chinese market and not giving it away early in the process in favor of a local partner.”

Noy who will serve as a board member on behalf of GIBF in the two companies added: “We are proud of the collaboration with an entrepreneur on the scale of Dr. Belson that illustrates the power of our investment model. The Covid-19 pandemic not only did not stop us but actually highlighted the fact that our set-up is one of the only ones currently capable of executing cross-border transactions in China.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pb2wuY28uemEvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9tZWV0LWRhLXZpbmNpLXhpLXRoZS1uZXctcm9ib3QtZG9jdG9yLWF0LWdyb290ZS1zY2h1dXItaG9zcGl0YWwtYjdkY2I4YzYtMjExOS00MDYyLTg4YjktNWUxZjI4MTRmY2Mx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet da Vinci Xi the new robot doctor at Groote Schuur Hospital,"The granddaddy of the surgical robots has now entered the doors of the public sector in Africa with Groote Schuur becoming the first public sector hospital to use a robot to perform surgeries. The da Vinci Xi is the fourth generation of the da Vinci and is designed as a minimally invasive approach to large-incision abdominal surgeries. The robot is designed by Intuitive Surgical an American corporation that has been leading in developing robotic systems for health.

Intuitive Surgical says the robot has been optimised for complex multi-quadrant surgeries. The hospital will become the first public hospital to perform robotic surgery as it launched the Da Vinci Xi fourth generation robot on Wednesday to be used in theatres. The Xi is designed for an improved user (surgeon) experience and ease of use. New features include: A new overhead instrument arm architecture designed to facilitate anatomical access from virtually any position. A new endoscope digital architecture that creates a simpler more compact design with improved visual definition and clarity.

An ability to attach the endoscope to any arm providing flexibility for visualising the surgical site. Smaller thinner arms with newly designed joints that offers a greater range of motion than ever before. Longer instrument shafts are designed to give surgeons greater operative reach. The Xi is also compatible with Intuitive's Firefly Fluorescence Imaging System which uses near infra-red imaging along with standard endoscopic light to enable surgeons to perform minimally-invasive surgery as well as visual assessments of vessels blood flow and tissue perfusion. The robot forms an important step towards taking South Africa’s hospitals into the 4th industrial revolution. This process will bring health innovation and complications. The SA health sector will also have to prepare for challenges associated with using robots in hospitals.",,,,,,,,,

Benishek has died at 69,"Former U.S. Rep. Dan Benishek a surgeon who represented northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula in Congress for three terms died Friday at age 69 his family said.

Benishek a Republican from Crystal Falls championed military veterans and conservation issues while in office from 2011-17 targeting the Department of Veterans Affairs spending he considered wasteful and policies that were frustrating veterans.

His sudden death was apparently heart related according to former staffer Michelle Lane.

Benishek is survived by his wife Judy; five children and five grandchildren.

“We are heartbroken by the sudden loss of a loyal friend a loving husband a dedicated grandfather and a tireless advocate for Northern Michigan"" his family said in a statement.

""As a doctor and surgeon Dan saved countless lives in our community. His work in Congress made a difference for veterans across the country and protected Michigan’s natural wonders for years to come. He will always be remembered by his family and friends as a strong leader a caring healer and an unwavering patriot.”

Benishek served on the Agriculture Natural Resources and Veterans Affairs committees. He worked part-time at the Iron Mountain VA Medical Center for 20 years as a surgeon and was the father of a daughter who is a veteran.

“Dr. Dan as we all knew him was about as solid and respected as a colleague could be"" said U.S. Rep. Fred Upton of St. Joseph the delegation's senior Republican.

""He had the same good doctor-patient relationship as he did with his many constituents. Always a strong voice for Michigan — especially the U.P.”

Rep. Bill Huizenga R-Holland described Benishek as ""a cheerful advocate who fought with passion for common sense U.P. values.

""I am proud to call him a friend and he will be deeply missed"" Huizenga added.

Benishek was born in Iron River on April 20 1952. He and his brother were raised by their mother after their father died in a mining accident when Benishek was 5 years old. His mother worked at his grandmother's hotel and bar the Iron River Hotel and the brothers grew up helping out at the establishment for $10 a week — making beds mopping floors and carrying beer after school — until Benishek turned 18.

He left for the University of Michigan with $2000 and his drive to the campus in Ann Arbor was his first time to Michigan's Lower Peninsula. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1974 and earned his medical degree from Wayne State University Medical School in Detroit in 1978. He then returned to the U.P.

""It was a privilege to serve with Dan who was always happiest when he was in his beloved Upper Peninsula"" said former U.S. Rep. Candice Miller who now serves as Macomb County Public Works Commissioner.

""Prayers to his family. RIP great Yooper Patriot.""

Benishek ran for Congress after being outraged by the $800 billion stimulus bill passed by Congress in 2009.

The physician went from an unknown political novice to doing hits on Sean Hannity's show on Fox News within a short window.

He was especially critical of the federal health care legislation the Affordable Care Act that his predecessor Democratic Rep. Bart Stupak of Menominee played a role in passing.

Benishek won election to Congress with the help of tea party enthusiasts. He upset state Sen. Jason Allen by 15 votes out of 100000 cast in the 2010 GOP primary. Two years later he won over Democratic challenger Gary McDowell by fewer than 2300 votes.

When he first ran for office in 2010 Benishek endorsed term limits and pledged to serve just three terms in the U.S. House. He later announced he'd pursue a fourth citing his ""ability to serve millions of veterans every day as a leader on veterans’ issues in the House.""

""My training as a physician taught me to never walk away from a patient and I can’t start now"" he wrote in The Detroit News in 2015.

""My focus has been on helping to provide an environment that will get government out of the way of job creators and allow our economy to grow. We’ve worked to bring businesses educators and the community together to improve and expand vocational education opportunities for individuals so they can gain the skills needed to secure good paying jobs.""

He later reversed himself amid criticism from Democrats deciding not to run in 2016.

Benishek in Congress worked with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand D-N.Y. on her fight to reform the prosecution of sexual assault in the military. He also helped enact legislation to designate the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore as protected wilderness his family said.

His final years were spent with his family and enjoying his camp in Ottawa National Forest they said.

Benishek was succeeded by U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman R-Watersmeet in 2017.

Bergman said Saturday he was “deeply saddened to learn of the untimely passing of Congressman ""Dr. Dan Benishek.

“Dr. Dan was passionate in his love for the Upper Peninsula a respected physician and served Michigan with sincerity and honor” Bergman said in a statement.

“While there will be much more to say about his life and legacy in the days ahead — Judy the Benishek family and all of Team Benishek will be in our prayers during this time of grief.”

Before his political reign Benishek graduated from Wayne State University School of Medicine and worked as a surgeon for two decades at the Iron Mountain VA Medical Center.

From 2011 to 2017 Benishek served on the agriculture natural resources and veterans' affairs committees in his three terms. He also introduced a bill to designate 32500 acres of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore as protected wilderness lands which passed in 2014.

“Former Michigan Congressman Dan Benishek was a man who cared about his community state and country. He was a cheerful advocate who fought with passion for common sense UP values” U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga a fellow Michigan Republican wrote on Facebook Sunday. “I am proud to call Dr. Dan a friend & he will be deeply missed.”

Missouri state Rep. Phil Christofanelli who previously served as Benishek’s press secretary wrote in a Facebook post “I will miss our early mornings together calling into obscure radio stations and rehearsing answers to the political questions of the day. He was a good man a loyal friend and a great American. Our country was lucky to have him in Washington and I was lucky to call him 'Boss.' Rest easy Congressman.”

Macomb County public works commissioner and former U.S. Rep. Candice S. Miller wrote in a statement “It was a privilege to serve with Dan who was always happiest when he was in his beloved Upper Peninsula. Prayers to his family. RIP great Yooper Patriot.”

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer wrote in a statement Saturday ""Today Yoopers and Michiganders lost a fighter.

""Congressman Benishek represented the spirit of 'Sisu' during his time in office. In Congress he championed our men and women in uniform advocated fiercely for veterans and worked to protect Sleeping Bear Dunes. As a physician and an elected official Dan put people first. My thoughts are with his wife children and grandchildren.”

She said that U.S. and Michigan flags would be lowered in his honor.

Benishek's funeral service will be held 1 p.m. Saturday at St. Mary & St. Joseph Catholic Church in Iron Mountain. Flowers may be donated in his name to the U.P. Honor Flight.

Benishek is survived by his wife Judy five children and five grandchildren.

This is a departure from Beijing’s cardinal foreign policy dictate of non-interference in other countries’ domestic affairs.

China has a big stake in the country. Guinea is China’s biggest supplier of bauxite a key raw material for the aluminium industry. But perhaps more importantly Guinea is home to the world’s largest untapped iron ore deposit Simandou.

With an estimated 2.4 billion tons of high-grade iron ore reserves Simandou is widely seen as China’s best hope of reducing dependency on Australia which is by far the largest supplier of iron ore to the country. Beijing’s relationship with Canberra has sunk to new lows during the last two years over a range of bitter disputes from the South China Sea to the decision to exclude Huawei from Australia’s 5G network.

Guinea was mentioned as an option for China to develop a large-scale iron ore mine in its five-year plan for the steel industry released by the Ministry of Information Technology and Industry in early 2021. It is a key piece in China’s strategy of achieving a higher degree of resource security.

Two Chinese companies already have strategic stakes in the Simandou project — the state-owned Chinaclo and the privately controlled Weiqiao. In 2020 China’s largest steelmaker Baowu Steel Group was reportedly exploring the possibility of establishing a US$6 billion consortium to develop Simandou in partnership with other steelmakers engineering companies and sovereign wealth funds.

The ouster of Alpha Condo could derail Beijing’s ambition to reduce its dependency on Australia for iron ore highlighting one of Simandou’s biggest risk factors: political instability in a country ravaged by civil war and tribal conflicts.

China is cognisant of political risk and is not afraid of airing it publicly. China Geological Survey published a report in 2020 highlighting the Guinea government’s lack of respect for contractual arrangements political instability and rising African resource nationalism.

The report is critical of industrial relations in the country and cites increasingly frequent strikes as a ‘negative’ for investment. It concludes by saying that while the Simandou project’s advantages are clear the risks are also significant including huge investment outlay a long investment cycle and uncertainty. Chinese firms have acquired mining rights but there is significant uncertainty about the profitability of the project. The report notes ‘Chinese companies will face significant challenges during implementation and operation stages of this project’.

The Chinese government’s geology services further warn about the Guinean government’s desire to extract as much as US$15.5 billion in tax. A non-Chinese mining executive who was heavily involved in the early development of the Simandou project noted: ‘the biggest [issue] is that Simandou is a national crown jewel and in any country … resources of that scale come with very big political strings … this is far bigger than anything they’ve ever had to deal with before’.

Australian miner and Chinalco’s partner in the project Rio Tinto understood the risk too well as the victim of Guinea’s past expropriations after winning the exclusive development rights in 1997. Today Rio Tinto’s share in the Simandou project has been whittled down to 44.05 per cent.

In Simandou Beijing faces a huge dilemma. It is a significant opportunity to reduce its dependency on a supplier that it no longer trusts. But geography price fluctuations and political instability also present significant risks.

Despite Beijing’s established ties in Africa its large cheque book and ability to deliver massive infrastructure projects quickly there are things even the Chinese Communist Party find beyond their control.

Annually the Black Mountain Express welcomes hikers from mid-June to late September. Located in the White River National Forest the area is full of dramatic views from a series of enchanting alpine meadows. Before your visit please note that bikes and pets are currently not permitted to ride the lifts in the Arapahoe Basin Ski Area.

A ticket is required to ride the chairlift unless you are a season pass holder in which case it’s free. After the ride up to mid-mountain many visitors enjoy the Half Moon Vista Trail which offers an easy and scenic walk about the area. Hikers looking for a bit more of a workout can also enjoy the steep ​​Argentine North Fork Trail which features many seasonal wildflowers.

Aspen – Snowmass

Pitkin County’s internationally famous Aspen-Snowmass is a great Colorado destination for chairlift-assisted hiking. Catering to families and hardcore-hikers alike scenic views and mountain air await travelers on Snowmass’s Elk Camp Gondola and chairlift Aspen’s Silver Queen Gondola and Buttermilk’s Summit Express.

Beaver Creek Resort

Just outside Avon Beaver Creek Resort continues to run its Centennial Express Lift for scenic summer chairlift and gondola rides. At the top of the lift guests arrive at Spruce Saddle which offers food drinks games and restrooms and provides access to a network of hiking trails.

Like in ski season Beaver Creek Resort offers summer trails of varying difficulty to satisfy guests of all ages and ability levels. For an easy walk with incredible views both the Discovery and Spruce Saddle Loops are great mid-mountain hikes. Avid hikers can take the moderately difficult Overlook or Royal Elk trails to the base or ascend even higher on the challenging PHQ Hill Climb.

Breckenridge Ski Resort

For another free ride on the other side of the Rocky Mountains the Breckenridge Ski Resort also offers cost-free trips all summer long on the BreckConnect Gondola. Leaving from the North Gondola Parking Lot BreckConnect lifts visitors over the Cucumber Gulch Wildlife Reserve and onto the resort for easy access to hiking trails.

From the resort hikers can choose to head uphill on two feet or purchase a ticket to climb even higher via the Colorado SuperChair. On top of the mountain guests can enjoy the water restrooms food and unforgettable views of the White River National Forest at the aptly named Vista House.

For the best Breckenridge hiking experience we recommend taking the Horseshoe Bowl hiking loop for a bike-free stroll near the treeline. The BreckConnect Gondola operates year-round and the SuperChair is typically open to foot traffic through the end of September.

Copper Mountain

On the other side of the Ten Mile Range Copper Mountain is another great ski resort with summer chairlift access to breathtaking hiking trails. From the base of the mountain Copper visitors can take either the American Eagle or Woodward Express lift to instantly access a network of easy and intermediate trails.

With all of the mountain roads open to foot travel hikers have many options to customize their route around picnic sites overlooks and personal preferences. For a purely downhill hike with chairlift access many visitors enjoy Chickaree Way which eventually merges with the Colorado Trail.

Crested Butte Ski Resort

In the Elk Mountains of Gunnison County Crested Butte Ski Resort keeps the mountain open each summer for visitors to enjoy chairlift-assisted hiking. By taking the Silver Queen Lift from the base area to 11400 feet above sea level visitors can sit back and enjoy the expansive Gunnison National Forest views.

From the top of the lift there are opportunities to hike to a picnic shelter overlook or the summit of Mt. Crested Butte. For those interested in a full day or overnight journey Crested Butte’s hiking trails also connect to the famous Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness Area.

Granby Ranch

Ninty miles from Denver the scenic Granby Ranch is a low-key ski resort that maintains summer lift operations for hiking and mountain biking. Encompassing 500 acres of varied terrain it is very easy to find a hike to fit any skill level and timeframe.

During the summer the chairlifts typically operate from Wednesday to Sunday and are completely free to ride. From the top visitors will find several family-friendly routes for hiking back down to the base area.

Keystone Resort

Just down the road from Arapahoe Basin Keystone Resort welcomes summer hikers with a wide variety of choices for post-adventure meals or accommodations. Taking the River Run Gondola guests can quickly ascend from the base of the mountain to Summit House Food Court on Dercum Mountain.

Here the 2.3-mile Dercum Summit Hiking Trail offers incredible views of the area while only climbing roughly 180 feet. The trail is rated as easy traverses the Mozart Ski Run and includes an overlook deck. On the loop clockwise travel is recommended bearing left at the junction.

Annually Keystone Resort offers chairlift-assisted hiking experiences from June through September. ATV rentals tours and other activities may also be available at the top of the lift. Late in the season gondola service may only be available Friday through Sunday with additional trails and activities such as golf and tennis located at the base of the mountain.

Powderhorn Resort

Atop Grand Mesa Powderhorn Mountain Resort offers one of the most secluded chairlift rides in the state. From the base guests will ride the Flat Top Flyer lift over the trees to a scenic view with picnic tables and restrooms on top of the world’s largest flattop mountain.

From here there are several ways to return to the main resort area via easy intermediate and difficult hiking routes. There are several other picnic areas along the way and the small resort is working to create additional hiking trails in the near future.

Purgatory Resort

Outside of Durango Purgatory Resort is a great place to hike in the San Juan Mountains with an extra boost from the summer lifts. Before a visit hikers should familiarize themselves with the area and be sure to steer clear of mountain biking only trails.

From the top of Lift 4 hikers have an excellent opportunity for small or large loops on the backside of the mountain. To reach the base without getting back on the lift hikers can take the World Champs XC trail which may be difficult for visitors with mobility challenges.

Steamboat Resort

In the Park Range of the Rockies Steamboat Ski Resort stays open each summer to offer visitors scenic lift rides and ample hiking options. Located in the beautiful Routt National Forest guests can sit back and enjoy the ride on the gondola or Christie Peak Express and find easy intermediate and difficult hiking trails.

Steamboat’s summer lifts typically operate from Memorial Day to Labor Day with restrooms and multiple food options located mid-mountain at the Thunderhead Lodge. Visitors looking for a quick hike will enjoy the Vista Nature Trail while serious hikers and backpackers are welcome to extend their trip over the Continental Divide.

Telluride & Mountain Village Gondola

Transporting millions of visitors through one of Colorado’s most picturesque box canyons the Telluride & Mountain Village Gondola provides million-dollar views at a zero-dollar ticket price. With most riders starting their journey at the Telluride Station visitors of all kinds can enjoy the scenery trails and wonder of the San Juan Mountains.

Hikers can choose from several small loop trails traverse the terrain on the Village Trail or even ascend to 12000 feet via the See Forever Trail. Restrooms food and water are available near every station and interested tourists are encouraged to visit the St. Sophia Nature center to learn more about the area.

Each year the free gondola service is typically running for hikers to take advantage of from late May to mid-October.

Vail Ski Resort

Vail is the largest ski resort in the state so it should come as no surprise that it is also a great place for chairlift-assisted hiking. Every summer Vail continues to operate both the Gondola One and Eagle Bahn Gondola for visitors of all ages to see expansive Rocky Mountain views from 10000 feet in elevation.

At both Mid-Vail and the Eagle’s Nest hikers can step off the lift and onto easy or moderately difficult trails. Before or after your hike there are also food services restrooms and access to other fun activities within the resort’s full-service facilities.

Winter Park Ski Resort

Although named “Winter” Park the fun does not stop when the snow melts at this year-round Colorado resort. With a scenic gondola ride from Winter Park’s base area visitors can take in the views of the Continental Divide on several established hiking trails. From the end of the lift many hikers choose to travel down the Ute Trail a difficult 2-mile descent back to the resort.

For something a bit easier we recommend a walk along the Lower Roof of the Rockies Trail to Fantasy Meadow.

Other Chairlift Hiking Opportunities Around the State

Aside from its many ski resorts Colorado is also home to a few independently owned seasonal chair lifts for high-elevation hiking. Here are four more places to ride and hike around the state.

Royal Gorge Bridge & Park Gondola – Outside of Cañon City The Royal Gorge Bridge and Park features a gondola hiking trails and many more ways to enjoy the dramatic Arkansas River canyon. One of the best ways to explore the park is by hiking across the bridge and riding the gondola back over the gorge or vice versa.

To reach the park entrance visitors must ride the Glenwood Gondola. From here guests can enjoy the views attractions and services as well as several hikes into the mountain with guided cave tours.

Although many people pride themselves on climbing Colorado’s famous mountain tops on foot lift-assisted hiking is a great way to quickly ascend to panoramic views of some of the state’s most scenic areas.

The Immokalee Road Corridor Congestion Study focused on a two-mile stretch of Immokalee Road between Livingston Road and Logan Boulevard in North Naples.

“The growth projections between now and 2040 that capacity is going to be reaching critical levels” said Bill Gramer a consultant with Jacobs Engineering. “Something is going to have to be done at these intersections.”

The need for the study and improvements along Immokalee Road are obvious as drivers are already experiencing delays along the corridor Gramer said.

Traffic volume is expected to grow by 67% by 2040 along the corridor Gramer told commissioners.

“As you know Immokalee (Road) is a critical east-west network for your overall roadway network” Gramer said. “It also provides the northernmost connection to I-75.”

The study evaluated conventional solutions such as adding or extending travel lanes and non-conventional solutions for improving seven intersections along the corridor. Public safety crash history and design constraints were used to analyze and develop recommendations for improving the intersections Gramer said.

“One of the first things we came up with is adaptive traffic signalization” Gramer said. “What this does is it ties the signals in the corridor together. This way you can adjust traffic in real time as opposed to the signals just being preprogrammed.”

If there is an incident at one of the intersections the adaptive traffic system will adjust traffic signals to help eliminate delays Gramer said.

Commissioners approved the installation of the adaptive traffic system and unanimously voted to accept the study at their Tuesday meeting. Installation of the adaptive traffic system will begin in November.

Commissioners' approval also allowed for modifications to begin on the Immokalee Road westbound right-turn lane and shoulder area to create a right-turn lane for the entire corridor. This portion of the project will be done in phases by 2025.

The study recommends the county pursue construction of an overpass on Livingston Road that will go over Immokalee Road by 2025.

""Conventional intersection improvements are not going to work at this intersection” Gramer said.

The study recommends two other non-conventional solutions at the intersections of Immokalee Road and Interstate 75 and Immokalee Road and Logan Boulevard.

By 2040 the plan recommends construction of a diverging diamond interchange at the intersection of Immokalee Road and I-75. This project would be coordinated with the Florida Department of Transportation and be similar to what was recently approved by commissioners for the I-75 interchange at Pine Ridge Road.

In addition to restriping lanes at the intersection and adding a second westbound on-ramp to I-75 north on Immokalee Road the diverging diamond project would cost $9 million. The Livingston Road overpass project would cost $38 million according to the study.

The third non-conventional solution recommended in the study is the construction of partial displaced left-hand turn lanes at the intersection of Immokalee Road and Logan Boulevard.

“It looks odd but it functions very well” Gramer said. “It's not going to be one of the immediate projects. It will probably be one of the last projects to come online.”

Conventional solutions recommended by the study include adding or extending travel lanes at the intersections of Immokalee Road and Strand Boulevard/Juliet Boulevard Northbrook Drive/Tarpon Bay Boulevard Oakes Boulevard and Valewood Drive.

In total all of the recommendations in the study would cost $82.3 million. Commissioners will have to approve funding allocations for each recommendation in the study through the annual budget process and adoption of the county’s Capital Improvement Plan each year.

""We are recommending continued public involvement and coordination through all the additional phases of design and construction” said Lorraine Lantz a principal planner with the county.

To create the study county staff and Jacobs Engineering reached out to the community online via a survey and virtual public meeting.

“The feedback was pretty good for the overall project” Gramer said. “Most people understand there is a need out there and understand something has to be done.”

Commissioner Burt Saunders said he remembers being at a public meeting in February 2020 where traffic issues on Immokalee Road were discussed by members of the audience.

“We promised the audience we would start a corridor study for Immokalee Road just like we had done with Pine Ridge Road and that fixes were going to be on the way” Saunders said. “These are things that have to be done. This is a project that directly affects three county commission districts but it indirectly affects all of us.

The old-time image of an anarchist that has long been fixed in popular imagination is of a guy with wild hair and a deranged smile holding a circular bomb with a lit fuse. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman looked nothing like that. Photographs of them from more than a century ago show them to be quite proper and well dressed; they could have been any elegant couple decked out for a stroll along Fifth Avenue.

But Berkman and the better-known Goldman onetime lovers born in the Russian Empire were indeed anarchists believing in a society without leaders one rooted in an egalitarian spirit free of the top-down organization that has defined governance for oh only forever. Sure many anarchists were unruly: In their heyday roughly from 1880 to 1920 they went around blowing things up employing the dynamite invented by a Swedish gent Alfred Nobel whose name now graces the world’s most coveted peace prize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1sYnRyYWRlcnVtb3JzLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L25sLWVhc3Qtbm90ZXMtbHV6YXJkby1vcnRpei1qb2huc29uLW5hdGlvbmFscy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NL East Notes: Luzardo Ortiz Johnson Nationals,"Jesus Luzardo was reinstated from the Marlins’ 15-day injured list today with right-hander Eli Villalobos optioned to Triple-A in the corresponding move. Luzardo struggled to a 6.58 ERA over his first five starts and 26 innings before a mild left flexor strain (initially diagnosed as elbow tightness) sent him to the IL so the three-week layoff between starts can hopefully set as a refresh of a tough season to date for the 26-year-old. The returns of Luzardo and Braxton Garrett this weekend will help the injury-riddled Marlins rotation though Edward Cabrera has now also gone down with a shoulder impingement.

Beyond the immediate help that Luzardo will bring to Miami’s pitching staff today’s start figures to reignite the trade rumors that have swirled around the left-hander for months. If Luzardo recaptures his 2021-22 form he would be a very hot commodity at the trade deadline as he is arbitration-controlled through the 2026 season. The Luis Arraez trade has already signaled that the Marlins are in sell mode but while the team pulled the trigger early on that deal Luzardo’s suitors will want to see a larger sample size of healthy and productive starts before moving what would have to be a very substantial trade package to pry him away from Miami.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- Chicago City Council is moving forward with Mayor Brandon Johnson's plan to borrow more than a billion dollars to fund an array of economic programs.

The massive 37-year borrowing plan relies on winding down the city's dependency on the controversial tax-increment financing program also know as TIF. I has has been long been criticized as a patchwork and politically based system for funding construction projects around the city.

When a TIF district expires the tax revenues it holds are released back to the city school system and other local governments that levy property taxes in the area.

Officials say they will let enough special taxing districts expire to generate the money needed to repay the debt. But wary financial analysts TIF experts and even some alderpeople have warned that the city will get access to those recurring revenues only if city officials let the districts expire on schedule - which would be a sharp departure from the city's past practice.

Baker was named president of the Pro Football Hall of Fame located in Canton in January 2014. Before joining the HOF Baker played professional basketball in Europe served as a City Councilman in Irvine California and was the commissioner of the Arena Football League.

With the Pro Football Hall of Fame Baker helped establish the Johnson Controls Hall of Fame Village a nearly $900 million mixed-use development surrounding the Hall of Fame in addition to supporting causes to promote health in former athletes and their families and brining the Black College Hall of Fame to Canton.

Baker said he decided to retire to ""return to his home family and business projects in California and Nevada.""

“As I approach the end of nearly eight years of service to the Pro Football Hall of Fame I have come to the conclusion that it is time for someone else to have the ‘best job in the world’ so I can still do a few more exciting things in my professional life while also returning home to our four children 10 grandchildren and soon-to-be great grandson in Orange County California whom I’ve missed so much during my tenure at ‘The Most Inspiring Place on Earth’ Baker said in a press release.

While Baker will no longer be involved in the day-to-day operations of the Pro Football Hall of Fame he will continue to represent the HOF at upcoming ceremonies for the remainder of the schedule as the retired President and Executive Director including the Pro Football Hall of Fame at Ring of Excellence ceremonies.

Jim Porter the Hall of Fame’s Chief Marketing and Communications Officer since April 2020 has been named President of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He will now will oversee all daily business operations.

Porter 57 is a lifelong resident of Stark County and joined the HOF after spending 33 years in print journalism.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell praised Baker's contributions to the league and to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

“Few people combine vision passion and dedication as completely as David Baker. In seven years as president and CEO of the Pro Football Hall of Fame David expanded the Hall’s brand nationally and footprint locally in Canton Ohio. The growth he envisioned led to the expansion of the Hall of Fame spread to downtown Canton and will continue to have a tremendous impact on the future of the Hall for decades to come"" Goodell said in a press release.

Canton Mayor Thomas Bernabei issued the following statement regarding Baker's retirement announcement:

David Baker came to Canton in January 2014. He brought with him an extraordinary vision for growing the Hall of Fame and creation of the Hall of Fame Village.

His physical stature –6’9’’ and @400 lbs is so recognizable – but his size is over shadowed by his even larger vision.



That vision has been in part implemented: national recognition and growth of the Hall of Fame and construction of Tom Benson Stadium and youth fields. And much more is being implemented and built at the Village today and tomorrow!

His “Knock on the Door” and “Welcome to Canton” to newly selected HOF Gold Jackets has given Canton and the HOF national attention. He has made the words “Canton” and “excellence” synonymous.



He is a personality of national standing in his own right. He is a mesmerizing speaker – no one wants to follow David Baker to the speakers podium. He could be the lead anchor on ESPN or a pre-game NFL show.



I thank him for the 7 years he has given Canton for the vision and leadership he brought to the Hall and for his allegiance to Canton. I wish him all the best -- he has a beautiful wife Colleen a beautiful family and I understand his desire to enjoy them!!

CANTON Ohio — Canton's Pro Football Hall of Fame will be under new leadership.

David Baker who has served as president and executive director of the Pro Football Hall of Fame since January 2014 announced on Saturday that he is retiring from the Hall to return to his home family and business projects in California and Nevada.

Jim Porter who has served as the Hall of Fame’s chief marketing and communications officer since April 2020 has been named president and will oversee all daily business operations.

Baker released the following statement:

""As I approach the end of nearly eight years of service to the Pro Football Hall of Fame I have come to the conclusion that it is time for someone else to have the 'best job in the world' so I can still do a few more exciting things in my professional life while also returning home to our four children 10 grandchildren and soon-to-be great grandson in Orange County California whom I’ve missed so much during my tenure at 'the Most Inspiring Place on Earth.'""

During his tenure Baker oversaw a significant expansion and renovation of the museum and neighboring football stadium (now named after former New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson) which were both part of the larger ""Hall of Fame Village"" project. Rich Desrosiers vice president of communications and ublic relations at the Pro Football Hall of Fame says Baker ""elevated the Hall's profile nationally"" as well as locally.

""We're thankful for that and we want to keep that going"" Desrosiers told 3News.

However construction of the remainder of the village ran into numerous delays and cost concerns leading to criticism of Baker and an eventual leadership shakeup of those who were running the operations. Some have wondered if that played a role in Baker's rather abrupt departure but Desrosiers dismissed such rumors.

""Any of the negative reporting that has been out there on social media in the last 48 hours or so [is] all unsourced all unsubstantiated and throwing things at the wall that just aren't going to stick"" he said adding Baker was considering stepping down in 2020 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic which postponed virtually all of the Hall's festivities until 2021.

Prior to his arrival in Canton Baker served as the Mayor of Irvine California (leaving politics after a conviction for forgery) and later Commissioner of the Arena Football League. The 68-year-old will continue to represent the Pro Football Hall of Fame at Ring of Excellence Ceremonies honoring members of the Centennial Class of 2020 and Class of 2021 at National Football League stadiums for the remainder of the presentation schedule as the retired president and executive director.

Said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell:

""Few people combine vision passion and dedication as completely as David Baker. In seven years as president and CEO of the Pro Football Hall of Fame David expanded the Hall’s brand nationally and footprint locally in Canton Ohio. The growth he envisioned led to the expansion of the Hall of Fame spread to downtown Canton and will continue to have a tremendous impact on the future of the Hall for decades to come.""

Baker's replacement Porter is a lifelong Stark County resident who was previously publisher of both the Akron Beacon Journal and Canton Repository. He had been serving as member of the Hall of Fame's board of trustees and most recently chaired the NFL Centennial Host Committee as the City of Canton prepared to celebrate the league's 100th birthday.

""He's got a lot of ideas on how we can engage the public"" Desrosiers said. ""He's going to work closely with the village and see that project continue to take shape. It's going to be a huge badge of honor for him to take it to the next level.""

He will continue to represent the Pro Football Hall of Fame at Ring of Excellence Ceremonies honoring members of the Centennial Class of 2020 and Class of 2021 at National Football League stadiums for the remainder of the presentation schedule as the retired president and executive director.

'The best job in the world'

""As I approach the end of nearly eight years of service to the Pro Football Hall of Fame"" Baker said in a statement released by the Hall ""I have come to the conclusion that it is time for someone else to have the ‘best job in the world’ so I can still do a few more exciting things in my professional life while also returning home to our four children 10 grandchildren and soon-to-be great grandson in Orange County California whom I’ve missed so much during my tenure at ‘The Most Inspiring Place on Earth.’ ""

Jim Porter 57 the Hall of Fame’s chief marketing and communications officer since April 2020 has been named president of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and will oversee all daily business operations.

The Hall of Fame’s board will continue to discuss the Hall’s management structure including a determination of who will deliver the news to those elected in future enshrinement classes and who will serve as host of the annual enshrinement events each summer in Canton.

When he joined the Hall Baker replaced Stephen A. Perry who led the Hall for seven years as president. Perry had been a top executive with Timken Co. and administrator for the U.S. General Services Administration under President George W. Bush before joining the Hall.

Before coming to Canton Baker served as commissioner of the Arena Football League and had been a partner in the Union Village a $1.6 billion health care development in Henderson Nevada.

David Baker instrumental in creating Hall of Fame Village project

It wasn't long after his arrival that Baker and others began discussing creating Hall of Fame Village a development similar to the project in Nevada. Prior to Baker's arrival the Hall quietly had purchased property in the neighborhood west of the museum. By fall of 2014 the village project featuring a top-flight hotel conference center and other amenities had taken hold of the community.

“Few people combine vision passion and dedication as completely as David Baker"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement released by the Hall. ""In seven years as president and CEO of the Pro Football Hall of Fame David expanded the Hall’s brand nationally and footprint locally in Canton Ohio. The growth he envisioned led to the expansion of the Hall of Fame spread to downtown Canton and will continue to have a tremendous impact on the future of the Hall for decades to come.

“His mission to honor and support the heroes of the game will be one of his most lasting and important legacies. We are grateful for David’s many contributions and extend our utmost thanks and best wishes to Colleen and him.”

Work started in September 2015 demolishing Fawcett Stadium and building Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium. In August 2016 the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game was cancelled just before kickoff because of problems with paint on the stadium turf.

Plans called for the Hall of Fame Village project to be completed in time for the NFL's centennial season in 2020 but the project hit snags. Some youth playing fields were constructed south of McKinley High School and the north and south stands of the stadium were built. Work also began on foundations of a new hotel.

By 2018 construction at the village had been stalled for months as companies waited on millions of dollars in back pay for work on Benson Stadium.

The parties involved in the project regrouped and eventually formed Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Co. The Hall of Fame holds stock and is a partner in the new entity but Baker no longer was at the forefront of the project.

Baker received a five-year contract extension as the Hall of Fame's president and CEO in December 2018. At the time of the announcement he called it the greatest job in the world.

In 2017 Baker received the March of Dimes Sports Leadership Award in recognition of his efforts with the Canton Village. He also was commended for his efforts to increase the amount of national programming the Hall offers and to improve the nonprofit’s financial situation.

“David Baker lifted the Pro Football Hall of Fame to new heights. He helped make the words ‘Canton’ and ‘Excellence’ synonymous” the Hall's Chairman of the Board of Trustees Dennis Nash said in a statement. “Jim Porter as president along with the next executive director of the Hall step into an organization with a unique place in the game of football and a strong national reputation.”

Dennis Saunier president and CEO of of the Canton Regional Chamber of Commerce and a Hall board member said Baker made a tremendous impact ""on the vision growth and national recognition"" of the Hall of Fame.

Baker's efforts have the Hall Hall of Fame Village powered by Johnson Controls and the Canton community ""positioned to continue their growth including bringing millions of football fans into the history of the game and the mission of the Hall"" Saunier wrote in a text message.

""I personally wish (Baker) nothing but the best of health and happiness in a well-deserved retirement"" Saunier added.

It was he who launched the concept for the development of the ambitious Hall of Fame Village project a for-profit entity distinct from the nonprofit Pro Football Hall of Fame. He regularly cited the Hall of Fame’s powerful Mission – to “Honor the Heroes of the Game Preserve its History Promote its Values & Celebrate Excellence EVERYWHERE” – at or near the beginning of every meeting at the Hall of Fame during every media opportunity and at each public appearance as a reminder of the Hall’s crucial role in Canton and to the game of professional football.

Under Baker the words “Canton” “Hall of Fame” and “Excellence” became interchangeable. Broadcasters across the country routinely tell viewers a certain player will “find himself in Canton someday.”

Baker will be remembered in the sports world as the man who introduced “The Knock” as the way of informing eligible Hall of Fame candidates they had been elected. He would rap on the doors of the hotel rooms where that year’s Enshrinement candidates were sequestered – or in the case of the COVID-affected Class of 2021 at their homes or a place of business – and savor the moments as the men and their families realized their lives were changing forever. He would welcome each enshrinee to Canton thank him for what he had contributed to the game and promise to guard his legacy at the Pro Football Hall of Fame forever.

Under Baker’s tenure the Pro Football Hall of Fame:

Promoted health-related causes for former NFL athletes and their families an ongoing effort that includes the formation of Hall of Fame Health (January 2020) and Hall of Fame Behavioral Health (May 2021).

(January 2020) and (May 2021). Expanded programming across the country especially in the areas of educational outreach for students of all ages.

Experienced increased television ratings and an increase in national broadcasts.

Received broader exposure of the Hall’s Mission Values and Vision.

Launched the Black College Football Hall of Fame Classic to celebrate Historically Black Colleges and Universities.

Brought the Black College Hall of Fame to Canton and inside the Pro Football Hall of Fame building.

Navigated the Hall safely through the COVID-19 pandemic.

Oversaw the selection of a 20-person Centennial Class of 2020 to commemorate the 100th birthday of the National Football League.

Enshrined both the Centennial Class of 2020 and Class of 2021 this past August as Canton led the celebration of “The Greatest Gathering in Football.”

In 2018 the Pro Football Hall of Fame was voted the Best Attraction for Sports Fans in the USA TODAY 10-Best Readers’ Choice Awards.

Baker’s accomplishments were recognized when he was bestowed the prestigious March of Dimes Sports Leadership Award for 2017. He joined a long list of distinguished winners of the award that includes former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue former NBA Commissioner David Stern NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and former Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig.

Baker an attorney earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature and Criticism from the University of California at Irvine and his Juris Doctorate from the Pepperdine School of Law during which time he served as the Editor-in-Chief of the Pepperdine Law Review.

He played professional basketball in Switzerland and worldwide with a Christian basketball team that beat some of the best competition in the world. He served a term as mayor and was elected as a councilman in Irvine Calif. the country’s first master-planned city. He also served for 12 years as Commissioner of the Arena Football League.

From 2009 to 2014 Baker served as the Managing Partner for Union Village an integrated health village located in Henderson Nev.

Baker is the father of two boys: Ben who is the Director of Broadcasting at NASCAR; and Sam who played left tackle for the Atlanta Falcons and currently serves as a high school football coach. David and his wife Colleen also have a daughter Leyla and a son Michael; and they are the proud grandparents of 10 grandchildren.

“I want to expressly thank all the Board of Trustees for their past support and allowing me to serve in this important position for nearly eight years. I shall always and forever be both literally and figuratively the Hall’s biggest fan” Baker said. “It has been an honor to serve the Hall’s noble mission of ‘Celebrating Excellence EVERYWHERE’ and I want to also thank the management team and staff who comprise the best ‘team’ in the world.

“A special thanks also to our Hall of Famers and Hall of Fame Families the good people and incredible volunteers of Canton all of the Hall’s partners and the Commissioner and the National Football League for supporting so much of the progress we were all able to achieve during this time.”",,,

Sgt. Nick Irving made a name for himself as a special operations sniper in the Army’s 3rd Ranger Battalion. He deployed six times to Iraq and Afghanistan earning a reputation as one of the deadliest Army Rangers in military history.

“Our job set is very focused” Irving recalled. “We have a list of guys bad guys that we have to kill or capture and we don’t stop until we knock out as much of that list as we possibly can.”

Pre-COVID-19 getting together was as easy as hopping on a plane home or scheduling a fantastic vacation somewhere in the middle. But with borders closing and a seemingly endless array of constantly changing restrictions regulations visas and tests it's become difficult to reunite with loved ones. As borders begin to reopen VistaJet has created an over-the-top package with event planners Sharky & George that will make your first reunion one your family will remember forever.

The Surprise Reunion will bring together family and friends from around the world for an epic adventure. First special packages will be delivered to each guest's home including itineraries challenges or maybe cryptic messages. Those messages will lead family members (or friends) to a private jet that will whisk them off to the reunion destination with VistaJet handling all logistics ensuring a seamless trip.

Of course the trips are all bespoke and can be customized in every way but there are several inspirational itineraries available such as a treasure hunt adventure race and trips based on historical experiences. And really ""experiences"" might be an understatement. The treasure hunt is more akin to the plot of a James Bond movie including drone deliveries boat chases femme fatales spy equipment and buried treasure. The historical experience could recreate the 12 Labors of Hercules in Greece aboard a superyacht.

In a phone interview Matteo Atti EVP of marketing and innovation at VistaJet said the trips were designed to accommodate all ages from the very young to more senior members of the family and different activity levels. The expert party planners will create unique itineraries for every member of the family. ""Everyone has their own rhythm and habits. You don't want to force a holiday onto them. You want to create something that generates interactions moments of love moments of happiness moments of fun"" he said. ""Someone might be fighting to find that missing clue while another person might be at home cooking a meal inspired by what the others are doing.""

The inspiration behind the trip actually came from Atti's personal experience during COVID-19 being separated from his family. ""What I've seen is a cathartic time the moment when you hug a person again… It's magnificent"" he said. And truly what could be more magnificent than a globe-trotting adventure with the entire family?

The projects are:

Bounce Back in partnership with Bournemouth Churches Housing Association (BCHA) supporting vulnerable adults in achieving independent sustained living via a classroom and practical learning.

Show Racism the Red Card events consisting of educational days for school children that are hosted annually at the stadium. They involve a question-and-answer session with a panel which normally consists of a male and female player as well as a member of staff from the campaign.

Educational and interactive diversity and inclusion workshops for staff and primary and secondary school students.

Lottie Forte responsible for volunteering and community relations at JPMorgan Chase said: “This project has been several years in the making and we are delighted to now be working with AFC Bournemouth to develop long-term projects to have a real and positive impact on the local community in Bournemouth.

“Our employees are excited to team up with our friends at AFC Bournemouth and explore the many different ways to make a real difference within the community.”

JPMorgan Chase has previously invested in the careers of black students through its global Advancing Black Pathways Programme. This included a £2million philanthropic investment in 2020 to support non-profit London organisations led by black and ethnic minority leaders. It also set up a £4.8m endowment fund to improve access and employability opportunities for low income black and minority ethnic university students in the UK starting with 350 students in the next 10 years.

The initial collaboration with AFC Bournemouth is set to run 18 months with a review to take place during that time.

Four main areas have been identified as starting points: diversity education and inclusion; mental health; personal development and career guidance; and disadvantaged and vulnerable adults.

Steve Cuss head of community at AFC Bournemouth Community Sports Trust said: “I have been very fortunate to have had the backing of Jeff Mostyn our chairman and Rob Mitchell commercial director and consequently my team has been able to bring some real benefits to the area.

“Our chairman believes this partnership could not have come at a better time and described it as utopia. With these two organisations joining forces to boost the local community we’re really excited to get started.”

The launch event at JPMorgan Chase was attended by personnel and also viewed online. A panel consisted of Lorna Jeffery Hannah Elson Lottie Forte Jeff Mostyn Rob Mitchell and Steve Cuss who all gave their thoughts on the project and answered questions."

LONDON — Swedish fintech firm Klarna on Monday said it is introducing a number of changes to its product in the U.K. as regulators in the country prepare to tighten regulation on the fast-growing ""buy now pay later"" industry.

One of the biggest updates Klarna is implementing is stronger credit checks. The company said a new tool will let users share income and spending data from their bank accounts to determine whether they can afford future repayments. The feature is voluntary a Klarna spokesperson said.

Unlike banks and credit card providers Klarna doesn't conduct hard credit checks on its customers meaning their credit score shouldn't show up on their credit history.

Klarna said it will also launch the ability for users to pay for things instantly in one go as well as clearer language at checkout letting users know they are taking out a loan with the firm and may be penalized for missing a payment.

Klarna is one of the world's largest buy now pay later or BNPL operators. Such services let shoppers split their purchases into monthly installments typically interest-free. In 2020 about $97 billion of global e-commerce transactions were processed through a BNPL platform.

Major companies have made a leap into the market including PayPal  Square and Mastercard .",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzEwLzE2L2tsYXJuYXMtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtYm9zcy1jbGVhbmluZy1iYW5raW5ncy1kaXJ0eS10cmlja3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Klarna's billionaire boss responds to 'buy now pay later' criticism,"At first everyone thought Siemiatkowski’s idea was mad.

“I was talking to my friends about this business I wanted to set up and [apart from Victor] they were all saying ‘Yeah good luck’” he says.

“The perception from them was like ‘you do that and I’m going to work for Morgan Stanley and make lots of money’.

“All my friends from the Stockholm School of Economics wanted to be bankers at Goldman Sachs but I was different I wanted to start a business.”

Now worth around $2.2bn the 40-year-old father of three makes no secret of the fact that he wants to kill off the credit card while also competing shoulder-to-shoulder with the big banks.

A string of new features that will make Klarna more similar to a traditional bank or payment giant are about to be adopted in the UK with some changes expected to be announced as soon as this week.

Senior City bankers say that Siemiatkowski has made clear in recent months that he wants Klarna to be “part of the establishment” becoming the first ""buy now pay later"" firm to join banking lobby group UK Finance earlier this year.

Big banks admit they want to take on Klarna too. Would he not be tempted to sell?

“That would be very sad. The unfortunate truth about banks is that they haven’t played a nice game” Siemiatkowski says.

“It’s been a lot of dirty tricks. So I would be very sad if we sold to a big bank as someone needs to participate in making this industry better for consumers and society and create some nice competition.”

Klarna has attracted plenty of criticism itself for encouraging spending and driving many into an endless cycle of debt.",,,

The brand sold out just one day after its release — but Yahoo Finance got to try it before it quickly disappeared from shelves.

Upon arrival the bottle of La Moutarde Vin looked and smelled like normal wine with a faint yellow hue and slight tangy aroma.

A descriptive card included in the packaging read that the wine embodies ""bright hints of spice pronounced citrus and floral characteristics balanced by vibrant acidity"" and that each bottle ""is infused with our Grey Poupon mustard seeds.""

Surprisingly the wine tasted light and crisp — and not at all like mustard.

“We’ve watched as leisurely lunches have been replaced by food delivery apps and desk-side speed snacking” Kraft Heinz said in a press release following the wine's launch.

“Here at Grey Poupon we want lunch to feel worthy of savoring again"" the company added.

Trade magazine The Drinks Business called the La Moutarde wine ""well structured and well-made"" noting that ""it is doubtful that anyone would taste the influence of the mustard infusion (there are no actual seeds in it.)""

The quirky concoction which is listed at 13.7% ABV retails for $30 and comes with an 8 oz. bottle of Grey Poupon mustard.

In recent years more food brands had adopted similar marketing schemes (and wines!) to attract new consumers and drive greater traffic toward core products.

Last year Taco Bell (YUM) unveiled 'Jalapeño Noir' to pair with the relaunch of the toasted cheesy chalupa. It too sold out in just one day.

Meanwhile Cheez-Itz unveiled sparkling wine last month following the success of its limited-edition red and rosé wine cracker boxes.

Sachem Head has a history of solid value investing but we believe that they really found their activist stride in 2020 with their investment in Olin. Scott Ferguson took a board seat at Olin – the first public company board seat he has taken in an investment that was not part of a group – and created tremendous value there where he remains on the board. His next activist 13D was at Elanco where he again took a board seat and is in the process of creating value there. Taking board seats signifies both commitment and contribution and this philosophy and style is really paying off for Sachem Head.

Sachem Head subtly signals in its 13D filing that it might be interested in a board seat. It states in the filing that Sachem Head has entered into an agreement with Bernardo Hees who has agreed to serve as an advisor to Sachem Head and as a potential director nominee. This makes sense as Sachem Head founder Scott Ferguson is already on two public company boards and Hees has extensive industry and operating experience.

But to truly understand Sachem Head's thesis here we have to go back to August 2015 when Trian filed a 13D on USFD competitor Sysco and Nelson Peltz took a board seat creating significant value for shareholders by improving operating margins and focusing more on Sysco's higher margin businesses. Three years later in 2018 Sachem Head took a 2% position in USFD stating in a letter to investors that USFD could benefit from many of the same steps Sysco took at the urging of Trian. Sachem Head further stated: ""With the help of an activist shareholder Sysco meaningfully expanded profitability by improving discipline around pricing and increasing focus on high-margin private label goods and lucrative smaller restaurant customers.... US Foods can implement many of the same initiatives while innovating in other areas such as technology and central replenishment."" In 2018 Sachem Head predicted that the company could generate $3 in earnings per share in 2020 with a stock price of $45. Cut to 2020 and both gross and operating margins are worse than 2018 earnings per share is $1.66 and the stock price is $36.08. So there is even more work to be done and more opportunity for value creation.

However while Scott Ferguson does have extensive activist experience he is already on two public company boards and does not have the operating experience of Trian's Nelson Peltz (few activists do). So he wisely partnered with Hees who has extensive operating experience. Hees is a former partner of 3G Capital and former CEO of Kraft Heinz and H.J. Heinz from 2013 to 2019. Interestingly Nelson Peltz was a director of H.J. Heinz and served on the special committee of the board that negotiated the acquisition of Heinz by 3G Capital in 2013. Two years later Peltz started an activist campaign at Sysco. Two years after Hees left Heinz he is starting one with Sachem Head at Sysco competitor USFD. The blueprint to this campaign has already been written and Sachem Head seems to have recruited the right players for shareholder value creation.

The sprint shoes and shot put stones aren't needed just yet. Instead Warner planned to shoot hoops with his coach and play some badminton Friday as he slowly eases his body back into a regular routine.

After a two-month break from training Warner will keep things light over the next few weeks.

""Nothing is out of touch"" Warner said. ""Anything that we think is going to be interesting or fun we'll try it.""

WATCH | Warner joins fight against food insecurity on World Food Day:

Damian Warner joins the fight against food insecurity on World Food Day Duration 4:07 Olympic decathlon gold medallist Damian Warner has teamed up with Kraft Heinz Canada in support of Kraft Pantry Day to fight a problem he and his family experienced early in his life: food insecurity. The initiative is part of a larger five-year $20-million product donation to Food Banks Canada to connect the 4.4 million Canadians affected by food insecurity across the country with the meals they need. Warner spoke with CBC Sports about his experiences growing up and coming to understand the challenges his family faced when he was young.

He also plans to toss the baseball and football around while working in sports as varied as table tennis rock climbing and volleyball.

""We don't necessarily believe that the most athletic person runs in a straight line"" Warner said. ""So we try to move on different planes.""

The 31-year-old from London Ont. has kept busy since winning gold at the Tokyo Games. He and longtime partner Jen Cotten a former national team hurdler stay on their toes with son Theo who's seven months old.

Warner has also made recent appearances at pro sports events was named a Canada's Walk of Fame inductee and has been tending to sponsor commitments and community initiatives.

When decathlon training resumes he'll have his eye on major 2022 competitions like the March 18-20 world indoors in Belgrade the May 28-29 Hypo Meeting in Gotzis Austria and the July 15-24 world athletics championships in Eugene Ore.

""Those are the big ones that are in the schedule"" Warner said. ""Obviously there will be some other events here and there individual events but we're not necessarily sure of those dates yet.""

A bronze medallist at the 2016 Rio Games Warner also finished third at the 2019 world championship in Doha Qatar.

WATCH | Warner breaks down decathlon gold medal at Tokyo Games:

He set a Canadian record at Gotzis last May and improved that national mark by setting an Olympic record in Tokyo with 9018 points.

""I don't necessarily chase a number score"" Warner said from London. ""But at the same time I'm human and you can't help but look at scores and try to see if there's an opportunity to score 9000 points. But I think having that in my bag now I can really focus on just going into the competitions and just trying to win.

""I don't really have to focus too much on what the score is going to be. It takes off some pressure in that sense where now I can just focus on exactly what I want which is winning competitions. The world championships will certainly be a big one.""

WATCH | Warner becomes 1st Canadian to win decathlon Olympic gold:

Warner had to train in a chilly run-down hockey arena last winter because his usual indoor training facility at Western University wasn't available due to the pandemic. The school venue has since reopened but Warner won't firm up plans until he shifts to decathlon training.

""I think it was a great story but it was difficult"" Warner said. ""We were able to persevere through it but it's not necessarily the most ideal training situation. It will be really nice to be back to normalcy.""

Now that he's had time to reflect on his unusual path to Olympic gold Warner said he's really proud of how he and his team handled training challenges travel limitations and the adjusted competition schedule.

""I think it sets me up well moving forward not only for the decathlon but for other things in my future"" he said. ""If you're given cards that aren't necessarily the best you know how to deal with them and manoeuvre and make the most of it.

""I think it'll definitely help me out in the long run.""

In Tokyo Warner became the fourth man in history to top the elusive 9000-point barrier. A world title and besting Kevin Mayer's world record of 9126 points are two of his main goals for the future along with trying to defend his Olympic crown in 2024 in Paris.

""The next three years are different than most because usually we'd have an off-year"" Warner said in an interview as part of his promotion of Kraft Heinz Pantry Day. ""But for this [shortened quadrennial] there's going to be two world indoors two world outdoors two times at Gotzis and an Olympic Games.

""So there's a lot from a year-to-year basis but Paris is definitely the end goal.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3Qtam91cm5hbC5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzEwL2NvdmlkLTE5LXBhbmRlbWljLWhlbHBlZC1mdWVsLWluc3RhY2FydHMtZ3Jvd3RoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID-19 Pandemic Helped Fuel Instacart’s Growth | News Sports Jobs,"When the pandemic hit the U.S. last year grocery delivery company Instacart suddenly became a lifeline for millions of consumers. Sales volumes skyrocketed; in one month the company added 300000 drivers to keep up with its orders.

“We saw five years of growth packed into one year” Instacart CEO Fidji Simo said.

Demand has waned this year but remains above pre-pandemic levels. San Francisco-based Instacart —- which is a private company —- expects to see double-digit transaction growth this year.

But the company —- which offers delivery from 55000 stores in the U.S. and Canada through its 500000 contract workers —- is also trying to expand in other ways like offering advertising services and non-grocery delivery from stores like Dick’s Sporting Goods. An initial public offering is likely in its future.

Guiding Instacart through this new normal is Simo a former executive at Facebook who joined Instacart’s board in February and took over as CEO in August. Simo —- the daughter granddaughter and great-granddaughter of fishermen —- says Instacart appealed to her because its mission is feeding people.

“I grew up with a very large rambunctious French Sicilian family where the way we show love the way we show care is always food” said Simo who was born in France.

Simo spoke with The Associated Press about Instacart’s future. Her comments have been edited for length.

Q. How would you describe the changes Instacart has seen over the last 18 months?

A. Grocery is one of the largest segments of commerce but it’s only 10% penetrated online. And we think over the next five years it’s going to get to 20% 30% like most other commerce segments. I would say that before the pandemic many people weren’t even aware that a service like ours existed. And that has been changed forever. We are seeing that many people are now making it part of the way they run their household.

Q. Instacart is the U.S. market leader for grocery delivery but it’s facing a lot of competition. Uber Eats and DoorDash have recently added grocery partners for example. How will Instacart remain on top?

A. You know any attractive market will always attract a lot of competition. And to a certain extent I’m glad that there’s a lot of attention on online grocery right now because that’s making this behavior just much more democratized. I would say that in terms of the competition what we’re focused on is really being the best partner to all retailers. That’s why pretty much all of the top retailers are on our platform. And that matters enormously because when you talk to customers about what they care about when it comes to buying online they care enormously about selection and they care enormously about their loyalty to particular retailers. And so our positioning is very very different from that of our competitors.

Q. Instacart’s ad business —- promoting products on its site from food companies like Kraft Heinz —- tripled in revenue in the first part of this year. Why is that business so critical for Instacart?

A. It’s an important part of the consumer experience. We think that through advertising they’re going to be able to discover brands they wouldn’t have discovered otherwise. But it’s also an important part of our business model because it allows us to make the service cheaper for consumers and charge grocers less. And I fundamentally believe that if we want 30% of people to shop online we are going to have to make online grocery delivery cheaper overall.

Q. Prior to Instacart you spent a decade leading development and strategy for the Facebook app. What lessons from Facebook are you bringing to Instacart?

A. I’ve always been fascinated by complex marketplaces. Facebook was one and certainly Instacart is one as well a four-sided marketplace between consumers shoppers retailers and food brands. And I think this ability to think in terms of ecosystems and how to balance all the sides of the marketplace that I learned at Facebook is serving me well at this job.

Q. You recently announced that you are co-founding Metrodora a clinic and research foundation in Salt Lake City that will study diagnose and treat complex neuroimmune disorders. Why is this issue so important to you?

A. Right after my pregnancy I started having a lot of weird symptoms including fainting. Sadly I wasn’t diagnosed at the time. I was told that I was a tired mom who needed some sleep. After many many months of tests and probing I was diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome abbreviated as POTS. It’s a neuroimmune condition which means that it impacts both the immune system and nervous system. I’ve been incredibly lucky to have access to the best doctors and to find great treatments. Despite that it took me close to five years to be diagnosed. There isn’t enough research being done on why so many people —- 80% of whom are women —- can get so sick with these conditions. So when I realized that was the case I usually don’t handle things passively. Everybody who knows me would tell you I like to fix problems.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vcGlkZ2luLzU4OTM3ODE40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World Food Day: We need ‘to get use to higher price of food’?,"World Food Day: We need ‘to get use to higher price of food’?

17 October 2021

Kontris around di world celebrate World Food Day on 16 October wit warning from United Nations (UN) of ""extraordinarily terrible levels of food insecurity"" and as dem fear say price of food go seriously increase through out di world.

""Close to 500000 pipo dey experience famine-like conditions for Ethiopia Madagascar South Sudan and Yemen.

For recent months vulnerable pipo for Burkina Faso and Nigeria don already dey suffer di same conditions"" UN tok for one statement.

Di UN dey call for immediate funding to support 41 million people for many kontris wey dey in danger of going into famine.

According to UK based charity Di Hunger Project while 690m pipo around di world dey live wit chronic hunger 850m people dey at risk of poverty becos of Covid-19.

Out of dis 690m 60% are women.

Here we dey look at wetin higher food price mean practically for pipo all ova di world and which alternatives dey to consider to help elevate food poverty.

But first make we look at why food price dey rise in di first place.

Why price dey get higher?

Wia dis foto come from Getty Images Wetin we call dis foto The pandemic has led to a shortage of goods such as ketchup sachets as demand for takeaways soared

International food giant Kraft Heinz don war say pipo go need to ""get used to higher food price"" as a result of post-pandemic ""across board"" inflation.

Dr Sarika Kulkarni Founder and Trustee of Raah Foundation Mumbai India agree wit Miguel Patricio di oga of Kraft Heinz say food prices go stay higher.

Dr Kulkarni and the Raah Foundation don dey work to make better healthier and happier life for indigenous communities for India.

During the pandemic many kontris experience say di price of production of raw materials from crops to vegetable oils fall. Measures to control di coronavirus as well as di sickness limit output and delivery.

As economies don restart di supply of dis products many neva fit keep up wit demand afta dem return and dis lead to higher prices.

Higher salaries plus price of energy also add to wahala wey manufacturers dey face.

""Prices get direct relationship wit demand and supply - while population dey increase and demand for food dey continuously rise - di number of acres of land wey dem dey farm dey reduce due to many challenges and problems wey include availability of water ground wey im quality reduce climate change and increasing extreme weather condition newer generations no dey interested in farming as occupation etc…"" na so poverty alleviation expert Dr Kulkarni tok.

""Di farmers dey face many challenges wey don dey reflect in di price of food wey continue to dey increase.""

'Selling sex for food'

Wia dis foto come from Getty Images Wetin we call dis foto Women and girls are particularly vulnerable as a result of increasing poverty and higher food prices. according to the UN

While pipo for developed world fit choose to reduce luxury items less holidays abroad or even carefully manage dia budget e no straight forward for some pipo for undeveloped kontris wey dey are so desperate most times dem dey forced to sell sex for food.

According to UN Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths: ""Wen famine finally open di door e dey go viral in a way wey oda threats no fit.""

Women and girls dey particularly vulnerable as a result of increasing poverty and higher food prices.

""Women tell us of di desperate measures dey must take to find food to feed dia families including selling sex for food early and child marriages as I bin dey hear wen I dey Syria recently"" im tok.

Wia dis foto come from Susuma Susuma Wetin we call dis foto Farm radio programmes for Tanzania dey help educate pipo on how to make di best out of their land and natural resources

Di UN regional bodies and different goments fit use di traditional method to lift pipo out of poverty to face di challenge of increasing food prices and many charities around the world are focusing on innovative methods.

Di Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organisation Qu Dongyu say ""supporting agri-food systems and providing long-term assistance na di path to recovery beyond just survival.""

But Collacott tell BBC say moni alone no go solve food poverty: ""We need radical reform of di systems and structures wey dey keep pipo for poverty.""

According to Dr Kulkarni di introduction of climate smart farming improving way we adapt to climate change like improved rainwater harvesting storage capacities decrease price of seeds and other farming related raw material encourage farmers to keep enough wey dem go consume while dem dey make moni by selling di rest.

What now?

Wia dis foto come from Susuma Susuma Wetin we call dis foto Involving small-scale farmers for big government policy fit help elevate global food poverty na so Karen Hampson from Farm Radio International tok

While pipo for both developed and developing countries fit dey wonder how to respond to increasing food price activists believe say hope dey to avoid di crisis as long as world leaders take quick and measured action.

""Personally I go say hope always dey"" Karen Hampson Senior Manager Program Development for Farm Radio International tok but only if:

""We listen to women men and young farmers we let dem lead and hear dia concerns we include dem for policy dialogues and we support dia efforts weda through co-operatives farmers and women groups or innovation.

""We put di focus on climate response and supporting marginalised groups especially and respond to dia needs - for equality of access to markets access to credit access to information."""

Quick Thoughts

Drop launched this new Premium Offers card-linked program last week and it is indeed living up to its Premium name and has gotten even better since it started.

In the first round of card-linked offers they were offering 0.5% back at Kroger and Trader Joe’s 1.5% back at Amazon along with a few other retailers and restaurants. For this second week they’ve not only added even more retailers (who are very useful) but they’ve increased the return for some of the retailers too.

For example Kroger and Trader Joe’s have been increased from 0.5% to 1.5% this week while Adidas has been increased from 3% to 15%. In terms of additional retailers they’ve added Walmart and Target at 1.5% CVS and 7-Eleven at 4% and more.

There are a couple of reasons why these Premium Offers in the Drop app are so notable. For starters these offers are all available for in-store purchases other than when a retailer only has an online presence (or mainly an online presence like Amazon). That can be helpful if you spend a lot in-store at places like Kroger Walmart Target CVS 7-Eleven etc. Many of these offers are available for online purchases too so offers for Walmart Target etc. are valid for both in-store and online purchases.

Another reason these offers are notable is because they’re card-linked offers. That means they’ll stack with other deals such as Amex Offers bonused spend categories shopping portals etc. For example the Discover It card is offering 5% back for online purchases from Amazon Target and Walmart this quarter all of which Drop is offering 1.5% for. Some cards offer bonused spend at drugstores like CVS 7-Eleven stores sometimes code as gas purchases on cards that offer bonused spend in that category etc.

Some of these card-linked offers have an exclusion for gift card purchases but it wouldn’t surprise me if that’s not actually enforced. However that’s something to be aware of if you were planning on trying to maximize the earning opportunities available here.

The Drop app can be painfully slow at times but offers like this make it worth keeping around.

Update: It looks like these offers are only available to Premium members. As best as I can tell you become a Premium member when linking a card and one of the benefits is 1000 points per month (worth $1) which you have to actively claim.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsaXRlZGFpbHkuY29tL25ld3MvcHVtcGtpbi1pY2UtY3JlYW0tdG8tYnV5LTIwMjEtdGFyZ2V0LWtyb2dlci1qZW5pcy9hbXDSAVVodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbGl0ZWRhaWx5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3B1bXBraW4taWNlLWNyZWFtLXRvLWJ1eS0yMDIxLXRhcmdldC1rcm9nZXItamVuaXMvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 Pumpkin Ice Creams: Target Kroger Jeni’s & More,"If you’re looking to put a chilly spin on your favorite fall treats these six pumpkin ice creams are perfect for when you’re chillin’ at home.

The Oregonian/OregonLive

Intel has taken to running TV ads during the Portland telecast of Sunday Night Football one of the most popular programs on the air — but not to hawk its microprocessors.

It’s trying to lure workers.

And at a time when the most entry-level job seekers are in demand at restaurants hotels bus companies and heath care clinics Intel’s pitch is to perhaps try advanced microcircuitry manufacturing instead.

The microelectronics industry faces a particular labor squeeze. Demand is up at nearly every chip company. And Intel the state’s largest corporate employer plans to open a $3 billion factory expansion in Hillsboro early next year that will add hundreds more jobs.

Electronics companies large and small say they’re struggling to find workers so they’re putting up billboards buying TV and radio ads and bringing in new hires still in school to plug the holes.

“I think a lot of people have this misconception that Intel is this black box or that Intel is only hiring people with a master’s degree or a Ph.D.” said Intel spokeswoman Elly Akopyan. She said the company’s ad campaign aims to demystify chip manufacturing and make it clear it’s a job that just about anybody can do.

“We need to create a pipeline of manufacturing workers to come work for us” Akopyan said.

Oregon exported $15 billion in electronics last year 60% of all the state’s exports. The state’s electronics output climbed another 26% through the first half of 2021 reflecting huge demand for the chips that run computers smartphones cars trucks and home appliances.

The Portland area’s manufacturers would certainly make more chips – if only they could find the workers to do the job.

“It seems like every other week I get a call that says ‘I could hire 100 people right now’” said Eric Kirchner chairman of the microelectronics department at Portland Community College. Intel hasn’t said that the labor shortage is constraining production but many others in the industry have.

Technology is one of Oregon’s largest industries as important to the state’s economy today as timber was in its 1970s heyday. And electronics manufacturing pays well.

Chip manufacturing equipment supplier Watlow said last week that it is hiring 20 technicians for its Hillsboro site at a starting wage of $25 an hour with a retention bonus for those who stay with the company and an annual corporate performance bonus.

Portland Community College’s microelectronics graduates typically earn a starting salary around $60000 after completing the two-year program according to Kirchner. And he said pay rises sharply as workers build experience.

Yet Kirchner said recruitment has always been a challenge. The work is typically done out of sight in windowless cleanrooms that keep the electronics free from even microscopic contamination. So there’s very little awareness of what the job is he said let alone what it pays.

“People think oh it’s high tech I don’t understand high tech. I can’t do that” Kirchner said. “Anybody can be a technician. We’re going to train you the technical stuff. You need people that can work in teams and show up for work on time and manage a schedule or follow a procedure or checklist. You don’t have to be a technical genius to do that kind of stuff.”

Of Intel’s 21000 Oregon employees roughly 10% have a master's degree. The company’s Washington County campuses are home to its most advanced research.

But for the jobs Intel is advertising on TV it seeks only a high school diploma – and the ability to spend all day on your feet.

Austin Robertson had planned to go into nursing after he graduated from high school seven years ago. But a few years into his training he decided it wasn’t a fit for him. After stints working at Safeway and at a jail in Columbia County a friend suggested Robertson try electronics manufacturing instead.

So he started an associate’s degree program at Portland Community College.

Robertson is taking classes intermittently so doesn’t expect to complete the coursework within two years. But Intel hired him anyway. He’s in his third month as a technician learning on the job and fitting in his college classes around his work schedule.

“I love it. It’s the best job I’ve had” Robertson said. He said he thinks he’s found a career that feels meaningful working in an advanced industry and getting to know a new field.

“It’s just working with a lot of knowledgeable people and working with stuff that’s kind of hands on” Robertson said. “It just feels like I’m doing something important.”

That’s just the kind of thing manufacturers want to hear from their new hires. But there don’t seem to be many other people thinking that way.

With wages rising across Oregon industries and job openings abundant Kirchner said many people are choosing to work instead of enrolling in his program.

“We’re about as low as I can remember with the number of students starting the program which really hurts” Kirchner said. “That means in two years we’re not going to graduate very many people.”

While many people can learn on the job Kirchner said the additional education would get ahead and position them for promotions and higher pay down the road while making them more productive over the course of their careers.

Manufacturing equipment supplier Lam Research has added 1000 jobs in the past 18 months at its 52-acre Tualatin campus and plans to hire 300 more for a new factory opening this fall in nearby Sherwood. To meet that increased demand Lam has hired first-year electronics students at Portland Community College to work part time while they pursue their degree.

“Technicians are so unavailable with the associate of applied science degree that they said ‘We’re going to grow our own’” said Bill Manley a PCC employment specialist who works with the microelectronics industry.

Electronics manufacturers say it takes about two months to get a new hire up to speed on the basics of the job and a year to be fully qualified in some areas. So there’s no quick fix in sight for an industry that would prefer to hire experienced workers.

“We’re resorting to hiring other folks and going through longer training periods and hoping we can build the folks up over time. But they don’t become really effective quickly” said Frank Nichols founder of boutique Vancouver manufacturer Silicon Forest Electronics. He said his clients have a year of work lined up for his company but the hiring shortage is limiting the degree to which he can cash in on that.

“The outlook is very rosy actually” Nichols said “if we can find the people.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

""Seeing Lucy start her journey reinforces the strength of the 500 team members from NASA Lockheed Martin the Southwest Research Institute and many other teams who worked together to bring this mission to life"" said Rich Lipe Lockheed Martin Lucy program manager. ""It's a tale centered on flexibility collaboration and ingenuity which is fitting for the voyage that lies ahead for this advanced spacecraft.""

The spacecraft was designed built and tested in Lockheed Martin's Littleton facility using transformative technology. The company's mission operations team is now in communications with the spacecraft and will operate it through the end of its mission.

Lucy will be the farthest solar-powered mission from the Sun and will visit a record-breaking number of asteroids – all in the name of studying them for clues about our own origins.

Engineering for an Epic Journey

Lucy's 4-billion-mile odyssey through the solar system will last 12 years and fly by eight objects: one Main Belt asteroid and seven Trojan asteroids that lead and trail Jupiter in its orbit.

Scientists are keen for an up-close look at these ancient rocks which are believed to be pristinely preserved leftovers from the formation of our outer solar system 4 billion years ago.

With such a long unforgiving journey through space Lucy's engineers designed the spacecraft to be ready for anything. Lucy draws on heritage design elements from previous Lockheed Martin-built missions like OSIRIS-REx and MAVEN.

Key features of the Lucy spacecraft include:

Some 430 unique components brought together by more than 2 miles of wire 170 square feet of composite structure and more than 12800 electrical connections

Three powerful primary instruments to study the geology composition and structure of the Trojan asteroids

Two 24-foot diameter solar arrays built by Northrop Grumman spanning more than a four-story building when unfurled

A robust thermal design that protects Lucy from extreme space temperatures ranging from -250⁰F to +300⁰F

Autonomous software that enables Lucy to track asteroid targets as it flies by at an average speed of 15000 mph

Advanced production parts like 3D-printed brackets and harness clamps made from three different materials

The team also made use of the latest collaborative tools and digital engineering techniques on Lucy including automated testing digital test review capability and remote collaboration. These tactics helped the team continue production without missing a shift throughout the pandemic.

Seeking Science for the Next Generation

The long duration of Lucy's endeavor means that a student in 4th grade now could find themselves working on this mission when they graduate college.

The spacecraft also draws its name from another scientific discovery that students may recognize from their history books.

Much like the 3.2-million-year-old Lucy skeleton fundamentally changed our understanding of human evolution this mission aims to change the way we understand how the planets – including Earth – formed.

Donald Johanson who discovered the famous fossil in 1974 is thrilled to see the spirit of scientific exploration live on through the Lucy mission.

""The mission teaches us something about the interconnectedness of people over time and space"" he remarked. ""A poignant moment in the history of humanity that brings the past and the present together – and launches us into the future.""

In an Oct. 17 statement NASA said that while the spacecraft is healthy one of the two circular solar panels “may not be fully latched” after its deployment. The solar arrays deployed in the first half-hour after separation from the Centaur upper stage of the Atlas 5 rocket that launched it early Oct. 16.

Both solar panels are generating power the agency stated and there are no other problems with the spacecraft. “In the current spacecraft attitude Lucy can continue to operate with no threat to its health and safety” NASA said in the statement. “The team is analyzing spacecraft data to understand the situation and determine next steps to achieve full deployment of the solar array.”

“This team has overcome many challenges already and I am confident they will prevail here as well” Thomas Zurbuchen NASA associate administrator for science tweeted Oct. 17.

Lucy’s two solar panels are each 7.3 meters in diameter. Stored in a folded configuration they were designed to unfurl “like Chinese fans” said Joan Salute associate director for flight programs in NASA’s planetary science division at a prelaunch briefing Oct. 14.

The arrays have a combined 51 square meters of solar cells. That large area is needed since the spacecraft will be flying out to Jupiter’s distance from the sun where the sunlight is only a few percent as powerful as at Earth. “That enables Lucy to travel further away from the sun than any other solar-powered spacecraft to date” said Katie Oakman Lucy structures and mechanisms lead at Lockheed Martin Space at the Oct. 14 briefing. Lockheed was the prime contractor for Lucy although the solar arrays were built by Northrop Grumman.

In the vicinity of the Earth Lucy’s panels can generate 18 kilowatts of power. However when flying by the Trojan asteroids that are the destination of the mission the arrays will produce only 500 watts of power still sufficient to operate the spacecraft and its three main instruments.

She added there was no specific design requirement for circular arrays versus more conventional rectangular ones but that those offered the most area while fitting in the confines of the Atlas payload fairing. “This particular design really enables us to stow up closely and tightly next to the spacecraft for launch” she said. “Having any particular shape other than this really unique design wouldn’t enable us to get to that 51-meter-squared of active cell area and still fit within the launch vehicle fairing.”

It’s unclear if the problem will affect other work to check out the spacecraft after its launch. That includes deployment of the instrument pointing platform on which the three major instruments are mounted which is scheduled for about two days after launch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwLzE3L2VyZG9nYW4tc2F5cy10dXJrZXktaW4tdGFsa3Mtd2l0aC11cy1vbi1zYWxlLW9mLWYtMTYtZmlnaHRlci1qZXRz0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwLzE3L2VyZG9nYW4tc2F5cy10dXJrZXktaW4tdGFsa3Mtd2l0aC11cy1vbi1zYWxlLW9mLWYtMTYtZmlnaHRlci1qZXRz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Erdogan says Turkey in talks with US on sale of F-16 fighter jets,"Turkish president says the US proposed the sale of F-16 fighter jets in return for its investment in the F-35 programme.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says the United States proposed selling F-16 fighter jets to Turkey in return for its investment in the F-35 programme from which Ankara was removed after purchasing missile defence systems from Russia.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday before departing for a trip to Africa Erdogan said Turkey wants a return for its investment in the F-35 programme and that talks on the issue are ongoing.

“There is the payment of $1.4bn we have made for the F-35s and the US had such a proposal in return for these payments” Erdogan said.

“And regarding this we said let’s take whatever steps are needed to be taken to meet the defence needs of our country” he said.

“We are working to further develop our fleet from the modernisation of the F-16s in our possession to new additional F-16 purchases” the Turkish leader said.

Ankara had ordered more than 100 F-35 jets made by Lockheed Martin Corp but the US removed Turkey from the programme in 2019 after it acquired Russian S-400 missile defence systems.

The decades-old partnership between the NATO allies has gone through unprecedented tumult in the past five years over disagreements on Syria policy Ankara’s closer ties with Moscow its naval ambitions in the eastern Mediterranean US charges against a state-owned Turkish bank and Turkey’s human rights record.

Ankara’s purchase of the S-400s has also triggered US sanctions. In December 2020 Washington blacklisted Turkey’s Defence Industry Directorate its chief Ismail Demir and three other employees.

Erdogan has indicated Ankara still intends to buy a second batch of S-400s from Russia a move that could deepen the rift with Washington.

The US has warned Turkey of further risks to bilateral ties if it bought more weapons from Russia.

Reuters news agency reported earlier this month that Turkey made a request to the United States to buy 40 Lockheed Martin-made F-16 fighter jets and nearly 80 modernisation kits for its existing warplanes.

The request for the jets could have a difficult time getting approval from the US Congress where sentiment towards Turkey has soured deeply over recent years.

There is bipartisan support in the US Congress to push the Biden administration to put further pressure on Ankara primarily over its purchase of Russian weapons and its human rights track record.

Ankara has said it hopes for better ties under US President Joe Biden.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBybmV3c3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvc29sYWVyby10ZWNobm9sb2dpZXMtdG8tcG93ZXItbmFzYXMtbHVjeS1taXNzaW9uLTMwMTQwMTc0NS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SolAero Technologies to Power NASA's Lucy Mission,"ALBUQUERQUE N.M.

Lumber prices have been on a wild ride since the pandemic onset. The price measured per thousand board feet was around $400 in December 2019 before the outbreak. It fell to $236 in April 2020 before skyrocketing over the next year reaching almost $1700 in May this year. The price started crashing as economies were reopening falling to nearly $400 in August. Now it's surging again trading at $755 as of this writing.

Home improvement retail giants Home Depot (HD -0.29%) and Lowe's (LOW -0.47%) sell a lot of lumber to professionals and do-it-yourselfers. Therefore changes in lumber prices can have a significant impact on their business. Let's look at Home Depot and Lowe's and see if the recent lumber prices increase is good or bad news.

Increasing lumber prices decrease spending at Lowe's

Lowe's last reported quarterly financial results on Aug. 18 for the three months ending July 30. Its fiscal third quarter will include results for August September and October. And the price of lumber did not start rising again until mid-September. So for the first half of its third quarter lumber prices hovered at lower levels. Lowe's investors are hoping management secured purchases for large quantities of lumber at those prices.

Lowe's merchandise inventory was already up to $17.3 billion as of July 30 an increase from $13.8 billion the same time last year and $655 million of that was related to higher prices for commodities primarily attributed to lumber.

From a customer viewpoint management noted that folks pulled back spending on projects that required lumber in the mix. That's a typical consumer response; when prices go up quantities purchased decrease. However management also noted that when the cost of lumber was falling in the first few weeks of August customers were spending more on the commodity.

Thankfully Lowe's has implemented digital pricing protocols at most of its stores reducing the time employees spend walking around adjusting the prices of products to account for changes in materials cost. That capability might be paying for itself during all the lumber price volatility. Still the rapidly changing prices and especially increases in lumber prices are not good news for Lowe's and it's likely discouraging some customers from going forward on projects they would otherwise undertake.

Home Depot has a customer-friendly policy on lumber prices

While commodity price volatility is harmful to Lowe's it is more so for Home Depot. The company has a customer-friendly policy on the matter that could be detrimental to near-term profitability. Here is CEO Craig Menear addressing the company's stance on lumber-price volatility:

[When it comes to pricing goods] ... we always have a philosophy that we want to lead the market down and lag going up to remain as competitive as possible for our customers and that actually created an impact which in this quarter was unique that we normally don't see.

That means Home Depot absorbs higher prices for a while before passing them along to customers and drops prices soon after commodity prices decrease. In other words Home Depot is willing to take a hit on profit margins to provide customer-friendly pricing. This policy may gain customers' loyalty over the long term but hurts profit margins during such volatile price changes as what's going on with lumber right now.

Fortunately for both Home Depot and Lowe's they operate with healthy gross profit margins and can absorb decreases in the metric with minor damages. Furthermore Home Depot's customer-friendly policy is apparent in its decreasing gross profit margin while Lowe's expanded from 2020 onward (see chart). The trend is likely to continue with Home Depot suffering more damage to gross profit margins with lumber price volatility.

Still this is no reason to choose Lowe's over Home Depot when considering a home improvement retailer stock to buy. The benefits of Home Depot's policy could come forth over the long term through higher customer loyalty.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm8uY28udWsvMjAyMS8xMC8xNy9qZWZmLWxvd2UtZXZpY3RlZC1mcm9tLXRpZ2VyLWtpbmctcGFyay1hZnRlci1mYWlsaW5nLXRvLXBheS1kZWJ0cy0xNTQzNjY5OS_SAW5odHRwczovL21ldHJvLmNvLnVrLzIwMjEvMTAvMTcvamVmZi1sb3dlLWV2aWN0ZWQtZnJvbS10aWdlci1raW5nLXBhcmstYWZ0ZXItZmFpbGluZy10by1wYXktZGVidHMtMTU0MzY2OTkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeff Lowe 'evicted from Tiger King park after failing to pay debts',"Jeff Lowe has reportedly been evicted from Tiger King park (Picture: Netflix)

Tiger King star Jeff Lowe has reportedly been evicted from his park after allegedly failing to rent and other damages.

Lowe who took over the zoo previously owned by Joe Exotic is starting over in a new location after the park’s owner claimed the 56-year-old businessman owed more than $10000 (£7000) in unpaid rent and other damages.

The court documents presented showed the judge ruled against Lowe meaning the star had to pay immediately and leave the premises by October 22.

TMZ sources reported Lowe’s wife Lauren turned up to court and said Lowe was taking care of their sick child.

Lauren also asked the court for a 30-day extension before the eviction however her request was denied.

However Lowe isn’t letting this setback get to him. According to TMZ the TV personality will be moving his zoo to a new still to be determined location.

Joe Exotic was sentenced to 22 years in jail for hiring someone to kill rival Carole Baskin (Picture: Netflix)

Lowe was introduced as an investor on Netflix’s Tiger King back in 2015 when Joe Exotic was struggling financially due to a legal battle with animal rights activist Carole Baskin.

Not much has been said about Lowe’s background but in the hit series he reveals how he grew up around big cats because his grandfather was a circus owner.

Lowe had his first cat when he was 15 years old and went on to own mountain lions and tigers.

In the series he appeared to be rich and even flew Joe out to his mansion in Las Vegas – however in reality this wasn’t the case.

Many viewers undoubtedly assumed the Tiger King chapter was closed as series one ended with Joe’s shock arrest and imprisonment for trying to hire someone to kill longtime nemesis Carole.

However Netflix surprised fans and announced season two will drop before the end of 2021.

Tiger King Murder Mayhem and Madness is available to stream on Netflix.

Zoo but then he took it over — and helped land Exotic in prison.

Ever since the seven-part Netflix series Tiger King: Murder Mayhem and Madness introduced us to the bizarre world of “exotic animal lovers” we’ve had a hard time believing that any of it is real. In order to prove it to ourselves we’ve taken a deeper dive into the lives of these strange characters like the conman Jeff Lowe.

While Joe Exotic was the center of the series it was also Lowe his former associate-turned-enemy that had viewers engaged.

For one thing the man was a walking contradiction. Viewers were quick to note that Jeff Lowe didn’t look and sound like the kind of man who drove a Ferrari flew private and lived in a sprawling mansion. And if he was why did Jeff Lowe and Joe Exotic team up to drive attractive women around Vegas to play with baby tigers?

Lowe made his character clear though when he seamlessly stole Exotic’s livelihood right out from under him.

After stepping in as a benefactor to help Exotic revive his failing sanctuary Lowe managed to shift the ownership of the entire operation over to himself.

Perhaps it came as no shock that Lowe was also revealed to be a petty criminal in addition to being a player and a conman but his potential involvement in an obscene murder-for-hire plot surprised everyone.

Who Is Jeff Lowe The Man Who Took Over Joe Exotic’s Operation?

Lowe was born to Janice and Jerry Lee Lowe in the 1960s and grew up southeast of DeWitt Michigan. After graduating from Eastern High School in Lansing in 1982 Lowe tumbled into the big cat world.

In 1988 Lowe’s cougar Rambo escaped and killed a neighbor’s dog. The Clinton County Sheriff’s Office had to shoot and kill the 150-pound big cat with Lowe’s permission.

“He could have been let out or he could have busted out” said Lowe at the time. “He had always been very content to stay in that cage.”

Lowe himself was mauled by another cougar less than a year later in August 1989. The 24-year-old was cougar-sitting for a friend and ultimately needed 40 stitches for his injuries. His first wife Kathy who Lowe later “beat up and strangled” — made sure they got rid of the animal afterward.

In 1990 Lowe requested permission to keep a 325-pound lion named Rajah in his home. Cougars were out of the question because his cougar-related fiasco resulted in a Clinton County policy requiring people to obtain special permits in order to keep exotic animals in their homes. The township was amenable to Lowe’s request — until the lion escaped.

“The lion got loose and everybody was like ‘Are you kidding me you can just have a lion?'” Charles Sherman the Clinton County prosecutor recalled.

It was this type of demeanor the railing against authority that attracted Joe Exotic to Lowe in the first place. Of course the fact that Lowe allegedly had multimillions to buy his drowning animal sanctuary also helped. Alas Lowe was not the savior Exotic had hoped he’d be.

Inside Jeff Lowe’s Troubled Relationship With The “Tiger King”

Even before Jeff Lowe and Joe Exotic met Lowe already had a storied criminal past.

In 2007 Lowe was sued by Prince for allegedly selling clothes with the singer’s trademarked symbol on them. Lowe purportedly claimed at the time that he worked for Prince though Dale Atkins of the singer’s legal team graciously disagreed.

“I’m not gonna call him a liar but based on any information I have he never worked for Prince — unless you can call getting sued working for him” said Atkins.

The following year Lowe pleaded guilty to federal mail fraud after claiming to work for the Citizens Opposed to Domestic Abuse charity. Lowe had tried to obtain $1 million worth of merchandise to later resell.

In 2015 — the same year he met the Tiger King — Lowe was found not guilty after he brought several big cats to a public gathering amongst civilians.

Meanwhile Lowe was making the bulk of his cash by offering private rides with tiger cubs to Las Vegas tourists. Lowe operated a party bus that would pick up high-paying customers and drive them along the Las Vegas Strip all while playing with big cat cubs.

Sadly tigers Lowe touted around with him through Vegas were suffering from diarrhea urinary tract infections Giardia and malnutrition

Eventually that venture came to legal blows too he failed and after Lowe was arrested for these activities he paid $10000 in restitution and headed to Oklahoma where he convinced Joe Exotic that he was a multimillionaire that could save his ailing sanctuary.

Exotic was saddled with a $1 million judgment following a lawsuit against competitor Carole Baskin. Baskin had sued Exotic for trademark infringement — a case he ultimately lost — and Lowe swooped into Exotic’s life as though he were the answer to all his financial prayers.

Lowe courted Exotic by taking him to the mansion he lived in letting him sit in all the sports cars he kept at his house and generally touting him around in his flashy lifestyle. When Lowe suggested he take over ownership of G.W. Zoo in order to save the park Exotic signed the papers.

Jeff Lowe’s Role In The Attempted Murder Of Carole Baskin

Meanwhile Exotic had struck up a friendship with a local business owner named James Garretson whose dealings were as shady as his friendship was honest.

Exotic had turned to Garretson to help him organize the murder of his competitor Carole Baskin. Unfortunately for Exotic however Garretson was actually an informant for the FBI.

“In late August James Garretson stopped by Joe’s office where Lowe pulled up a map on a computer that detailed Baskin’s property in Tampa” Texas Monthly reported. “He started showing me easy ways to kill her” added Garretson.

But it was allegedly Lowe who first showed Exotic Baskin’s regular bike paths and the images of her home. Garretson also said that Lowe told him to call Baskin and inquire if she wanted to buy G.W. Zoo behind Exotic’s back — and that if he could get her to agree then he’d pay Garretson $100000.

Though the plan failed and Exotic was sentenced to 22 years in federal prison as a result Lowe was never called to testify. He’s consistently denied any involvement in the plot too despite the fact that among the total $94 million lawsuits Exotic has filed against numerous citizens included Lowe.

But as the documentary explained Lowe had collaborated with federal authorities to protect himself and provided officials with enough evidence to put Exotic behind bars. In the end Lowe got away as the sole owner of the zoo — with promising plans to build another one.

Where Are Jeff Lowe And His Wife Lauren Now?

After finishing the series you’re likely wondering what happened to Jeff Lowe and all the other crooks that got called out. According to Lowe and his wife Lauren they aren’t too bothered by their portrayal on Netflix stating “all in all it’s not bad.”

“He made us look like sluts but it’s really helping us get laid” he added. “It worked out okay that way.”

As it stands Lowe has wasted no time in developing a new business venture with yet another Tiger King personality Tim Stark. Though the two planned on building a new zoo on the Texas border together the relationship quickly soured which Exotic claimed from prison wasn’t a surprise.

Stark said that he’d done all the preparatory work for their venture and acted “as his bitch.” Lowe simply used him to foot most of the expenses before Lowe gave him the boot. In a since-deleted Facebook post Lowe arrogantly patted himself on the back while kicking his former friends under the bus.

“I will always believe that our biggest contribution to the animal kingdom was helping the feds take down monsters like Joe Exotic and Tim Stark” he wrote.

Following the show however Lowe has had a number of legal troubles. He and his wife were arrested for DUIs in June 2021 and Lowe was evicted from Tiger King Park in October 2021 allegedly because of unpaid rent and other damages.

LULU,Lululemon Athletica,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vdGhldmFyc2l0eS5jYS8yMDIxLzEwLzE2L2x1bHVsZW1vbi1hdGhsZXRpY2EtdGVhbS1jYW5hZGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,lululemon athletica: Team Canada quality or a middle school fad?,"You circa 2010 and Canada’s Olympic team just gained a common trait: repping lululemon athletica.

The Vancouver-based company lululemon has been announced as Team Canada’s official outfitter until 2028 replacing Hudson’s Bay Canada. This deal means that athletes coaches and staff will be wearing lululemon at the Olympics’ opening and closing ceremonies media appearances and around the athletes’ village.

Are you reminiscing about middle school yet? So were we. So we decided to feed into our nostalgia and put this brand to the test.You’re welcome Team Canada.

Four of our bravest writers dug deep into their closets strapped on their lululemon gear and searched for the hardest UTrain exercises to test the quality of this gear.

Stylish and comfortable — Robyn Loves

In the last 18 months of COVID-19 lockdowns my wardrobe has slowly become composed of stretchy waistbands and soft sweaters.

lululemon has managed to find the balance between the athleisure we all need while looking put-together enough to be seen virtually or in person. With this in mind I joined the Mindful Moments yoga class at 6:00 pm on Thursday through the U of T Virtual Fitness Studio. I was wearing the lululemon Align High-Rise leggings with pockets and the Swiftly Tech Long Sleeve Shirt 2.0. For bonus points I used the Lululemon Reversible Yoga mat.

I love the look of the leggings. The material is soft but thinner than some of lululemon’s other leggings. Over the years in my accumulated struggles with putting these pants on I had damaged the seams but they held together well otherwise. Equally as important these pants have real pockets. The pockets can fit a phone or keys with minimal slipping of the waistband. Overall the pants are comfy fit very well and would fare equally well in a yoga class as they would in a cardio or weights session.

The same is true for the shirt; it’s comfortable and worked well in this yoga class. However it would also be comfortable when tackling cardio or other workouts especially in the cooler months. Its fabric is light and breathable and the sleeves are long enough and don’t slide up when I lift my hands. In other words it’s great for tall people. The sleeves are tight and the torso is looser than most lululemon shirts; for other workouts this is fine but a fitted shirt would have been better with the type of movement in a yoga class.

Overall lululemon’s pieces were comfortable for the Mindful Moments yoga class. The materials and fit were great and the outfit looked put-together enough that I could answer a Zoom call or run out to get coffee without having to change.

In my opinion Team Canada’s choice of lululemon gear will have the athletes looking stylish — unless they were really a fan of the Canadian tuxedo in 2021. More importantly they’ll also be ready for practice or competition heading into the 2022 Beijing Olympic Games.

Trendy not weight-friendly — Alexa DiFrancesco

Two words: Dominican Republic.

In five short days I’ll be boarding a flight to this destination. As a former swimmer that’s into fitness this fact leaves me with one mission: to develop abs as tight as I possibly can.

This is where lululemon comes in. My closet consists of two pieces from the outfitter: the Unlimit High Rise Tights and the Scuba Oversized Zip Hoodie. Both items are hand-me-downs that are at least 10 years old. I threw them on and pressed play on UTrain’s NO BOUNDARIES: BARRE video that I found on YouTube.

The first exercises were leg stretches followed by squats. My leggings had a semi-loose fit which made the movements easy to execute without tightness.

Next up were planks with shoulder taps. When I exercise my abs I opt to tuck a handheld weight under my waistband to increase my core strength. However I couldn’t do this while wearing lululemon — because of the stretchiness of my leggings the weight rolled out of my pants and onto the ground much to the dismay of my sleeping family. The same incident happened during a downward-dog stretch and push-ups.

Where my leggings were lacking my sweater pulled through. I wore it unzipped; because of its slim fit its sides didn’t fall in front of my face and distract me from holding the plank. Its sleeves also covered the bottom of my hands providing a soft mediator against the carpet.

Halfway through my workout I started to feel warm. I was swinging my arms while squatting; the warm material of my sleeves made me hyperaware of how sweaty my arms had gotten. My house’s air conditioning still turned on from summer did little to ease my suffering.

On the bright side I looked as hot as I felt. My sweater’s snug fit hugged my figure accentuating my core muscles and my waist. Its colours — a blue and white ombré — made me look so effortlessly put-together that I was tempted to do a grocery store run to show off my outfit.

Obviously Team Canada won’t be repping winter sweaters while competing in their events. Nor will they be tucking weights under their waistbands. And don’t Olympians deserve to look hot too? For these reasons I have no choice but to support our team’s switch in partnerships — after all who voluntarily buys clothing from Hudson’s Bay anyways?

“Stick to yoga” — Lilly Turmel

I’m sure that most of the Canadian population has heard of lululemon — it is a staple brand for athletic wear especially because it was founded in Vancouver. Despite its fame I had doubts if it was good enough for the Olympics.

I took some of my lululemon favourites and decided to test them out at the Athletic Centre where I participated in a dance cardio class with UTrain.

I wore my all-time favourite lululemon product the Wunder Under leggings and a recent addition to my closet the Swiftly Tech Short Sleeve Shirt 2.0. I chose these two not only because they are lululemon’s staples but because both the Wunder Under and Swiftly Tech fabric technologies appear in lululemon’s Team Canada collection.

lululemon advertises its clothing mostly for running dance and yoga. Naturally I felt this class would be the perfect test for whether or not it can withstand a good workout. During the class my apparel held up very well. It’s super comfortable and easy to move in and the biggest success was that the leggings don’t slide down while I’m moving! I’m not sure if anyone else has this problem but if I’m running or jumping a lot I find that my leggings slip down. lululemon’s leggings didn’t do this at all.

My biggest complaint was that the leggings weren’t very good at being sweat-wicking — when I became too sweaty I started to get itchy. My suggestion: stick to doing yoga in them.

An empowering nostalgia — Andrea Zhao

It started innocently enough: a couple weeks ago I agreed to write a fun piece about doing UTrain workouts in lululemon clothing. I saw it as the perfect opportunity to further procrastinate on all the work I was already behind on. I’ll go for a class I thought to myself and have a delightful time in one of the shiny fancy gymnasiums that I would finally have an excuse to visit.

However I soon discovered that my fleeting fantasies were not to be. My incredible time management skills won out once again and I didn’t get around to the registration until only a few days before the article was due. By that time there was only one class I could attend which — unsurprisingly — still had spots open: the ever-dreaded Run Club. I hesitated as I hovered my mouse over the big blue button which would seal my one-way ticket to the Land of All Pain and No Gain.

When I reached the class it took several embarrassing minutes to scan my TCard to even enter the premises. After making it in and out of the changing room unscathed I emerged in my trusty old lululemon leggings — now practically on life support but beloved nevertheless — and motored down to meet the rest of the group in front of the entrance.

The only time in my life that I could have called myself a runner — if I have ever had the right to do so — was in the 10th grade when I joined my school’s cross-country team. This meant dragging myself out of bed at 5:30 am so I could make the 7:00 am practice downtown. I had convinced myself to sacrifice sleep and comfort in the name of health and wellness. This had worked: it was always chilly even with my lululemons on and my bones would start to creak after 10 laps but there was also a freeing feeling after the last home stretch sprint of each practice. It was a certain kind of irreplicable euphoria I’d been chasing ever since.

This is the point in the story at which I must make use of tropes and clichés galore as the UTrain class ended up being an absolute highlight of my week. I was — unfortunately? happily? — deprived of angst-inducing material which would no doubt have made for a much better read. The class jogged over to Queen’s Park as a group and did laps around the gravel track alternating between a more leisurely pace for most of the run and a quicker tempo at the end of each lap. I was not the fastest person there nor did I have much stamina or technique but I had a good time as I bounced around on the rocky road.

It was around 9:00 pm when I began walking home. Heading down that familiar path next to the Varsity stadium in my old lululemons I felt nearly as free as I did years ago. I fully support Team Canada’s choice to partner with lululemon; when the athletes wear their uniforms years after they compete I hope that they’ll also be hit with the realization that some things never change.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Magical' $1.8M treehouse-like home in the Oakland Hills for sale,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/magical-treehouse-like-home-oakland-hills-19451043.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmZ2F0ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS9hcnRpY2xlL21hZ2ljYWwtdHJlZWhvdXNlLWxpa2UtaG9tZS1vYWtsYW5kLWhpbGxzLTE5NDUxMDQzLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvYm94LW9mZmljZS1raW5nZG9tLW9mLXRoZS1wbGFuZXQtb2YtdGhlLWFwZXMtMTIzNTkxMTExOC_SAVlodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1L2JveC1vZmZpY2Uta2luZ2RvbS1vZi10aGUtcGxhbmV0LW9mLXRoZS1hcGVzLTEyMzU5MTExMTgvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ Still Reigning With $52M-$55M Opening – Saturday Box Office Update,"SATURDAY AM: For those hooked on a theory last weekend that star power no longer works in opening films their concerns are further underscored this weekend as a bunch of no-name apes are driving 20th Century Studios/Disney’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes to what might be the biggest B.O. opening this May of $52M-$55M. This is all fueled by PLFs and Imax screens which are delivering 44% of the weekend’s till. Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak exits showed that 43% of the moviegoers bought tickets because they love the franchise natch.

We’ll see if a Cannes Premiere this week can lift Furiosa past its current $40M-$50M projection but word of mouth is excellent out of early screenings for the George Miller directed Mad Max: Fury Road prequel. Unlike Disney with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny last Cannes a movie that wasn’t ready for primetime Warners is truly in pole position here to blast Furiosa off.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes posted a very good Friday of $22.2M thanks to late night business which isn’t that far from the first Friday results of Tim Burton’s 2001 version ($24.6M) and ahead of Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M) and pennies lighter than War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M). However the Wes Ball directed version of the 56-year old franchise gets a B Cinemascore and 3 1/2 stars/77% on Screen Engine/Comscore’s PostTrak so hopefully these apes don’t lose their muscle. On a whole 85% of the CinemaScore audience gave Kingdom an A or a B. That’s one of the lowest grades for an Apes movie in the millennium down there with Burton’s which got a B-. Rotten Tomatoes’ audience score has eased to 79%. Still good on Disney for getting this movie opened their first try with the franchise post 20th Century Fox. Despite the audience exits there’s confidence at Disney for the sequel to arrive at the higher end of its projections due to its better-than-expected Friday.

Social media monitor RelishMix detected mixed to positive word of mouth before Kingdom‘s opening. That said on the bright side: “Fans anticipating the sequel seem excited primarily because of one thing — sheer love for the past three films. ‘This looks freaking incredible. I gotta rewatch all the previous ones before this comes out. These movies are so cool.’ The quality of the past films is driving immense interest in this one” ‘This is one of the best franchises ever made. Every movie was awesome. A near-perfect trilogy. I was not expecting a fourth installment but man this looks great!’ Whatever direction the Apes franchise goes next it looks like fans will follow.”

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes saw 64% men turnout with 18-34 year olds repping 57% of the audience with the 25-34 year old segment being the biggest demo at close to a third. Solid diversity demos in 35% Caucasian 27% Latino and Hispanic 22% Black and 9% Asian. Those moviegoers going bananas for this sequel were in the South South Central and West. AMC Burbank is currently the highest grossing theater in the nation with $67K.

The social media universe for Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes stands at 331.6M followers across TikTok Facebook X YouTube and Instagram. Compared to other action sci-fi comps Kingdom‘s smu runs 24% above genre norms but below recent pics such as Dune: Part Two (575.7M) and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (508.8M) and even Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (393M).

Ryan Gosling in ‘The Fall Guy’ Universal Pictures

Universal’s second weekend of Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt’s Fall Guy is eyeing $14.4M -48% a very good hold. The second weekend is better than Lost City‘s -51% but a little lighter as that Sandra Bullock-Channing Tatum film posted $14.7M. The pic’s slither out of the gate had more to do with the marketplace and the insider type of movie that it was and less about stars — it was Gosling’s third highest opening of his career. Some were even put off by the mixed genres. “It’s a problem when you’re pushing a romantic comedy and a majority of men show up” sniped one rival studio source.

Elsewhere there’s Briarcliff Entertainment’s comedy satire Not Another Church Movie booked at 1108 theaters which had no P&A spend and is resulting in $120K Friday and a $300K 3-day. Critics didn’t think it was funny at 17% on RT nor did moviegoers at 44%. Johnny Mack wrote and directed the movie which stars Mickey Rouke as the Devil Jamie Foxx as God and Kevin Daniels as Taylor Pharry.

Overall weekend stands at $93.8M which is 27% ahead of last weekend but 7% off from the same frame in May a year ago when the second weekend of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 delivered $62M.

Wes Ball’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes from 20th Century Studios the first Apes release under the Disney empire is looking at $21M-$22M today (which includes previews) for a what is looking like a $52M-$55M opening at 4075 theaters. Tracking saw it around $50M.

Also the opening is in the vicinity of the first and third chapter of the previous millennium trilogy: 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes ($19.5M Friday $54.8M 3-day) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes ($22.1M Friday $56.2M 3-day). RT Audience sentiment is still at 82%.

UPDATED AFTER EXCLUSIVE: 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes filed $6.6M in previews per Disney. As we told you $1.6M of that comes from Wednesday night fan screenings hence Thursday’s $5M ties with the preview cash of the franchise’s previous chapter War for the Planet of the Apes.

That preview number is above Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire ($4.7M) which saw a $45M 3-day opening and it’s under the $7.2M posted by Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny which turned in a $60.4M domestic start.

The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is playing in 4075 theaters on all premium screens including 40 Imax 950 PLFs 300 Dbox/4D Motion screens and 90 Screen X locations.

Rest of the week is as follows:

Fall Guy (Uni) 4002 theaters Thu $1.5M (-8% from Wed) Total $36M/Wk 1 Challengers (AMZ MGM) 3477 theaters Thu $897K (-5%) Wk $11.5M Total $33.3M/Wk 2 Star Wars – Phantom Menace (Dis) 2700 theaters Thu $347K (-19%) Wk $10.5M/Total $484.9M lifetime/Wk 1 re-release Tarot (Sony) 3104 theaters Thu $466K (+7%) Wk $8.5M/Wk 1 Godzilla x Kong (Leg/WB) 2884 theatres Thu $233K (-14%) Wk $5.7M Total $189.3M/Wk 6

EXCLUSIVE: Sources tell us that 20th Century Studios’ Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is off to a good start with previews around $6.5M. That’s comprised of Thursday night money which began accruing at 3PM and around $1.6M from Wednesday fan shows that began at 7PM.

We’ll know tomorrow AM if it’s the best Thursday night ever for an Apes movie besting 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes which did $5M on its preview night before a $22.1M Friday and $56.2M opening. This Wes Ball directed PG-13 sequel takes place 300 years after the events of Matt Reeves’ War for the Planet of the Apes.

Already Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes‘ Thursday has bested that of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’ which did $4.25M before minting a $27.6M Friday and massive 3-day of $72.6M still a record domestic debut for the Apes‘ franchise.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ is 82% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics and 82% with RT audiences.

Tonight’s results are a bit of fresh air next to the $3.15M Wednesday and Thursday previews of Universal’s Fall Guy last weekend which fizzled with a $27.7M opening. While fans always populate Thursday night shows hopefully Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at a 2 hours and 25 minutes running time can hold it together throughout the weekend.

Hands down tonight it’s the best preview cash for a Ball movie beating all of his Maze Runner titles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvZmxvcmlkYS1hLW0tYmFja3MtYXdheS1mcm9tLWR1YmlvdXMtMjM3bS1kb25hdGlvbi0wMDE1NzIzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Florida HBCU backs away from dubious $237M donation,"“With regards to the gift and the processing of it and so forth in terms of future processing we’ve already decided it’s in our best interest to put that on hold” Robinson said during the meeting.

The alleged windfall donation to FAMU came from Batterson Farms Corporation’s Gregory Gerami and the Isaac Batterson Family 7th Trust and would’ve almost tripled the school’s endowment helping students and faculty for generations. But after the announcement was made — with major fanfare during a Saturday commencement ceremony — skepticism quickly quelled the celebration.

For one Batterson Farms Corporation appears to be a relatively small outfit based in Texas selling hydroponic hemp farm products leading some to question how its stocks could be worth millions. The doubts have been heightened by reports about Gerami’s past dealings including a $95 million donation to Coastal Carolina University in 2020 that was terminated by school officials only weeks after it was publicly announced.

FAMU foundation members raised these points during Thursday’s emergency meeting while venting frustrations about how school staff transacted a nine-figure donation without telling them or the board of trustees. Some board members claimed to have learned about the donation from the university’s press release or from friends after graduation. The board of trustees had already called a special meeting for next week to discuss the donation before Thursday’s shock announcement.

“How did we get this far without knowledge of the transaction or the donor?” asked Chekesha Kidd a foundation member who is co-founder and CEO of Kinumi a concierge service.

School leaders — including Robinson and Shawnta Friday-Stroud FAMU’s vice president for university advancement — said they were barred from discussing the gift publicly due to a non-disclosure agreement. They defended accepting the donation from Batterson Farms Corporation noting the potential upside should the company go public. Batterson Farms did not respond to a request for comment about the potential future value of its stock.

Still the shares could be worth “$500 million or it could be zero” Laurence A. Humphries a member of the foundation’s board noted at the meeting.

“Yes there is clearly risk and we are seeing that in everything that has shaken out” Friday-Stroud said during the meeting. “But at the time that was the decision.”

FAMU did not reach out to Coastal Carolina University as they vetted Gerami’s gift officials confirmed Thursday.

That failed donation was one of several red flags that should have been raised during the vetting of FAMU’s gift according to finance experts.

The gift would have been paid out over the next decade according to an agreement obtained through a records request Thursday by the Tallahassee Democrat. The agreement shows that Gerami “donated 14 million shares of stock of intrinsic value worth at least $239000000 and will donate an additional $61000000 over 10 years” — valuations that don’t match what the school announced only days ago.

The agreement though does not specifically name a company and it’s unclear where and how the stocks were valued.

“Where does this valuation come from?” Rebel Cole a professor of finance at Florida Atlantic University said in an interview. “It raises more questions than it answers. If I were a dog my hackles would be up.”"

As energy sector demand roars back and commodities market pundits talk about the return of $100 oil there are new factors in the energy sector pushing producers to extract less — from greater fiscal discipline in the U.S. shale after a decade-long bust to ESG pressure and the ways in which energy executives are being paid by shareholders. In 2018 Royal Dutch Shell became the first oil major to link ESG to executive pay earmarking 10% of long-term incentive plans (LTIP) to reducing carbon emissions. BP followed suit using ESG measures in both its annual bonus and its LTIP. While the European majors were first Chevron and Marathon Oil are among the U.S. -based oil companies that have added greenhouse gas emissions targets to executive compensation plans. The oil and gas companies are joining dozens of public corporations across all sectors — including Apple Clorox PepsiCo and Starbucks — that tie ESG to executive pay. Last week industrial Caterpillar created the position of chief sustainability & strategy officer last and said it will now tie a portion of executive compensation to ESG. As of last year 51% of S&P 500 companies used some form of ESG metrics in their executive compensation plans according to a report from Willis Towers Watson. Half of companies include ESG in annual bonus or incentive plans while only 4% use it in long-term incentive plans (LTIP). A similar report from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) found that 45% of FTSE 100 firms had an ESG target in the annual bonus LTIP or both. ""We will continue to see the percentage of companies [linking ESG to pay] increase"" said Ken Kuk senior director of talent and rewards at Willis Towers Watson. And although right now more than 95% of instances of ESG metrics are in annual bonuses ""there is a shift more toward long-term incentives"" he said. A related survey by the firm last year of board members and senior executives revealed that nearly four in five respondents (78%) are planning to change how they use ESG with their executive incentive plans over the next three years. This reflects the current purpose-over-profit debate in the corporate world with the environment ranking as the top priority.

Pressuring the fossil fuel industry

In 2020 petroleum accounted for about a third of U.S. energy consumption but was the source of 45% of the total energy-related CO2 emissions according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Natural gas also provided about a third of the nation's energy and produced 36% of CO2 emissions. Oil and gas companies have largely abandoned coal which accounted for about 10% of energy use and accounted for nearly 19% of emissions. Investors are increasingly focused on ESG and more have been pressuring the fossil fuel industry to shrink its global carbon footprint and the associated risks to operations and bottom lines. ""The increase in momentum that the investment community has put around ESG is driving the discussion into climate [change]"" said Phillippa O'Connor a London-based partner at PwC and a specialist in executive pay. ""We can't underestimate the impact that investors will continue to have for the next couple of years."" Investor input played a decisive role in Shell's seminal decision as well as those at competitors that followed suit. And while executive compensation wasn't high on the docket at Exxon Mobil's shareholder meeting last spring the industry was gobsmacked when the climate-activist hedge fund Engine No. 1 won three seats on its board of directors. The coup as it was roundly described may ultimately deemphasize Exxon's reliance on carbon-based businesses and move it more toward investments in solar wind and other renewable energy sources — and in the process lead to ESG-linked pay packages. ""We look forward to working with all of our directors to build on the progress we've made to grow long-term shareholder value and succeed in a lower-carbon future"" Exxon chairman and CEO Darren Woods said in a statement shortly after the proxy vote.

Meanwhile financial regulators also are eyeing climate change as a factor for investors to consider. The Securities and Exchange Commission has indicated that ESG disclosure regulation will be a central focus under new Chair Gary Gensler from climate to other ESG factors such as labor conditions. There's nothing novel about incentivizing corporate leaders to hit predetermined targets particularly for increasing revenue profits and shareholder returns by certain increments. Oil and gas companies because of their hazardous extraction operations — from underground fracking wells to offshore drilling rigs — have for years established incentives for improving workplace safety. Following the Enron accounting and fraud scandal in 2001 meeting new governance mandates (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) was the basis for rewards. Then came added remuneration for achieving internal goals set for quality health and wellness recycling energy conservation and community service — wrapped into corporate social responsibility. Sustainability then became the catch-all for establishing executive performance metrics around environmental stewardship diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace and ethical business practices — all of which now reside under the ESG umbrella.

ESG is tricky and existing carbon targets have critics

Although the trend is expected to continue experts warn that the process can be tricky and targets designed by oil and gas companies to combat climate already have critics. Including emission-reduction targets in executive pay packages may compel oil and gas companies to walk their public-relations talk about being good corporate citizens. Yet the methodology can be challenging. ""It's not the what but the how"" said Christyan Malek an industry analyst at JP Morgan. For example a company can state how much is has lowered its global carbon emissions in a given year. ""But that's very limited"" he said ""because they're not disclosing their emissions by region"" which can widely vary from one location to the next. ""When it comes to carbon intensity it's in the [overall] portfolio."" Or a company can ply in greenwashing through carbon offsets. ""I have massive emissions so I'll [plant] a bunch of forests and that way I neutralize myself"" Malek said — while the company is still producing the same amount of emissions. ""You're disclosing in a way that's better optically than it is in reality. Disclosure has to work hand in hand with compensation."" The optics of oil and gas companies paying well for doing good might help the industry's image among a general public increasingly concerned about the calamitous impacts of human-induced climate change exacerbated by the latest and most dire related U.N. report and a string of deadly floods hurricanes heatwaves and wildfires. But experts focused on climate and the energy sector note that sector targets often don't go far enough related to reducing intensity of fossil fuel operations not underlying production of fossil fuels and dealing only with Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions not the Scope 3 emissions which are the largest share of the climate problem. O'Connor said that companies should be careful how they align ESG metrics with incentives. ""ESG is a broad and complex set of metrics and expectations"" she said. ""That's one of the reasons why we're seeing a number of companies use multiple metrics rather than a single measure to get a better balance of considerations and perspectives across the ESG forum. There isn't a one-size-fits-all policy in this and there's a danger in trying to move too quickly and revert to some kind of standard."" The pandemic placed an unexpected hard top on compensation incentives in 2020 and with the global economy decimated last year Shell's remuneration board decided to forego bonuses for CEO Ben van Beurden CFO Jessica Uhl and other top executives and there was no direct link in their LTIPs to delivery of energy transition targets. The energy sector has roared back this year amid strong global economic growth and demand for oil and gas amid lower supply has led to a spike in prices. That could incentivize oil and gas companies to produce more but at the same time compensation to to energy transition targets ae going up. At Shell the 2021 annual bonus is targeted at 120% of base salary for the CEO and CFO which remain the same as set in 2020 at $1842530 and $1200900 respectively. Within this though progress in energy transition is now up from 10% to 15% of the total amount that can be awarded. In addition energy transition is part of the LTIP which vests three years in the future based on Shell's 2020 annual report.

“One of the most impactful benefits of WIMOs is the ability for our members to serve our hometown river communities and our annual cleanup days with Living Lands & Waters are definitely a highlight of our many volunteer opportunities” said Alice Momenee executive vice president of the WIMOs national board and marine senior supply chain contracts representative for Marathon Petroleum Company. “With WIMOs being heavily active in many of the nation’s river cities—be it New Orleans Houston Paducah Louisville Cincinnati Catlettsburg Pittsburgh and others—our women can and do make a strong impact.”

The WIMOs group connects women serving the maritime industry in a variety of roles and allows for networking opportunities mentoring and education. WIMOs now includes roughly 500 members from more than 110 companies across the country.

Group activities include lunch-and-learn sessions facility tours training seminars and networking functions.

Recently WIMOs members spoke for education day at the Breakbulk Americas conference founder and executive director Kasey Eckstein said. Eckstein and WIMOs national president Holly Normand presented on the inland barge industry to generate interest from numerous Texas college students who participated Eckstein said. She then also participated on a panel about diversity and inclusion.

It was the third year the Ohio Valley chapter hosted other WIMOs chapters for the Cincinnati cleanup with members coming in from surrounding states.

“We love [Living Lands & Waters] because we know they’re doing this great work on the river system that is just incredible and nobody else is doing that sort of thing to that scale” Momenee said.

Living Lands & Waters also includes several women working within the industry she said.

WIMOs volunteers removed more than 2250 pounds of garbage from the Ohio River. The trash included tires barrels barge line and even a freezer.

Living Lands & Waters a non-profit headquartered in East Moline Ill. has worked with more than 118000 volunteers to remove more than 11 million pounds of trash from the country’s rivers since being founded in 1998. The group has also educated more than 11000 students and planted more than 1.6 million trees according to the organization’s website.

Rachel Loomis Living Lands & Waters education coordinator said the organization is always glad to partner with WIMOs.

“We have been able to connect with some great women here in the industry in the Ohio Valley primarily” she said.

She said the two groups share goals of connecting people to the river and instilling in them the desire to preserve and protect the environment while also empowering and educating.

Momenee said the river cleanup left the group feeling connected to their communities their careers and to each other.

“We know that we are not only important contributors in an industry that is vital to our national economy but we are making a tangible difference where we work and live” she said. “Just being together as a group getting our hands dirty and helping others is meaningful and keeps our members engaged and motivated to plan the next function.”

The group also left inspired to continue their environmental work into the future. WIMOs is also participating in a Marathon Petroleum Company-sponsored Ohio River cleanup later this month in Catlettsburg Ky.

Kevin Robbins commercial mortgage consultant for Baypoint Financial Services Inc said the next steps in the project is to complete environmental reviews of the land and to have a geological study done to make sure the property is viable to construct the five-story hotel that will have about 70 rooms.

Robbins said Baypoint is working hand-in-hand with another developer Rick Patel who owns the Ramada Inn in Alpena Marriott International as well as city officials to make the hotel a reality.

The hotel which will have parking on the ground-level and four floors of lodging and other amenities would face Water Street and have many amenities including a fitness center a market a hot breakfast and coffee bar and potentially up to three outdoor patio areas including one on the second floor.

The site plans can be amended as cost estimates are received and geological data comes in Robbins said.

Robbins said the proposed project has come together quickly saying most of the heavy lifting thus far has been done in about the last two months. He said all involved are excited about the prospects of the new hotel in Alpena and the location downtown.

“This project and the site are very attractive to Marriott” Robbins said. “We know there are some environmental issues but we feel we have a pretty good grasp on what they are from previous studies.”

Robbins said depending on the degree of environmental issues it is possible the developers could request a Brownfield tax exemption from the city to help reimburse it for the cost of any cleanup or remediation that may be needed.

A Brownfield property is described by the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy as a property in which the redevelopment or reuse of the property may be complicated by the presence or perception of contamination. Revitalizing and redeveloping these properties protects the environment reuses existing infrastructure.

The city and state have utilized Brownfield incentives in the past to help businesses like the Holiday Inn Express and Austin Brothers Beer Company become realities.

Because of the environmental and geological work needed at the site and any assistance the developers may need from the city Robbins said it is possible the six-month could be extended until all the puzzle pieces are in place.

Robbins said other possible alterations to the site are also being considered. He said it is yet to be determined on where on the property the building would be built and once that is determined simple things like moving power lines might be needed.

“We need to find out if the building will butt up closer to the street or to the river” he said. “We might have to rearrange things just a little.”

Although things are moving rapidly now it doesn’t mean groundbreaking is imminent. Robbins said the best-case-scenario is that it could happen in the spring but he suspects the summer or fall is a more feasible goal.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUvdmFjYW50LWJ1aWxkaW5nLW1pZHRvd24tc2V0LWJlY29tZS1kZWx0YS1tYXJyaW90dNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vacant building in Midtown set to become Delta by Marriott,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.crainscleveland.com/real-estate/vacant-building-midtown-set-become-delta-marriott on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYWluc2NsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUvdmFjYW50LWJ1aWxkaW5nLW1pZHRvd24tc2V0LWJlY29tZS1kZWx0YS1tYXJyaW90dNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLWluc2lkZXIvYWZ0ZXIteWVhcnMtb2YtaG9wZS1mdXR1cmUtb2Ytbm9ydGgtc3RyaXAtc3RpbGwtaW4tZmx1eC0yNDYwOTg4L9IBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLWluc2lkZXIvYWZ0ZXIteWVhcnMtb2YtaG9wZS1mdXR1cmUtb2Ytbm9ydGgtc3RyaXAtc3RpbGwtaW4tZmx1eC0yNDYwOTg4L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After years of hope future of north Strip still in flux,"Locals have long predicted better days ahead for the north edge of the Strip but a burst of news shows the area is still in flux.

After years of hope future of north Strip still in flux

The north edge of the Strip for years a sleepy stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard got a big boost of momentum this year.

Resorts World Las Vegas debuted in June to an estimated crowd of 20000 visitors and 5000 VIPs. Huge crowds waited outside to get in on opening night and the 3500-room casino resort generated nearly $15 million in revenue during its first six days developer Genting Group reported.

Locals have long predicted better days ahead for the north Strip in large part because of Resorts World. But as a burst of news showed this week the area’s future is still in flux.

Marriott International confirmed Thursday that it reached an “amicable settlement” with the owner of the unfinished former Fontainebleau that resulted in the hotel chain exiting the long-stalled casino project which got started during the mid-2000s bubble and has yet to open.

Florida developer Jeffrey Soffer’s firm Fontainebleau Development which acquired the property in February said in a statement that as it “moves forward with the project in Las Vegas we feel it is important to make clear that upon opening the hotel will be managed and operated by Fontainebleau Development.”

It also noted the agreement with Marriott announced in 2018 “was made with the building’s previous owner.”

“Having come full circle and taken ownership of the site in Las Vegas we intend to fulfill our original vision and deliver the same extraordinary hospitality experience that our guests have come to expect from Fontainebleau Development” the statement said.

Soffer was the project’s original developer. His group hasn’t announced when the 60-plus-story resort would open or what it would be called.

Meanwhile Majestic Las Vegas developer Lorenzo Doumani said Wednesday that he plans to start construction on his 720-room nongaming hotel in the first quarter of 2022 after stating in January that he expected to break ground in late summer or early fall this year.

However Doumani says he is “still on track” to complete the roughly $850 million project in late 2024.

Also the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority board of directors on Tuesday approved selling 10 acres of the former Riviera site to a Chilean developer for $120 million — a lucrative deal that may not result in a new project anytime soon.

Under the terms of the sale the buyer must start construction by Jan. 1 2031 — more than nine years from now — or the LVCVA can buy back the land.

After the real estate frenzy of 15 years ago flamed out the north Strip was saddled with huge tracts of land where projects never materialized and a few unfinished megaresorts that were left to collect dust. Since then the area has seen other big plans but they have largely stalled or fizzled. Even Resorts World debuted five years after the developers initially planned to open.

Ex-NBA player Jackie Robinson’s proposed arena and hotel project which he announced in late 2013 still hasn’t materialized and casino operator Wynn Resorts hasn’t said when it plans to develop its 38 acres of land between Resorts World and Fashion Show mall.

Wynn reached a $336 million deal in late 2017 to acquire the plot — former home of the imploded New Frontier and the proposed-but-never-built Alon Las Vegas — and company founder Steve Wynn said in early 2018 that he wanted to move quickly on a project.

Days later The Wall Street Journal reported that Wynn had a decadeslong pattern of sexual misconduct. Wynn who called the allegations “preposterous” soon resigned as chairman and CEO of his company citing “an avalanche of negative publicity.”

On top of all this there’s no telling when the pandemic will be a thing of the past or when Las Vegas will fully recover from the severe economic fallout.

People have been saying for years that the north Strip’s recovery is just around the corner and the area has indeed shown signs of life. But given the state of some plots and projects along that end of the boulevard don’t be surprised to keep hearing about that elusive corner for years to come.

View the current offers here.

Only 100 miles separate Fort Lauderdale from Naples a city perched on the Gulf of Mexico in southwest Florida. Yet once you reach ""the west coast"" (how we South Floridians affectionately refer to Florida's Gulf Coast) you'll find a much slower pace than the pulsating metropolitan vibe of South Florida.

Once the snowbird haven of Midwesterners Naples has expanded its appeal to include families and couples looking for a relaxing getaway.

And as the ""unofficial"" end of summer arrived with Labor Day I was looking forward to one final escape across Alligator Alley to Naples before cooler weather prevailed (yes even in Florida) and my life reverted to biweekly soccer practices homework assignments and the daily work grind.

Drawbacks

(Photo by Juan Ruiz/The Points Guy.)

You'll need a car to go anywhere else. The hotel location is not within walking distance to any offsite restaurants or shops.

The Ritz-Carlton brand lacks special perks or benefits for Marriott Bonvoy's elite members.

As with most Ritz-Carlton properties be prepared for sticker shock.

The hotel's interior lodge-style decor could use an update – but I suppose the classic luxury look could be a draw for some guests.

The 295-room property only has one pool and it's on the smaller side.

The vibe

The sprawling Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort Naples has Mediterranean-style aesthetics — think textured walls stone and wood finishes vibrant textiles and rustic furnishings — which gives it a high-end feel that is suitable for being home to two PGA-level golf courses. Families with small children can be seen in abundance thanks in large part to the waterpark poolscape but the resort equally caters to couples looking for a respite with its laid-back vibe.

Even at full capacity during a holiday weekend the ambiance remained tranquil but also had a sense of activity — an optimal and difficult balance for a busy resort.

The room

You can expect decent-sized rooms measuring 470 square feet and suite sizes starting at 750 square feet. Though the rooms could use some updating they still convey a feeling of old-time glamour with white-marble tiled bathrooms and earth tones that blend well with the resort's tropical motif. Rooms come equipped with a king or two double beds and all feature a personal balcony with seating for two overlooking the resort grounds or a perfectly manicured golf course.

Well-lit marble bathrooms feature a separate bathtub and shower double sink and single-use PAYA hotel toiletries. In-room amenities include complimentary bottles of water Nespresso coffeemakers well-stocked minibars and 55-inch LCD TVs with premium movie channels. All Marriott Bonvoy members receive complimentary in-room Wi-Fi.

Food and drink

The resort has two onsite standalone restaurants Lemonia and RÍA. Lemonia serves daily breakfast and contemporary American cuisine for dinner. RÍA is a newly-added lunch and dinner spot serving a variety of dishes such as Peruvian lomo saltado and other classic Latin American delicacies in a modish yet low-key outdoor setting. If you're the on-the-go type or need a quick fix the resort's Express(o) cafe offers caffeinated beverages and pastries while the Bella Vista Lounge overlooking the 18th hole of Tiburón Golf is the ideal spot for relaxing with a glass of wine or champagne before or after dinner. If you're by the pool and don't want to abandon your sunbathing you can also order lunch right from your pool chair.

At check-in I was offered access to the Club Lounge an exclusive lounge on the second floor offering delectable light snacks a complimentary selection of adult beverages and an excellent morning breakfast. Daily Club Lounge rates are $225 for non-elite Bonvoy members or $175 for Bonvoy elite members (Gold and up) and include internet access and valet parking.

I was admittedly hesitant at first but when I considered breakfast snacks and drinks for a family of four I figured I'd likely save a considerable amount of money over paying à la carte prices. I opted to add lounge access for one day and breakfast for two mornings (think hot stations with bacon scrambled eggs and pancakes and cold options such as smoked salmon charcuterie fruits and pastries) and it was well worth the daily rate.

Amenities and service

True to its name the Ritz Carlton Golf Resort Naples features two Greg Norman-designed PGA-level golf courses. If you don't fancy playing 18 holes you and your family can borrow complimentary golf clubs and golf balls from the hotel's concierge desk and hit the putting green in front of the Bella Vista patio.

Younger children can frolic at the interactive children's splash pool while older children and adults can zoom down waterslides to their heart's content at The Reservoir the property's new riveting waterpark experience.

Additional features include a heated pool with a sundeck indoor playground an entertainment room for kids and hydro clay tennis courts with one-hour complimentary court time and racquet rental included with the resort fee. The onsite spa offers massage and facial treatments while the fitness center has Peloton bikes and a copious amount of cardio and strength-training equipment.

At the Ritz the mission is its guests' genuine care and comfort and it shows. Each time a hotel employee walked by my daughters there was always a reminder about a kid-friendly activity occurring or the tasty treats being passed out soon. This personalized approach to service was recognizable immediately upon arrival when the front-desk employee introduced me by name to the bellhop who would assist us with our luggage – and that pursuit of service excellence was noticeable until the moment we checked out.

Out and about

The beach is only a few minutes away by car. Still you'd be hard-pressed to pull your kids (or even yourself) away from the onsite waterpark with three waterslides and 600-foot mellow and meandering lazy river divine for a leisurely float on a hot Florida day. This is the type of resort where you want to stay on property and enjoy a day out on the golf course by the pool or racing down one of the exhilarating waterslides.

The only time we left the grounds was to have dinner at the resort's beachfront sister property The Ritz-Carlton Naples and get a glimpse of the sunset from its outdoor seaside restaurant Gumbo Limbo. Guests staying at either resort are offered complimentary shuttle service between the properties which are approximately four miles apart. So whether you have a rental car or are mostly staying put you can enjoy the amenities and restaurants at both.

Bottom line

(Photo by Juan Ruiz/The Points Guy.)

Top-notch service an upscale vibe patently family-friendly staff and facilities and an array of exciting activities for your whole group make The Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort Naples a notable option in southwest Florida for your next getaway.

That said if you're coming to Florida seeking oceanfront access steps from your Ritz-Carlton room you may want to instead pick sister property The Ritz-Carlton Naples located on one of Florida's most spectacular beaches."

And the power has shifted to the banks Read this edition online A paid 🔒 weekly emailer that explains fundamental shifts in business technology and finance that happened over the last seven days in India. In a way you’ll never forget. Someone sent you this? Sign up here Good Morning Dear Reader Our story begins two weeks ago on the eve of the first day of October. At the stroke of the midnight hour on 30 September as the month drew to a close and when the world slept thousands of India’s small medium and big internet businesses awoke to pandemonium. That’s because a new rule came into force that night. The rule created by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was the implementation of a key regulation around how businesses in India process recurring payments through credit and debit cards. You are probably familiar with how recurring payments work. You make a purchase perhaps a subscription to Coursera or Netflix or Amazon Prime; and the business charges your card every month until you decide you’ve had enough and ask them to stop. That’s a recurring payment. You enter your card details once give your consent and consume the product until the end of the subscription period. Last year the RBI took a look at this and decided that recurring payments needed a few changes. So it came up with a framework. But for many businesses and consumers it felt like an obstacle course. The RBI mandated that for all transactions up to Rs 5000 (~$67) customers couldn’t just pay and say okay now charge my card. They had to do an additional factor authentication along with a one-time registration process. For transactions above Rs 5000 it was even more onerous—customers would have to explicitly authenticate every transaction every month 24 hours prior to the transaction. In one swift move the RBI effectively killed all recurring payments in India. And it was done not by an explicit ban but by adding layers of consent on top of it which added friction. Of course the RBI justified this the same way most regulations are justified. We did it for the consumers. The primary objective of these rules it argued was to make digital payments in India safe and secure to protect customers from fraudulent transactions and enhance customer convenience. Ah yes. The poor unsuspecting naive consumers who need protection from the big bad companies who charge their credit cards with abandon for months while they helplessly watch unable to do anything at all. On the face of it this rule sounds perfectly reasonable. You merely have to ask the consumer before making a recurring payment. Does that sound too hard? Or unreasonable? Why would anyone not support this? Perhaps you agree with this argument. Perhaps you’ve found yourself on the receiving end when a shady business suddenly charged your card without any warning. This is probably why you welcome this regulation and you think it sounds reasonable. After all it’s for you—the consumer. Incidentally this is why media publications are struggling to get their heads around this regulation. Most of them find it hard to make a coherent argument why a regulation that sounds so good on paper and so well-intentioned is actually a bad idea. It’s partly because they don’t understand how subscription businesses work or why recurring payments exist and what it means for businesses. It’s also because many of them are incentivised not to talk much about it. Today I’ll explain why this is one of the worst things that could have been done to small businesses in India. By implementing this rule cash flows of businesses all over India have been crunched—threatening their survival. It has cut off India as a market for international products and services. Above all the ones who are winning as a result of this regulation are the big legacy incumbents with smaller companies paying the price. Oh incidentally it’s also one of the worst things that could have happened to you—the consumer. You should be mad. Really mad. Let’s dive in. Three misconceptions about recurring payments To understand recurring payments we need to begin at an unlikely place. Shaving blades. And a company we’ve all heard of. Gillette patented the first safety razor over a century ago. In many ways it was the official razor of World War I driven to success by a contract with the US Government who purchased 3.5 million razor blades and gave them to American soldiers. Since then Gillette has ruled the shaving blade market through a combination of a first-mover advantage a massive distribution network and by spending millions of dollars in marketing and branding. If you are reading this chances are you’ve bought Gillette in your lifetime. Perhaps you still do. But the thing about shaving blades is that it’s actually a product that’s fairly simple and it’s hard to differentiate. Humans have been shaving for centuries. At some level a shaving blade is a commodity. It’s purpose is to remove hair. That’s it. It’s hard to extend it to do anything else. So Gillette which found itself as an incumbent started doing what incumbents do with products that can’t be differentiated that easily. It started “innovating”. First it convinced gullible consumers that the perfect shave needed more blades and that a single blade wouldn’t do. It introduced products with two blades. Then three. Then four. It even went all the way up to five and six. It patented all of these designs. And thus began an arms race in the shaving industry. Second it adopted a business model of making refills expensive—a strategy perfected by the laser printer industry. Gillette sold razor handles at a throwaway price but made the cartridges really expensive. As a consequence something that should have been cheap to consumers suddenly became much more expensive. In 2014 it cost over $20 for a pack of cartridge refills. Gillette basically made stuff up out of thin air priced it exorbitantly and convinced you that it was better for the consumer. The Gillette strategy has been ridiculed for decades on late-night shows on memes and on the internet. It’s a running joke. Now as a consumer you could say—well this is how the free market works. If Gillette wanted to do absurd things and price them at a premium consumers were also free to look past them and pick a cheaper option. In theory yes. But put yourself in the shoes of a consumer who wants to buy shaving blades. You walk into a supermarket and head over to the shaving section. You look at the various brands available there. More often than not Gillette thanks to their massive sales team probably commands the most shelf space. If you ask the shopkeeper for a shaving blade he’ll probably give you a Gillette because that’s where his margins are the highest. Sure there are other blades which look just as good at a fraction of what Gillette charges. You aren’t sure about the quality though or the brand. However you may still pick one at random. You may love it. But chances are that when you come back next time that particular brand isn’t there anymore. Or if you travel to another city and walk into another store and head over to the shaving section—you won’t find that particular brand there. You may find others but you’d have to take another risk on another unfamiliar product. But you’ll definitely find a Gillette. It’s everywhere. So you reluctantly buy that seven blade cartridge. Around ten years ago Gilette controlled a 65% market share in the $3.7 billion shaving industry. It did this through a combination of distribution sales marketing R&D and aggressive patent litigation against competitors—all to sell you something with features you don’t need at a price you shouldn’t be paying in the first place. This is Gillette’s unfair advantage. All of this changed quite suddenly in 2012 thanks to a company called Dollar Shave Club. Dollar Shave Club did something extraordinary. It launched a website where you could buy razor blades for just one dollar a month delivered straight to your door. To market the website it created an ad that went viral. It featured the CEO of the company walking around ruthlessly making fun of Gillette (which he never named). He asked why “your razor needs a vibrating handle a flashlight a backscratcher and 10 blades?” But he wasn’t done. Because the next few words transformed the shaving industry. “Stop paying for shave tech you don’t need and stop forgetting to pay for your blades every month—Alejandro and I are gonna’ ship them right to ya.” Dollar Shave Club did something almost no other company did in decades. It took away significant market share from Gillette. And three years later it was sold for over a billion dollars. The smallest David went against the biggest Goliath. And David won. And it did it not by fighting for shelf space in stores or by better R&D or through any meaningful product innovation. It beat Gillette with subscriptions. Driven by recurring payments. The first misconception about recurring payments especially in India is that it’s something shady companies do; a business model that relies on consumer forgetfulness in order to make money. The thinking is that recurring payments are about making a quick buck by exploiting your trust. This is completely inaccurate. The reason why recurring payments work is because consumers are convinced about the quality of a product and demonstrate that conviction through a commitment to keep using that product. This commitment is expressed through an agreement that they will continue to pay to use that product as long as the product delivers. Financially this is expressed through a recurring payment. In other words to get a customer to sign up for a recurring payment is the ultimate signal of trust. Millions trusted Dollar Shave Club and told it to keep sending them blades every month. All that the company needed to do was to sell once and keep a customer as opposed to Gillette which needed to sell again and again to the same customer in all their stores across the country. Recurring payments is what enables Davids like Dollar Shave Club to take on giants like Gillette. Trust is their unfair advantage. Now you might argue that recurring payments may be wonderful but what happens when you don’t really consent to it? Or if the lines of explicit consent are blurry—like a subscription service that makes it hard for you to cancel. What if the service charges you without warning? Surely this is unreasonable. We need some regulation to stop companies from doing this and to protect the consumer you’d argue. I agree. Some companies do this. It is unreasonable. I think they need to be deterred. But regulations don’t do that. Which brings me to my second misconception. What bookshops in Bangalore teach us about regulations If you live in a city like Bangalore like I do you’ll notice something happening. Bookshops are dying. One by one they have been fading out and disappearing. Closing down. The trend was always downward but it’s now accelerated first after demonetisation and then the pandemic. It’s probably happening in your city as well but it’s a bit more stark in a place like Bangalore which is the nerve-centre of product and technology in India. The city is the home of companies like Flipkart—which started off by selling books online and Amazon India which is probably the largest bookseller in the world. So when sales dried up and people started buying online bookshops in Bangalore were forced to innovate. I know Bangalore is a tech hub but I don’t need to tell you that the people who run bookshops aren’t exactly experts in technology business or innovation. Despite this what they did when the chips were stacked against them is nothing short of remarkable. Take the example of Champaca a beautiful bookstore located in the heart of Bangalore. It’s named after the Champaca tree located in its courtyard and it’s one of the most beloved bookstores in the city. When the pandemic hit Champaca needed to do something really innovative in order to survive. So it created a subscription product. What Champaca realised was that it could never hope to compete with companies like Flipkart and Amazon on selection. But it could compete on curation service and knowledge. All that you needed to do was head over to the Champaca website enter your card details buy a subscription and every month Champaca would send you a box of books carefully curated and selected for you. Champaca isn’t the only small business that relies on subscriptions. There are hundreds of small companies in Bangalore like say Farmizen which takes subscriptions for organic vegetables sourced directly from farmers. And other companies that do it for flowers bread or bakery items. It goes on and on. Then there are several small independent online D2C stores who exist and sell exclusively on Instagram. All of them depend and survive on the ability of people like you and me to make online transactions directly on their website and app. Today it’s easy to take online payments using credit and debit cards for granted. But what few people are aware of is that the reason we can buy things online from practically anywhere today is not because of regulations but despite them. Back in 2004 when online payments started becoming a possibility a bunch of credit card companies came together to create a framework called the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Every single merchant who needed to accept card transactions on their website needed to be compliant with this or else they couldn’t accept cards. The purpose of the framework was to safely do online payments and to reduce card fraud. I think you can guess where this story is going. On the face of it the PCI-DSS framework was deceptively simple. All you needed to do was to comply with a set of 12 points. If you were a merchant who did this you were allowed to accept card transactions. In practice the regulation was impossible to implement. Here’s Michael Jones CIO of Michaels' Stores—a Canadian art and supplies store—testifying about the implementation of PCI-DSS in front of a US Congress Committee. (...the PCI DSS requirements...) are very expensive to implement confusing to comply with and ultimately subjective both in their interpretation and in their enforcement. It is often stated that there are only twelve 'Requirements' for PCI compliance. In fact there are over 220 sub-requirements; some of which can place an incredible burden on a retailer and many of which are subject to interpretation Michael Jones CIO Michael Stores There were other problems. Non-compliance with the PCI-DSS would attract a fine. And guess who profited from the regulation meant to protect consumers from fraud? Well here’s a story that appeared in Wired magazine back in 2012. It’s long but I recommend you read it carefully. Stephen and Theodora ""Cissy"" McComb owners of Cisero's Ristorante and Nightclub in Park City Utah have filed a lawsuit against U.S. Bank claiming that the financial institution which used to process the restaurant's credit and debit card transactions wrongfully seized money from the McCombs' merchant bank account. U.S. Bank seized about $10000 from the McCombs' account to pay $90000 in fines that Visa and MasterCard imposed after alleging that Cisero's had failed to secure its network and suffered a data breach that resulted in fraudulent charges on customer bank cards. U.S. Bank sued the McCombs to obtain the remaining balance on the fines saying a contract the McCombs signed with the bank makes them liable for such fines. But in their countersuit against U.S. Bank the McCombs allege that the bank and the payment card industry (PCI) in general force merchants to sign one-sided contracts that are based on information that arbitrarily changes without notice and that they impose random fines on merchants without providing proof of a breach or of fraudulent losses and without allowing merchants a meaningful opportunity to dispute claims before money is seized. It's the first known case to challenge the heart of the self-regulated PCI security standards—a system that requires businesses accepting credit and debit card payments to implement a series of technological steps to secure data. The controversial system imposed on merchants by credit card companies like Visa and MasterCard has been called a ""near scam"" by a spokesman for the National Retail Federation and others who say it's designed less to secure card data than to profit credit card companies while giving them executive powers of punishment through a mandated compliance system that has no oversight. ""It's just like Visa and MasterCard are governments"" said Stephen Cannon an attorney representing the McCombs. ""Where do they get the authority to execute a system of fines and penalties against merchants? That's a very important issue in this case."" Rare Legal Fight Takes On Credit Card Company Security Standards and Fines Wired The reason why all of us today can make transactions online on any merchant is because of companies like Stripe and Razorpay in India which abstract away the compliance of these regulations from merchants. This is what enables Champaca to accept payments online without having to comply with a set of regulations that’s poorly defined and impossible for them to implement. If every single merchant had to comply with PCI-DSS directly the only companies that’d be accepting card payments today would be the ones with the lawyers the engineers and the accountants to help them do it. None of this is new. In fact if you go back you’ll find stories of startups moving away from India specifically because of rules around recurring payments—especially Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies whose business relies heavily on subscriptions. Back in 2014 Krish Subramanian founder of Chargebee an Indian firm ​​that provides customer support for the recurring billing needs of SaaS companies explained why customer acquisition is a problem. He went on to describe firms that were able to comply with the regulations and could charge recurring payments by saving card details as “well-connected”. If you live in India you know what that word really means. Also if the intent was to protect consumers from unauthorised recurring payments it could have been done in other ways. We could have created ways for consumers to dispute transactions and mechanisms for refunds and resolution. We could have done it in a million ways. Ultimately that’s the problem with regulations even the ones created ostensibly to protect consumers. They don’t protect consumers at all. Which brings me to the final misconception about recurring payments. What the cash flow of a small subscription business looks like I’m on a Zoom call with Mehul Mohan. Mehul is the CEO and co-founder of Codedamn a company that teaches programming to aspiring developers. If you are picturing him as a seasoned experienced executive abandon that image. Mehul is just 22 years old. In the middle of our conversation he mentions that he was in school in 2017 making me feel even older. Codedamn is a fascinating company. It teaches coding using an experiential approach to anyone who wants to be good at it. Mehul thinks he knows what his customers want and what existing coding companies get wrong. There’s good reason to take him seriously. He has a YouTube channel with 1500 videos all to teach you programming. And he has over 150000 subscribers there. Mehul runs a subscription product to teach coding. People sign up from all over the world from the US UK Australia and yes India. They pay Rs 999 ($13) per month for the course in India going all the way up to ~Rs 8000 ($110) at the highest tier. I ask Mehul how his business has been affected by the RBI regulation. “Bad. We’ve lost about 60% active Indian subscriptions on codedamn. Cards just stopped working”. The thing with subscription businesses is that few understand their cash flow. When you start a company you have no customers. Then a few sign up and give you some money. So all your revenue is from new customers. Next year if they love your product they’ll renew their subscription. So if you needed to get 10 new customers every month to meet expenses you now need to acquire fewer say 8. Then the next year more renewals. You need to acquire even fewer customers. That’s the superpower of recurring businesses. You get to build your company from what you’ve already done in the past. You make money from people you’ve acquired once and who give you money for a long time. That’s why VCs love companies like this. But what happens when all recurring payments disappear overnight? Like it did for Mehul who lost 60% of his active Indian customers? You start from scratch. I ask Mehul if there’s anything he thinks he can do. “Not really” he says. “Maybe send more reminders.” Then a pause. “What can I do really?” We are assuming that banks want to implement the new regulations to protect consumers. We believe that they are incentivised to adopt this framework and to maximise transactions in a way that every merchant can accept recurring payments seamlessly. But are they really? As flawed as this regulation is it’s important to remember that the RBI came out with the notification for processing recurring payments in August 2019 and set an initial deadline of 1 April 2021 for its implementation. But in March this year banks went back to the central bank and asked for more time. Then finally just eight hours before the recurring bomb was set to detonate the RBI came in and hit the pause button. It allowed banks to continue processing recurring payments and gave them six more months to implement the changes. After this the RBI released a letter. Here’s what it said. It is however noted that the framework has not been fully implemented even after the extended timeline. This non-compliance is noted with serious concern and will be dealt with separately. Any further delay in ensuring complete adherence to the framework beyond the extended timeline will attract strict supervisory action. All of this brings us to 1 October 2021 when the new rules finally came into force. I wish I could tell you about the chaos that’s going on inside subscription businesses in India. Payments are now failing across the board and not just for subscriptions but for all kinds of transactions. Notices of card failures for critical services like Slack AWS Apple Google web-hosting and many more are hitting the inboxes of hundreds of companies in India. These are services that companies use everyday to conduct their business. More strangely the failures are arbitrary—what works for one person’s card for one service won’t work for another person’s card for the same service. Right now you can’t buy a subscription in India even for those products that you want. I still haven’t got to the worst part. By introducing a system like this the bank now has the power to decide which recurring payments can be honoured and which ones will be blocked. Banks are clearly not ready or are unwilling to process recurring payments. And despite the RBI’s grave warnings there appears to be few consequences. Theoretically banks can now maintain “allowlists” for merchants deciding that their card holders could pay for Netflix but not for say MUBI—an independent website that streams art movies. They could do this even if a cardholder explicitly wants to pay for MUBI. But no you might say. Surely banks won’t do that. Surely they wouldn’t have a list to pick who is allowed to run subscriptions in India and who isn’t. That would be like a license system. A permission structure. And if they did surely they wouldn’t publish this list of allowed merchants on their website? Well… Look at that list carefully. These are the only merchants who are “allowed” to receive recurring payments in India from cardholders of India’s largest private bank. Not Dollar Shave Club. Not Champaca. Not Codedamn. Well-connected. In summary a system that existed to give small players an advantage (through trust) over bigger incumbents has been destroyed by a regulation with the ostensible goal of helping the consumer; which has effectively benefited banks and those close to them. This is the current state of payments in India. And it looks like it’ll remain this way for the next several months. The cash flows of subscription businesses are going to be crushed. It’s unlikely that all of them will survive. Two requests The Nutgraf is a paid newsletter and is available only to subscribers of The Ken.

Selective focus. Macro. Concept.

The buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) industry is booming but keeping abreast of all the players in the industry is far from easy.

And it’s not getting any easier. Thanks to Covid-19 online shopping has grown in popularity and as a result so has the BNPL space.

The BNPL industry is expected to keep growing to be worth $166bn by 2023 according to GlobalData’s thematic research. Looking further ahead it could even reach a valuation of $3.98tn by 2030 according to Allied Market Research. In other words: it’s time to start taking BNPL businesses more seriously.

“This increase in usage of BNPL payment methods has put providers in a prime position to be considered as much more than a feature but a business model that the financial ecosystem needs to take seriously and consider how they implement or work cohesively alongside” Al Lukies founder and CEO of banking software company Pollinate tells Verdict.

Despite most of the companies in this sector not making a profit it’s clear that instalments services is a multi-billion industry. No wonder then that the sector is growing crowded.

Not only are BNPL companies like Swedish quadradecacorn Klarna making headlines but bigger players like PayPal Block and as rumour has it even Apple are muscling into the sector as well.

So keeping track of all the different companies in the sector is no mean feat. But don’t worry we’ve got you covered.

Addi

Addi is one of Latin America’s newest BNPL providers. Launched in 2018 the Bogota-based business secured $75m in a Series B funding round in September 2021. Greycroft led the round. While Addi didn’t reveal its valuation it will use the money to fuel expansion plans in Brazil Colombia and Mexico. It will face stiff competition from other BNPL industry companies such as Mexican rival Nelo and other fintech companies peddling their own instalment solutions in the region.

Affirm

Affirm is a San Francisco-headquartered company. This early entrant into the BNPL industry was founded in 2012 by PayPal’s first CTO and founder Max Levchin together with a small group of fellow co-founders. Affirm is available in the US and all US territories with a few exceptions. The company went through an initial public offering (IPO) in January 2021. Having inked a partnership with Amazon in August Affirm delivered a strong fourth quarter for the financial year. Despite announcing a jump in quarterly revenues to $261.8m Affirm said it was not expecting to make a profit in 2022. Nevertheless the quarterly result saw Affirm’s shares skyrocket and at the time of writing it is trading on the Nasdaq with a $28.9bn market cap.

Afterpay

If there is one big rivalry of note in the BNPL space it’s that between Klarna and Afterpay. Soon after Klarna entered Australia Afterpay’s home market in 2020 the two companies’ CEOs engaged in a very public spat. They essentially accused each other of taking advantage of merchants. There have been few signs that the rivalry has improved since.

Launched in 2014 Afterpay has since expanded to offer instalment services in the United States New Zealand and the United Kingdom where it trades under the ClearPay brand. In August payment processing company Block announced that it had reached a deal to buy Afterpay for $29bn seemingly pushing the sector towards further consolidation.

In early January 2022 the Bank of Spain approved the deal meaning the deal is now fully unconditional. Afterpay estimates that the deal is now likely to close on February 1.

Apple

Apple may make most of its profits from smartphones but the iPhone maker has also established Apple Pay as a solid revenue stream over the years. Now it seems as if the iPhone maker may add BNPL services to its fintech solution. In July several media reports suggested that the Cupertino-headquartered tech giant could soon launch its own instalment solution. It had reportedly explored the idea together with Goldman Sachs. While there hasn’t been much movement on its own solution since in August Apple announced a new deal with Affirm. The partnership would see them bring a joint BNPL solution to Canada.

To be fair though Apple had already created a BNPL solution of sorts at least for its own products. It has long offered customers to divide the price of their purchases into monthly instalments.

Behalf

New York and Ra’anana-based Behalf was founded in 2011. Unlike the majority of companies on this list Behalf isn’t focused on consumers and online shoppers. Instead it’s carved out a niche for itself in the market by providing instalment solutions for businesses in the States. The B2B BNPL business has so far raised a total of $462m from investors like Visa. Its most recent round saw it cash in $19m in venture capital and $100m in debt financing according to GlobalData.

Biller

Biller is one of the newest entries into the BNPL space. The startup was launched in 2021 by former Mollie and Klarna executives. Just like Behalf Biller is a B2B BNPL provider. Its solution is designed to help smaller firms solve purchasing issues around risk and to boost their cash flow. The Biller solution is built in partnership with Slimmer AI a European B2B venture studio. The company is headquartered in Amsterdam.

Billie

German Billie was founded in 2016 after the founders split from UK-based B2B-financing startup Funding Circle with Billie founder Matthias Knecht citing “fundamental differences” as the reason behind their exodus. Like Billier Billie is making a name for itself by providing businesses with the smooth financing options consumers can expect from the likes of Klarna.

What gives Billie an edge is that it has not only launched a service similar to that of the Swedish fintech giant it has also actively partnered with it. Klarna was one of the investors behind Billie’s $100m Series C round round back in October 2021. The Scandi quadradecorn has also inked a partnership with Billie to integrate its services for its customers. “It’s a game-changer for us” Knecht recently told Verdict.

Since the launch in 2016 Billie has grown at a steady pace. Picking up a $11.79m Series A round in December 2017 and a $33.79m Series B round in July 2019 according to GlobaData‘s intelligence centre. With the $100m Series C round from October the company has raised close to $150m in total.

Bumper

Bumper claims to be something as unique as a profitable BNPL startup. In December 2021 Bumper raised a $12m Series A round and claimed that it had been profitable for the 18 months leading up to the cash injection.

The company provides a way for drivers to finance car repairs and maintenance. Focusing on this segment means Bumper customers normally do big one-off purchases and not repeat shopping solutions like the ones offered by other BNPL businesses like Klarna. Bumper CEO James Jackson told Verdict at the time that this leads to lower default rates.

Following the raise Bumper is now gearing up to expand outside of the UK and Ireland.

“Already a dominant player in the UK and Ireland we’re currently rolling out our product in Germany plan to launch in Spain and the Netherlands in the next three months and have ambitions to be in every major European market by the end of 2022” Jackson said.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia

Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) is one of Oz’s biggest banks. So when it announced in August that it would enter the BNPL market the news turned a few heads. The lender’s new BNPL platform is dubbed StepPay. It will offer eligible customers to split payments into four fortnightly instalments for transactions higher than A$100 ($71.1). As of the announcement 86000 customers had preregistered for the service.

Curve

UK-based Curve was founded in 2016. The self-described “financial super app” added a BNPL feature to its services in September 2021 – Curve Flex.

The service empowers Curve’s customers to pay later for almost any purchase made at any merchant from any card up to a year ago. Curve Flex was announced on the same day as neobank Monzo announced its BNPL service which was also called Flex. Curve made a point out of saying that it had tested the technology since September 2020 and that it had been accredited by the Financial Services Authority in September 2021.

Curve’s founder and CEO Shachar Bialick said: “Why settle for a rigid copy when you can have the real thing? Curve Flex is almost certainly the most flexible credit solution in the market. With no limitations on merchants and the ability to accommodate all Mastercard Visa and Discover cards Curve Flex will provide customers with access to easy and affordable credit.”

ePayLater

Mumbai-headquartered ePayLater was founded in 2015. It is part of India’s emerging fintech ecosystem. It offers zero-cost instant credit. The payments provider secured a $10m funding round in September 2021 from Zurich-based Responsability Investments AG Blue Ashva Capital Pravega Ventures and others.

humm by Flexifi

humm by Flexifi is a subsidiary of Australia-listed consumer finance company Hummgroup which was founded in 1988. Since its launch humm has grown popular in Australia where it claims to be the third biggest BNPL provider after Afterpay and Klarna. It has also launched its services in New Zealand Ireland and the UK. It targets customers making larger expenditures of up to A$30000 enabling customers up to 24 months to pay off the purchase.

Kissht

Founded in 2015 Kissht claims to be “India’s fastest credit lending app” despite GlobalData pointing out in recent funding round that it requires a fairly extensive customer information in order to open an account. It also offers BNPL online and in-store for 0% financing on purchases of INR5000 ($66.6 to INR500000. Terms range from one month up to 15 months although longer terms attract interest.

Klarna

Founded in 2005 by a group of Stockholm School of Economics students Klarna has clawed its way to the top of the BNPL industry. Klarna raised a $639m SoftBank-led investment round in June to strengthen its position in the market. The raise saw it achieve a $45.6bn valuation making it Europe’s most highly valued private tech company.

To date Klarna is available in several European countries North America Asia and Australia. While rumours about an IPO have been circulating for years the Swedish BNPL powerhouse hasn’t made any plans public.

The company is also increasingly marketing itself as an alternative to traditional credit cards. David Sandström Klarna’s chief marketing officer told Verdict in a recent interview that one reason for the BNLP sector’s huge expansion over recent years is customers simply having had enough of the raw deal offered by traditional credit card providers.

“Credit card companies have made an astounding amount of money by essentially cheating and taking advantage of people with bad terms and conditions high rates and extremely disadvantageous interests” he said “What we’re seeing now is a whole generation abandoning credit cards. Roughly 70% of American millennials don’t have a credit card because they fear them more than they dread death according to some reports.”

Kredivo

Indonesian BNPL player Kredivo was founded in 2016. It has raised $310m in total over the years most recently through a $100m debt facility from Victory Park Capital in June. Boasting that it has almost four million customers Kredivo is now seemingly on the path to become the next BNPL company to go public.

Contrary to several other players on this list that floated via IPOs Kredivo announced in August that it planned to debut via a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings II. The SPAC is sponsored by Victory Park Capital. Kredivo also has plans to expand into Vietnam via a joint venture with family investment office Phoenix Holding.

Kueski

Kueski is a Mexican startup that provides microloan services to clients. Founded in 2012 Kueski Pay the startups BNPL service has gained more traction highlighting the growth of the industry. Today it has almost 1000 retail partners.

Laybuy

Laybuy was founded by husband-and-wife team Gary and Robyn Rohloff in 2016. The New Zealand-headquartered company has since expanded to the UK and Australia where it listed on the stock market in September 2020. It is currently trading at a A$127m market cap.

While the Rohloffs started with global domination plans Laybuy is yet to fully conquer the UK market. In May the company raised $27m to that end.

“There will be growth beyond the UK but for now all the focus is the UK” Gary Rohloff recently told RBI.

A big part of its strategy is the recent launch of its virtual card that enables customers to skirt the cumbersome tick-a-BNPL-solution-at-the-checkout routine and immediately get the full benefit of Laybuy’s pay-in-six instalments.

Limepay

Limepay is another Australian BNPL company to be aware of. Founded in 2016 Limepay offers what it describes as the nation’s only white label BNPL solution. What means is that it allows merchants to slap their own branding on the solution in their shops. So far it has raised $27m in total. While it was planning to go public in 2021 The Age reported in May that those plans could’ve been delayed due to the departure of one of the co-founders and investors growing weary of BNPL providers trying to replicate the success of Afterpay.

Lunar Bank

Lunar Bank is a Danish neobank. Just like other digital lenders like Chime Revolut and N26 it has so far made its winnings by providing traditional banking services via its app. However on the back of its $47.2m Series C funding round in October 2020 Lunar announced plans to launch a BNPL solution of its own. It stayed true to that promise by launching the feature Pay Later in December. While Lunar is certainly not one of the biggest players in the sector its foray into the BNPL space highlights how many companies recognise the lucrative opportunities of the market.

Mastercard

Payments goliath Mastercard launched its highly anticipated bnpl feature that gives fintechs the opportunity to include instalments in their offering in September.

Mastercard would initially roll out the new service in three markets: the US Australia and the UK. Mastercard Instalments as the BNPL service is called will enable banks lenders fintechs and digital wallet companies to offer various BNPL benefits including zero-percent interest and the common pay-in-four-goes model.

“Mastercard is definitely a serious threat for smaller BNPL companies” Theodore Delimaris research analyst at GlobalData told Verdict at the time. “Due to its size and global network of issuers and merchants it has a clear operational and cost competitive advantage.”

Monzo

2020 was not a great year for Monzo. The London-headquartered challenger bank struggled during the pandemic. In June it raised a £60m down round that cut its valuation from £2bn to £1.24bn. Some even speculated that fintech may go bust. The neobank later added new fees and announced a new premium offering to cover its losses. And then on 15 September Monzo announced that it would target the BNPL sector with its Monzo Flex product offering.

Monzo Flex can be used for online and in-person transactions of more than £30 in value. Specifically Monzo Flex will allow users to repay what they owe in three instalments. In addition customers can opt to repay in six and 12 instalments with interest levied at 19% APR.

Of course not everyone is optimistic about Monzo’s chances to steal market shares from bigger and more established players in the sector.

“It will be difficult for the bank to take a significant slice of business from the likes of Klarna or PayPal” Payl8r’s managing director Samantha Palmer said.

Mox

Hong Kong-based neobank Mox launched its own BNPL service this summer for its Mox Credit customers. Just like with similar offers Mox’s “Spilt purchase” feature would enable users to pay off payments in smaller instalments.

Nelo

Nelo was founded in 2019. The Mexico City-headquartered startup is the latest company muscling itself into the booming Latin American fintech scene. But unlike Brazilian digital lender Nubank or Uruguayan payments processing provider dLocal Nelo is doing it by joining the BNPL brigade. It is hoping to get the jump on rival firms by being a first-mover in the region. The startup secured a $3m seed funding round to that end in April 2021. Nelo has already signed deals with 45 merchants and has over 150000 users on its books.

OpenPay

OpenPay is yet another Australian BNPL company. The Melbourne-headquartered startup was founded in 2013. It has carved out a niche for itself by focusing on cash flow management of larger purchases between A$40 and A$20000 with plans ranging from two to 24 months. It other words; the service is similarly to that offered by humm by Flexifi. Following an abysmal IPO in 2019 OpenPay recovered some of its earnings along the online shopping boom of 2020. It’s currently trading at a $142m market cap.

Payl8r

Founded in 2014 Manchester-headquartered Payl8r is arguably the oldest BNPL provider in the UK. Despite its age it has yet to become a unicorn. That may change soon. Payl8r raised a £40m debt facility from Conister Bank this summer with the aim to pass the important $1bn mark within the next five years. It’s going to do so by tapping into younger customers’ cravings for new lines lines of credits.

“We are the opposite of banks we want to help millennials and we do so ethically and responsibly” Palmer said. “In effect we’re spearheading the death of the credit card and are proud to provide loans that can pay for the likes of educational courses that can lead to new job opportunities.”

PayPal

PayPal is another company that has realised the opportunities in the BNPL space. The San Jose-headquartered payment processing provider has spent the past year cutting out a slice for itself in the BNPL market. In August 2020 it launched its own instalments service in the States. It has since rolled out the offering across the pond. In September 2021 PayPal turned up the heat by announcing plans to acquire Japanese Paidy for $2.7bn. The acquisition would see the $338bn company signal just like Block’s Afterpay deal that market leaders are now hungry for bigger chunks of a market that has previously been dominated by pure BNPL providers.

Revolut

Like PayPal Monzo and Lunar Revolut is not a traditional BNPL player. The UK challenger bank was founded 2015. In July 2021 it became the UK’s most valued privately owned tech company after raising a $800m funding round at a $33bn valuation. Over the years it has been busy expanding its offering with premium cards cryptocurrency features and foreign transactions. Now it seems like it might be eying the BNPL space as well according to CEO Nikolay Storonsky who spoke with the Evening Standard. The features are expected to hit the market next year.

Santander

Following the turbocharged growth of the BNPL market European bank Santander seemingly feared it would miss out. So in late January 2022 Santander announced that it would launch its own BNPL app named Zinia. Like many other apps on this list Zinia will enable shoppers to split their purchases over monthly instalments interest-free. It plans to rollout its services across its different markets this year.

Ezequiel Szafir CEO of Santander’s Openbank online banking division bullishly claimed that by “the security and trust provided by a large financial group” would be the distinguishing factor that would enable Santander to “become a leader in the buy now pay later market.”

Scalapay

Italian Scalapay may be a new player in the BNPL space but it’s already making waves. The Milan-based venture was launched in 2019. It is operating in Italy France Germany Spain Portugal Austria Belgium the Netherlands and Finland. Despite its tender age Scalapay raised a $155m Series A round in September at a $700m valuation. It is backed by investors like Tiger Global Baleen Capital and Woodson Capital.

Sezzle

Sezzle was founded in 2016. Since then the Minneapolis-based company has listed in Australia and is reportedly planning to follow suit in the US. Despite having the same profitability problems as almost every other company in the sector investors have taken a shine to Sezzle. Having already expanded to the EU Oz and Canada the company also plans on tipping its toes into the Indian and Brazilian market.

“My aim is to go for big opportunities: low cost low risk opportunities” Sezzle CEO and executive chairman Charlie Youakim recently told RBI.

Simpl

Another Indian BNPL provider Simpl was founded in 2015. Its online checkout provides online stores to offer customers one-click checkouts and BNPL services. It has raised $26.7m to date.

Slice

Fintech startup Slice was founded in 2016 but has since become one of India’s youngest fintech unicorn. It claimed the its spot in the coveted $1bn+ valuation club in November 2021 after securing $220m Series B funding round. Tiger Global and Insight Partners co-led Slice’s funding round with Sunley House Capital Moore Strategic Ventures Anfa Gunosy Blume Ventures and 8i also participating in the raise.

tabby

Founded in late 2019 tabby may be a reasonably new face to the BNPL market. However as one of the early entries into the Middle East the Dubai-headquartered company could still make a mark. In August this year it secured a $50m cash injection from investors like Global Founders Capital and STV. On the back of the raise it achieved a $300m valuation. In September tabby was Sharia-approved in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The company claims to have secured partnerships with over 3000 global companies and SMEs.

Tamara

In April 2021 Checkout.com led a $110m investment into Saudi Arabian BNPL startup Tamara. The Series A round came on the back of a $6m seed funding cash injection from January. Like the other companies on this list Tamara gives users access to options like “pay in 30 days” or to “pay in three”. Today it is active in Saudi Arabia and in the United Arab Emirates.

Temenos

In January banking software company Temenos announced the launch of its own BNPL banking service. This offering will open up new revenue opportunities for banks and fintechs help them reach new markets and cement their relationships with both consumers and merchants through alternative credit products.

“In an extremely competitive market financial services providers need to evaluate new business models to drive revenue” said Max Chuard CEO of Temenos. “As the strategic technology provider for over 3000 banks worldwide we are committed to empowering our clients to pioneer and adopt those new profitable business models. Buy-now-pay-later has shown the industry that we can come up with new solutions to old problems. It has challenged the way we think about customer engagement acquisition and retention. We are very excited to launch this new solution to enable our clients to offer alternative financing that is fast seamless and scalable.”

Splitit

Splitit was founded in 2012 and has established itself as a BNPL venture separate from the pack.

While companies like Klarna and Afterpay lend the customers the full amount of a purchase at the checkout and then allow that purchase to be paid off in instalments Splitit lets users pay with an existing credit card holding the full amount on their card and taking an instalment each month. In other words: it uses existing cards to enable shoppers to split payments. The approach enabled it to grow by 307% in 2020 to $11.6m. The company followed up its success by inking a deal for a financing facility from Goldman Sachs in January. The lender committed a investment of up to $150m for a three-year term.

Having grown in the States thanks to its partnerships with Visa Mastercard and Stripe Splitit now has eyes on the horizon. It plans to expand further around the globe. In June it teamed up with Middle Eastern BNPL provider tabby. The partnership will help both companies grow in the region. Splitit is headquartered in New York and it listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2019. The company has an R&D centre in Israel and offices in London and Australia.

ZestMoney

ZestMoney is another Indian fintech that – much like many other BNPL providers on this list – first saw the light in 2015. ZestMoney claims to be “the largest and fastest growing consumer lending fintech company in India” and that its platform “can meaningfully improve the lives of more than 300 million households in the country who currently have no access to credit cards or any other formal financing options because of insufficient credit history.” ZestMoney raised $50m from Australian provider Zip in September 2021.

Zilch

Zilch is a BNPL startup straight out of London. Founded in 2018 the company exited out of stealth in August 2020. It differentiates itself from the likes of Klarna and Afterpay by not being reliant on signing partnerships with merchants before users can tap into its services.

“We bring the buy-now-pay-later experience directly to a client anywhere they like – online offline Amazon eBay Etsy Not On The High Street – rather than where we’ve gone and done deals and integrations because that for me is not the customers’ problem. That’s our problem” Philip Belamant founder and CEO of Zilch recently told Verdict.

The company has achieved a $2bn valuation on the back of its $110m Series C round in October and is currently considering expanding into the States.

Now the founder says the Klarna challenger can claim to be Europe’s fastest growing startup.

“We went from Series A to unicorn in 14 months which is officially the fastest if you’ve seen any company go from series A to unicorn [in Europe]” Zilch CEO Philip Belamant recently Verdict.

Zip

Zip is yet another Australian company making a killing on instalment payments. Launched in 2013 it has which should be no surprise to anyone by now listed on the Australian stock exchange. It operates in Australia the US the UK New Zealand South Africa the Czech Republic and the United Arab Emirates. It is trading at a $3.95bn market cap.

Zebit

Founded in 2015 California-based Zebit is yet another fintech on this list having gone public in Australia. It made its debut at $1.58 per share in October raising $35m in the process. However the price fell by 34% on the day to $1.17. While it did enjoy a surge in March 2021 the price has fallen since. It’s currently trading at $0.8 giving it a $75.6m market cap.",,,,,,,,,

Big Picture

That said Bangladesh have T20I series wins over Australia and New Zealand  from the last three months to draw confidence from. Together with their 2-1 win over Zimbabwe in July they are enjoying their best period as a T20I team and they will want to translate that into a big T20 World Cup campaign. Scotland and then PNG and Oman stand in their way to begin.

The reliable trio of captain Mahmudullah Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan - the latter hopped over to Muscat overnight after the IPL final in Dubai - will have a big say in Bangladesh's progress. But the likes of Liton Das Soumya Sarkar and Mustafizur Rahman have also been on the international stage long enough to be expected to get them big wins.

Bangladesh will face a Scotland side that has had a mixed bag in T20Is of late with three defeats in their last five T20Is including a home series loss to Zimbabwe in September but given their results in the warm-ups head coach Shane Burger believes his side is peaking at the right time.

Experienced batters like Richie Berrington Kyle Coetzer George Munsey and Calum MacLeod of course have crucial roles to play. Alasdair Evans and Safyaan Sharif will head the fast bowling attack while legspinner Chris Greaves  who took a four-wicket haul against the Netherlands could surprise Bangladesh given his ability to spin the ball both ways.

Of course on this big stage nerves also play a big part. Bangladesh might have more experience in such situations but Scotland will be determined to show what they've got.

Form guide

Bangladesh: LWLWW (last five completed matches most recent first)

Scotland: LWLLW

Players to watch

Mahmudullah will not only dictate terms in the field as the Bangladesh captain but his batting could make or break big finishes too. He was the only batter to get a half-century in Bangladesh's T20I series win over Australia and was also their top-scorer against New Zealand. will not only dictate terms in the field as the Bangladesh captain but his batting could make or break big finishes too. He was the only batter to get a half-century in Bangladesh's T20I series win over Australia and was also their top-scorer against New Zealand.

George Munsey whose T20I career strike rate of 153.36 speaks volumes of his big-hitting ability. The left-hand batter with the low grip can clear the infield with ease both against pace and spin and could give the likes of Berrington and Coetzer the right platform. Scotland will look for quick early runs fromwhose T20I career strike rate of 153.36 speaks volumes of his big-hitting ability. The left-hand batter with the low grip can clear the infield with ease both against pace and spin and could give the likes of Berrington and Coetzer the right platform.

Team news

Soumya Sarkar's form puts him ahead of Mohammad Naim who hasn't looked in good touch lately. Playing three seamers in Muscat may be the way to go which would leave Nasum Ahmed out of the XI. Shoriful Islam's variety may be preferred over Taskin Ahmed.

Bangladesh (possible): 1 Soumya Sarkar 2 Liton Das 3 Shakib Al Hasan 4 Mushfiqur Rahim 5 Mahmudullah (capt) 6 Afif Hossain 7 Nurul Hasan (wk) 8 Mahedi Hasan 9 Mohammad Saifuddin 10 Shoriful Islam 11 Mustafizur Rahman

Scotland have the option of legspinner Chris Greaves after his four-for against Netherlands in the practice match. Hamza Tahir the left-arm spinner wicketkeeper-batter Craig Wallace and fast bowler Brad Wheal are also options available to them.

Scotland (possible): 1 George Munsey 2 Kyle Coetzer (capt) 3 Matthew Cross (wk) 4 Richie Berrington 5 Calum MacLeod 6 Dylan Budge 7 Michael Leask 8 Mark Watt 9 Safyaan Sharif 10 Josh Davey 11 Alasdair Evans

Stats that matter

Scotland have won the sole T20I between the two sides although Bangladesh won all four completed ODIs Bangladesh have won only five out of 25 completed matches at the T20 World Cup

Scotland shook the T20 World Cup on the opening day by beating the No. 6 ranked Bangladesh by six runs. The margin doesn't however reflect just how well Scotland played at the Al Amerat ground. The little-known Chris Greaves  playing only his second international match rescued his side with a quickfire 45 after Scotland slipped to 53 for 6. Then with his quickish legspin Greaves removed Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim just when Bangladesh had started to make a move towards the 141-run chase.

Greaves was calm under pressure with the bat adding 51 runs for the seventh wicket with Mark Watt. He scrapped hard in the last five overs which ultimately helped Scotland immensely in terms of giving them energy in the field and then sucking the life out of Bangladesh.

Brad Wheal took three wickets while Greaves finished with two scalps. Josh Davey and Watt got one each while Safyaan Sharif closed out the game in the last over even though Mahedi Hasan threatened briefly with a six.

Failure to launch in the end

But despite the sluggish nature of the Shakib-Mushfiqur partnership when they added 47 off 7.4 overs Bangladesh always knew that they had Mahmudullah Afif Hossain and Nurul Hasan to get the job done in the last five overs.

Afif survived a dropped catch in the 16th over but he could strike only two fours in his 12-ball 18. But the bigger surprise was how Mahmudullah Bangladesh's main finisher kept mistiming the ball at the death. His 22-ball stay only yielded a four and a six as he made only 23. Hasan too had little time to maneuver pumping a catch to MacLeod who took three catches in all in the boundary line.

Mahedi's final fling

Sharif had to defend 24 runs in the final over but it was only when Bangladesh required to hit only sixes in the last three balls Mahedi swung him over square-leg for a six. Sharif kept his head in the last two balls bringing Scotland the hard-fought win.

Coetzer's surprise for Soumya

Off the first ball he faced Soumya cracked Brad Wheal through midwicket for a beautiful four. Was this going to be the turnaround for Soumya who struggled badly against Australia in August and was mostly dropped against New Zealand in September? He had already been picked over Mohammad Naim who himself was struggling for runs after he had made couple of thirties in the warm-up games.

But Scotland captain Kyle Coetzer wisely put a man at deep midwicket a standard decision in such a situation. But when Soumya struck a similar shot off Josh Davey in the second over the man at midwicket Munsey didn't have to move an inch to complete the catch. Soumya looked rather daft for trying the same aerial shot as it looked like he wasn't aware of the fielding change. It wasn't really rocket science but Coetzer looked like a genius.

Scotland keep Shakib Mushfiqur quiet

Scotland played on Bangladesh's poor start by keeping Shakib and Mushfiqur Rahim quiet throughout their 47-run stand. Only in the ninth over Mushfiqur hammered Leask for two sixes but the experienced duo were surprisingly batted conservatively. Finally when Shakib did hit out at Greaves Callum MacLeod took an excellent running catch around the deep midwicket boundary.

Spinners dominate Scotland

Scotland lost their way just when the aggressive George Munsey was getting into his big-hitting groove. Offspinner Mahedi took two wickets in the eighth over to stop Scotland on their tracks. He trapped Matthew Cross lbw attempting a sweep before he bowled Munsey who had struck two sixes and two fours in his 23-ball 29.

Shakib followed up Mahedi's double-wicket over with one of his own and it took him to the top of T20I's wicket-taking chart. Richie Berrington fell trying to clear long-on where Afif Hossain took an excellent catch. When Michael Leask struck the fourth ball of the over to long-off where Liton Das had an easier catch Shakib's tally reached 108 one more than Malinga.

Mahedi further dented Scotland in the following over when he bowled Callum MacLeod for five. From 45 for 1 they slipped to 53 for 6 losing five wickets for eight runs in the space of 3.2 overs.

Greaves Watt dig deep

Bangladesh released some of the pressure when Afif went for ten runs in the 13th over. Playing only his second T20I Greaves showed no nerves. He hammered two sixes and four boundaries in his 28-ball 45 Scotland's top score in the innings. Watt contributed 22 off 17 balls with two fours before holing out to Soumya Sarkar off Taskin Ahmed.

Their 51-run stand is the highest for Scotland for the seventh wicket  crucially picking them past the 100-run mark when they looked down the barrel at 53 for 6 in the 12th over.

Oman get T20 World Cup underway in dominant fashion

In a nutshell

Co-hosts Oman hammered Papua New Guinea by 10 wickets in the opening game of the T20 World Cup which returned after a five-year hiatus. Openers Jatinder Singh and Aqib Ilyas added unbeaten 131 runs tracking down the runs in only 13.4 overs after captain Zeeshan Maqsood's 4 for 20 the best T20I figures for Oman had restricted the opposition to only 129/9.

Wickets before runs on the board for PNG

The tournament started on a disastrous note for PNG when they lost their openers without a run on the board. Bilal Khan bowled Tony Uraw with the fifth ball of the match before Lega Siaka met the same fate against Kaleemullah in the next over with both openers found wanting in the footwork.

Recovery led by Assad Vala

That PNG got to 129 in their 20 overs was largely due to their captain Vala who walked in at No.3 and played a mature hand en route to a half-century. He hit 4 fours and 3 sixes in his innings of 56 off 43 and put on an important 81 runs for the third wicket with Charles Amini (37 off 26). But Amini got run out by Mohammad Nadeem in the 11th over while Vala was out to a brilliant catch by Jantinder in the deep a couple of overs later.

The Zeeshan Maqsood show

The Oman captain brought himself to bowl only in the 13th over the left-arm spinner hoping to sneak in a few quiet overs after Amini's run out. He even conceded a six to Vala in his opening over but in his next bowling from the other end he returned three wickets and conceded only 1 run. PNG went on to lose 4 for 6 and were restricted to a below par score on a good pitch at the Al Amerat Cricket Ground.

Openers lead the charge

The run-chase started on a slow note with both Jatinder and Aqib careful in their quick singles against the electric PNG fielders inside the ring. But that soon gave way to a flurry of shots as both openers went on to get their fifties. Jatinder showed the extra gear he's known for hitting 7 fours and 4 sixes in his 42-ball 73 not out. PNG didn't have a great day with regards to their bowling discipline as well as catching as they dropped both the openers at least once. The lack of cricket for PNG made worse by the pandemic showed.

Brief Scores: PNG 129/9 in 20 overs (Asad Vala 56; Maqsood 4-20) lost to Oman 131/0 in 13.4 overs (Jatinder Singh 73* Aqib Ilyas 50*) by 10 wickets

As he did for Troy Fautanu and several other Pittsburgh Steelers newcomers Wilson made a quick phone call to fourth-round pick Mason McCormick welcoming him to the team.

“Russell Wilson Facetimed me as soon as I got drafted” McCormick said via Erie’s JET24 News. “That was pretty cool. A lot of the vets have reached out.”

Wilson did the same or at least attempted to with Troy Fautanu who missed his initial call on his flight to Pittsburgh. The two eventually got in touch. Wilson was clearly plugged into the Steelers’ selections even on the third day of the draft rookies that aren’t always expected to make an immediate impact. McCormick was the team’s fourth-round selection and third offensive lineman selected. Primarily a guard throughout his college career he’s tabbed to begin the year as a backup behind starters Isaac Seumalo James Daniels and veteran swingman Nate Herbig.

Still offensive line depth can quickly be tested in the league. All it would take is an interior injury or two to press Mason McCormick into action to protect someone like Wilson. While he has the challenge of coming from the FCS level McCormick’s size and elite experience of nearly 60 starts will help him make the transition to the NFL level.

With one of the youngest offenses in football last year the Steelers are looking for leadership. It’s one reason why they pursued Wilson in the offseason and why he’s the front-runner to start the year ahead of Justin Fields. At 35 years old with a Super Bowl ring Wilson is regarded as a hard-worker who wants to lead and rally the group.

Beyond leadership the unit needs to be more productive an offense that’s flailed and sputtered three seasons running. Talent and skill will be the main reasons why Pittsburgh succeeds or fails but having a tight-knit team where everyone is included from starting quarterback to fourth-round guard is often a hidden factor in how to maximize a group.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtbmV3cy8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM5MzYvc3RlZWxlcnMtc2lnbi1yb29raWVzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtY29udHJhY3QtdGVybXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers officially sign rookies Mason McCormick Logan Lee,"The Pittsburgh Steelers officially signed two members of their 2024 NFL Draft class Friday including fourth-round guard Mason McCormick and sixth-round DL Logan Lee. The news comes on the same day of the start of rookie minicamp taking place between Friday May 10 and Sunday May 12. Financial terms of their contracts were not disclosed.

McCormick in particular could be in a position to earn some significant playing time in the 2024 season with several question marks remaining regarding the current configuration of players on the offensive line. Should McCormick have a successful offseason he could be in the mix to compete with starting right guard James Daniels. Daniels is in the final year of his contract with the Steelers with a 2024 cap hit of just under $11.2 million. By trading or releasing Daniels the Steelers can save $8.25 million against the salary cap in 2024.

Related Steelers rookie IOL Mason McCormick could find his way to the starting lineup in 2024

Though McCormick might afford the Steelers the flexibility to make that decision on the roster It would still be a surprise to see them do so especially given the fact that they’ve got two other rookies presumably starting on the offensive line this year including OT Troy Fautanu and C Zach Frazier.

The Steelers have 43 players on their 2024 Rookie Minicamp Roster with 12 of them being rookies in this class including five undrafted free agents who received contracts. That leaves five drafted rookies remaining with whom the team will need to finalize a deal ahead of training camp including first-round OT Troy Fautanu second-round center Zach Frazier third-rounders WR Roman Wilson and LB Payton Wilson as well as sixth-round DB Ryan Watts."
MCD,McDonald's,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1sb2NhbG5ld3MuY29tL21lL21haW5lL25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMC8xNS9tYWRhd2Fza2EtdG8tbG9zZS1pdHMtbWNkb25hbGQtc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Madawaska to lose its McDonald's,"After years of trying to get the attention of McDonald’s executives in hopes that the restaurant giant would keep the Golden Arches in Madawaska Brian Thibeault decided to make a video.

With drone footage music and heart-felt interviews with drive-thru customers he communicated the town’s hope that even though the restaurant can’t stay in its current location it might be able to move somewhere else in town.

“McDonald’s has been part of our community for 50 years” Thibeault said this week. “Most people over 50 have childhood memories. Like any community you have cornerstones. That was a big part of your life.”

But on Saturday the McDonald’s at 180 Main St. will close for good. The place to meet for morning coffee or pick up a burger and fries on the way home from work is now standing in the way of progress.

On three sides heavy construction equipment is doing the earthwork necessary to build a new port of entry at the base of a yet-to-be-built bridge to link Edmundston New Brunswick with Madawaska.

The new international bridge is needed – at nearly 100 years old the current span can no longer handle anything heavier than a passenger car -- and figuring out where to put it has been going on for more than a decade. The McDonald’s is the only thing left between the construction site and Route 1.

A McDonald’s spokesperson told Spectrum News in a statement that they were proud to have been in Madawaska for 48 years. The statement confirmed that the current location would close Saturday but did not address whether they considered rebuilding.

Town Manager Gary Picard said he and other town officials spent years trying to work with the fast-food giant to get them to relocate. Ultimately he found out by reading a newspaper story that the company would be leaving town for good.

“It’s an established business” Picard said. “It’s been in town for 50 years. We know it was successful. A group of citizens got together to try to push and put a compelling story together to get them to rebuild.”

That compelling story was told in the high-quality video called “Save Madawaska McDonalds.” Posted to YouTube on Aug. 30 it had nearly 10000 views as of this week.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

In the video customers talked about why they wanted the restaurant to stay.

“We need to save our McDonald’s” said a woman driving a white sedan. “We need to do something to keep this town together.”

A woman in a red pick-up truck said “It’s the only fast-food restaurant that us working people have in town.”

One man pointed out that although the Tim Horton’s in town has a drive-thru they don’t serve hamburgers. A woman in a dark blue SUV said “We need McDoanld’s. We have very few things in this town. It’s a place where people gather.”

Thibeault a former selectman who also appears in the video looked into the camera and said if a new McDonald’s opened in Madawaska it would help the town as it pursues revitalization efforts.

“McDonald’s would be sending a message to Madawaska” he said. “What would it be? It would be that you matter. Small town America you matter.”

In some ways the fight for the Madawaska McDonald’s is a way to fight for the town that has seen population drop from 5282 in 1980 to 3774 in 2019 according to census data. The downtown is a mixed bag of for sale signs papered-over windows and some longtime shops such as Roberts Jewelry and Pierrette Florist.

An undated sign in one shop window announced “Bread of Life Bookstore closing after 35 years.” It’s signed “Love & Hugs Rita.” In another window is an Acadian Tree of Life with brown branches bearing the leaves of common local names including Bouchard Berube Landry Fournier Soucy Gendreau Godbout Chasse and Gagnon.

On Sunday with steam flowing from paper mill stacks on both sides of the St. John River cars lined up at the McDonald’s drive-thru.

They brought their dogs and had large trailers hitched to their pick-up trucks. An elderly couple tried the doors of the restaurant before they saw the sign that said “lobby not open for dine in.”

In the northeastern-most town in the U.S. where the trash cans at McDonald’s say “merci” customers took their food to go for one of the last times.

Thibeault recalled another loss when K-Mart in town closed a few years back. He said in that instance the company had filed for bankruptcy. Not so with McDonald’s he said.

“It’s all about dollar signs” he said. “McDonald’s is now choosing to leave the town of Madawaska which is unfortunate. We’re just going to lick our wounds and move on.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L21jZG9uYWxkcy1tY3BsYW50LXVzLXRyaWFscy1wbGFudC1iYXNlZC1idXJnZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's to trial McPlant plant-based burger in the US,"McDonald's is preparing to bring a plant-based burger co-developed with Beyond Meat stateside for a trial run in a handful of restaurants. The McPlant is promised to offer the ""iconic"" taste of a McDonald's burger with all the trimmings though the firm is remaining tight-lipped about a wider rollout.

Just as fellow fast-food giants Burger King and KFC have done in recent years McDonald's is looking to expand its menu to include purely plant-based options and began trialing its first such offering the PLT in Europe and Canada in 2019.

The McPlant patty being served up as part of these upcoming US trials is made from plant-based ingredients including peas rice and potatoes. It will come on a sesame seed bun along with tomato lettuce pickles onions mayonnaise ketchup mustard and a slice of American cheese.

McDonald's has previously tested the McPlant in Sweden Denmark the Netherlands Austria and the UK. Starting November 3 the McPlant will be introduced for a limited time in eight US restaurants in Irving and Carrollton Texas Cedar Falls Iowa Jennings and Lake Charles Louisiana and El Segundo and Manhattan Beach California.

According to the company the small-scale tests will help it gauge how plant-based patties can be integrated into its kitchen operations. It says it will provide updates on wider availability following these trials.

What are some other unique restaurants in Ohio?

Here in Ohio there are so many unique restaurants to enjoy if you just know where to look. From restaurants with stores to restaurants with amazing grounds to explore Ohio has so much to offer its diners -- in addition to great fare! One of our favorite unique restaurants in Ohio is The Schoolhouse Restaurant in Camp Dennison which offers a fascinating glimpse into the past — while also serving up some pretty incredible home-cooked cuisine (the fried chicken is absolutely the best in the state!). Looking for a little lesson (see what we did there?) on one of the most unique restaurants in Ohio? Read our article here!

What’s the oldest restaurant in Ohio?

The oldest restaurant (and longest continually operating business in Ohio) is the Golden Lamb located in the historic and charming town of Lebanon. You can read all about this beloved favorite here; hailing from 1803 it has quite the storied past! In terms of oldest Italian restaurants Guarino’s Ristorante in Little Italy was established in 1918 making it the oldest Italian restaurant in Cleveland. One of the best restaurants in Ohio this Cleveland classic has been run by the same family since the beginning and its history is as noteworthy as its fare. Established just two years prior to Prohibition the little neighborhood eatery began life as a speakeasy and was a favorite spot for the Cleveland elite — and celebrities with Frank Sinatra among the restaurant’s regulars! In terms of cuisine the recipes are from the Old Country and feature bright herbs and bold flavors. Guarino’s is revered for its lasagna a family recipe straight from Mama Guarino. This restaurant really has stood the test of time and is a must-visit when in Forest City!

What are the best restaurants in Ohio?

Ohio has quite the culinary clout and we’ve a whole menu of must-visit restaurants (see what we did there?!) to prove it. Since we're on the theme of breakfast all day (we love you McDonald's!) Holtman's Donuts down in Cincinnati is easily one of the best spots to grab a donut and coffee in the Buckeye State. Since 1960 Holtman's Donut Shop has been satisfying Cincinnati’s sweet tooth with their unbelievable donuts. The Holtman family has always made their sweet concoctions from scratch daily and you can taste the freshness. The choices here are endless: their glazed yeast and cake donuts are absolutely perfect as are their more unique creations that feature specialty toppings such as cereal cookies and even bacon. Holtman's also offers a substantial selection of vegan varieties too and the Oreo crumble cake donut tastes just as sinful as its non-vegan counterparts.

According to the Israeli Corporations Authority the investment was made via Covidien which Medtronic purchased in 2015. Triple Jump is developing a unique small insulin pump patch that is placed on the patient’s body. The patch has mobile connectivity capabilities and will be included in a future artificial pancreas system.

Triple Jump which is based in the northern town of Yokneam was founded in 2015 by CTO Guy Shinar and Ofer Yodfat. Shinar was the CEO of X Technologies that was sold to Guidant for $200 million in 2003. Yodfat was also one of the founders of Medingo which developed an insulin pump and patch and was sold in 2010 to pharma giant Roche for around $170 million. In 2012 Roche shut down Medingo's operations in Israel and fired all 150 employees.

Among Triple Jump's additional investors are Elixir Medical Corporation Hong Kong investment fund Wealth Strategy Holding and veteran entrepreneur Dov Moran.

Adjuvant treatment with Keytruda and chemotherapy—with or without radiotherapy—failed to hit the mark for disease-free survival (DFS) in newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients who received surgery with curative intent according to an interim analysis of Merck’s late-stage KEYNOTE-B21 study. DFS refers to the length of time after a primary treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of their cancer.

The trial’s other primary endpoint overall survival was not formally tested because the Keytruda-chemo combo failed to reach statistical significance on the DFS metric Merck said in a Thursday release.

Merck says it’s continuing a full evaluation of the data and is working with investigators to share the results at a later date.

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the most common type of cancer in the uterus according to Merck. In the U.S. alone the company estimates roughly 67880 patients will be diagnosed with uterine body cancer this year. Merck also estimates there will be 13250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024.

“While these results were not what we had hoped we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of Keytruda in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications” Gursel Aktan M.D. Ph.D. vice president of global clinical development at Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

Merck will continue to test Keytruda-based combinations—plus other treatment approaches like antibody-drug conjugates (ADC)—in endometrial and other types of gynecologic cancers Aktan said.

Keytruda is already approved in patients with endometrial carcinoma that is microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR). The PD-1 inhibitor picked up that nod in 2022 following a 2017 approval that allowed the drug to cover previously treated MSI-H/dMMR tumors in patients without alternative treatment options.

Keytruda also boasts a second indication alongside Eisai-partnered Lenvima in previously treated endometrial cancer that’s not dMMR.

Over the past year Merck’s Keytruda has been sparring with GSK’s PD-1 rival Jemperli over endometrial cancer dominance in the clinic.

Last February just two months after Jemperli snagged a historic win for immunotherapy in first-line endometrial cancer Keytruda plus standard chemotherapy beat chemotherapy alone at staving off tumor progression or death in advanced or recurrent disease.

The following month at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology 2023 annual meeting both GSK and Merck provided a closer look at their meds’ late-stage performance in first-line endometrial cancer with Keytruda appearing to edge out Jemperli in MMR proficient (pMMR) patients—a key subgroup that Merck says comprises roughly two-thirds of all endometrial cancer cases.

GSK ultimately beat Merck to the finish line for a PD-1 nod in newly diagnosed disease with the company’s Jemperli in July snagging FDA clearance as an add-on to chemotherapy for patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer but only for tumors that are mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H).

Meanwhile Merck and Eisai’s Keytruda-Lenvima combo in December missed the mark in a phase 3 study as a potential first-line treatment in certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The oncology cocktail failed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival over a regimen of platinum-based chemotherapy missing both of its primary endpoints.

While Keytruda climbed to the top of pharma's sales charts in 2023 the drug has experienced a series of clinical ups and downs in 2024.

The PD-1 inhibitor started out the year by delivering a partial win in a phase 3 study pitting the drug against high-risk localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer and locally advanced bladder cancer. Around the same time Keytruda bolstered its case as a postsurgical treatment for resectable kidney cancer with data showing it helped slash the risk of death by 38% versus placebo post-kidney removal in patients with clear cell renal carcinoma—the most common form of kidney cancer.

The drug also posted a win in cervical cancer in March. But that same month Keytruda in combination with Lynparza failed to improve patients’ life expectancy or delay progression or death when subbed in for the chemotherapy pemetrexed during maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lunger cancer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vaGVhbHRoLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTbSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9oZWFsdGguZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9waGFybWEvcGhhcm1hLWluZHVzdHJ5L21lcmNrcy1lbmRvbWV0cmlhbC1jYW5jZXItdGhlcmFweS1mYWlscy10cmlhbC8xMDk5ODI0OTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck's endometrial cancer therapy fails trial,"Join the community of 2M+ industry professionals Subscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.

The initiative supports the company’s work in expanding access to health and accelerating progress toward the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goal 3 which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all. More specifically it is focused on creating a world where no woman has to die while giving life by helping to address the first target under SDG 3 reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100000 live births by 2030.

“I am so proud of our company’s longstanding commitment to our Merck for Mothers initiative which is dedicated to improving maternal health outcomes around the world” Allison Goldberg president Merck Foundation said. “Through Merck for Mothers we have now helped more than 30 million women access high-quality life-saving care around pregnancy and childbirth — surpassing our goal of reaching 25 million women by 2025. This milestone serves as a reminder that much work is left to be done and we remain committed to helping create a world where no woman has to die while giving life.”

Through wide-ranging approaches Merck for Mothers harnesses the power of public-private collaboration to strengthen health systems and mobilize solutions to address the diverse and unique needs of moms babies and families worldwide. The initiative’s milestone of 30 million women reached reflects the combined total impact of the programs and partnerships it supports in more than 70 countries including India Brazil Kenya Nigeria and the U.S.

The U.S. is the only high-income country in which maternal mortality is on the rise — where Merck for Mothers supports a variety of programs to address racial inequities in maternal health outcomes. For example with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Foundation Merck for Mothers created the Hear Her campaign to disseminate critical information on pregnancy and childbirth-related complications reaching more than 1.5 million people to date across the campaign’s website and social media channels."

The metaverse is a digital reality that combines aspects of social media online gaming augmented reality (AR) virtual reality (VR) and cryptocurrencies to allow users to interact virtually. Augmented reality overlays visual elements sound and other sensory input onto real-world settings to enhance the user experience. In contrast virtual reality is entirely virtual and enhances fictional realities.

In fact science fiction author Neal Stephenson coined the term metaverse in his 1992 novel Snow Crash. In the book human avatars and software agents interact in a three-dimensional virtual space.

Key Takeaways The metaverse is a shared virtual environment that people access via the Internet.

Cryptocurrency is an aspect of the metaverse.

Technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are combined in the metaverse to create a sense of ""virtual presence.""

Meta (formerly Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes augmented reality glasses will eventually be as widespread as smartphones.

In October 2021 Meta announced plans to create 10000 new high-skilled jobs in the European Union (EU) to help shape the metaverse.

An exact definition of the metaverse may be hard to explain because of its depths but most technology experts agree that the metaverse is a vast network where individuals via their avatars can interact socially and professionally invest in currency take classes work and travel in 3-D virtual reality.

As the metaverse grows it may likely create online spaces where user interactions are more multidimensional than current technology supports. In simple terms the metaverse will allow users to go beyond just viewing digital content users in the metaverse will be able to immerse themselves in a space where the digital and physical worlds converge.



Meta and the Metaverse

In July 2021 Mark Zuckerberg talked with journalist Casey Newton about the metaverse and the changes he envisioned for Facebook. Then rumors began swirling in mid-October 2021 about a Facebook rebrand—complete with a new name—to embrace the company’s commitment to the metaverse. Unnamed sources told The Verge that an announcement could come soon. And it did.

Meta has been talking metaverse for a while noting in an Oct. 17 2021 press release that the metaverse is ""a new phase of interconnected virtual experiences using technologies like virtual and augmented reality. At its heart is the idea that by creating a greater sense of ""virtual presence"" interacting online can become much closer to the experience of interacting in person.""

Interest in the metaverse is expected to grow substantially as investors and companies want to be part of what could be the next big thing. The metaverse is ""going to be a big focus [of Facebook's] and I think that this is just going to be a big part of the next chapter for the way that the Internet evolves after the mobile Internet"" Zuckerberg told technology site The Verge before announcing the name change. ""And I think it's going to be the next big chapter for our company too doubling down in this area.""



Proponents of the metaverse view the concept as the next stage in developing the Internet. Meta for example has already invested heavily in AR and VR developing hardware such as its Oculus VR headsets while AR glasses and wristband technologies are in the works. Zuckerberg who believes AR glasses will one day be as ubiquitous as smartphones told The Verge that over the next several years Facebook ""will effectively transition from people seeing us as primarily being a social media company to being a metaverse company.""

$50 million The investment Meta is making in global research and program partners to build the metaverse in a responsible way.

Special Considerations

Numerous sci-fi books television series and movies are set in metaverses—digital worlds indistinguishable from the real world. Often these sci-fi metaverses are dystopian worlds. Some of Zuckerberg's contemporaries are concerned that the real-life metaverse—the ""next-gen Internet""—could become a dystopian nightmare.

Niantic is a software developer best known for the augmented reality mobile games Ingress and Pokémon Go. Niantic CEO John Hanke for example wrote in a blog post ""A lot of people these days seem very interested in bringing this near-future vision of a virtual world to life including some of the biggest names in technology and gaming. But these novels served as warnings about a dystopian future of technology gone wrong.""



The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated interest in the metaverse as more people have worked from home and gone to school remotely. Of course there are concerns that the metaverse will make it even easier for people to spend time apart—even in a post-COVID world.

Hanke wrote ""We believe we can use technology to lean into the 'reality' of augmented reality—encouraging everyone ourselves included to stand up walk outside and connect with people and the world around us... Technology should be used to make these core human experiences better—not to replace them.""



What Exactly Is the Metaverse? Meta defines the metaverse as ""a set of virtual spaces where you can create and explore with other people who aren't in the same physical space as you."" Though metaverse technology is years away from being fully realized it is expected to eventually be a place where you can work play learn create shop and interact with friends in a virtual online environment.

What Is the Difference Between AR and VR? Augmented reality involves overlaying visual elements sound and other sensory stimuli onto a real-world setting to enhance the user experience. AR can be accessed with a smartphone and users can control their presence in the real world. In comparison virtual reality is completely virtual and enhances fictional realities. VR requires a headset device and users are controlled by the system.

Does Meta Own the Metaverse? The metaverse has no single creator (or definition) so it's not something that Meta owns or is solely responsible for developing. Still Meta has already invested heavily in the metaverse through its Oculus VR headsets and it's working on AR glasses and wristband technologies. In September 2021 the company announced a $50 million investment in global research and program partners to ensure that metaverse technology would be developed responsibly.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vYWJvdXQuZmIuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS8xMC9jcmVhdGluZy1qb2JzLWV1cm9wZS1tZXRhdmVyc2Uv0gFFaHR0cHM6Ly9hYm91dC5mYi5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLzEwL2NyZWF0aW5nLWpvYnMtZXVyb3BlLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Investing in European Talent to Help Build the Metaverse,"Creating 10000 new jobs at Facebook across the EU

Building on our long standing European presence and putting the region at the heart of our plans to help build the metaverse

Facebook is at the start of a journey to help build the next computing platform. Working with others we’re developing what is often referred to as the metaverse — a new phase of interconnected virtual experiences using technologies like virtual and augmented reality. At its heart is the idea that by creating a greater sense of “virtual presence” interacting online can become much closer to the experience of interacting in person. The metaverse has the potential to help unlock access to new creative social and economic opportunities. And Europeans will be shaping it right from the start.

No one company will own and operate the metaverse. Like the internet its key feature will be its openness and interoperability. Bringing this to life will take collaboration and cooperation across companies developers creators and policymakers. For Facebook it will also require continued investment in product and tech talent as well as growth across the business.

So today we’re announcing a plan to create 10000 new high-skilled jobs within the European Union (EU) over the next five years. This investment is a vote of confidence in the strength of the European tech industry and the potential of European tech talent.

Europe is hugely important to Facebook. From the thousands of employees in the EU to the millions of businesses using our apps and tools every day Europe is a big part of our success as Facebook is invested in the success of European companies and the wider economy.

This is an exciting time for European tech. The EU has a number of advantages that make it a great place for tech companies to invest — a large consumer market first class universities and crucially top-quality talent. European companies are at the cutting edge of several fields whether it’s the German biotech helping to develop the first-ever MRNA vaccine or the coalition of European neo-banks leading the future of finance. Spain is seeing record levels of investment into startups solving everything from online grocery delivery to neuroelectronics while Sweden is on its way to becoming the world’s first cashless society by 2023.

We have long believed that European talent is world-leading which is why we have invested in it so heavily over the years — from funding grants at the Technical University of Munich to opening our first major European AI research lab and FAIR accelerator programme in France and Facebook Reality Labs office in Cork.

Beyond emerging tech talent the EU also has an important role to play in shaping the new rules of the internet. European policymakers are leading the way in helping to embed European values like free expression privacy transparency and the rights of individuals into the day-to-day workings of the internet. Facebook shares these values and we have taken considerable action over the years to uphold them. We hope to see the completion of the Digital Single Market to support Europe’s existing advantages as well as stability on international data flows which are essential to a flourishing digital economy.

As we begin the journey of bringing the metaverse to life the need for highly specialized engineers is one of Facebook’s most pressing priorities. We look forward to working with governments across the EU to find the right people and the right markets to take this forward as part of an upcoming recruitment drive across the region. And as Facebook continues to grow in Europe we hope to invest more in its talent and continue to innovate in Europe for Europe and the world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwL3NvdGhlYnlzLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS1uZnQtbWFya2V0cGxhY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sotheby's Metaverse NFT Marketplace Digital Art,"Sotheby’s has become the first auction house to launch its own dedicated NFT marketplace called the Metaverse. The British-founded American-based corporation has worked with a number of digital artists this year that reflects the unquestionable rise of NFTs across all sectors of the art world.

The new NFT marketplace is backed by a list of celebrities and digital artists such as Steve Aoki and Paris Hilton to Pranksy and straybits. Sotheby’s aims to create a gathering point for the world of digital artists NFT enthusiasts and collectors. Having entered the game just earlier in the year the auction house aims to use its “expertise and curation to the burgeoning world of art for the digitally native generation” said Sotheby’s managing director Sebastian Fahey.

The Sotheby’s Metaverse will commence with the second installment of its “Natively Digital” sale which will be called “Natively Digital 1.2: The Collectors.” The sale will feature 53 works that include Bored Ape Yacht Club‘s and art from Kevin Abosch to an interesting cover design by Time magazine’s creative director D.W. Pine. Bidding for the second “Natively Digital” will take place from October 18 to 26.

Our technology is having a big impact on reducing how much hate speech people see on Facebook. According to our latest Community Standards Enforcement Report its prevalence is about 0.05% of content viewed or about 5 views per every 10000 down by almost 50% in the last three quarters.



We use technology to reduce the prevalence of hate speech in several ways: It helps us proactively detect it route it to our reviewers and remove it when it violates our policies. It also allows us to reduce the distribution of likely violating content. All of these tools working together is what makes an impact on prevalence.

In 2016 our content moderation efforts relied mainly on user reports. So we built technology to proactively identify violating content before people report it. Our proactive detection rate reflects this. However we report prevalence figures so we can be judged on how much hate speech is actually seen on our apps .

Data pulled from leaked documents is being used to create a narrative that the technology we use to fight hate speech is inadequate and that we deliberately misrepresent our progress. This is not true. We don’t want to see hate on our platform nor do our users or advertisers and we are transparent about our work to remove it. What these documents demonstrate is that our integrity work is a multi-year journey. While we will never be perfect our teams continually work to develop our systems identify issues and build solutions.

Recent reporting suggests that our approach to addressing hate speech is much narrower than it actually is ignoring the fact that hate speech prevalence has dropped to 0.05% or 5 views per every 10000 on Facebook. We believe prevalence is the most important metric to use because it shows how much hate speech is actually seen on Facebook.

Focusing just on content removals is the wrong way to look at how we fight hate speech. That’s because using technology to remove hate speech is only one way we counter it. We need to be confident that something is hate speech before we remove it. If something might be hate speech but we’re not confident enough that it meets the bar for removal our technology may reduce the content’s distribution or won’t recommend Groups Pages or people that regularly post content that is likely to violate our policies. We also use technology to flag content for more review.

We have a high threshold for automatically removing content. If we didn’t we’d risk making more mistakes on content that looks like hate speech but isn’t harming the very people we’re trying to protect such as those describing experiences with hate speech or condemning it.

Another metric being misconstrued is our proactive detection rate which tells us how good our technology is at finding content before people report it to us. It tells us of the content we remove how much we found ourselves. In 2016 the vast majority of our content removals were based on what users reported to us. We knew we needed to do better and so we began building technology to identify potentially violating content without anyone flagging it to us.

When we began reporting our metrics on hate speech only 23.6% of content we removed was detected proactively by our systems; the majority of what we removed was found by people. Now that number is over 97%. But our proactive rate doesn’t tell us what we are missing and doesn’t account for the sum of our efforts including what we do to reduce the distribution of problematic content. That’s why we focus on prevalence and consistently describe it as the most important metric. Prevalence tells us what violating content people see because we missed it. It’s how we most objectively evaluate our progress as it provides the most complete picture. We talk about prevalence in our Community Standards Enforcement Report report every quarter and describe it in our Transparency Center.

Prevalence is how we measure our work internally and that’s why we share the same metric externally. While we know our work will never be done in this space the fact that prevalence has been reduced by almost 50% in the last three quarters shows that taken together our efforts are having an impact. As reported in our Community Standards Enforcement Report we can attribute a significant portion of the drop to our improved and expanded AI systems.

We’ve worked with international experts to develop our metrics. We’re also the only company which has volunteered to have them independently audited.

We include many metrics in our quarterly reports which are the most comprehensive of their kind to give people a more complete picture. We have worked with international experts in measurement statistics and other areas to provide an independent public assessment to make sure we are measuring the right things. While they broadly agreed with our approach they also provided recommendations for how we can improve. You can read their full report here. We have also committed to undergoing an independent audit with global auditing firm EY to make sure we are measuring and reporting our metrics accurately.",,,

Unfortunately all of those players are retired and their presence was a reminder that the bad days are here again in force.

Memories of better times are all the Giants have now. The present is disgraceful. There are no signs the future will be any better.

Better to salute and remember the Super Bowl XLVI team as the halftime ceremony on Sunday commemorating the 10-year anniversary was the only reason to be in attendance at MetLife Stadium. You cannot live in the past but it sure beats the garbage these Giants are trying to sell as competitive football.

“It’s not acceptable’’ safety Logan Ryan said. “I mean honestly it’s not acceptable and that’s just it.’’

Honestly no one is saying otherwise.

There have been lowlights aplenty over the past decade and especially in the terrible past five years. Still this felt like a low point amid all the other low points. The Rams (5-1) entered MetLife Stadium and treated the home team like some junior varsity outfit as the Giants were thrashed 38-11. At least the weather was spectacular.

It was so bad so early that coach Joe Judge said he “challenged guys at halftime’’ with the Giants down 28-3 and showing no signs of life.

“I wanted to see who’s going to finish the game’’ Judge said. “I wanted to see what type of fight some of these guys have.’’

All losses are equal but not the same. This one was as bad as it gets.

“We have to play with heart’’ receiver Sterling Shepard said. “When you look up at the scoreboard you can tend to get down. People’s heads start to drop. No matter what the situation is we have to fight.’’

There was little fight in the Giants.

To add to the desultory tone of the day the Giants lost star rookie receiver Kadarius Toney and left tackle Andrew Thomas to ankle injuries as the beat goes on.

Tom Coughlin the former Giants head coach took to the podium at halftime and offered an emotional reminder of how his upstart 2011 team won it all.

“We shut the noise out’’ Coughlin said his voice rising. “Fire the coach. Fire the coaching staff. Fire the players. You know how that goes.’’

The noise around this current Giants team is full of discord.

Daniel Jones knocked out of last week’s loss in Dallas with a concussion regressed with three interceptions and one lost fumble often running for his life with little or no help around him. Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford (four touchdown passes) did as he pleased.

At 1-5 the Giants are in another downward spiral and all-in on a miserable season which is fitting considering the events of the day. “All in’’ was the rallying cry of the 2011 Giants who were 7-7 after 14 games and did not lose again defeating the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI. That really was the last time this franchise was what it purports itself to be.

There was booing of course because this is what Giants fans do when their team is stinking up the joint week after week.

“Yeah they’re upset’’ Jones said. “We didn’t play well we’re certainly upset about that too. I get it.’’

4 A Giants fans holds up a sign during the team’s loss to the Rams on Sunday. Charles Wenzelberg/New York Post

Defensive linemen Leonard Williams did not get it.

“Obviously we’re in our own home stadium’’ he said. “I don’t want to be hearing boos from my own fans. I understand that they have a right to be upset as well because they’re coming to see us put good football on the field. We haven’t been winning up to date. But at the same time I don’t know I don’t like that.’’

No one likes anything having to do with these Giants.

Toney had three catches on the first series then exited. Just like that whatever dynamism the Giants had on offense was gone.

Shortly after the Rams broke through for a 7-3 lead in the second quarter Jones was sacked when Matt Peart — in at left tackle when Thomas went down — was beaten by linebacker Ogbonnia Okoronkwo. The ball was sitting there Peart was there and all he had to do was fall on the ball on the Giants’ 12-yard line. Peart muffed the recovery. The Rams took over and Stafford hit Cooper Kupp who easily beat cornerback Adoree’ Jackson in the right side of the end zone to make it 14-3.

Jones was intercepted by safety Taylor Rapp (who picked off Jones twice) to put the Rams on the Giants’ 14-yard line. Four plays later it was 21-3.

Stafford hit Kupp for 25 yards with safeties Xavier McKinney and Julian Love colliding with each other. It was 33 seconds before halftime when Stafford lofted a pass to running back Darrell Henderson who ran past linebacker Tae Crowder for a 25-yard scoring hookup.

He was their most dynamic ball carrier once Saquon Barkley went down.

And he was their emergency quarterback with Daniel Jones sidelined running the Wildcat and figuratively warming up in the bullpen if second-stringer Mike Glennon got hurt.

“It’s all football to me” Toney said Friday. “I’ve played quarterback so I’m used to having the ball in my hands and having to make decisions. It’s not much of a big deal to me. It’s just what I do.”

Joe Judge may bench Toney for the start of Sunday’s home game against the Rams (4-1) as punishment for the punch he threw at Cowboys safety Damontae Kazee.

The Giants’ first-round pick also is managing a right ankle injury that required X-rays and a follow-up doctor’s appointment after the Dallas loss.

But if the Giants (1-4) want to hold off the boos at MetLife Stadium and challenge their West Coast foes Judge and offensive coordinator Jason Garrett know that No. 89 has to touch the ball often — and that there is no limit to what he can do.

The Giants need to get the ball in the hands of Kadarius Toney any way they can.

Toney has 267 receiving yards and eight rushing yards the last two weeks. He’ll get ample opportunities to increase both totals against Aaron Donald’s L.A. defense.

“He’s dynamic with the ball in his hands and he has a quarterback background” Garrett said. “He seems very comfortable doing those things. He has a feel and an instinct. I think he’s proving that when you get the ball in his hands he can do some real positive things for you.”

The rookie’s biggest challenge on Sunday might be keeping his cool when he faces Rams corner Jalen Ramsey an infamous trash-talker who frequently gets in receivers’ heads.

Toney promised to kill the Rams’ defense with his actions not his words.

“I can’t control what anybody else does” Toney said. “I’m a silent assassin. I don’t talk to nobody on the field.”

There was nothing silent about Toney’s right-handed punch at Kazee last Sunday at Dallas’ AT&T Stadium though.

So that’s why Judge has to discipline Toney by taking away some playing time against the Rams: to send his team a no-tolerance message and to warn Toney not to do it again.

“I’m just playing my role” Toney said Friday of possibly being sat down. “At the end of the day I’m not this or that. I was able to go out there and showcase what I can do but at the end of the day I’m still the rookie. There’s still a lot that I have to learn a lot of stuff that I have to overcome.”

Judge said he doesn’t have Toney sitting in the quarterback meeting room. Not yet anyway.

“Nah” the coach said laughing.

But Toney ran some more plays at quarterback in practice this week. And Judge said Toney has earned the coaching staff’s trust to handle more.

“To me one of the biggest plays he’s made for me as a coach is when we called the first [Toney] pass in New Orleans [in Week 4] and he didn’t throw that ball” Judge said. “It’s key to see a young guy like that make the right decision.”

Judge saw discretion and patience beyond Toney’s years in that choice when the Saints defense adjusted and picked up the Giants’ downfield targets. Toney had shown the same restraint when he ran the play in practice and he did it again in the game.

“When you see a guy who makes those right decisions it gives you more trust to say ‘Alright give him more on his plate'” Judge said.

Toney had to earn trust to line up as a QB in the NFL but the Giants have known he could do it for a long time.

Assistants Jeremy Pruitt (Alabama) Jody Wright (Alabama) and Kevin Sherrer (Georgia) recruited Toney out of Mattie T. Blount High School in Prichard Ala. where he starred at QB.

“When he gets the ball in his hands he’s like a running back” Pruitt told the Daily News in the spring. “You have to tackle him. Some guys look to go down. He doesn’t look to go down. He has really good balance and body control. He can make you miss. He’s really tough.”

It’s not clear just how much the Giants will use Toney as a quarterback in shotgun on Sunday. What the Giants clearly understand however is that their path to keeping pace with the Rams runs through Toney’s dynamic skill set.

“His instincts and his feel and how smart he is as a player just early on in this whole process has been impressive” Garrett said.

The Giants’ latest marketing initiative on Sunday will be a halftime ceremony to honor the 10-year anniversary of the 2011 Super Bowl XLVI champion team.

The last time John Mara was on the MetLife Stadium field at halftime in Week 3 for Eli Manning’s jersey retirement the home fans booed the co-owner loudly.

Giants fans jeered tight end Evan Engram that same game. They are restless.

They are sick and tired of only one playoff appearance — and zero postseason wins — since that 2011 title team. And they’ll likely make Mara hear it again Sunday unless they see a reason for hope.

Toney is that glimmer of optimism. He is the 22-year-old rookie who will try to turn this oil tanker of futility around on Sunday at receiver running back or quarterback -— whatever it takes."

Bruno and Babyface. Now that would be a wild residency on the Strip.

We settled for Bruno Mars introducing Kenny “Babyface” Edmonds at the 25th Keep Memory Alive Power of Love gala Saturday night at Resorts World Las Vegas.

Mars came out to a standing ovation futilely asking the crowd “Sit down! Sit down! Please!”

Bruno intro

On a night that summoned songwriters Mars recalled Edmonds telling him he’d originally written “Every Time I Close My Eyes” for Luther Vandross.

Mars was stunned.

“I said ‘You did what?’ I am a songwriter and I understand how hard it is to come up with these chords and make something that’s magical and I couldn’t believe he would give it away” said Mars who has worked with Edmonds intermittently over the past five years. “I promise y’all if I wrote that song you would see me going down the street (singing) ‘And every time I close my eyes.’”

Edmonds recorded the song himself and it became an R&B classic. Mars asked Edmonds “Aren’t you happy it turned out the way it did and Luther didn’t recorded and you did?”

Edmonds said “No you know what if it was Luther Vandross’s song would have been a classic for him because I’m a songwriter first. That hit me so hard. That’s what he does with his music he’s so selfless.”

Edmonds performed “Change The World” which Edmonds produced. The backing vocalist were a veritable roster of all-stars: Demi Lovato AJ McLean of Backstreet Boys Shawn Stockman and Wanya Morris of Boyz II Men. As someone said a gala was held and the Grammy awards show broke out.

A legendary message

Smokey Robinson stepped into the spotlight to close the night speaking warmly and in modest tones. He’s one superstar who remains down to earth.

“I cannot even begin to express how humbled I am to receive this award” Robinson said from the stage upon being introduced by “Blackish” actor Anthony Anderson.

Moments later Robinson added “I don’t do what I do to get awards. I do it for the love of it.”

There’s that word again “love” which spread through the tented palace designed specifically for the event at Resorts World. Robinson Edmonds and Genting Group CEO K.T. Limwhose company owns the hotel were all honored as the event returned to full capacity for the first time since its event at MGM Grand Garden in March 2020.

About 1200 guests turned out in a venue that had been “Ruvo-Fied” for the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health co-founders Larry and Camille Ruvo. White drapes multicolored lights LED screens and regal chandeliers filled the venue which is intended to be a permanent facility.

Before singing Robinson spoke from the heart embracing the Ruvo Center’s battle against such neurocognitive diseases as Alzheimer’s Parkinson’s Huntington’s multiple system atrophy and multiple sclerosis. He said that medical hardship is universal.

Alzheimer’s and dementia affected Robinson’s own life and his original band The Miracles. The 81-year-old (remarkably) Robinson recalled his lifelong friend Bobby Rogers from that band. The two were born on the same day (Feb. 19 1940) in the same hospital in Detroit. The two met at age 14 and grew as professional singers partners in the Miracles for a dozen years.

In 2013 the year Rogers died Robinson called Rogers keeping with the tradition.

“He had no idea who I was” Robinson told the audience. “He knew nothing about me. Who I was why I was talking to him. … It was a hurting feeling to think this had happened to him after being so close all of our lives. But his wife Joan got on the phone after and said ‘Don’t feel bad about this because I live with him and he doesn’t know who I am.”

Robinson’s words brought the message home. He also sang in the voice that has somehow defied time performing “Being With You” and “Tracks of My Tears.” His friend Charlie Wilson formerly of the great funk/R&B band the Gap Band joined for “All My Love.”

The show culminated with the night’s lineup of Wilson Lovato Tori Kelly Jordin Sparks Morris and Stockman Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr. and Kenny Loggins all singing “Get Ready.” Keyboard great Greg Phillinganes navigated the performance and gala to its close the requisite storm of red-paper hearts. After a 19-month pause the event showed it still delivers the power.

Around the room

Larry Ruvo repeatedly thanked Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis and Vegas Golden Knights owner Bill Foley for their support. Both were in attendance. So was Gov. Steve Sisolak and just a few tables away Sheriff Joe Lombardo seeking to unseat Sisolak while campaigning as a Republican. Sen. Jacky Rosen was also among the elected officials on hand.

Davis allowed he’d had a rough week with the Raiders losing at home to the Bears the Aces eliminated from the WNBA playoffs and coach Jon Gruden forced to step down. And this was just as “SNL” was toasting Davis and the team at about the time the gala was closing. But count on Davis to show his resiliency and he enjoys full support of Las Vegas’ power brokers.

Angie made the show

Larry Ruvo’s 97-year-old mother Angie was seated with Lorraine Hunt-Bono and Dennis Bono. Angie Ruvo is Lorraine’s aunt the late Mama Maria Perry’s younger sister. Amazing to see her again.

Cool Hang Alert

Charter members of the Cool Hang Hall of Fame Santa Fe & The Fat City Horns are back at Copa Room at Bootlegger Bistro at 7:30 p.m. Mondays. There is no better band or hang than this Vegas institution and hey you might run into some of Lady Gaga’s band members this week. Hit up the club for specifics.

Warm words have given way to stern warnings on Brexit and surly trade talks. Yet there is one aspect of the relationship that certainly remains special: corporate America’s apparently insatiable appetite for British businesses.

Uncle Sam’s shopping trolley has been filled to overflowing with UK companies since the start of the pandemic as market panic gave way to a bargain-hunting frenzy that has seen bids for notable names including outsourcer G4S infrastructure builder John Laing and defence companies Meggitt and Ultra Electronics. This week will mark the next steps in three more buyouts: supermarket Morrisons inhaler-maker Vectura and bookmaker Entain.

At Morrisons shareholders are expected to back a takeover by the US private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice on Tuesday after a bid battle and auction pumped up its price. On the same day Vectura’s London-listed shares will be cancelled after its controversial acquisition by cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris.

The buyout of Entain the owner of the Coral and Ladbrokes betting brands may still have further to run but US bidder DraftKings has until Tuesday to put forward a formal offer after approaching with a $22.4bn (£16.4bn) bid that was worth almost double a previous offer by Las Vegas’s MGM Resorts. DraftKings hopes to apply Entain’s UK bookmaking expertise in the US where deregulation has triggered a breakneck race for what could be one of the world’s most lucrative gambling markets.

Hefty premiums have calmed quibbles up to now but Tuesday may see some quiet ‘whither Britain’ reflection in City pubs

The three deals would have a cumulative value of about £25bn before debt is included adding further to takeovers adding up to £36bn that were completed in the first six months of 2021 according to data from the Office for National Statistics. Foreign buyers may not match 2016’s all-time record (when a few mega-deals skewed the total) but 2021 is still likely to be one of the biggest selloffs in UK corporate history.

Hefty premiums offered by buyers have calmed quibbles from investors up to now but Tuesday evening may see some quiet “whither Britain” reflection in City pubs. Two camps have emerged in the acquisition spree: blithe spirits who are eminently comfortable with corporate Britain being for sale – for the right price – and others much more uneasy about the star-spangled banner rising over yet more former British assets.

The Morrisons deal does not lend itself well to the optimists’ argument. A share price that still lags behind the level it hit in 2013 – even after taking into account the 61% premium to the undisturbed price squeezed out of a private equity buyer – is not usually indicative of a company with spectacular growth prospects and analysts expect asset sales in the order of £2.5bn to achieve private-equity levels of return on investment. Politicians are watching (or perhaps bracing themselves) for any job cuts.

Triumphalism on the other two deals might be tempered by the ethical quandaries associated with gambling and tobacco companies – two conference events quickly dropped their Vectura sponsorship. But from a certain angle the takeovers of Entain and Vectura could be spun as optimistic tales of research prowess. Both are British companies that developed highly valued technology.

Yet the buyouts will surely also give pause to even the most ardent “global Britain” proponents. An open door to business is all very well but it will again raise the question of why British companies seem to be unable to make their own way on to the world stage.",,,,,,,,,

As the world grapples with an ongoing chip shortage a quiet giant among chipmakers has committed to investing $100 billion over three years to ramp up production. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company may not be a household name but with a market value of over $550 billion it's one of the world's 10 most valuable companies. Now it's leveraging its considerable resources to bring the world's most advanced chip manufacturing back to U.S. soil. CNBC got an exclusive tour of the $12 billion fabrication plant or fab in Phoenix Arizona where TSMC will start making 5-nanometer chips in 2024. The company says it will produce 20000 wafers each month. ""These are parts that are going to be used in lots of different places: CPUs GPUs IPUs etc. They'll be used in smartphones"" Rick Cassidy told CNBC. Cassidy is TSMC's chief strategy officer and the president and CEO of TSMC's project in Arizona. TSMC makes key components for everything from cellphones to F-35 fighter jets to NASA's Perseverance Rover mission to Mars. Earlier this month it announced plans for a new factory in Japan where it will produce chips with older technologies for things like household devices and certain car components. TSMC is also Apple 's exclusive provider of the most advanced chips inside every iPhone currently on the market and most Mac computers. ""But they remain sort of in the background in terms of end markets. So Apple gets all the accolades when a new phone comes out"" said Joanne Itow managing director of manufacturing at Semico Research. ""We're low-key. We let our products speak for themselves. Their success brings all the business that we could ever hope for"" Cassidy said. The U.S. was the birthplace of advanced silicon but for decades now it's been losing market share to Asia where 79% of the world's chip production happened in 2020 according to industry association SEMI. It calculated the U.S. was responsible for 12% of worldwide chip manufacturing last year down from 37% in 1990.

TSMC's $12 billion 5-nanometer chip fabrication plant is six months into being built in northern Phoenix Arizona on September 28 2021. TSMC

TSMC alone was responsible for 24% of the world's semiconductor output in 2020 up from 21% in 2019 according to the company. When it comes to the most advanced chips used in the latest iPhones supercomputers and automotive AI TSMC is responsible for 92% of production while Samsung is responsible for the other 8% according to research group Capital Economics. ""It's become almost a monopoly at the leading edge and all of those manufacturing operations for the most part are out of Taiwan Hsinchu. That becomes a matter of national importance for the United States but not only the United States but the Western world"" said Christopher Rolland Susquehanna's senior semiconductor analyst. Along with cutting edge 3- and 5-nanometer chips TSMC also makes larger chips for products such as electric toothbrushes and coffeemakers. Cars often use less-advanced 28- to 40-nanometer chips. All types of chips have been impacted by the shortage. Carmakers including GM and Toyota have paused production at some plants. And Apple is likely to slash its 2021 production targets for the iPhone 13 with orders for some models delayed by more than a month.

World's first pure-play foundry

When Morris Chang first proposed the idea for TSMC in the 1980s investors were skeptical. Born in China and educated at Harvard MIT and Stanford Chang moved to Taiwan after 25 years at Texas Instruments . There the government asked him to create a Taiwanese semiconductor company that would become a world leader. His idea: Focus only on manufacturing — what's now known as a pure-play foundry. ""When you're just focused on one thing you do one thing really well"" said Cassidy who joined TSMC 23 years ago after what he describes as a fascinating hourslong meeting with Chang. Chang bet big on a need that didn't exist yet. When he founded TSMC in 1987 giants such as Intel and Texas Instruments took pride in designing and making their own chips. A legendary saying in the industry back then was ""Real men have fabs."" ""When Morris went out to get funding he went to many named companies that you know and they told them 'Morris your idea won't get off the ground. If you get it off the ground it can't scale.'"" But as chips got more complex manufacturing them became an enormous undertaking. Analysts say building a fab today takes at least two years and $10 billion. It's become nearly impossible for even the biggest chip companies — Intel  Nvidia  Broadcom  Qualcomm  AMD — to do it all and keep up with the most advanced tech. Intel for example still designs and makes its own chips but it's fallen behind Samsung and TSMC in recent years and now relies on TSMC to make some of its chips. ""If you were a smart designer you didn't have to have billions of dollars and a fab behind you for the first time with the emergence of TSM"" Rolland said. Now each major step of chipmaking is often handled by a separate company. Some such as Arm and MIPS focus on IP and architecture providing the core building blocks to design chips. Then there's electronic design automation companies such as Cadence and Synopsys that write the software used to design chips. Only one company ASML  makes the $180 million extreme ultraviolet light machines required to etch designs into the most advanced chips. Then there are the wildly successful fabless companies designing the chips such as Apple  Qualcomm Nvidia and many more.

As these fabless companies took off TSMC found itself on a flywheel making more and more of the world's chips. ""This has allowed [TSMC] to not only catch up but in my opinion surpass Intel to become the world's greatest manufacturing technology on the planet"" Rolland said ""one of the top 10 most valuable companies in terms of market cap in the globe."" TSMC was first listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in 1994 and in 1997 it became the first Taiwan-based company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. By the 2000s it had caught up with the 20 or so other companies making the most advanced chips at the time. As the tech kept advancing more and more companies fell behind. Today only two manufacturers remain that can make the most advanced 5-nanometer chips: TSMC and Samsung. In 2013 Apple started relying on TSMC to make its A-series chips for the iPhone as it moved away from reliance on Samsung a direct competitor in mobile phones. Today there's a TSMC chip inside every iPhone on the market. And Apple has moved away from Intel too now relying on TSMC to make the chips inside most Macs. In 2018 at age 86 Chang retired as chairman of TSMC. His radical pure-play foundry idea continues to pay off. With the opening of a new fab in Taiwan next year TSMC is in a race with Samsung to make the world's first 3-nanometer chips — with Intel planning to get there by 2025.

Bringing 5-nanometer to the U.S.

Right now no fab in the U.S. can make 5-nanometer chips. But TSMC is changing that. ""If you want more capacity you have to build more fabs. And that's one of the reasons that we're moving to the U.S."" Cassidy said. ""Our customers want us in the U.S. The U.S. government wants us here."" TSMC Technical Director Tony Chen took CNBC on a tour of the site where a four-story 2.3-million-square-foot fab is being erected. Chen has led 17 other fab construction projects in his 23 years with TSMC. ""This project is designed as a 5-nanometer fab. Actually it's a copy from the fab we have in Taiwan"" Chen said. Nearby one of the world's largest cranes was being lifted to its full height of 200 feet. The 2300-ton crane was brought to the site on 153 semitrucks. Site supervisor Jim White said contractors have moved nearly 4 million cubic yards of dirt and have used more than 260 million gallons of water since construction began in April. Building a fab and making chips takes an incredible amount of water not an abundant resource in the middle of the desert. Arizona's biggest water source is groundwater but deep wells at big farms are using water up faster than it's naturally replenished. Chen said TSMC needs around 4.7 million gallons of water each day to support production. TSMC is no stranger to water shortages. Taiwan is facing its worst drought in 56 years something that TSMC said has not impacted production. In Arizona TSMC said an on-site water treatment center will recycle up to 90% of water used at the fab. ""And then ultimately that water will be reinjected into the aquifer in partnership with the city of Phoenix after reverse osmosis and other technology solutions are provided"" said Chris Camacho president and CEO of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council. He helped negotiate the deal that brought the project to Arizona. Another challenge is that most 5-nanometer specialists are based in Asia. To solve this TSMC's academic relations manager Roxanna Vega said the company is bringing over some of its top experts from Taiwan. ""They're seen as subject matter experts on what they do in our fabs over there"" Vega said. ""It'll be a temporary assignment ... two maybe three years."" TSMC said it's already sent more than 250 new U.S. hires to Taiwan for 12 to 18 months to get up to speed. ""The opportunity to train in our 5-nanometer gigafab in Taiwan is to kind of give them that insight of how immense and how state of the art the tools machinery and everything is going to be here in Arizona"" Vega said. Diversification is a key reason for TSMC to bring advanced manufacturing to the U.S. ""Taiwan is not very good when it comes to analog semiconductor design and by moving to the United States you'd be able to tap into a much larger number of analog designers"" Rolland said.

According to ""The 5G Economy"" published by IHS Market the global 5G industry investment will reach US$4 trillion in 2035 and another US$12 trillion will be invested in related applications driven by 5G.

Mr. Jang-Hwa Leu the Director General of Industrial Development Bureau Ministry of Economic Affairs Taiwan indicated that the semiconductor and ICT advantage of Taiwan is impregnable in the world. To keep the lead intellectual property (IP) protection becomes vital. ""5G is setting off a new industrial revolution… the key to be standing on firm ground is to control the latest innovation and IP"" said Mr. Leu.

Under the theme of ""Maximising 5G IP value in Taiwan"" and co-organized by Business Next IPBC Taiwan 2021 presents in-depth speeches and discussions about IP and patent protection strategy as well as the value of 5G. The morning session includes senior executives and experts from Nissan Motor Ericsson Micron Technology ARM Intel Nokia and more. Apart from the critical 5G patents the speakers also shared their insights toward the development of 6G.

Dr. Jen-Ming Wu Director at the Next Generation Communications Research Center of Hon Hai Research Institute kicked off the afternoon session with ""Innovation Trend and IP Strategy of 5G"" suggested that ""The fourth generation of mobile communications changed our daily lives while the fifth generation is changing our society as a whole.""

Followed by Jerry Hsu President at 5G Industry Innovation and Development Alliance he illustrated the mass applications of combining 5G with AI and big data. ""So charging royalty is getting more and more sophisticated"" supported by Dr. Jen-Ming Wu ""We have to be very careful while deploying IP and patent strategies.""

""In addition to self-developed patents the concept of building a patent platform has gradually become a trend"" stated Sarina Lin VP of MediaTek Inc. With the help of Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) many Taiwanese enterprises join forces to establish an IP Bank.

For example HTC has been introducing AR/VR and AI to healthcare education and entertainment. Chia Te Lu the VP Head of Business Development and General Counsel of HTC indicated that ""Patents are useful assets when enterprises cooperate and negotiate with other organizations.""

Similarly Billie Chen Associate General Counsel and Chief IP Counsel of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) mentioned ""As the champion of patent application in Taiwan for five continuous years researchers at TSMC not only develop their own technologies but proactively collaborate with others.""

""Acer has built a solid patent strategy based on both vertical and horizontal development opportunities"" said Lydia Wu General Counsel of Acer. ""We always reserve the most important patents.""

Dr. Shiaw-Shian Yu Executive VP and Executive Operating Officer of ITRI concluded the event with ITRI's 2030 Technology Strategy & Roadmap. ""Cross-field collaboration matters"" said Dr. Shiaw-Shian Yu ""If we can integrate patents owned by Taiwanese companies we will see an exponential growth of impacts to the world!""

Source: Nasdaq

On Oct. 9 2017 GitLab announced a $20 million funding round led by Alphabet's GV formerly known as Google Ventures. The news hit just as larger rival GitHub was about to start its annual developer conference. It was just one instance of the smaller upstart trying to snag attention from its more established rival. Just over a year earlier on Sept. 13 2016 GitLab said it had raised $20 million in a round led by August Capital. GitHub's developer event dubbed Universe kicked off the next morning. In the market for code collaboration GitLab grew up in the shadows of GitHub. Both companies were built on top of the open-source software Git which was started by Linux creator Linus Torvalds as a way for software developers to share code and work together from disparate locations. GitHub was founded in 2008. Four years later it raised $100 million from Andreessen Horowitz a mammoth round in those days. GitLab launched around the time of that financing. In early 2015 after GitLab wrapped up its three-month stint in the Y Combinator accelerator program CEO Sid Sijbrandij namechecked GitHub three times in his two-minute presentation at YC Demo Day. ""Our competitor GitHub has 270 employees. GitLab has 800 contributors"" he said touting his company's open-source bona fides. ""That is why GitHub enterprise has been playing catch-up to our feature set."" GitHub had little reason to sweat at the time. GitLab only had $1 million in annualized revenue and GitHub was not only backed by Andreessen but would soon pull in another $250 million in a round led by Sequoia. However GitHub's cultural deficiencies had been exposed by an engineer named Julie Ann Horvath who tweeted at length in 2014 about sexism in the upper ranks. Although the company continued expanding after some C-suite tweaks GitLab suddenly had an opportunity to use its distinguishing culture to its advantage. GitLab was founded as a fully remote company with no headquarters and not a single piece of real estate. All employees across the globe were said to have equal access to information. GitLab has an expansive online handbook now consisting of over 2000 web pages that lays out in detail how the company operates regarding everything from finance engineering and marketing to hiring stock options compensation and remote work. Board meetings were held at Sijbrandij's apartment in San Francisco's South of Market district. ""We would all be sitting around his kitchen table and he had a cat that would be in his bedroom meowing to come hang out"" said Dave Munichiello a partner at GV who became a board observer after leading his company's investment in 2017. Eventually the board fell in line with the rest of GitLab's operations and went fully remote. ""It was the last aspect of the company to go remote and our board meetings are better for it"" Sijbrandij said in an interview on Thursday from the Nasdaq.

'Lighting money on fire'

Munichiello said the cultural differences loomed large as he was evaluating the two Git-based rivals. So was the fact that GitLab had raised much less cash and had low operating costs. ""We had just gone through this period of time where GitHub was lighting money on fire"" Munichiello said. In GitLab ""we saw a company that had a fantastic culture and understood that developers are the new kingmakers"" he added. GitHub did not respond to a request for comment. Then in June 2018 Microsoft said it was buying GitHub for a whopping $7.5 billion. At roughly 25 times revenue GitHub was richly priced for that time period and the deal seemed to crown the market winner. GitLab's most recent valuation from the year prior was just $200 million.

In fact the game was just beginning. GitLab excelled against its larger rival despite Microsoft's massive sales engine. It's also thriving against BitBucket its other main competitor owned by Atlassian . In its fundraising announcement in September 2019 GitLab said annual revenue was up 143%. For the year that ended Jan. 31 revenue jumped 87%. Public investors are now rewarding that momentum. GitLab debuted on the Nasdaq on Thursday in one of the most-anticipated software IPOs of the year. After the stock's 49% jump in its first tow days GitLab is valued at almost $16.5 billion more than double GitHub's acquisition price from 2018. Its revenue multiple of 71 is one of the highest in all of software and is well above Atlassian's multiple of 45. ""The market loves fast growth"" said Tomasz Tunguz a managing director at Redpoint Ventures who invests in software and infrastructure companies. His firm is not involved with GitLab. Tunguz said that even with GitHub getting swallowed GitLab showed the world of DevOps — the word refers to a combination of development and IT operations — doesn't operate by the same rules as traditional software. In DevOps developers decide what tools they they use. With so many free and low-priced products available through a simple cloud delivery model the software giants and their massive sales and marketing budgets don't have all that much influence over their choices. So GitLab built a suite of tools that developers want in a package that businesses could buy. ""GitLab had a sense of the importance of enterprise sales much earlier on in the lifespan of the company"" Tunguz said. Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub opened up two big opportunities for GitLab. First GitLab could peel off developers who had an inherent mistrust of Microsoft and its anti-open-source past. Although current CEO Satya Nadella has made a point of embracing open-source offering where it makes sense for customers Microsoft historically distanced itself from open source with former CEO Steve Ballmer once calling Linux ""a cancer."" More importantly GitLab could promote itself as a neutral service available across all public cloud providers while GitHub would be owned by the same company that controls Azure the second-largest cloud service after Amazon Web Services. In a blog post titled ""Congratulations GitHub on the acquisition by Microsoft"" GitLab made exactly that point. ""The long-term strategic implication seems to be that Microsoft wants to use GitHub as a means to drive Azure adoption"" the post said.

Sijbrandij said the market has played out as expected since the deal. For example earlier this year GitHub launched a product called Codespaces as a cloud-based developer environment on Azure. As for customers migrating over Sijbrandij said UBS signed on last year going from ""zero to 11000 people on GitLab"" even though the bank like most big financial institutions uses a lot of Microsoft products. ""Our customers put great value on us being cloud-independent"" Sijbrandij said. ""Every company is becoming multi-cloud."" Sijbrandij added that Amazon and Google sell GitLab's tools and those efforts ""have been intensifying over the last few years.""

Bleeding cash

Still GitLab has financial challenges. Even with no real estate costs and an expansive universe of unpaid developers helping build features it's running up big expenditures in sales and marketing as it tries to convert free users into paid customers who shell out $19 a month or $99 a month for features like enhanced security and faster code reviews. Revenue in the second quarter jumped 69% from a year earlier to $58.1 million yet the company's net loss widened in the period to $40.2 million from $9.4 million. Sales and marketing costs amounted to three-quarters of revenue in the second quarter. Cumulative losses for the past four quarters exceeded $200 million. Prior to the IPO GitLab had just $276.3 million of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. Unlike GitHub which now operates within the cozy confines of cash-rich Microsoft GitLab needs outside financing to maintain its growth. New Constructs a research firm that takes a particularly skeptical view on tech IPO valuations wrote in a report this week that GitLab should be valued as low as $770 million or 95% below its current price. ""As a cash generating machine Microsoft can easily afford to offer GitHub services at or below cost in an effort to gain market share and bring users into the Microsoft platform"" the firm wrote. ""GitLab's dependence on one revenue stream subscriptions and licenses to its DevOps platform is a major competitive disadvantage as it attempts to compete with profitable companies that have many other revenue streams to support loss-leaders."" GitLab acknowledges in its prospectus that ""our principal competitor is Microsoft Corporation following their acquisition of GitHub."" Sijbrandij certainly isn't expressing concern now that his company has hundreds of millions in additional capital to fuel expansion and for the first time a liquid stock that can be used to acquire smaller businesses.

He touts the benefit of GitLab's full DevOps platform and the ability for developers to use it as their central repository throughout a project. ""We've been able to build something that lets you do everything from planning what you're going to make making it deploying it all the way to monitoring it"" Sijbrandij said. He says the contrast with GitLab isn't all that different than it was six years ago when he was just coming out of Y Combinator. GitHub hosts a lot of open-source projects but the products its ships are closed and proprietary Sijbrandij said while GitLab uses a so-called open-core model commercializing software that's open source. Hearkening back to GitLab's early funding rounds Sijbrandij wouldn't specifically confirm that his intention was to grab some of the spotlight during GitHub's developer conferences. But he didn't deny it either. ""When you start off as a company"" he said ""it's really important you find a way to be part of the news cycle.""

The case of the Surface Go has not been changed and still convinces with the high-quality workmanship. The magnesium casing is very sturdy and the various optional keyboard covers allow for a certain degree of customization. The red Alcantara cover of our review sample costs another 129 Euros (~$150). However we still like the illuminated keyboard. Of course the keys are relatively small due to the compact device but the typing feel is crisp and precise.

Besides the USB-C connector which can also be used for charging Microsoft still relies on its own Surface Connector which is often a bit annoying in practice due to its orientation (cable either sticks upwards or hangs around the keyboard). The WLAN performance is very good and there is still a microSD card reader.

In terms of webcams the Surface Go 3 has clear advantages over most notebooks because the image quality of the two built-in sensors (5 MP and 8 MP) is simply visibly better. A new feature is the additional IR camera which now also supports facial recognition with Windows Hello. An LTE module is also available for business customers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHRvcG1hZy5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9taWNyb3NvZnQtc3VyZmFjZS1wcm8tONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Surface Pro 8 review,"Why you can trust Laptop Mag Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you.

Microsoft’s Surface Pro has been a driving force in the 2-in-1 laptop market for years and the Surface Pro 8 represents an evolutionary change for the beloved laptop/tablet hybrid.

Without departing drastically from its iconic look the Pro 8 makes subtle improvements to the Surface Pro as a tablet and a laptop. Upgrades include a larger display and more comfortable to use design along with a much-needed internal upgrade.

Microsoft Surface Pro 8 Price: $1099 (starting); $1879 (as tested)

CPU: Intel Core i7-1185G7

GPU: Intel Iris Xe

RAM: 16GB

Storage: 256GB SSD

Display: 13-inch 120Hz (2880x1920)

Battery: 9:07

Size: 11.3 x 8.2 x 0.37 inches

Weight: 1.96 pounds

That includes an 11th Gen Intel Core i7-1185G7 processor and up to 32GB of RAM components that bring some of the new features of Windows 11 to bear. These upgrades come at a tangible cost with a starting price of $1099 without the Type Cover or new Slim Pen 2.

The Surface Pro 8 certainly earns a spot among the current best 2-in-1 laptops  but read on to see whether the new hardware justifies the added cost for you.

Microsoft Surface Pro 8 price and configuration options

The Microsoft Surface Pro 8 starts at $1099; that model includes an 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor 8GB of RAM a 128GB SSD and the new 13-inch PixelSense (2880 x 1920) at 120Hz display.

As always with the Surface Pro if you want the whole laptop experience you need to spring for the keyboard as well which is another $179 bringing that price up to $1280. Microsoft’s new Slim Pen 2 is also available in a bundle with the keyboard for $279 meaning the entire Surface Pro 8 experience starts at $1380.

My review unit is a mid-tier option at $1599 with an upgraded Intel Core i7-1185G7 processor 16GB of RAM a 256GB SSD and the same PixelSense display. My review unit is a dark Graphite color which is only available on some configurations; the base model and the higher-end options only come in the traditional Surface Pro Platinum finish.

The Surface Pro 8 tops out at $2599 for the Intel Core i7-1185G7 processor 32GB of RAM a 1TB SSD and the PixelSense display. Again tack on an extra $179 or $279 if you want the keyboard or keyboard and Slim Pen 2 combo.

Considering the Surface Pro 7 started at $749 there will be sticker shock for some Surface Pro fans. With that said this is the first significant redesign of the Surface Pro since the Surface Pro 3 so read on to see if Microsoft earned the price bump.

Microsoft Surface Pro 8 design

That larger screen necessitates a larger laptop but not in all directions as Microsoft has blessedly slimmed down the bezels on the Pro 8. At 11.3 x 8.2 x 0.37 inches and 1.96 pounds it is slightly narrower but taller and thicker than the Surface Pro 7 (11.5 x 7.9 x 0.33 1.74 pounds). The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 (11.6 x 7.8 x 0.6 inches 2.9 pounds) comes in quite a bit thicker and heavier due to its built-in keyboard while the slim Lenovo ThinkPad X12 Detachable at (11.2 x 0.8 x .03 inches 1.7 pounds) is the most portable of the pack.

The re-sculpted rounded edges of the Pro 8 make it a more comfortable tablet than its predecessors. The anodized aluminum finish looks like a prop from The Batman in Graphite offering a slightly different spin on the now all-to-common silver aluminum laptop. The mirrored Microsoft logo centered on the stand in the back gives some added interest to the otherwise stark look.

For those who took a look at the Surface Laptop Studio  the Surface Pro 8 picks up some of the DNA from that laptop with a minimal exhaust system wrapping the top and roughly one-third of the way down the sides. I’m sure this is a thermal benefit but again I like the little details that help give it a bit more of a personality. The tablet portion of the laptop is light on buttons with just a volume rocker on the left and the power button on the right.

The kickstand is rightly untouched as a technical marvel that doesn’t need any updates yet. However when you pop open the kickstand you will now find a user-replaceable SSD like what we first saw on the Surface Pro 7+ . Whether motivated by a hard drive failure or simply a desire for more space on your laptop it is fantastic to see a laptop this thin and light offer such a simple SSD upgrade procedure.

Microsoft Surface Pro 8 ports

The Surface Pro 8 goes all-in on Thunderbolt 4 ports with a pair on its right side. The Surface Connect port Microsoft’s excellent magnetic charging port is directly below them.

On the left side of the Surface Pro 8 you have a 3.5mm headphone jack and on the bottom is a Surface Type Cover port.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag/Sean Riley)

The loss of the USB Type-A port and to a lesser degree the microSD card slot may be disappointing to some but at this stage Thunderbolt 4 is the most future-proofed option and getting a pair of them rather than just one is icing on the cake.

Regardless of what else you might need to connect to your Surface Pro 8 a USB Type-C hub can handle it via those Thunderbolt 4 ports.

Microsoft Surface Pro 8 display

Microsoft’s PixelSense displays in the Surface Pro lineup have been excellent for years and the Pro 8 doesn’t break that chain. The new 13-inch (2880 x 1920-pixel) display is brighter and more vivid than the Surface Pro 7's. and if you haven’t used a 3:2 aspect ratio laptop then you've been missing out.

While it is not ideal for watching videos 3:2 is the superior option for any kind of productivity work. If your eyes can handle it at this resolution then you can fit an incredible amount of content on screen.

If you need to stay portable but get stuff done it would be hard to beat the Surface Pro 8 from a display standpoint. The biggest knock against it in the past was its large bezels. While this updated model isn’t challenging the micro bezels of the Dell XPS 13 the Pro 8 has found a comfortable balance for a device that is after all a tablet.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag/Sean Riley)

Watching the latest trailer for Matrix Resurrections the Surface Pro 8 display handles the wildly varied environments effectively from the dormant fields of battery pods in the dark apocalyptic real world to the eye-searingly bright and colorful battle environments of the training program fight sequence. While the display is quite good it isn’t built for content consumption and won’t hold up to the best in the category in that regard.

Our colorimeter backed this up with the Surface Pro 8 panel hitting 72% of the DCI-P3 color gamut . That is just a hair above the XPS 13 2-in-1 (70%) but behind the ThinkPad X12 Detachable (75%) and the premium laptop average (85%).

Brightness put the ball back in the Surface Pro 8’s court with a peak of 453 nits. The XPS 2-in-1 managed to slightly outclass it at 488 nits but the X12 Detachable (376 nits) and premium laptop average (394 nits) were well behind.

Microsoft Surface Pro 8 keyboard and touchpad

While it now offers a cozy home for the Slim Pen 2 at the top of the keyboard the Microsoft Type Cover is otherwise unchanged. To be clear that is as it should be. While it still isn’t as lap-friendly as a traditional clamshell laptop on a desk the Surface Pro 8 with the Type Cover is up there with the best of them as a productivity tool.

The Alcantara fabric surface gives a slightly plush feel to the typing surface a welcome reprieve from the typical metallic or plastic palm wrest. The key spacing is fantastic as well helped along this year by the slight increase to the overall size of the Surface Pro 8.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag/Sean Riley)

Testing my typing speed I averaged 88 words per minute with 97% accuracy on the 10fastfingers.com typing test slightly faster than my 86 wpm average. There are limits to what can be achieved in this form factor but it is as good as anything I’ve used in terms of allowing for speed and accuracy.

The 4 x 2.3-inch surface of the touchpad on the Microsoft Surface Pro 8 is slightly taller than it has been in the past and large enough for Windows 10 gestures . At my desk I always stick to my mouse anyway but when I’m on the go I do find myself frequently reaching up and using the touch display rather than the touchpad.

Microsoft Surface Pro 8 audio

The Surface Pro 8’s 2W stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos are one of those design feats that have me wondering what many traditional clamshell laptop manufacturers are doing. It simply obliterates them. Regardless of the engineering wizardry involved the speakers in the Pro 8 had no difficulty filling my 18 x 12-foot listening space and even at full volume remained crisp and clear.

I listened to “Night And Day” by Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga and the peppy vocals and big band behind them weren’t as rich as you would get with a good pair of wireless headphones  but it wasn’t far off either. I’d happily use this for my background music while working in my home office or watching Netflix or YouTube.

When it comes to audio input the Surface Pro 8 has you covered as well with dual far-field studio mics.

Microsoft Surface Pro 8 performance

As I covered in the design section the Surface Pro 8 bulked up a little and performance is one area where we see some of that extra muscle. The Intel Core i7-1185G7 processor with 16GB of RAM and a 256TB SSD gives this 2-in-1 a surprising amount of power behind its punch.

With apologies to Edge I still turn to Google Chrome for my primary browser in testing. I loaded up two dozen tabs in Chrome including three YouTube videos running at 1080p and two Twitch streams. Not only did it handle all of this with ease but I never once heard a fan spin up.

While my freehand artistic skills are slimmer than the Slim Pen 2 I do enjoy photography and videography so I put the Surface Pro 8 through its paces in Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro. Obviously there are more robust video and photo editing laptops that will churn through projects much faster but I was pleasantly surprised by the responsiveness of both apps on the Surface Pro 8.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag/Sean Riley)

The results of our benchmarking proved similar. The Surface Pro 8 managed a Geekbench 5.4 overall performance score of 5347. That’s not enough to outclass the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 (5571 Core i7-1165G7) but it blew past the ThinkPad X12 Detachable (4778) the Surface Pro 7+ (4825 Core i5-1135G7) and the category average (4212).

Our Handbrake video transcoding test requires the laptop to convert a 4K video to 1080p resolution and here the Surface Pro 8 shone at 13 minutes and 30 seconds. That’s almost two and a half minutes faster than the XPS 13 2-in-1 (15:52) and close to 10 minutes faster than its more tablet-like counterpart the X12 Detachable (22:54).

The Microsoft Surface Pro 8’s 256GB SSD didn’t hold up quite as well. It completed our 25GB file transfer test with a 415 megabyte per second transfer rate. That was behind the XPS 13 2-in-1 (503 MBps) and the category average (604 MBps) but enough to eclipse the X12 Detachable (408 MBps).

Microsoft Surface Pro 8 battery life

The battery life on the Microsoft Surface Pro 8 manages to neither impress nor bitterly disappoint. It called it quits at 9 hours and 7 minutes in our battery test which involves continuous web surfing over Wi-Fi at 150 nits of brightness. That's not terrible considering the form factor the display and performance but it’s not going to take home any awards either.

That battery test was conducted with the display at its default 60Hz; crank it up to its full 120Hz refresh rate and we would expect it to drop by roughly an hour. While the smoother refresh rate is nice this probably won’t be worth it for most users.

That score is a solid step up from the Surface Pro 7 (7:30) but doesn’t hold up as well against more modern competition like the Lenovo ThinkPad X12 Detachable (11:06) and the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 (10:52). Particularly for users who push their systems harder that extra two hours in our test could mean the difference between getting through a full day on a charge or being forced to track down an outlet.

While it isn’t entirely responsible this is to some degree the price you pay for that higher resolution (2880 x 1920) PixelSense display which is naturally much more power-hungry than the FHD+ (1920 x 1200/1280) displays of its competitors.

Microsoft Surface Pro 8 webcam

The 5MP 1080p webcam in the Surface Pro 8 is still among the best in any laptop or tablet that I’ve tested. If you are regularly video conferencing or video chatting from home an external webcam still has an edge for their flexibility but the results from the Surface Pro 8 are on par with all but the very best of them.

Windows Hello integration is fantastic as well reliably keeping the Surface Pro 8 secure then instantly logging me in when I power it on without needing to touch a thing. Every laptop should have facial recognition.

The Surface Pro 8 also features a 10MP autofocus camera on the back with either 1080P or 4K video capture available. I wouldn’t set out to make a film with the Surface Pro 8 as my camera but it is perfect if you're flipping the video around during a video conference to show or demo something.

Microsoft Surface Pro 8 software and warranty

For better and for worse the Microsoft Surface Pro 8 ships with Windows 11 . Read our full review for a more in-depth look at what to expect from Microsoft’s updated operating system. There are a few genuinely nice touches for the Surface Pro 8 just don’t set your hopes too high.

On the plus side while we might be able to quibble about whether you consider some of Microsoft’s apps to be bloatware there is no sign of any other random apps or games stealing your precious SSD space and that’s always a joy to see.

The Surface Pro 8 comes with a one-year limited warranty. You can see how Microsoft generally fares on this front in our Tech Support Showdown and Best and Worst Brands special reports.

Bottom line

The Microsoft Surface Pro 8 isn’t a quantum leap forward from its predecessors. Still it makes enough crucial upgrades to an already excellent 2-in-1 tablet to once again put it among the top 2-in-1 laptops.

The added screen size and reduced bezels make for a more modern look while the rounded edges give it a much more tablet-friendly feel backed up by some of the new software touches in Windows 11. For creatives or prolific note-takers the new Slim Pen 2 combined with the Type Cover gives you a built-in stylus with a tactile feel that makes for an improved inking experience.

A bit more battery life would have been outstanding and the price jump may be hard for some to swallow. However taken as a whole the Surface Pro 8 is a solid addition to the Surface lineup and a compelling option for those looking to upgrade their laptop for the move to Windows 11.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2dvb2dsZS1mb3JjZWQtbWUtdG8tdHJ5LWJpbmctdGhlbi1taWNyb3NvZnQtc3BvaWxlZC1pdC1hbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google forced me to try Bing (then Microsoft spoiled it all),"Pretty isn't it? Screenshot by ZDNet

Occasionally you just have to admit why you did something you never thought you'd do.

Here then is what happened.

I happened upon the tale of Google telling a European court something it thought was embarrassing.

Embarrassing for Microsoft that is.

Google's lawyer Alfonso Lamadrid told the court: ""We have submitted evidence showing that the most common search query on Bing is by far 'Google'"" He added: ""People use Google because they choose to not because they are forced to.""

""Oh ho ho"" I snorted to myself. ""Well how archly arrogant of Google.""

This was closely followed by: ""Bing? Bing? I wonder what Bing's like these days.""

Google is of course a verb and a habit. You go there because you go there because that's what you do because that's what everyone does.

Whereas Bing incites the thought: ""I can't even remember the last time I looked at Bing.""

I had to look it up. You can do that when you write columns. It was January 2020 when I asked both Google and Bing whether Google was better than Bing. (Answer: Shruggy-shouldered emoji.)

So when Google's lawyer came over all haughty-taughty I thought I'd take another look at Microsoft's search engine.

And what a peculiar sight. Or site.

Where Google's home page is pale tending toward Ted Williams here was an enticing explosion of color. This was actually moving. This was welcoming. This made me want to search for things.

But first though it made me utter a deeply felt sound that was somewhere between a hiccup and an expectoration.

For there on the page was an instruction from Microsoft: ""Switch to the latest browser recommended by Microsoft.""

Regular readers will know that Microsoft's constant nagging to download its every product suffocates. It's like going out with someone on just one date and they keep texting you to wonder if you should move in together.

It's even worse when you've already downloaded the particular Microsoft product and like it yet the company keeps nagging you to download it.

Oh do stop. Screenshot by ZDNet

What was curious though about the latest Binged nag was that it had the Edge logo but didn't mention the name. Could it be that some users might think Microsoft was recommending Firefox?

In any case can you just give it a rest Microsoft? Can you let me decide whether I even like Bing before you start to pester me with more of your desperate entreaties? (I know the answer is no but I can still ask surely.)

Still I quickly filled in the search box and discovered that the results were in large part much more recent that I'd previously associated with Bing. In some cases they were more recent than a simultaneous comparable search on Google.

In some cases Google was appreciably badder than Bing. (Oh come on. I had to.)

I drifted away heartened by Bing's look yet annoyed by Microsoft's pestering.

A few days later I went back to Bing. Again the attractive home page welcome. As well as a peculiar display of stories with headlines such as ""Clipboard hits fan"" ""Files defamation suit"" and ""Alaska's fattest bear.""

Is this what Microsoft thinks moves me? Silly sports stories lawsuits and fat animals? It seems so.

Naturally I clicked on the fattest bear story. Naturally Microsoft began to annoy me again. This was so so petty. But once I'd looked at the search results for Alaska's fattest bear the back button didn't work.

It was clear Microsoft wanted me to search some more instead of going back to the home page to look at the gorgeous scenery. This was so utterly pointless and something Google doesn't do.

I got back to the pretty home page by clicking on the Bing logo. I scrolled down some more and it really was quite absorbing. For example stories from that particular day in history. Not one included a fat animal though one was about a blackballed billy goat that cursed the Chicago Cubs in 1945. It could have been a large goat I suppose.

Yet scroll to the bottom and what do you find? Another nag: ""Make Bing your homepage."" This was accompanied by the tender words: ""Experience beauty every day.""

I want to do that. I do. This is my goal in life. But not in this context: ""Never miss a moment and keep search at your fingertips. Just set Bing as your browser's homepage with a few easy steps!""

Please Bing let me like you first. Please let's go on a third date. Then a fourth.

One day I might fall in love with you.

One day."

Following weeks of speculation the United States confirmed late Friday it will accept mixed vaccines when new rules kick in on Nov. 8 requiring that foreign travellers entering the U.S. be fully vaccinated.

Individuals inoculated with any combination of two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine authorized by U.S. regulators or the World Health Organization will be considered fully vaccinated the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told CBC News.

WHO-approved vaccines include Moderna Pfizer AstraZeneca and its Indian-made counterpart Covishield. So travellers with any combination of these vaccines will be allowed to enter the U.S.

The CDC does not recognize mixing COVID-19 vaccines but said it updated its guidance to reflect growing global acceptance of the practice.

""While CDC has not recommended mixing types of vaccine in a primary series we recognize that this is increasingly common in other countries so should be accepted for the interpretation of vaccine records"" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in an email.

Ingrid and John Whyte of Toronto are set to fly to Florida to spend the winter at a condo they own in Naples Fla. The snowbirds are relieved to hear the U.S. will accept their mixed vaccines. (Submitted by Ingrid Whyte)

Millions of Canadians have mixed doses of COVID-19 vaccines. When the U.S. recently announced it would impose a vaccination requirement for travellers entering by both land and air many Canadians with mixed doses worried they might soon be barred from entering the country.

""We felt kind of blindsided"" said snowbird Ingrid Whyte of Toronto. Following Canadian government guidance she and her husband John each got one dose of Covishield and a second dose of Pfizer.

'We did all the things we were supposed to do in terms of vaccinations"" Whyte said.

The couple had booked a flight to Florida for Nov. 17 but cancelled it due to concerns over their mixed vaccines. They're now relieved to hear their vaccine combination won't be an issue when entering the U.S.

""We are thrilled"" Whyte said. ""I wish it could have been a little sooner. It would have allowed people to plan a little bit more effectively. But in the long run it's great news.""

It's also good news for Petar Sesar of London Ont. who has a mix of Moderna and Pfizer.

Petar Sesar of London Ont. was relieved to learn his vaccine mix of Moderna and Pfizer won't bar him from entering the U.S. to visit his fiancée Mara Bakula who lives in Cleveland. (Submitted by Petar Sesar)

Sesar's fiancée Mara Bakula lives in Cleveland. Sesar welcomed news this week that the U.S. land border will reopen on Nov. 8 to non-essential travellers as he prefers to drive instead of fly to Cleveland.

However he worried he might soon have no way of getting to the U.S. if the country rejected his vaccine mix.

""That was a very scary moment"" he said. ""It felt like house arrest of sorts like now I [may] have no option.""

Earlier this year the CDC stated online that a mix of two mNRA vaccines Moderna and Pfizer would be accepted in ""exceptional situations."" But Sesar didn't rest easy until he learned that the CDC had approved his exact combination.

""It is unbelievable"" he said. ""It is such a relief. I share the relief with millions of [Canadians].""

What are the other rules for entering the U.S.?

When the new U.S. travel rules kick in on Nov. 8 travellers will still be on the hook for one or more COVID-19 tests.

Along with showing proof of vaccination air passengers will still have to show proof of a negative antigen or molecular test taken within three days of boarding their flight to the U.S.

Canadians entering by land won't have to take a COVID-19 test. However when returning to Canada all non-essential land and air travellers must show proof of a negative molecular test.

WATCH | U.S. will accept Canadians with mixed vaccines: U.S. will now accept Canadian travellers with mixed COVID-19 vaccine doses Duration 2:09 The United States has confirmed that Canadians that had different COVID-19 vaccines for their first and second dose will be recognized as fully vaccinated. The U.S. will be implementing travel restrictions on Nov. 8 only permitting fully vaccinated travellers into the country.

That return test has caused consternation for Canadian daytrippers to the U.S. No matter how short their trip they will be on the hook for a molecular test such as a PCR test that often ranges from $150 to $300 US and can take 24 hours before results are available.

To eliminate the wait for test results the federal government says Canadians can take their test in Canada travel to the U.S. and then use that test to return as long as it's less than 72 hours old.

But that solution doesn't eliminate the high cost of the test.

At a news conference on Friday Ottawa said that according to the latest data less than one per cent of fully vaccinated travellers tested positive after being randomly selected to take a COVID-19 test upon arrival. Even so Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said Canada's pre-arrival test requirement will remain for now for both unvaccinated and vaccinated travellers.

""We're still at the top of that fourth wave. We're in a situation in Canada where our health systems are still very fragile"" she said. ""We need to take a precautionary approach in the next little while and we'll continue to evaluate the situation.""

The U.S. has yet to say how it will deal with child travellers too young to get vaccinated. The CDC told CBC News it's working to establish an age requirement for its vaccine mandate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3N0Z3VhbS5jb20vdGhlX2dsb2JlL25hdGlvbi9mZGEtcGFuZWwtcmVjb21tZW5kcy1tb2Rlcm5hLWJvb3N0ZXItZm9yLXBlb3BsZS02NS1hbmQtb2xkZXItYW5kLWFkdWx0cy1hdC1oaWdoLXJpc2svYXJ0aWNsZV8xZGE4NTgwYS0yZDdiLTExZWMtYmQzMi1hNzBmYjI3N2M3NTguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FDA panel recommends Moderna booster for people 65 and older and adults at high risk of exposure or severe illness,VACCINE: The Moderna vaccine is one of the vaccines available at the University of Guam Vaccination Clinic on Sept. 29 at the University of Guam Calvo Field House in Mangilao.

Ford Motor Company

Well before the pandemic automakers like Ford Motor Company faced massive disruption from self-driving cars electric vehicles and shared mobility. But COVID-19 dealt the industry another blow forcing dealerships to close their lots and sell cars online  and causing supply chain shortages that slowed vehicle production. In 2020 alone U.S. auto sales sank by 15% .

While years of disruptions led Ford to begin its business transformation those efforts took on new urgency under the leadership of CEO Jim Farley and global CMO Suzy Deering. Both executives believed that providing new differentiated customer experiences would be a key to long-term resilience. Getting — and staying — ahead of auto consumers’ evolving needs required putting technology at the center of Ford’s business.

As Farley recently explained “The biggest transformation for us is to a software services–dominated company and brand. We have to invest in electric architectures and build software know-how in the company. And we need to integrate that know-how in ways we’ve never had to before.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Credit Suisse suffered losses of close to US$5.5 billion from the default of Archegos Capital Management. In the latest in a series of articles Bob Currie reports on the role played by a lack of effective risk technology and failure to learn lessons from past defaults

The market value of Archegos Capital Management’s investment holdings fell sharply during the week of 22 March 2021 driven by a slide in the price of a number of single-name tech stocks particularly ViacomCBS in which Archegos had a large and heavily leveraged position. This triggered a chain reaction that resulted ultimately in the hedge fund’s default.



A 170-page report by a Credit Suisse Group special committee makes detailed and critical observations about the engagements of the investment bank and specifically its prime services division with Archegos in the lead up to the fund’s closure.



The report analysed in a series of articles in Securities Finance Times presents the findings of a Credit Suisse Group Special Committee on behalf of its board of directors into the circumstances that led to the Archegos’s collapse and the large financial losses and reputational damage sustained by the investment bank (subsequently referred to as the ‘Special Committee report’).



This event resulted in combined losses of more than US$10 billion for the prime services divisions of global investment banks including Credit Suisse (CS) Morgan Stanley Nomura and UBS.



Learning lessons



Among the major conclusions to emerge from this report covered in the first part of this article published in SFT Issue 284 on 17 August 2021 the investigation found that CS had failed to learn from past risk situations.



For example in March 2020 CS sustained a US$214 million loss following the default of Malachite Capital Management another hedge fund which was a client of CS’ equity derivatives business. Like Archegos Malachite’s transactions were statically margined (for further discussion see SFT Issue 284). Both buy-side firms had losses substantially exceeding their potential exposure (PE) and stress scenario limits.



Although circumstances leading to the Malachite default in March 2020 differed in significant ways from those that precipitated Archegos’s collapse there were also commonalities (see box opposite). Some remedial action had been implemented after Malachite but other fundamental issues that CS had failed to tackle also re-emerged with Archegos.At the heart of this failure the Special Committee finds that “CS failed to address a culture that encouraged excessive risk-taking and injudicious cost cutting as well as a complex and siloed organisational structure that impeded the swift identification understanding and escalation of risk” (p 30).



This culture prevailed even though Malachite apparently generated relatively modest revenue — US$6.9 million over the term of the relationship — relative to the risk borne by CS (p 15). The Special Committee drew a similar conclusion with regard to the Archegos default 12 months later.



Following the investigation led by its Internal Audit team CS took steps to ensure that its equity derivatives division did not service other clients with profiles similar to Malachite. This process also triggered a programme known internally as Project Copper intended to improve the bank’s ability to identify early warning of a default event and to reinforce controls and escalation procedures with a primary focus on OTC derivatives transactions.



Among other changes Project Copper created a new committee the Investment Bank (IB) Counterparty Oversight Committee (CPOC) co-chaired by the IB chief risk officer and its chief operating officer along with senior IB executives including the global head of equities.



At the instruction of the CRM team (see box below) Archegos was one of a small number of counterparties that were discussed at the initial CPOC meeting held in September 2020. Significantly neither of the co-heads of the prime services division — the division within CS containing prime brokerage and prime financing sub-units which had the largest exposure to Archegos — were CPOC members and neither was asked to attend the meeting.



The committee report notes that in practice CPOC did not discuss Archegos again for a further six months not until 8 March 2021 and by this time the client’s risk exposure had surged dramatically (for a more detailed analysis see SFT 284).



In the meantime during the autumn of 2020 Archegos’s swap business was migrated from one UK-based CS entity Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd (CSSEL) to another Credit Suisse International (CSi) with the transfer completing in December 2020. This the report notes was partly an attempt to wind down CSSEL. However in so doing it also transferred the client’s activity to an entity (CSi) that had a “higher stress scenario appetite” — a tolerance for larger risk exposure to the hedge fund counterparty (p 17).



The CRM reportedly backed a case for an accommodative approach indicating that Archegos was a “significant relationship” for the prime services division and given that Archegos was also doing business with other prime brokers across the Street a sudden margin increase could potentially result in “irreversible damage to the client relationship” (ibid).



Mixed messages



Following an annual credit review of Archegos at the end of 2020 CRM took the decision to downgrade Archegos’s credit rating from BB- to B+ thereby placing the hedge fund in the bottom third of CS’ hedge fund counterparties by credit rating (p 18).



But even while downgrading Archegos’s credit rating CRM recommended raising Archegos’s potential exposure limit from US$20 million to US$50 million — advice that was a departure from the bank’s standard position that a B+ rated hedge fund should typically have maximum PE of no more than US$10 million.



In February 2021 the business began taking steps to move Archegos to dynamic margining. However internal calculations (provided by the software engineering team responsible for transitioning clients to dynamic margining platforms) estimated that under CS’s existing prime brokerage dynamic margining framework this would require the fund manager to post an additional US$3 billion in margin raising the total margin for its swaps portfolio to US$4 billion.



Fearing the impact this would have on the business relationship the head of Prime Services Risk (PSR) proposed applying a more forgiving dynamic margining framework for Archegos — one that would create an average margin of 16.3 per cent requiring the client to post an additional US$1.3 billion on implementation. A written proposal was sent to Archegos on 24 February but it was ignored by the hedge fund the report says despite repeated follow up from CS (p 20).



Archegos default



The value of Archegos’s concentrated positions dropped rapidly in the week of 22 March 2021 reversing the upwards momentum that these positions had experienced for several months leading up to its default. The price of its largest position ViacomCBS fell 6.7 per cent on 22 March and further in the days that followed. US$600 million in excess margin that the fund manager had with CS on 23 March was eliminated by these movements in the market and CS requested a further US$175 million in variation margin (VM) which Archegos paid (p 22).



With the valuation of another significant long position Tencent Music Entertainment Group falling 20 per cent on 24 March CS took a decision to issue a US$2.7 billion VM call the following day. Responding to this request Archegos’s COO told CS’ co-heads of prime services and its head of equities that evening that the buy-side firm did not have sufficient liquidity to meet margin calls the following day to CS or its other prime brokers.



In the course of 25 March CS’s legal department prepared Event of Default notifications setting into play CS’s contractual right to demand full return of all outstanding balances in case of a default including any failure to pay margin when it was required (p 125).



By the evening on the 25th March Archegos informed its prime brokers on a group call that although it had US$9 to $10 billion in equity it had US$120 billion in gross exposure (US$70 billion long US$50 billion short). It asked its prime brokers to enter into a standstill agreement whereby these PBs would not push Archegos into default while it took steps to wind down its positions. The hedge fund indicated that it was committed to making all PB and swap counterparties whole by liquidating assets to cover the shortfall owed to each dealer. However it said that it needed to liquidate assets carefully so as to “not tip the market”.



In the face of this request CS indicated that it remained firm in its commitment to issue a termination notice which it sent by email the same evening and by hand delivery on 26 March specifying 26 March as the termination date.



On the morning of 26 March CS was approached by Archegos and told that Goldman Sachs was executing block sales of some ADR positions and invited CS to be involved. CS subsequently participated in three Goldman Sachs-led block trades selling stock in Baidu Tencent and Vipshop Holdings (p 127).



Alongside this CS indicates it executed algorithmic trading on that day designed to stay within 2-3 per cent of average daily volume. It ultimately sold slightly more than US$3 billion notional on 26 March approximately US$1.25 billion being sold through Goldman Sachs block sales.



Archegos and its PBs held another call on 27 March including CS Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs Nomura UBS Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank. The fund manager again asked for a forbearance agreement.



Without Archegos in attendance these PBs discussed the potential for a managed liquidation where PBs would send positions for review to an independent counsel or other trusted third party and lenders would be offered a percentage range within which they would be allowed to liquidate their overlapping positions.



CS Nomura and UBS indicated their interest in moving ahead with this managed liquidation. Several other banks including Deutsche Bank Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to be involved (p 128).



The Special Committee report indicates that on 28 March CS stepped into a managed liquidation agreement with UBS and Nomura. Following this agreement CS liquidated approximately US$3 billion through block sales of overlapping positions on 5 April and US$2.2 billion on 14 April 2021. It liquidated other Archegos positions through open-market algo trading — and by 22 April 2021 it had liquidated 97 per cent of its Archegos exposure (p 128).



CS indicates in line with its public reporting that it lost US$5.5 billion as a direct outcome of the Archegos default and the subsequent unwind. Drawing on public information it indicates that Nomura lost close to US$2.5 billion Morgan Stanley approximately US$1 billion and UBS lost US$774 million.



Deutsche Bank Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo are reported to have suffered “immaterial losses” (p 129)



Plain sight



As reported in the preceding section of this article Credit Suisse’s internal investigation into the Archegos failure arrived at the following damning conclusion: “no one at CS — not the traders not the in-business risk managers not the senior business executives not the credit risk analysts and not the senior risk officers — appeared to fully appreciate the serious risks that Archegos’s portfolio posed to CS (p 129).



These risks it notes were not hidden. They were in plain sight from at least September 2020 when CPOC first met and CS senior leaders discussed Archegos’s concentrated long-biased volatile equity swap positions. “Yet no one at the bank acted swiftly and decisively to try to mitigate the risks posed by Archegos. And when CS finally took steps to mitigate the risks the actions it took were ineffective too little and too late”.



It concludes that the business should never have put on such large concentrated positions with Archegos particularly without securing adequate margin. It indicates that the prime services business was aware that Archegos’s portfolio was highly concentrated and also that its portfolio holdings with CS were severely undermargined (p 131).



For example at a CPOC meeting on 8 March 2021 a representative from the bank’s client risk management (CRM) team indicated that Archegos was an outlier in the prime financing swap book with gross market value (GMV) exposures of US$20 billion when compared to the next largest client of US$5 billion. CRM also noted that Archegos had a net-long bias at this time of more than US$7 billion compared to the next-largest long-biased client at US$1.5 billion (p 20).



The CPOC also flagged up Archegos’s single issuer concentration including a US$3.3 billion position which represented more than 8 per cent of the outstanding free float. At this meeting CPOC discussed potential difficulties in liquidating Archegos’s portfolio should this become necessary given the size and concentration of these positions.



Additionally the business missed multiple opportunities to “right-size” Archegos risk. Prime services saw its relationship with the fund manager as “significant” contributing revenue of US$16 million in 2020 and this was expected to rise to US$40 million in 2021 on the basis of appreciation in Archegos’s positions. The business was intent on growing its relationship with the hedge fund recognising that it was competing for this business with multiple other prime brokers (p 133). Consequently the business pushed for an “accommodative approach” to risk refusing to take forceful steps and remaining reluctant to have difficult conversations with and about Archegos.



Risk employees failed to appreciate Archegos’s true risk despite a series of red flags says the Special Committee report. (p 138) CRM learned from Archegos that other prime brokers were charging higher margins and were dynamically margining Archegos’s swaps portfolio. CRM also had access to non-public information confirming that Archegos had concentrated exposure to the same single-name positions with other prime brokers as it held with Credit Suisse (p 27).



“This information — that Archegos maintained similar positions across the Street that CS was the only PB using static margining and that CS’s margin rates were lower than those of other PBs — should have sounded alarm bells” says the report (p 138).” The CRM employees that were privy to this information did not appear to appreciate its importance and failed to escalate the information to more senior risk or business managers.



A similar myopia applies to Archegos’s limit breaches. Rather than viewing the breaches as symptomatic of a much larger problem CRM and the prime services business were focused on eliminating the breaches without considering the larger significance.



Consequently the CRM did not insist that the business take immediate steps to reduce Archegos’s exposure — by having Archegos sell down its concentrated positions and reduce its portfolio — and instead resorted to “superficial fixes” such as raising Archegos’s PE limit from US$20 million to US$50 million and raising Archegos’s scenario limit from US$250 million to US$500 million (p 139).



Technology and data failures



The Special Committee finds that the prime services business did not prioritise investment in technology that would have assisted in managing risk more effectively. The PSR had identified a relatively inexpensive fix for bullet swaps that subject to the client’s consent would have automatically recalculated IM based on the current mark-to-market value of the portfolio. This fix would have cost approximately US$150000 — a relatively small investment given the size of Credit Suisse’s subsequent losses against its Archegos exposure — but the business did not prioritise or fund this (p 146).



It was also slow to adopt automated technology that would have enabled it to dynamically margin swaps. Despite the systems limitation the Special Committee says that dynamic margining could have been agreed with Archegos at any time and implemented manually — even though this would have been cumbersome and time consuming for CS to operate.



CS already had an automated means to margin swaps dynamically (through cross-margining with prime brokerage) when these were conducted in the same legal entity. However the systems for dynamically margining were inadequate within CS for clients such as Archegos whose swaps and PB accounts were held with different legal entities (see SFT Issue 284 for further discussion).



Notwithstanding by September 2020 CS had developed the capacity to dynamically margin swaps regardless of whether the client had a PB account or in which legal entity this account was held. However the Special Committee finds that Archegos was not on the list of clients that the business had prioritised for transition to dynamic margining despite the increasing risks presented by this client (p 147).



More generally the report finds that risk divisions had struggled with “fragmented ineffective technology” during the year leading up to the Archegos default along with data quality issues that impaired its ability to assess counterparty and portfolio credit risk in a timely manner. “These issues were well known but not sufficiently addressed before the Archegos default” says the report.



For example the systems employed by the CRM team only displayed a counterparty’s aggregate portfolio and not individual position data. This impeded CRM’s ability to see full details of the risks presented by a client. Further CRM only received verified data for scenario limit breaches on a monthly basis — although it could access “rough” scenario data twice per week. “This posed ‘undue risks’ given that Prime Services had a number of hedge fund clients with volatile positions that could change significantly intra-monthly” concludes the report (p 147-8).





In managing its relationships with buy-side clients CS indicates that it operates multiple lines of risk defence. The business unit in this case the prime services division provides the first layer of defence with each business employee directly responsible for protecting the bank against losses. Prime services maintains an in-house risk management unit named Prime Services Risk (PSR) that among other duties sets margin rates and manages other risk controls in dialogue with traders and clients.A bank-level risk division Credit Risk Management (CRM) provides a second line of defence responsible for evaluating credit risk across all of the investment bank’s business lines while acting independently of any individual business unit. This includes conducting annual counterparty risk reviews assigning an internal credit rating to the counterparty and setting counterparty trading limits for the prime services division and other business units.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm5pbmdicmV3LmNvbS9kYWlseS9pc3N1ZXMvbWFraW5nLWJhbmvSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Making bank,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/issues/making-bank on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm5pbmdicmV3LmNvbS9kYWlseS9pc3N1ZXMvbWFraW5nLWJhbmvSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd2VzdGNoZXN0ZXJtYWdhemluZS5jb20vbGlmZS1zdHlsZS90b3AtZG9jdG9ycy0yMDIxL9IBQmh0dHBzOi8vd2VzdGNoZXN0ZXJtYWdhemluZS5jb20vbGlmZS1zdHlsZS90b3AtZG9jdG9ycy0yMDIxLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Are the Top Doctors in Westchester County in 2021,"ADDICTION PSYCHIATRY

It’s true there’s some survivorship bias in this data. The winners write the history books.

It didn’t have to happen this way but the United States has swallowed up global stock markets Pac Man-style since the turn of the 20th century:

American corporations have dominated the rest of the world over the last decade and change as well:

But it’s not like other countries don’t have a good long-term track record.

MSCI has developed country stock market indexes that date back to 1970. Here are the annual returns of these indexes along with the S&P 500 through the end of September:

There are certainly some differences amongst country stock returns but no complete and utter disasters.

That’s not to say disasters haven’t occurred for stock market investors in the past. Of course they have.

The Russian government confiscated financial assets — both stocks and bonds — from its citizens in 1917. The stock market ceased to exist there for many decades. A similar confiscation of assets occurred in China in 1949.

But it’s hard to kill markets.

One of my favorite examples of this is what happened to Germany in the 20th century.

The country was the aggressor in two world wars experienced severe hyperinflation and suffered what should have been a death blow to its economy from the fallout of WWII.

The economy was wrecked but quickly grew out of the ashes:

The 1950s saw the German stock market compound at nearly 25% per year.

Even if we include that first half of the 20th century a period that saw a number of depressions and two world wars the really long-term performance of stock markets around the globe are still impressive.

These are the real annual returns for a number of countries from 1900-2020 courtesy of the Credit Suisse Yearbook:

Again some countries are better than others but it’s not like the United States is head and shoulders above every other region around the globe.

The United States has had an extraordinary run in the stock market for many decades. We’re home to some of the biggest and best companies in the world.

The U.S. does have some advantages over other countries. We have the biggest most diverse economy in the world. We have the biggest most liquid financial markets. The government generally leaves most corporations alone which is something you can’t say about every country.

But it’s not like we have a monopoly on good ideas innovation profits and progress. And most of our biggest and best companies sell their products or services around the globe.

It’s possible the U.S. stock market continues to dominate the rest of the globe for a time. Betting against the US of A has been a losing battle for a long time now.

I wouldn’t bet against the rest of the world either.

The SZSE is one of China’s three stock exchanges — along with Shanghai Stock Exchange and China Financial Futures Exchange — that hold a 40 percent stake in the PSX reported Arab News.

The PSX signed a $5 million contract with SZSE in November 2019 for the acquisition of Trading and Surveillance System to improve its operational and technological level. It was first scheduled to be implemented in March 2021.

“We expect to launch within the month of October. There were certain requirements that our stakeholders had requested to accommodate in the trading system which now have been implemented” PSX chief executive Farrukh H Khan told Arab News earlier this week.

The system is expected to make the PSX more transparent and attractive. “The system will vastly improve the capabilities of our trading and abilities to introduce new products like options” Khan said. “We’ll have a proper surveillance system and the robustness of the much better system.”

The bourse’s benchmark KSE 100 index dropped 25.61 percent in April 2020 and touched the year’s lowest 27228.80 level. The index recouped some of the losses in later months.

Pakistan’s bourse was declared Asia’s best stock market and the world’s fourth best performing market in 2020 by Market Currents a New York-based financial markets research firm.

However last month Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) downgraded PSX from its Emerging Market Index (EMI) to Frontier Markets Index (FMI) following a continuous drop in share prices of its listed companies.

In 2017 benchmark KSE 100 had peaked to 53000 points level with market capitalization of $100 billion. However market capitalization has dropped over the years to $45 billion including 17 percent decline in the last four months.

“This (downgrading) was mainly due to the size of the market capitalization which has declined” Khan said. “Rising oil prices which doubled in recent days Afghanistan’s situation interest rate hike and rupee remained under pressure and MSCI reclassification generally has created negative impacts in the equity market.”

“Pakistan’s stock market has given an average 19 percent return in dollar terms during the last 20 years” Khan concluded.",,,,,,,,,

These investment vehicles were popular in early 2021 but many have lost value in recent months. This includes 23andMe stock which currently sits almost 50% below its all-time high.

While no one knows where shares of the genetic-testing company will trade in the near term investors have a better idea of where 23andMe stock can trade over the long term. Over the course of years stock prices tend to correlate with cash flows and therefore if the company dramatically increases it cash flows the stock price could head higher as well. And in this video from Motley Fool Backstage Pass recorded on Oct. 5 Fool contributor Jason Hall explains to fellow contributor Jon Quast the one thing that could transform 23andMe's cash flows.

10 stocks we like better than 23andMe Holding Co.

See the 10 stocks

*Stock Advisor returns as of September 17 2021

Jason Hall: What is 23andMe? I think we've all seen their ads so we know somebody that done it or we've done it ourself which where you can get your own genetic profile. You can pay them 100 bucks 130 bucks different levels that they offer and they do your genetic screening. You send in the swab and they do the screening and they can also provide you with information about some specific genetic markers that indicate if you are at certain risk profiles for certain types of cancers and other health concerns. It's a really interesting thing that you can get right off the bat.

The other thing that they do and this is really important is about 80% of the customers also allow the company to use their data for research. This is enormously valuable data for the healthcare industry and in particular the pharmaceutical industry.

Here is a slide from the company's presentation. It talks a little bit about how there's potential value for the pharmaceutical industry. On average from the time the pharmaceutical companies develop a drug to actually filing an investigation of new drug application with the FDA it takes about seven years. The total costs by the time they finish going through all of their filings is between $2 billion and $3 billion and 90% failure rate: 90% never reach a successful outcome in terms of a drug that's commercially available.

Now what 23andMe says they have a deal right now partnership with GlaxoSmithKline. They are working on a drug and it took four years for this specific drug that they are working on to go through that same process that takes seven years on average for the pharmaceutical industry. That is a enormous shortening of the time and it should lead to a shortening of the cost. The other thing that highlighted on that slide was historically targets with genetic evidence have a higher success rate. Again so that 90% failure rate the idea is that number should fall substantially.

The biggest part of the thesis for 23andMe is their ability to use all of the data that we give them that we actually pay them to give them really because we're paying them 100 bucks a pop and we let them use the data is that the data should be able to be used to develop better medical treatments. That should be beneficial to all of society and it should be worth a tremendous amount of money to 23andMe. I think at the price that it's trading for now it's certainly worth a look.

I will share one more chart because this gets back to what Jon was talking about with Skillz earlier. You got to get into the numbers and understand because this is still a business. It's very much in growth mode. Revenues were just over $59 million in the one quarter that it's reported as a public company and it lost $42 million. So $42 million dollar net loss. And here's the thing this isn't like a lot of other companies that we cover that are in high growth mode that have big losses but then also have positive cash flows. The company had $44.5 million in negative cash flows in operations. It's spending an enormous amount of money to support its operations so those revenues need to grow. You see right here at the top $769.9 million that's how much cash it has on its balance sheet. That's a product of coming public through the SPAC process. It has a lot of cash that's going to cover a lot of quarters of cash burn. But you really need to focus on seeing revenue growth as its partnerships develop and it gets a larger share of income from potential future treatments.

Jon Quast: Yeah. That's really good. I meant to say that with Skillz $700 million in cash on the balance sheet versus a $3.9 billion market cap that's really interesting.

Hall: Yeah.

Quast: I'm super bullish on this trend that you're talking about Jason. This is big data in anything but specifically in medicine. I would imagine that that is actually going to be a high-margin business for 23andMe.

Hall: It should be because a substantial amount of the development costs like the GlaxoSmithKline one for example is a 50-50 partnership. GlaxoSmithKline is mostly taking on the development expense. It's the data that it's getting from its partnership. It could be enormously profitable. Even one blockbuster drug this could be worth half a billion dollars in cash flows a year to the company. It's enormous the potentials that it could be.

You Don't Have to Spend $57401 to Invest,"Bitcoin (BTC) is the world's largest -- and most expensive -- cryptocurrency. If you wanted to buy a whole Bitcoin at time of writing it would cost $57401 according to CoinMarketCap data. But you don't have to buy a whole coin. In fact you can invest in Bitcoin with less than a dollar.

If that comes as a surprise you're not alone. Almost 40% of Americans didn't know they could buy a part of a cryptocurrency according to a recent survey by digital payment company Bakkt. A further 12% didn't understand the question.

The good news is that every major cryptocurrency app and exchange will allow you to buy a fraction of a Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency it trades. But you need to watch out for any account minimums and factor in any fees you'll be charged.

Crypto minimum spend and minimum deposit requirements

Cryptocurrency exchanges make it easy to buy as much or as little crypto as you would like. You simply specify the dollar value of your trade and it will use current market prices to calculate the corresponding amount of crypto. For example on the Coinbase app I select Bitcoin enter the amount of money I want to spend and it tells me how much Bitcoin I will get.

However if you only want to invest a small amount you need to pay attention to the minimum spend and minimum deposit requirements on the crypto platform you plan to use.

Different platforms have different requirements. To give you an idea:

Coinbase has a minimum spend of $2 and the minimum deposit depends on how you transfer money.

Gemini's trading minimums depend on the individual crypto -- its minimum for Bitcoin is 0.00001 BTC (about $0.60) and it doesn't have a minimum deposit.

eToro has a minimum deposit of $50 and a minimum trade size of $25.

Watch out for fees when buying Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies

Another consideration if you're only buying a small amount of cryptocurrency is the fees. It doesn't make the most sense to buy $50 of Bitcoin only to lose $10 in exchange fees. Different exchanges have different fee structures -- but all of them make money in some way. Some charge when you deposit money into your account while others charge higher trading or withdrawal fees.

Check the following fees when deciding the best places to buy Bitcoin:

Deposit fees. Fees change depending on the way you plan to deposit money. Bank transfers are often free of charge while credit or debit card payments often come with a fee around 3%.

Fees change depending on the way you plan to deposit money. Bank transfers are often free of charge while credit or debit card payments often come with a fee around 3%. Trading fees. Some exchanges publish their trading fees while others give you a quote at time of trading. You may be able to get a discount by paying in the exchange's own token -- such as Binance's BNB.

Some exchanges publish their trading fees while others give you a quote at time of trading. You may be able to get a discount by paying in the exchange's own token -- such as Binance's BNB. Withdrawal fees. Make sure you are aware of any withdrawal fees before you make a deposit. You may need to pay a percentage of the withdrawal or a set fee that varies by crypto.

Don't judge cryptos by price alone

The fact you can buy a fraction of a Bitcoin means you don't need to turn to the low price cryptos if you want to invest. Indeed buying low price cryptocurrencies is much more risky than buying more established coins which have solid business plans and reputable teams.

Just because a coin is cheap does not make it a bargain. Some meme coins produce trillions of tokens all worth a fraction of a cent. The creators hope people will be tempted by the low price tag. But if those coins don't have any fundamental utility there's no guarantee the price will go up. Indeed there's a good chance the coin will fail altogether.

For example let's say I had $100 to invest in cryptocurrency.

Based on today's prices I could buy 0.00175 BTC. I would only own a fraction of a coin but if Bitcoin's price rose in value so would my investment.

Based on today's prices I could also become a FLOKI millionaire with 1368831 Floki Inu (FLOKI). This is one of the latest pet coins that sprung up after Elon Musk tweeted about his puppy (who's called Floki). I would own a lot of coins but there is a good chance I would lose all of my investment as the coin has no fundamental value.

Buying Bitcoin

If you're investing in cryptocurrencies for the first time buying a small amount of Bitcoin is an excellent way to start. Make sure you don't spend money you can't afford to lose as even Bitcoin is still a relatively untested investment and there are still many things we don't know about how the market will develop.

Buy and sell cryptocurrencies on an expert-picked exchange

There are hundreds of platforms around the world that are waiting to give you access to thousands of cryptocurrencies. And to find the one that's right for you you'll need to decide what features matter most to you.

Netflix paid $21.4 million for the nine-episode series which premiered four weeks ago and the company estimates “Squid Game” will deliver more than 40 times that — an estimated $891 million — in what it calls “impact value” Bloomberg reported Saturday evening citing confidential internal data that someone provided to the outlet. The proprietary metric is a measure of a title’s economic contribution to Netflix based on subscriber viewing.

Netflix declined to comment. According to Bloomberg’s report a lawyer for Netflix told the news outlet that it would be “inappropriate” for Bloomberg to publish the confidential data contained in the documents.

On Friday Netflix fired an employee who admitted they downloaded internal data and shared it outside the company which is a violation of the streaming giant’s policies. The info included financial data for “Squid Game” and Dave Chappelle’s stand-up special “The Closer” for which Netflix allegedly paid $24.1 million. The Chappelle special has become a lightning rod for critics upset about his homophobic and transphobic comments in “The Closer” and has led to a planned employee walkout on Oct. 20. The Netflix employee who leaked the data may have been motivated by a desire to tarnish the company’s image by revealing that it paid more for “The Closer” than “Squid Game” its new top-performing worldwide hit. The pink-slipped staffer was the only employee who had accessed data for the programming that was later cited by Bloomberg.

Popular on Variety

In the 23 days since the Sept. 17 debut of “Squid Game” 132 million Netflix households streamed at least two minutes of the show according to Bloomberg’s report. About 89% of those viewers watched at least 75 minutes (i.e. more than one episode) and 66% of them — or 87 million — finished the entire series within the first 23 days of its release. Overall Netflix users streamed more than 1.4 billion hours of “Squid Game” over that 23-day period. (Note that Netflix’s measurements aren’t verified by a third party.)

In “Squid Game” set in modern-day South Korea 456 desperately debt-stricken contestants compete in a deadly competition of mysterious origin pitting them against each other in a series of children’s games for the chance to win 45.6 billion won (about $38.5 million) in prize money.

“Squid Game” creator and director Hwang Dong-hyuk said he intended the series to highlight the growing wealth gap in the modern world. “I wanted to write a story that was an allegory or fable about modern capitalist society something that depicts an extreme competition somewhat like the extreme competition of life” he told Variety in an interview last month.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8xNi9tZWRpYS9uZXRmbGl4LWVtcGxveWVlLWZpcmVkLWRhdmlkLWNoYXBwZWxsZS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFPaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMS8xMC8xNi9tZWRpYS9uZXRmbGl4LWVtcGxveWVlLWZpcmVkLWRhdmlkLWNoYXBwZWxsZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix fired an employee who it says leaked information about Dave Chappelle's special,"New York CNN —

Netflix fired an employee for sharing “confidential commercially sensitive information” outside of the company about Dave Chappelle’s controversial stand-up special “The Closer” the company confirmed to CNN on Saturday.

The unidentified employee was an organizer of an upcoming walkout by the company’s trans employees according to a report by The Verge. Netflix claims the employee leaked the information to Bloomberg which published it in an article on October 13.

Laurie Burgess an attorney representing former Netflix employee B. Pagels-Minor denied that her client leaked the information to the press.

The Bloomberg report said that Netflix spent $24.1 million on the “The Closer” while “Squid Game” the company’s biggest debut hit cost the streaming giant $21.4 million.

Netflix said a review of its internal access logs showed that only one person viewed sensitive title data and that person downloaded and shared it externally.

“The Closer” has been criticized by advocacy groups such as GLAAD as being transphobic. The trans employee resource group at Netflix is planning a walkout on October 20 to protest both Chappelle’s special and statements in support of the comedian by Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos The Verge report said.

“We understand this employee may have been motivated by disappointment and hurt with Netflix but maintaining a culture of trust and transparency is core to our company” a Netflix spokesperson said.

Chappelle faced backlash for his special released in October in which he made comments on transgender people and called himself “team TERF” which stands for “trans-exclusionary radical feminist.”

“Gender is a fact. Every human being in this room every human being on earth had to pass through the legs of a woman to be on earth. That is a fact” Chappelle said in the special.

On Thursday Sarandos expressed continued support for Chappelle in a staff email obtained by Variety causing rifts within the company.

“With The Closer we understand that the concern is not about offensive-to-some content but titles which could increase real world harm (such as further marginalizing already marginalized groups hate violence etc.)” Sarandos wrote. “While some employees disagree we have a strong belief that content on screen doesn’t directly translate to real-world harm.”

Last week the company suspended Terra Field a senior software engineer who identifies as queer and trans who had publicly criticized “The Closer” on Twitter.

Field and two other employees were suspended for attending a virtual meeting of directors and vice presidents last week without notifying the meeting organizer in advance according to a source with knowledge of the matter. Field said on Twitter Tuesday that she has since been reinstated.

When reached by CNN earlier this week a spokesperson for Netflix said: “Our employees are encouraged to disagree openly and we support their right to do so.”

Chappelle also faced controversy in 2019 over a joke he made about Caitlyn Jenner and again in 2020 for his remarks about trans people in another Netflix special “Sticks and Stones.”

Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated as a matter of fact that the fired Netflix employee leaked information to the press. Their attorney denies Netflix's claim.

Netflix



""Squid Game"" fell to second place on Netflix on Saturday as the third season of Netflix's ""You"" took the top spot.

The Korean drama about strangers competing in deadly children's games became Netflix's most-watched show globally.

The show fell five days short of the record for longest show to stay at number one on Netflix in the US.

Much like the infamous Korean death match itself only one show can come out on top of Netflix's US Top 10 list.

While ""Squid Game"" remained number one on the list for weeks the hit Netflix television series fell to number two on Saturday after it was dethroned by the streaming platform's popular thriller series ""You"" fresh off its season 3 release.

The South Korean drama which centers on a group of strangers competing in twisted and deadly children's games for a large cash prize spent 24 days in the top spot for the streamer in the US. It fell short of the longest-reigning program on the streaming service ""Ginny & Georgia"" which stayed at the top spot for 29 days in the US earlier this year. ""Squid Game"" does however set the record for a non-English program in the coveted spot.

Netflix's ""You"" – which is now in its third season and centers on a murderous couple raising a newborn son in the suburbs – clinched the top spot after premiering on Friday.

""Squid Game"" became Netflix's most watched showafter it premiered in September drawing 111 million views. It snowballed into a global phenomenon spawning viral memes thousands of prank calls a candy craze pop-up stores and even talks of developing of a real-life game.

Though the show lost its number one spot in the US it remains at the top of Netflix's Top 10 in almost 50 countries including the UK France Russia and Hong Kong according to the most recently released numbers shared on Friday. However the show also lost its number one spot in its home country of South Korea falling to fellow Korean show ""Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha.""

""Squid Game"" still remains number one for the streaming service globally at 24 days behind the record set by Netflix's pandemic hit ""Queen's Gambit"" which earned the longest streak for number one worldwide earlier this year with a whopping 46 days.

The show's high performance indicates promise for the streamer's investment strategy which has involved leaning into international productions following the successes of shows like the Spanish series ""Money Heist (La Casa de Papel)"" and the French drama ""Lupin.""

Meanwhile a second season for ""Squid Game"" remains unconfirmed though fans are speculating about a follow-up to the series' first season."

In February 2020 National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) informed Indians about its intention to conclude the contract for Farzad-B development with an Iranian company. In May this year it awarded a USD 1.78 billion contract to Petropars group.

""The field was discovered by the Indian consortium and naturally it was interested in bringing it to production and submitted a development plan. But Iranian government decided to go ahead with the project without a foreign participation"" a government official with direct knowledge of the matter said.

This many believed was a set back for India. ""But all is not lost in the project. Contractually as the original licensee and someone who has discovered the field the Indian consortium has a right to take a 30 per cent interest in the project involving development of reserves and production of gas"" he said.

Expressing the Indian consortium's interest in the project OVL on July 29 2021 sought details of terms and conditions of the development contract. With NIOC not responding to this OVL has again written a couple of weeks back seeking details another official said.

""The contract is very strong and clear. The licensee in this case the Indian consortium at its election has the right to take a 30 per cent in the development project no matter who executes it"" the first official said.

OVL the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) holds a 40 per cent stake in the 3500 square kilometre Farsi offshore exploration block in the Persian Gulf Iran. Indian Oil Corp (IOC) holds 40 per cent stake and the remaining 20 per cent is with Oil India Ltd (OIL).

The Exploration Service Contract (ESC) for the Block was signed on December 25 2002 and OVL in 2008 made a giant discovery on the block which was later rechristened as Farzad-B.

The field holds 23 trillion cubic feet of in-place gas reserves of which about 60 per cent is recoverable. It also holds gas condensates of about 5000 barrels per billion cubic feet of gas.

The Indian consortium submitted a Master Development Plan (MDP) of Farzad-B gas field in April 2011 to Iranian Offshore Oil Company (IOOC) the then designated authority by NIOC for the development of Farzad-B gas field.

A Development Service Contract (DSC) of the Farzad-B gas field was negotiated till November 2012 but could not be finalized due to difficult terms and international sanctions on Iran.

In April 2015 negotiations restarted with Iranian authorities to develop the Farzad-B gas field under a new Iran Petroleum Contract (IPC). This time NIOC introduced Pars Oil and Gas Company (POGC) as its representative for negotiations.

From April 2016 both sides negotiated to develop the Farzad-B gas field under an integrated contract covering upstream and downstream including monetization/marketing of the processed gas. However negotiations remained inconclusive.

In 2016 Iran said it was examining the Indian proposal but that an agreement was unlikely because of the difference between Iran's demanded gas price and India's offer.

India offered a USD 6.2 billion development plan and a gas price of around USD 4 per million British thermal unit for Farzad-B in 2018.

Meanwhile on the basis of new studies a revised Provisional Master Development Plan (PMDP) was submitted to POGC in March 2017 sources said adding that in April 2019 NIOC proposed development of the gas field under the DSC and offtake of raw gas by NIOC at landfall point.

However due to the imposition of US sanctions on Iran in November 2018 technical studies could not be concluded which is a precursor for commercial negotiations.

The Indian consortium has so far invested around USD 85 million in the block. The contract provides for the Indian consortium being paid back the expense together with a fixed rate of return.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZWFsZXN0YXRlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL3RoZS1ibG9jay0yMDIxLWVwaXNvZGUtNDEtYmFja3lhcmQtcmV2ZWFsLXRlbXBlcnMtYm9pbC1vdmVyLWFzLXRhbnlhcy1saWVzLXJlYWNoLW5ldy1oZWlnaHRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Block 2021 episode 41 backyard reveal: Tempers boil over as Tanya's lies reach new heights - realestate.com.au,"If I was caught telling as many lies as Tanya I would simply stage my own disappearance and live off the land.

’There’s something wrong with Kirsty’- Country singer targeted by twins

Why the knives are out for Kirsty and Jesse

On this week’s backyard reveal as she has on so many episodes of The Block 2021 she instead opts for her trademark unsettling grin and a barrage of gaslighting that is Trumpian in its scale.

It kicks off as so many dramas do with Mark and Mitch on the warpath.

They discover tradies for every other house arriving at 7am on a Saturday when the rules say on weekends tradies can’t be on site until 9am and confront several including Tanya and Vito’s builder Andrew.

“Tanya and Vito are in bed and they should be out here working and not having you guys here. It’s not f. king fair. Go and get a coffee” Mark orders Andrew.

When Andrew meets Vito at the coffee cart he lets him know what was said prompting Vito to storm over to Mark and Mitch’s house where they are in the middle of telling Keith about the rogue tradies.

“What is your problem” he yells. “Why give Andrew a hard time? All he was doing was walking down the street. It’s just pathetic Pathetic people you are.”

Mark is inclined to leave it there but a fired up Mitch follows Vito back to the cafe where Andrew tells him he didn’t appreciate “being dressed down in front of the cameras”.

“I wasn’t working I was coming to get a coffee” he says.

Things further deteriorate when Mark shows up and reminds everyone that he had good reason to suspect foul play given Tanya and Vito’s history of cheating prompting Tanya to unleash that head thrusting baring of teeth before completely out of the blue claiming it was Mark and Mitch’s builder Jason who sent her builder Andrew the now infamous photo of the schedule.

That’s the photo that started weeks of bad blood and a positively operatic series of lies from Tanya and Vito about their innocence — before their house of cards came crashing down and they admitted that they were the ones who distributed the photo to Luke and Josh — giving both teams a hugely unfair advantage in the first few weeks of the competition.

But after all those weeks of suspicion and interrogation this is the first time Tanya has ever made the claim the picture was distributed by Jason and it’s one that leaves everyone gobsmacked.

Particularly since until now she’s claimed she got the photo via an anonymous text that she’s since deleted.

“She’s a liar” Mark says unnecessarily before he and Mitch head off to call Jason and tell him what he’s just been accused of.

A producer then interviews Tanya and Vito’s builder Andrew who denies Tanya’s claim that Jason sent him the photo and seems genuinely confused as to why she made the allegation.

Then Jason rocks up with Mark and Mitch to clear his name.

At which point Tanya denies saying he sent the photo to her builder and it’s hard to believe this needs to be said again but there were cameras there.

And she did say it. There’s video and audio of her saying it — and I can’t stress this enough — on camera.

There’s something deeply deeply weird about Tanya’s lies which at this point can really only be described as compulsive.

Tanya’s breathtaking dishonesty isn’t the only jaw-dropping moment of this episode though. Watching Georgia and Ronnie turn on Jesse and Kirsty comes a close second.

All week Josh and Luke have been stirring the other contestants up by suggesting the country pair have been doing something dodgy to afford to landscape their enormous backyard.

The twins call a body corporate meeting to vote on whether Kirsty and Jesse should be audited to ensure they’re not accepting free or heavily discounted landscaping services which would be a breach of Block rules.

As the contestants gather Josh says “we’ve all seen your backyard and it looks amazing but how much is it going to be costing?”

At which point Kirsty very reasonably replies “It’s none of your business how much it’s costing.”

Josh is outraged at that response.

“All we asked is how are you spending your money and she is arms crossed giving us stern greasies and trying to say it’s none of our business. Well actual fact if you’re doing the wrong thing it’s all our f. king business” he says in his later interview.

Except they are not.

They’ve accumulated $100000 in savings room wins challenge wins sponsor vouchers and bonuses in the form of their Hipages lever and their extra game-changer money which all contestants receive.

Plus they made the wise move of getting a set quote from the landscaper unlike Josh and Luke who are paying their landscaper and his crew an hourly rate.

They’re also planning to do little more than grass in their front yard.

Josh and Luke aren’t convinced and believe the quote Kirsty and Jesse’s landscaper gave them was well under the odds so they insist on a vote for an audit.

Mark and Mitch vote no.

“I don’t think it’s necessary. We had a private chat with the guys and we trust them” Mark says.

But Ronnie and Georgia are quick and firm yes votes which leaves Kirsty hurt given the friendship she thought she had with Georgia.

“It seemed like they were straight out calling us liars” Kirsty says.

“It was very disappointing and hurtful. It surprised me how quickly Georgia put her hand up for an audit. We would never do that to them.”

“It made us feel like s**t” Jesse agrees.

“It doesn’t sit well with me calling me a cheater” Kirsty adds. “You can call me a lot of things but I think I’m one of the most honest people out there.”

Anyway all that nastiness and bitterness ends up being moot. The twins don’t get a vote because they called the meeting and there’s no clear majority wanting an audit.

After all this nastiness the judging feels like a relief.

Ronnie and Georgia spent $76033 for their stylish backyard including a prefab pool feature brick wall deck barbecue concrete bench seats around a fire pit and a side play area with artificial grass and clothes line behind a gate.

The judges love everything about it their only criticism the lack of more established plants next to the pool.

Mark and Mitch spent $46425 on their Palm Springs resort style backyard with pool cabana area with kitchen speakers and heaters well-established dragon trees and raised and covered veggie growing boxes.

“This is Mark and Mitch at their absolute best” Neale Whitaker raves.

Tanya and Vito spent $45.005 on their pool deck fernery and barbecue area but the judges aren’t impressed saying it feels underdone and unfinished.

They think they wasted the curved window which could have been a great serving area and hate the lethal-looking sharp metal shelf under it right at toddler head height.

“It’s not kid friendly it’s not pet friendly and it’s not judge friendly” Shaynna Blaze says.

Josh and Luke spent $53538 and get some of the best judge feedback they’ve ever had. Their decision to move their master bedroom into the area earmarked for the garage is now shown as a masterstroke since it overlooks the pool area and has a siding door straight out on to the pool deck.

They also have a water feature kitchenette and eight-seater dining table and down the side is a perfect little grassed area for kids or pets with all the services like airconditioning and heating units neatly and safely screened off.

“The boys have knocked it out of the park this week. This is stunning” Neale says.

But even though Scott Cam claimed small spaces were just as likely to win as bigger ones the judges find it impossible to go past Kirsty and Jesse’s enormous space.

They spent $86411 on their concrete pool huge dining pavilion with barbecue smoker and pizza oven fire pit surround by limestone benches chook pen and private patio leading from the master bedroom.

“I think Kirsty and Jesse are on track to deliver one of the most beautiful homes we’ve ever seen on The Block” Neale says.

“The size the scope of this house could have brought them to their knees but this is boss level” agrees Darren Palmer.

The scores are close so the pair decide to use their bonus point but in the end it didn’t matter because they win by 1.5 points.

“It’s a weird feeling tonight. I just feel really down. I know we won but the whole time I just felt there were eyes glaring into the side of my head not wanting us to win” Kirsty says.

FINAL SCORES

1 Kirsty and Jesse 29.5

2 Ronnie and Georgia 28

2 Mark and Mitch 28

2 Josh and Luke 28

3 Tanya and Vito 22.5

They’ve accumulated $100000 in savings room wins challenge wins sponsor vouchers and bonuses in the form of their Hipages lever and their extra game-changer money which all contestants receive.

Plus they made the wise move of getting a set quote from the landscaper unlike Josh and Luke who are paying their landscaper and his crew an hourly rate.

They’re also planning to do little more than grass in their front yard.

Josh and Luke aren’t convinced and believe the quote Kirsty and Jesse’s landscaper gave them was well under the odds so they insist on a vote for an audit.

Mark and Mitch vote no.

“I don’t think it’s necessary. We had a private chat with the guys and we trust them” Mark says.

But Ronnie and Georgia are quick and firm yes votes which leaves Kirsty hurt given the friendship she thought she had with Georgia.

“It seemed like they were straight out calling us liars” Kirsty says.

“It was very disappointing and hurtful. It surprised me how quickly Georgia put her hand up for an audit. We would never do that to them.”

“It made us feel like s**t” Jesse agrees.

“It doesn’t sit well with me calling me a cheater” Kirsty adds. “You can call me a lot of things but I think I’m one of the most honest people out there.”

Anyway all that nastiness and bitterness ends up being moot. The twins don’t get a vote because they called the meeting and there’s no clear majority wanting an audit.

After all this nastiness the judging feels like a relief.

Ronnie and Georgia spent $76033 for their stylish backyard including a prefab pool feature brick wall deck barbecue concrete bench seats around a fire pit and a side play area with artificial grass and clothes line behind a gate.

The judges love everything about it their only criticism the lack of more established plants next to the pool.

Mark and Mitch spent $46425 on their Palm Springs resort style backyard with pool cabana area with kitchen speakers and heaters well-established dragon trees and raised and covered veggie growing boxes.

“This is Mark and Mitch at their absolute best” Neale Whitaker raves.

Tanya and Vito spent $45.005 on their pool deck fernery and barbecue area but the judges aren’t impressed saying it feels underdone and unfinished.

They think they wasted the curved window which could have been a great serving area and hate the lethal-looking sharp metal shelf under it right at toddler head height.

“It’s not kid friendly it’s not pet friendly and it’s not judge friendly” Shaynna Blaze says.

Josh and Luke spent $53538 and get some of the best judge feedback they’ve ever had. Their decision to move their master bedroom into the area earmarked for the garage is now shown as a masterstroke since it overlooks the pool area and has a siding door straight out on to the pool deck.

They also have a water feature kitchenette and eight-seater dining table and down the side is a perfect little grassed area for kids or pets with all the services like airconditioning and heating units neatly and safely screened off.

“The boys have knocked it out of the park this week. This is stunning” Neale says.

But even though Scott Cam claimed small spaces were just as likely to win as bigger ones the judges find it impossible to go past Kirsty and Jesse’s enormous space.

They spent $86411 on their concrete pool huge dining pavilion with barbecue smoker and pizza oven fire pit surround by limestone benches chook pen and private patio leading from the master bedroom.

“I think Kirsty and Jesse are on track to deliver one of the most beautiful homes we’ve ever seen on The Block” Neale says.

“The size the scope of this house could have brought them to their knees but this is boss level” agrees Darren Palmer.

The scores are close so the pair decide to use their bonus point but in the end it didn’t matter because they win by 1.5 points.

“It’s a weird feeling tonight. I just feel really down. I know we won but the whole time I just felt there were eyes glaring into the side of my head not wanting us to win” Kirsty says.

FINAL SCORES

The Ryde Rd house sold under the hammer for nearly $300000 above the reserve at $2.33 million with over 20 buyers registered to bid. The sale of the deceased estate marked the first Saturday in over 100 days auctions were able to be conducted across Sydney with the easement of Covid-19 restrictions.

On-site auctions were permitted with social distancing measures in place and attendees did not need to be vaccinated under guidelines from NSW Health.

While many vendors and real estate agents welcomed the return of the traditional Saturday method of selling homes others opted to be cautious and continue to hold virtual auctions.

Ray White Gladesville sales agent Barrie Brown said the Hunters Hill home was in poor condition with overgrown gardens torn wallpaper and damaged floorboards.

“There were wild cats hiding in the house and we had to get the RSPCA in to remove them” he said.

“To be able to bring buyers through we also had to remove 10 truck loads worth of rubbish.”

The opportunity to buy a property over a $1 million less than the median house price saw buyers compete hard for the offering. A local who planned to knock down the derelict home and build a grand residence was the buyer.

Earlier in the day Mr Brown sold another knock down rebuild in Gladesville for nearly $500000 over the reserve price at $2.430 million. The Brereton St home listed for the first time in 70 years attracted five registered bidders with two active including the Chatswood buyer.

Auctioneer Paul Menck said buyer appetite at on-site auctions remained as strong as past weeks.

“It was almost like Christmas Day for the real estate sector to have auctions back on-site” he said.

“The return could not have gone any better than what we saw in today with the bids coming in hard and fast.”

CoreLogic reports 983 auctions were schedule to take place in Sydney this weekend — an increase on the 825 that went under the hammer last weekend."

Massachusetts was leading the region into a war against the ravages of climate change. It saw a new transmission line that could import excess hydroelectric power from Canada through northern New England as one weapon in the arsenal. And after New Hampshire rejected a transmission line proposal through its state in 2018 CMP’s project was selected.

Four years later the $1 billion New England Clean Energy Connect project is under construction. Land is being cleared and poles erected. But rather than being widely embraced as a green-power solution for New England NECEC has triggered one of the most divisive and expensive environmental battles in Maine history. Now the fight is reaching a climax in court at regulatory agencies in the media and at the ballot box.

Related One crucial mile creates wide gap for power line project

It’s an unusual battle in some regards. Most times opponents try to stop a project from being started. The game here is to stop NECEC from being completed.

To meet contracts with Massachusetts utilities that already have been delayed years NECEC and its investor-owned parent company took a high-stakes gamble. They have spent more than $350 million on equipment labor permitting and construction calculating that they ultimately will prevail. And that doesn’t include more than $34 million on record-breaking campaign spending to fight the corridor referendum.

It’s also a perplexing fight for some voters just tuning in because Question 1 may appear to be about something other than a transmission line.

Drivers pass roadside campaign signs reading “Say No to Retroactive Laws.” Advertisements featuring grim-faced construction workers warn that politicians could shut down their businesses cancel road projects and kill jobs if Question 1 passes.

This campaign is being carried out by a political action committee funded by the project developers. It focuses on the word “retroactively” in the law behind the ballot question. That word is part of language dealing with certain projects specifically on Maine’s public lands that date back as far as 2014 and a requirement for lawmakers to approve them.

Without any mention of the power line this element of the No campaign seeks to plant a seed of doubt in the minds of voters. It conflates two sections of the law to mislead voters and create fear that by killing NECEC they also may wound Maine’s economy.

These and other claims obscure what the New England Clean Energy Connect actually is.

NECEC is a high-voltage direct-current transmission line with a capacity of 1200 megawatts enough energy to run roughly 1 million homes. It would carry energy from Quebec to an alternate-current converter station in Lewiston where it would enter the New England electric grid. It’s being built largely for the benefit of Massachusetts electric customers who will pay the $1 billion cost.

The 145-mile route is on land owned or controlled by CMP except for a one-mile patch through Maine public lands near The Forks. Two-thirds of the route follows existing CMP power line corridors some of which are being widened up to 75 feet to accommodate another set of poles.

A 53-mile stretch between The Forks and the Quebec border bisects undeveloped commercial forest. The area has been logged for generations but has high-value qualities for wildlife recreation and biodiversity. Permits require the power corridor in this section to be no more than 54 feet wide. Fewer than 1000 acres are being cleared in total for the project.

NECEC secured all its state and federal permits before construction began last winter but at least one of those approvals is now getting a second look.

A Maine Superior Court judge in August voided a lease across the one-mile stretch of public lands after ruling that state officials failed to properly conduct a review to decide whether the line significantly altered the land. CMP and the state are appealing the ruling but the Maine Department of Environmental Protection is holding a hearing Tuesday on whether it should suspend the permit. Meanwhile the Maine Supreme Judicial Court is allowing construction to continue during the appeal except on the public lands.

Amid uncertainty voters will weigh in on whether they think the project should continue and whether to expand the role of the Legislature in approving similar power lines in the future. Whatever the outcome more legal challenges can be expected.

Q: What happens if I vote yes? Or if I vote no?

A: The ballot question’s wording flips around its actual purpose by asking residents to vote affirmatively to ban something.

A yes vote means you support the initiative. It means you want to prohibit specifically defined “high-impact” power line construction in the Upper Kennebec region and want lawmakers to have the final say on similar projects anywhere in Maine as well as power lines and various defined activities on public lands going back to 2014.

A no vote means you oppose the ballot initiative. It means you favor NECEC completing construction and don’t want the Legislature to have a vote on approving any “high impact” lines anywhere.

Q: Who is funding the No and Yes campaigns and why?

A: The two sides combined had shoveled $60 million into the fight as of early October on advertising and other message outreach already a state record for a ballot question.

One side which supports the ballot measure and opposes the project is funded largely by two political action committees No CMP Corridor and Mainers for Local Power. Allies include environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Council of Maine the Sierra Club and the Appalachian Mountain Club. The political action committees have spent a combined $12.7 million.

Campaign finance reports show that the largest share of the money has come from Florida-based NextEra Energy Resources which has donated $7 million since July 1. NextEra owns Wyman Station an oil-fired power plant in Yarmouth. That has given NECEC supporters the ammunition to brand NextEra as a dirty “big oil and gas” company that opposes clean energy.

In fact NextEra is among the largest wind and solar generators in the world. It acquired Wyman Station which serves as backup generation for the region and rarely runs when its former parent company took over the generating assets of CMP during utility restructuring in the 1990s.

NextEra’s real interest in fighting the NECEC project has to do with its ownership of the 1250-megawatt Seabrook Station nuclear power plant in New Hampshire. NECEC would deliver cheaper around-the-clock power to New England. That would depress wholesale prices and directly compete with Seabrook the region’s largest single electricity generator and incidentally one that emits zero carbon.

Two Texas-based energy companies that also have helped fund the NECEC opponents own natural gas plants in Maine. They would run less often if NECEC came on line. The companies are Vistra Energy Corp. which has a 520-megawatt plant in Veazie and Calpine Corp. which owns a 552-megawatt plant in Westbrook.

Another NECEC opposition PAC No CMP Corridor has spent $415000 most of it donated by Mainers for Local Power.

The No campaign which opposes the ballot question and supports the completion of NECEC is primarily funded by the developers who stand to gain from it. They are Clean Energy Matters and the Hydro-Quebec Maine Partnership. This alliance has outspent project opponents 4-to-1. The latest campaign finance reports show Clean Energy Matters has spent $34.4 million and Hydro-Quebec $14.7 million.

You may also see roadside signs asking you to vote no on Question 1 sponsored by Mainers for Fair Laws. This group makes no mention of the power line but is focused instead on the message that a yes vote will allow lawmakers to retroactively change or kill highway or other projects across Maine. This group is backed financially by Clean Energy Matters which is funded by NECEC’s developers. It spent $406000 most of it on advertising.

Q: Opponents describe CMP’s project as a unilateral attempt to push a power line through western Maine’s mountains. Why is it being built in the first place?

A: The impetus dates back to 2016. That’s when Massachusetts enacted a law aimed at creating a clean-energy future that would replace fossil fuels and lower electric rates.

Part of the law mandated that utilities in cooperation with the state’s energy office solicit bids and sign contracts for certain amounts of wind solar and hydro power. Forty-six projects submitted proposals in early 2017 including CMP in partnership with Hydro-Quebec.

But the CMP project was only one of three proposals involving Hydro Quebec which had been trying for years to establish a new path to sell Canadian power into the Northeast. The others were Northern Pass through the White Mountains of New Hampshire and TDI New England under Lake Champlain in Vermont.

In late 2017 Massachusetts picked Northern Pass a project that offered 1200 megawatts of hydro capacity. Policymakers considered it the best value for Massachusetts electricity customers who would pay the full cost of the line and the most likely to be completed.

They were wrong on the second count. New Hampshire residents overwhelming opposed the line and a state siting agency killed the project in February 2018.

That put the $1 billion NECEC proposal back in play. Unlike the Vermont line almost all of the Maine project would run above ground and most of it would be along existing CMP corridors. That made it the next best deal for Massachusetts ratepayers.

In June 2018 with strong encouragement from former Gov. Paul LePage the Massachusetts utilities announced they had negotiated an agreement with CMP.

Q: Question 1 is actually three questions wrapped into one citizens’ initiative. What does each part do?

A: The first part reads: “Do you want to ban the construction of high-impact electric transmission lines in the Upper Kennebec Region … ?

This section directly seeks to kill the project. It’s aimed specifically at preventing NECEC from bisecting 53 miles of largely undeveloped forest between The Forks and Beattie Township on the Quebec border.

“High-impact” lines are defined as more than 50 miles in length outside an existing corridor not needed for generator interconnections or not primarily for electricity reliability. Such lines would be prohibited within a 43000-acre area roughly between Bingham and the Canadian border.

The second part reads: “… and to require the Legislature to approve all other such projects anywhere in Maine both retroactive to 2020 …”

This section would require the Legislature to approve any high-impact transmission line projects anywhere in Maine going back to 2020. NECEC supporters have been running ads asserting that the retroactivity language could allow lawmakers to tank all sorts of projects already underway including roads and bridges.

That’s a scare tactic. This part of the question only affects high-impact transmission lines. And no one has identified an existing project other than NECEC that would be at risk if Question 1 became law.

The third part reads: “… and require the Legislature retroactively to 2014 to approve by a two-thirds vote such projects using public lands?”

This section is directly meant to stop NECEC’s route over a critical mile that bisects two adjacent public lots in the Kennebec Valley in Johnson Mountain Township and West Forks Plantation. It’s retroactive to 2014 because that’s when the state and CMP entered into a lease agreement an approval being contested in court.

But this retroactivity component is being criticized in a deceptive way.

Ads run by NECEC supporters give the impression that approval of Question 1 could set a precedent to allow politicians to somehow impose new laws or restrictions on any existing project anywhere in Maine going back to 2014.

The claim seems meant to confuse voters. It’s deceptive for two reasons:

First this section only applies to public lands. Second the underlying law says legislative approval is needed for “poles transmission lines and facilities landing strips pipelines and railroad tracks” that “substantially alter” the use of public lands.

So the third part of the ballot question is strictly about those stated activities on public lands which by definition don’t see a lot of development. NECEC proponents have pointed to a handful of small telecom leases that could be impacted but opponents say they are not the target and that any issues they faced as a result could be remedied easily by lawmakers.

Q: Will the power line actually bring clean renewable energy into New England?

A: Unfortunately this question can’t be answered with certainty.

Some opponents liken the project to a big extension cord through Maine connecting Quebec with Massachusetts. That’s a simplistic analogy. The NECEC line actually will connect with Hydro-Quebec’s transmission system. Depending on wholesale market prices and generator availability Hydro-Quebec can move power to and from other Canadian provinces as well as New York state.

New England’s grid operator has a tracking tool that can identify power coming from specific generators but not how it’s dispatched within a utility’s system. Critics say Hydro-Quebec could at times buy power say from a natural gas plant in New York to meet its contract obligations in Massachusetts and move it though its system in a way that makes it seem like hydro power.

That’s the warning expressed in a 2018 report by Energyzt Advisors a consulting firm hired by project opponents to assess whether the project would result in a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in New England.

Hydro-Quebec however has said it has so much capacity in its vast reservoirs that it has had to spill water over dams because it lacked sufficient economical exports. What’s more Hydro-Quebec says it has enough existing storage that it can supply both NECEC and a second similarly sized project designed to bring hydro power underground and underwater to New York City – the Champlain Hudson Power Express. That project got a boost in September when New York authorities picked it for contract negotiations.

Q: Is that uncertainty the reason environmentalist groups are split on the project?

A: It’s a big reason. A couple of regional environmentalist groups the Conservation Law Foundation and Acadia Center collaborated with interests including Maine’s Office of Public Advocate and the Governor’s Energy Office to reach a settlement agreement in 2019 before the state Public Utilities Commission. It imposed conditions valued at $260 million including money for heat pumps electric vehicle charging stations and energy efficiency programs for low-income residents.

Separately Gov. Janet Mills received a commitment from Hydro-Quebec to directly sell enough discounted energy in Maine each year to run 70000 homes.

Taken together Mills and these interests have made the calculation that the project and settlement conditions will have a net positive impact on blunting climate change in New England.

But key adversaries led by the Natural Resources Council of Maine and the Sierra Club which helped commission the Engergyzt report arrived at the opposite conclusion. They say it won’t have any impact on climate change and would lead to “greenwashing” selling fossil fuel power under the facade of clean energy.

Q: Would the power line run through “unspoiled wilderness” as opponents claim?

A: A strict definition of wilderness is land not significantly modified by human activity. But unspoiled wilderness may be in the eye of the beholder.

The 53-mile undeveloped route between The Forks and the Quebec border known as Section 1 is mostly commercial timberland that contains multiple logging roads and has been harvested for generations. Anyone can see that by cracking open a Maine Atlas zooming in on Google Earth or driving into the area.

Still it remains a treasured remote area of the Maine Woods that’s part of the largest temperate forest in North America.

The power line corridor would further fragment the forest opponents say and disrupt natural resources from deer herds to brook trout habitat with a clearcut right-of-way “as wide as the New Jersey Turnpike.”

That characterization is deceiving. CMP does own a right-of-way that’s 300 feet wide. And it initially sought a 150-foot-wide corridor for the project. But the permit granted by the Department of Environmental Protection greatly reduced the size and impact.

The corridor through Section 1 can be no wider than 54 feet. Some opponents have claimed it is being cut wider but the DEP has found no evidence of that.

In addition trees at least 35 feet tall must be preserved in certain vulnerable wildlife habitats covering 14 miles. No herbicides can be used within the 53-mile section.

CMP also must spend $1.8 million to replace culverts that currently block fish passage and it must conserve 40000 acres in the region according to the DEP permit.

Q: Some people oppose the project because they are against “mega dams.” What’s that about?

A: This is a complex topic. It’s largely centered on the environmental effects of impounding water behind giant dams.

Flooded forests release carbon dioxide and methane – two greenhouse gases – as they decompose. But Hydro-Quebec which has developed 681 dams and 28 large reservoirs over decades isn’t building any new dams or reservoirs for the NECEC project.

Another concern is highly poisonous methylmercury which forms when bacteria reacts with naturally occurring mercury in plants and soil. It can accumulate in fish that are then eaten by people presenting a health risk. Methylmercury has been studied for years in Canada where millions of acres of forest have been flooded.

For its part Hydro-Quebec says the impacts are temporary and can be managed by limiting fish consumption. But mercury is of great concern to indigenous communities that are located near the man-made lakes and in some instances were flooded to create them.

Speaking to Sports Illustrated ahead of the release of his memoir “Jump: My Secret Journey from the Streets to the Boardroom” Miller 72 admitted that he killed a man named Edward White 56 years ago and served a prison sentence for the murder.

He said that he had never lied about the incident but kept it a secret due to his shame.

“For years I ran from this” Miller said in the interview published late last week. “I tried to hide this and hope that people didn’t find out about it.”

Miller said the murder took place after he joined the Cedar Avenue gang in West Philadelphia at age 13 quickly changing from “a straight-A student” to “a straight-up gangbanger.”

When a friend was killed by a rival gang member Miller says he took a handgun got drunk with three friends and went in search of retribution. But instead of finding the perpetrators he fired at the first person they found mortally wounding White who had no connection to the killing of his friend.

“That’s what makes it even more difficult for me because it was for no reason at all” he said further admitting that he was in and out of detention facilities in his late teens and early 20s.

While in prison he studied for an accounting degree at Philadelphia’s Temple University.

“A person’s mistake or the worst mistake that they made in their life shouldn’t control what happens with the rest of your life” he said.

Nike said in a statement that Miller’s life was “an incredible story of second chances.”

“We are proud of Larry Miller and the hope and inspiration his story can offer” the company said adding that it supported helping former prisoners “open new doors of opportunity and move forward with their lives.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmNhLmNvbS9lbi9iYXNrZXRiYWxsL25iYS8yMDIxLzEwLzE3LzYxNmMwZGYxNDYxNjNmODQ2ZjhiNDViNS5odG1s0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAubWFyY2EuY29tL2VuL2Jhc2tldGJhbGwvbmJhLzIwMjEvMTAvMTcvNjE2YzBkZjE0NjE2M2Y4NDZmOGI0NWI1Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michael Jordan Net Worth 2021: What is Jordan's deal with Nike?,"Michael Jordan is not only widely regarded as the greatest basketball player of all time but he is also one of the most successful brand endorsers ever.

The American basketball legend won six NBA Championships with the Chicago Bulls between 1991 and 1998 and continues to be an inspirational figure for many.

His on-court success in the NBA as well as his his money-spinning deal with Nike have seen him establish himself as the richest former professional athlete in the world.

What is Michael Jordan's deal with Nike?

Jordan's current net worth stands at a total of 1.6 billion dollars and here we look at his deal with Nike.

Back in 1984 he signed a contract with Nike as the US brand agreed to an upfront commitment of 250000 dollars and his own sneaker line.

At the time Nike were a fledgling company that were struggling to compete with the likes of Converse and Adidas but seized their moment when Converse failed to agree to Jordan's demands.

That year alone Nike earned 126 million dollars as a result of the deal and they have continued to earn eye-watering sums ever since.

At the end of 2019 it was estimated that the Nike Air Jordan brand was worth 3bn dollars with 'His Airness' earning over 1.3bn of that sum.

The deal catapulted Nike into a position of total monopoly over the basketball sneaker business and helped them establish themselves as one of the largest most valuable brands in the world with Jordan similarly accumulating enormous wealth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzc2VudGlhbGx5c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9wZ2EtdG91ci1nb2xmLW5ld3MtdGlnZXItd29vZHMtbmlrZS1jb250cmFjdC1ob3ctbXVjaC1pcy1pdC13b3J0aC1hbmQtd2hlbi13aWxsLWl0LWV4cGlyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tiger Woods Nike Contract: How Much Is It Worth and When Will It Expire?,"ST LOUIS MO – AUGUST 11: Tiger Woods of the United States stands on the 15th hole during the third round of the 2018 PGA Championship at Bellerive Country Club on August 11 2018 in St Louis Missouri.

The bond between Tiger Woods and Nike is inseparable. The most famous golfer in the history of this sport has been associated with Nike since 1996. Woods was a child prodigy and was already a well-known name in the sporting world even before his pro debut. Moreover the 15-time major championship winner revolutionized golf and made it a global sport.

Meanwhile his first signing with Nike came in 1996 just before his pro debut at the Greater Milwaukee Open. So let us have a look at Tiger Woods’ Nike contract and get to know more about this powerful pairing.

What is the worth of Tiger Woods’ Nike Contract?

The first deal Tiger Woods signed with Nike was worth $40 million for five years in 1996. According to the reports Tiger’s next contract came in 2001 which was more than double his initial contract.

This was said to be roughly worth $100 million with a similar five years span. The third deal came in 2006 but this time it was for seven years until 2013.

However he signed an extension in 2013 and it’s been reported that his current Nike contract is around $200 million. “We’re comfortable with where we ended up and the career trajectory that Tiger will be on with Nike” said Woods’ agent in 2013.

When does Tiger’s Nike Contract expire?

Nike has been with Tiger Woods through thick and thin. Nike stood by him even when everyone else had discontinued their contracts due to a few controversies in his life. Moreover during that same period he wasn’t even in the best of his form. He had just one top-10 finish in three years from 2014 to 2017.

But Nike chose to stay with Woods and keep their contract. Hence this powerful partnership between the 82 time PGA Tour winner and Nike will not end at least until Woods doesn’t retire from this sport. And it is crystal clear that even if his current deal expires Tiger Woods will extend the contract and remain with his giant sporting company forever.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9sb2NhbC9uaWtlLW1pc3NpbGUtc2lsb3Mtd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi8yMDIxLzEwLzE2L2IwMDY4NTI4LTJkZGEtMTFlYy05ODVkLTMxNTBmN2UxMDZiMl9zdG9yeS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike missiles around Washington,April 14 1955 was a good day to not be driving on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.

Kennedy Whose Ad Agency Put Nike on the Map Dies at 82 (Published 2021),"David F. Kennedy a founder of the innovative advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy which created famous campaigns featuring Nike’s slogan “Just do it” and Lou Reed on a Honda scooter died on Oct. 10 at his home in Estacada Ore. near Portland. He was 82.

The cause was heart failure said Jeff Selis a former Wieden+Kennedy producer and a family friend.

Wieden+Kennedy which Mr. Kennedy started in Oregon with Dan Wieden in 1982 elevated Portland’s creative cachet at a time when advertising was mostly associated with New York Chicago and Los Angeles. While many rivals have been subsumed by gargantuan holding companies the agency remained at his death an independent shop with eight offices around the world and about 1500 employees.

In 1988 Mr. Kennedy was the creative director on the first Nike commercial to include Mr. Wieden’s slogan “Just do it” featuring an 80-year-old man named Walt Stack who ran 17 miles each morning. For Honda in 1985 the pair put out grainy footage of Lou Reed the former frontman of the Velvet Underground telling viewers “Don’t settle for walking” while perched on a Honda scooter all to the tune of his 1973 hit song “Walk on the Wild Side.”"

Health Minister Robin Swann has hailed the importance of localised initiatives to further improve Northern Ireland’s Covid-19 vaccination uptake.

A push to offer vaccinations in rural areas has led to more than 1600 jabs being administered.

Meanwhile a branch of the Boots pharmacy chain has held walk-in vaccinations at a community pharmacy without the need for an appointment. The walk-in facility at the Ballyholme branch in Bangor was organised locally as a pilot and will hopefully be replicated across other pharmacies in NI. It was held on Friday past and a further walk-in facility is planned.

The rural take-up initiative involved the Farm Families Health Checks Programme working in partnership with the Trust-led mobile vaccine programme. The Farm Families Health Checks Programme is an innovative public health regional programme led by the Northern Trust and funded by DAERA and the Public Health Agency. It is a one stop mobile facility offering free health assessments and advice to those attending local markets and community events in rural areas. It has been teaming up with the Health Trusts to help with vaccination clinics in targeted rural areas where vaccine uptake has been lower resulting in a total of 1617 jabs being administered.

A further Farm Families/Western Trust clinic takes place this evening (Monday October 18) in St Ninnidh’s Parish Hall in Derrylin from 5.00pm – 9.00pm.

Community pharmacies are now taking the lead role in providing first dose Covid vaccinations. After tonight as part of their ongoing work the Farm Families Health Checks Programme will be encouraging people who have not yet been vaccinated to attend their local community pharmacy to get jabbed.

The Health Minister stated: “I want to express my gratitude to everyone working hard to get more people vaccinated. While the Covid booster programme is vitally important this winter we also need to keep reaching people who have not yet come forward for their first dose. The numbers involved are inevitably smaller than at earlier stages of the vaccination programme but they are still making a difference. As I keep saying – every single jab counts. “The Farm Families Health Checks Programme has undoubtedly played its part underlining once again its importance as a public health programme for rural areas. “I also very much welcome the initiative by the Boots branch in Bangor to pilot vaccination walk-ins at a community pharmacy. “This is going to be an incredibly busy period for vaccinations – with Covid boosters school-based Covid vaccination and flu jabs being provided along with the ongoing first Covid jabs. Vaccination is a monumental effort across the health and social care family and a huge logistical undertaking. On behalf of the people of Northern Ireland I say thank you to everyone involved.”

A combination of a birdie fest in the desert dominated firstly by the unheralded Robert Streb and then through 36 holes by Keith Mitchell meant that the tournament in all likelihood would not be one which would live long in the memory bank.

Saturday changed that all together and with no disrespect to Mitchell from the moment he made back-to-back double bogeys on nine and ten the complexion of the tournament changed completely and with two of the game’s most charismatic players Rickie Fowler and Rory McIlroy the ones to take advantage of Mitchell’s slip up we now have a mouth-watering Sunday shootout to look forward to.

Fowler who leads the field from tee to green and who hit all 18 greens on Saturday on his way to a 63 will start Sunday on 21-under and with a two shot lead over McIlroy with the trio of Abraham Ancer Adam Scott and day-one pacemaker Streb a further shot behind on 18-under.

Fowler’s last win also came in the desert in Phoenix in 2019 since then his slump has seen him fail to make last season's Masters and Fedex Cup play-offs and the once Ryder Cup stalwart was on no one's radar for the recent USA squad.

Playing this week on a sponsors' exemption following a visit to his old coach Butch Harmon who is based in Vegas Fowler has played superbly to take advantage of the opportunity and a win on Sunday would put his career right back on track.

While the popular Californian has not won as much as he should have over the years we know he is more than capable and with his most recent success in Phoenix coming when he also held the 54-hole lead he has plenty of positive experience to call upon.

The bottom line though is that there has been a lot of poor golf from Fowler since that win and while there were glimpses of some better stuff back in the summer it is a big ask for him to close this out after so long away from the Sunday spotlight.

A win for Fowler would be a hugely popular one but I just can’t see it and my strong suspicion is this week will go down as a positive stepping stone on the path back.

So if it’s not going to be Fowler taking home the trophy the question is who will step up and take advantage and the obvious answer to me is RORY MCILROY.

McIlroy was last seen on our screens when leaving us in no doubt as to how much the defeat and his overall performance at Whistling Straits had hurt him and having had time to step away and take stock since that experience it was hard to know which McIlroy would show up this week.

The one that we have seen though has been typically open and full of perspective off the course while between the ropes he has produced a performance very similar to his most recent win on tour - at Quail Hollow earlier this year.

On that occasion the Northern Irishman used a hot putter to produce a win on a course we know he loves even though his long game wasn’t firing on all cylinders. This week on another Fazio design McIlroy leads the field on the greens and is third off the tee but currently sits 73rd in approach play.

Having lost strokes with his approach on Thursday and Friday Saturday saw an upturn in that department in his 62 and my suspicion is he will build on that improvement with irons again today.

Following up a 62 with another low number something he will need to do to win is never easy but with McIlroy when it clicks it really does click and I am happy to take him to close things out.",,,,,,,,,

Lucy's 12-year mission begins Oct. 16 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station

CAPE CANAVERAL SPACE FORCE STATION Fla. Oct. 16 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Humankind is one step closer to unlocking new knowledge about the formation of our solar system thanks to a spacecraft named Lucy built by Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT). The NASA mission successfully launched from Florida at 5:34 a.m. ET this morning.

""Seeing Lucy start her journey reinforces the strength of the 500 team members from NASA Lockheed Martin the Southwest Research Institute and many other teams who worked together to bring this mission to life"" said Rich Lipe Lockheed Martin Lucy program manager. ""It's a tale centered on flexibility collaboration and ingenuity which is fitting for the voyage that lies ahead for this advanced spacecraft.""

The spacecraft was designed built and tested in Lockheed Martin's Littleton facility using transformative technology. The company's mission operations team is now in communications with the spacecraft and will operate it through the end of its mission.

Lucy will be the farthest solar-powered mission from the Sun and will visit a record-breaking number of asteroids – all in the name of studying them for clues about our own origins.

Engineering for an Epic Journey

Lucy's 4-billion-mile odyssey through the solar system will last 12 years and fly by eight objects: one Main Belt asteroid and seven Trojan asteroids that lead and trail Jupiter in its orbit.

Scientists are keen for an up-close look at these ancient rocks which are believed to be pristinely preserved leftovers from the formation of our outer solar system 4 billion years ago.

With such a long unforgiving journey through space Lucy's engineers designed the spacecraft to be ready for anything. Lucy draws on heritage design elements from previous Lockheed Martin-built missions like OSIRIS-REx and MAVEN.

Key features of the Lucy spacecraft include:

Some 430 unique components brought together by more than 2 miles of wire 170 square feet of composite structure and more than 12800 electrical connections

Three powerful primary instruments to study the geology composition and structure of the Trojan asteroids

Two 24-foot diameter solar arrays built by Northrop Grumman spanning more than a four-story building when unfurled

A robust thermal design that protects Lucy from extreme space temperatures ranging from -250⁰F to +300⁰F

Autonomous software that enables Lucy to track asteroid targets as it flies by at an average speed of 15000 mph

Advanced production parts like 3D-printed brackets and harness clamps made from three different materials

The team also made use of the latest collaborative tools and digital engineering techniques on Lucy including automated testing digital test review capability and remote collaboration. These tactics helped the team continue production without missing a shift throughout the pandemic.

Seeking Science for the Next Generation

The long duration of Lucy's endeavor means that a student in 4th grade now could find themselves working on this mission when they graduate college.

The spacecraft also draws its name from another scientific discovery that students may recognize from their history books.

Much like the 3.2-million-year-old Lucy skeleton fundamentally changed our understanding of human evolution this mission aims to change the way we understand how the planets – including Earth – formed.

Donald Johanson who discovered the famous fossil in 1974 is thrilled to see the spirit of scientific exploration live on through the Lucy mission.

""The mission teaches us something about the interconnectedness of people over time and space"" he remarked. ""A poignant moment in the history of humanity that brings the past and the present together – and launches us into the future.""

The fighter is armed with a General Electric Vulcan M61A-1 20mm gun with nearly seven hundred rounds of ammunition and possesses eight hardpoints for carrying ordnance—four on the fuselage and two on each side under the wings. It can also take along short medium and long-range air-to-air missiles AIM-9 AIM-7 and AIM-54 and air-to-ground ordnance that includes CBU cluster bombs.

A Highly Versatile Aircraft

According to Dario Leone at the Aviation Geek Club “advancements during the Cold War in Soviet long-range patrol and bomber aircraft dictated a requirement for a fleet defense fighter that could engage high-altitude bombers from well beyond visual range.”

He continued: “The iconic F-14 Tomcat was Grumman’s answer. Needing an interceptor’s high speed while carrying this heavy ordnance Grumman produced the highly effective variable sweep wing of the F-14 enabling it to operate at a wide range of airspeeds.”

Per the site according to Charlie Brown who was part of the F-14 design team and a Northrop Grumman test pilot “the Navy specs called for a top speed of Mach 2.34 but the Tomcat was tested for Mach 2.5.”

‘Gone Past 2.5 Mach’

Dave Andersen a former F-14 Tomcat Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) at the U.S. Navy wrote on Quora that “back in the day a typical U.S. Navy F-14 squadron was assigned twelve to thirteen jets at any given time. Of those maybe two or three were stellar flyers. One or two were ‘hangar queens’ seemingly always down for maintenance issues. And one or two were considered ‘bent’ … these jets wouldn’t trim up well and just didn’t fly very well compared to the other jets. The rest were somewhere in between in flying qualities.”

He continued: “To give an example my squadron had one jet that was a real ‘hotrod.’ It always flew great trimmed up perfectly and out-accelerated and was faster than all the other jets in the squadron. Even the AWG-9 radar/weapons system worked better than the other jets. Everybody loved flying it. One of my most memorable flights was taking that one out on a post-maintenance check flight. When flying from our home base on land we would do these and other training flights in designated ‘restricted’ military training areas that were hundred miles or more out over the Atlantic Ocean east of the Virginia/North Carolina coast. The PMCF checklist called for a supersonic dash up to 1.2 Mach as one of the checks so this being the squadron hotrod of course we decided to see what she’d do (despite the imposed NATOPS speed limit of 1.88 Mach).”

“So we climbed to around 40K ft pointed her east away from the coast the pilot pushed the throttles into full burner and we let her rip. That jet accelerated like it was blasted out of a cannon. In maybe fifty seconds we went from about four hundred knots and reached the advertised top speed of Mach 2.34 and the jet was still accelerating. I’m sure she would’ve gone past 2.5 Mach if we’d let her but backed off at that point because we were getting close to ‘bingo’ fuel state” he concluded.

The event hosted a multitude of discussion demonstrations and presentations related to UAS (unmanned aircraft systems). Notable speakers included Sens. Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven Rear Admiral Lorin Selby UND president Andrew Armacost and more. It was held virtually in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and attendees were happy to finally be back in person this year.

“It’s nice to be in person it really is” Jon Gaster managing member of First-i LLC said. “Everybody’s Zoomed out right now so it’s definitely good to be here see a few old friends and see some new ones.”

“This is the most hectic it’s been but in a good way” Matt Dunlevy founder and partner at SkyScopes said. “This is really good attendance.”

Grand Sky sponsored the summit and its president and CEO Tom Swoyer praised BBI International for its work putting together the first in-person UAS Summit & Expo since 2019.

“We think that BBI has done a good job organizing the summit over the years and bringing really relevant topic matter together but also it’s our hometown.” Swoyer said. “It’s the hometown of Grand Sky so we wanted to be very supportive of it.

Swoyer said he took a different approach to this year’s event by foregoing any speaking and sitting it out to hear what others had to say in their presentations.

“I wanted to sit and listen” Swoyer said. “I think we are at a pivotal inflection point in the industry where we’re so close to so many really key things happening like widespread beyond line of sight much more commercial activity going on and so I think the inflection point now is you can’t really kind of be a jack-of-all-trades in UAS now you really have to specialize in the field you want to work in. So we wanted to take a real ‘sit back and listen’ approach to the summit and listen to the stories people were telling the presentations they were making the investments they’re making and the technology they’re developing so we can start to pick and choose some of the directions we can go in from Grand Sky’s perspective.”

Swoyer thanked people like Sens. Cramer and Hoeven the latter of whom also helped dedicate Grand sky’s new multi-tenant facility  for coming to town to draw attention to the industry.

“We have the senators come the lieutenant governor come and state dignitaries come and demonstrate their support for the industry and for Grand Forks by coming out and talking about this” Swoyer said. “We get to talk about the investments we’ve made.”

The summit draws people from across the country into Grand Forks which Swoyer said helps Grand Sky network with them. It creates local business opportunities as well as bringing in revenue to the city.

“Grand Sky is great to talk about but you really have to come out and see it to understand it and so for us the summit gives additional reason for people to come to Grand Forks” Swoyer said. “They say ‘Oh I’m going to go to this conference and possibly speak at it. While I’m there I’m going to go to this test site and UND and I’m going to go see Grand Sky’ and that makes now a trip really worthwhile and companies instead of just sending one person to a conference they send four five or six. Then we start getting into a dialogue about ‘What are your operational needs and how can they be met at Grand Sky?’ Next thing you know you have a new tenant.”

Unlike anything that currently travels the skies of our world this thing is not shaped like a plane but rather like a flying wing and it looks more like an alien ship than an Earth-made machine.

Of course most of us know its shape by now and are no longer appalled by it in the rare occasions it shows its silhouette. That doesn’t make it any less impressive as a flying machine as this latest picture released by the U.S. Air Force ( USAF ) clearly shows.What you’re looking at is the underside of a B-2 as it does a low approach flight over the RAF Fairford in the United Kingdom back in August. The plane is deployed with the 509th Bomb Wing and was conducting a flight during a training mission over Europe and Africa.The image shows every single one of the many edges of the aircraft but it reveals nothing really of the thing’s inner workings. And that’s exactly how the Air Force likes it.The flying machine was introduced by what is now Northrop Grumman back in 1997 as a heavy strategic bomber. That’s something America already had in its arsenal but unlike anything that came before it the B-2 was special. Or should we say invisible.The shape of the aircraft along with the materials and even the paint use on the body all contribute to making it virtually invisible to enemy radar and other anti-aircraft defenses. Because it can fly at altitudes that can reach 50000 feet (15200 meters) it is also virtually invisible to the naked eye as well.That allows the B-2 to sneak behind enemy lines traveling at speeds of close to Mach 1 and if need be drop anything from conventional bombs to nuclear ones. Luckily even if it was deployed on the aerial battlefields of the world (Kosovo Afghanistan Iraq) the plane did not launch its deadliest cargo to date."

The ruling by Circuit Judge Layne Smith was a victory for Gov. Ron DeSantis who has led efforts to prevent businesses from requiring customers to show proof they are vaccinated against COVID-19 --- an issue that has become known as requiring vaccine passports.

Smith also split from a South Florida federal judge who sided in August with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings in a challenge to the state law. In both cases the plaintiffs argued that the law was an unconstitutional restriction on speech.

But Smith in a six-page decision Thursday rejected the First Amendment arguments of Bead Abode a Sarasota hobby and craft store and refused to issue an injunction against the law. Smith said the basic issue in the case is whether the law restricts speech or regulates conduct.

""The only issue before the court and the only one the court decided is whether (the law) abridges Bead Abode's First Amendment right to freedom of speech"" Smith wrote. ""It does not. Instead the statute regulates the plaintiff's conduct.""

Smith who was appointed as a circuit judge by DeSantis after serving as a county judge also pointed to the Legislature's authority and said the law ""assures open markets.""

""Prohibiting businesses from requiring patrons to produce documentary proof of vaccination or recovery may or may not be a good idea"" he wrote. ""Notwithstanding that decision belongs solely to the Legislature and is subject to approval or rejection by the voters at the ballot box.""

The Republican-dominated Legislature passed the law in April with the state threatening fines against businesses that violate it. Bead Abode has closed its doors since early in the pandemic though it sells products online and offers online classes.

Bead Abode developed a plan to reopen but wanted to require customers --- many of whom are seniors --- to show proof of vaccination to help prevent the spread of the virus.

""Absent the relief being sought to enjoin defendant (the state) from enforcement of this clearly unconstitutional content-based restriction on protected speech Bead Abode would be forced to choose between its commitment to the safety of its customers and crushing penalties from enforcement of this law"" attorney Andrew Boyer whose wife Kirsten owns the store wrote in the lawsuit.

In the ruling Smith wrote that he has ""great respect"" for U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams who sided with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings in the federal lawsuit but added ""this court must review the law and make its own decision.""

Williams' August decision applied only to Norwegian. In it she wrote that the law is a ""content-based restriction"" on speech as it targets documentation but allows businesses to request other information from customers about issues such as vaccinations.

""While companies cannot require customers to verify their vaccination status with 'documentation' the statute does not prohibit businesses from verifying vaccination status in other ways (e.g. orally)"" wrote Williams who was nominated to the bench by former President Barack Obama. ""Accordingly under (the law) businesses could still 'discriminate' against unvaccinated individuals by adopting a vaccination requirement which they could enforce by requiring oral verification of vaccination status before entry or by deterring unvaccinated patrons from entering by putting up signs that read 'vaccinated customers only' and 'unvaccinated patrons are not allowed.'""

The state has appealed Williams' decision to the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

As such Deathloop is one of those games that support both NVIDIA’s DLSS and AMD’s FSR techs. So we’ve decided to benchmark and compare these two upscaling techniques.

For these benchmarks we used an Intel i9 9900K with 16GB of DDR4 at 3600Mhz and NVIDIA’s RTX 3080. We also used Windows 10 64-bit and the GeForce 496.13 driver.

Below you can find some comparison screenshots between native resolution (left) DLSS (middle) and FSR (right).

As we can clearly see NVIDIA DLSS does a better job than AMD FSR. After all the game looks just as good as native 4K resolution when using NVIDIA DLSS in Quality Mode. On the other hand and even in Ultra Quality AMD FSR looks noticeably blurrier.

Not only does DLSS looks better but it also runs faster than FSR. On our RTX3080 we saw a 10fps performance boost when using DLSS over FSR. This is one of the best implementations of DLSS and we highly recommend using it.

All in all NVIDIA’s DLSS is wonderfully implemented in Deathloop. Thus and if you own an RTX GPU we strongly recommend enabling it. By using NVIDIA DLSS Quality Mode we were able to run the game with constant 60fps in 4K/Ultra/Ray Tracing. And while AMD FSR was also able to provide a constant 60fps experience the image quality with DLSS is miles better than what FSR is currently offering.

Lastly It would be really cool if more games supported both DLSS and FSR. I know this is me daydreaming but all games (whether or not they are AMD/NVIDIA-sponsored) should support both of them. Thus owners of RTX GPUs can choose the best option whereas owners of AMD’s GPUs (and older NVIDIA GTX GPUs) can simply use FSR in order to improve their performance (especially in ray-traced games).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3ZWFrdG93bi5jb20vbmV3cy84MjE0NC9iYWxkdXJzLWdhdGUtMy1nZXRzLWNyYXp5LWh1Z2UtODgtcGVyZi1ib29zdC1hdC00ay13aXRoLW52aWRpYS1kbHNzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Baldur's Gate 3 gets crazy huge 88% perf boost at 4K with NVIDIA DLSS,"Baldur's Gate 3 gets both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR tech: DLSS allows GeForce RTX 3060 Ti to run at 4K 60FPS 110FPS for RTX 3080 Ti.

NVIDIA doesn't stop work on expanding game support for its DLSS technology with Baldur's Gate 3 receiving a DLSS update and some very impressive performance improvements.

Baldur's Gate 3 can run at an impressive 4K 60FPS on the more mid-range GeForce RTX 3060 Ti graphics card and an even more impressive 110FPS+ average on the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. Without DLSS we're looking at 4K 34FPS average on the RTX 3060 Ti and just 54FPS average on the RTX 3080 Ti.

Popular Now: Scientists use supercomputer to find out when humanity will perish

This isn't the only new game to get DLSS support with NVIDIA pushing DLSS into Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider as well as DEATHLOOP Alan Wake: Remasterted the Crysis Remastered Trilogy and more. DLSS not only improves performance but for older games where pushing 120FPS+ is easy you can switch to Quality Mode on DLSS and enjoy a better-looking game and more performance.

I'll be re-running Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider through their new DLSS upgrades as soon as the updates go live. It'll be interesting to see performance across the board on other resolutions and graphics cards too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYmVlYm9tLmNvbS9udmlkaWEtdmlydHVhbC1vYnN0YWNsZS1jb3Vyc2UtdHJhaW4tNDAwMC1yb2JvdC1kb2dzL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vYmVlYm9tLmNvbS9udmlkaWEtdmlydHVhbC1vYnN0YWNsZS1jb3Vyc2UtdHJhaW4tNDAwMC1yb2JvdC1kb2dzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia Develops Virtual Obstacle Course to Train 4000 Robot Dogs to Walk in Minutes,"While humanoid robots are becoming common in today’s world quadruped robot dogs are taking over the operational sector for various businesses around the globe. Witnessing this demand we have seen several companies like Boston Dynamics and Xiaomi come up with advanced robotic dogs that can perform heavy-duty tasks with ease. Now ETH Zurich researchers have collaborated with popular GPU maker Nvidia to develop an advanced algorithm – to help train real-world robot dogs to walk and run on stable and unstable terrains.

Researchers from ETH Zurich in Switzerland have partnered with Nvidia to create an obstacle course for a virtual army of robot dogs. The virtual simulation is used to train real-world robotic quadrupeds to walk on complex terrains like slopes stairs and steep drops.

The four-legged machines in the simulation are referred to as “ANYmals” and look like thousands of ants wriggling aimlessly in a virtual field. The researchers used 4000 virtual robots to create the simulation that you can check out right below.

The simulations created to train the robots ran on specialized AI-based chipsets designed by Nvidia. As a result of these advanced chips the researchers say they were able to train the robots in less than one-hundredth the time that is generally required to train them using general-purpose chips used in computers and servers.

Now although Nvidia’s special chips are pretty good at calculating graphics rendering and running neural networks they are not very good at simulating physics-based properties such as climbing and sliding. However the researchers came up with some clever software-based workarounds “to get it right” as per Nvidia’s VP of Simulation Technology Rev Lebaredian.

Following the creation of the complex simulation using massively parallel deep reinforcement learning the researchers used it to train the legs of real-world robots. This enabled the robots to learn to walk on slopes stairs and other complex terrains in minutes. Moreover each time a robot dog learned to tackle challenging terrain the researchers gave a more difficult terrain challenge to make the control algorithm more advanced.

So the ETH researchers and Nvidia think that the “ANYmals” simulation can be a great tool for training real-world robot dogs in lesser time using reinforcement learning. You can check out the official research paper on it via the corresponding link to know more about the complex algorithm and the virtual obstacle course."

At the 2021 race at the Daytona road course Joe Gibbs Racing and Interstate Batteries celebrated a 30-year partnership. Apparently the company was one of the Joe Gibbs Racing team’s founding partners. So to honor the link up Busch ran the striking green livery at Daytona.

Sadly the two-time Cup Series champion could only muster 35th after a wretched day behind the wheel. On that day he ran wide onto the grass and wrecked the front fender of his car. As a result he lost a chunk of momentum and dropped down the order like a stone. From there he had a horribly difficult time trying to recover and never quite managed to make his way up the pack.

The shooting happened on Oct. 14 near 83rd and Olive Avenues police said. According to a statement released by Peoria Police the same afternoon officers responded to a report of a shooting in the area at around 9:15 a.m. after a man called police and said he accidentally shot his friend in his apartment.

When officers arrived on scene they found 18-year-old Roy Atkins with a gunshot wound. That man was taken to the hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

""Upon our detective’s initial investigation the discharge of the gun appears to be accidental"" read a portion of the statement. ""Based on statements made the caller along with three other friends were in the apartment. He was cleaning his gun and at some point during the manipulation of the gun a bullet was discharged which struck the male in the chest.""

The gun involved in the incident according to police has been recovered and an investigation is ongoing.

Family members are heartbroken.

""[I] watched him grow into a wonderful young man - smiles just ear to ear"" said Neil Stevens Atkins' uncle. ""He had a lot going on for himself. He had a scholarship for track and field and it's tragic that he's been taken away from us.""

The family held a car wash at O'Reilly's Auto Parts on 83rd Avenue and Indian School Road on Oct. 17. to help pay for funeral costs.

For the second time this season the No. 14 UVA field hockey team built a 1-0 lead against No. 18 Old Dominion. And for the second time this season the Monarchs scored two goals in the second half to steal the victory from the Hoos.

Laura Janssen scored a goal to put the Cavaliers up in the first half but ODU’s Alix Marien scored twice after halftime to lead the Monarchs to a 2-1 victory over Virginia on Sunday afternoon in Norfolk.

Virginia had more shots (9-7) and penalty corners (5-3) than ODU but shots on goal were 5-4 in favor of the Monarchs.

After a first quarter devoid of any offensive opportunities for either team UVA struck first on a goal by Laura Janssen with just over five minutes left in the first half. The Cavalier attack got the ball in front of the ODU and it was stuck there for an extended stretch of time as several players on both sides fought for possession. The ball eventually got loose and Janssen opportunistically shot it into the back of the cage for her second goal of the season.

Virginia defended ODU well in the first half holding the Monarchs scoreless. UVA goalkeeper Tyler Kennedy made three saves each of which came in the second quarter.

UVA outshot ODU 6-2 in the third quarter but it was the Monarchs who cashed in on their offensive chances and tied the game.

Just two and a half minutes into the third quarter ODU’s Alix Marien scored an unassisted goal on a fast break to even the score at one apiece.

A little over three minutes into the fourth quarter Marien scored again on a penalty corner to give the Monarchs the lead.

ODU’s defense tightened up in the fourth quarter and the Cavaliers did not even manage a shot.

With the loss Virginia falls to 7-6 on the season. The Hoos return home to face William & Mary on Wednesday at 3pm.

NORFOLK Va - In a decision he kept a secret until minutes before gametime Old Dominion football Coach Ricky Rahne started redshirt freshman Hayden Wolff at quarterback Saturday in place of D.J. Mack Jr. who started the Monarchs' six previous games.



And while Wolff threw well especially in the second half the Monarchs buried themselves with a series of early mistakes and fell to Western Kentucky 43-20 before a homecoming crowd of 16418 at S.B. Ballard Stadium.



It was the fourth consecutive loss for the Monarchs (1-6 0-3 Conference USA) who lost the previous three in heartbreaking fashion.



This game was still in doubt midway through the fourth quarter as the Monarchs staged a late comeback that trimmed WKU's lead to 13. But ODU could not overcome its poor start.



ODU essentially committed three first-half turnovers – if you include a pass intercepted by a Monarch defender and fumbled into the hands of a WKU receiver – and found themselves trailing 30-3 at halftime.



Wolff had two interceptions – the second in the waning moments when a storm whipped around S.B. Ballard Stadium with wind and rain – but had the best passing performance for the Monarchs since 2019. He completed 26 of 41 passes for 327 yards – it was the first time ODU passed for more than 300 yards since 2019 when he passed for 321 yards at Middle Tennessee.



Zappe one of the nation's most potent passers completed 37 of 54 passes for 397 yards and five touchdowns.



ODU wide receiver Ali Jennings III the transfer from West Virginia also had his best game of the season hauling in 13 passes for 172 yards. He fell one catch short of tying the school record for pass receptions in a game.



Rahne said that for the foreseeable future Wolff is ODU's starter which is much the same thing he said when Mack was announced as the starter for the Monarchs' opener at Wake Forest. In both instances he said he doesn't want his quarterback looking over his shoulder.



""Hayden has been practicing very well and I thought he gave us a better chance to win this game and win into the future"" Rahne said.



""I'm not a guy who wants to flip flop on quarterbacks. Hayden is our starter. He did some very good things. And when I say the future I don't mean next year. I mean this game Louisiana Tech (ODU's next opponent on Oct. 30) and this season.



""I've never been one of those coaches who's going to play a guy who's going to help us in anything other than this season.""



ODU's defense faced a mammoth task in trying to stop WKU (2-4 1-1) the nation's fifth-highest scoring offense. The Hilltoppers averaged 40.4 points and 550.4 yards per game and it didn't help that Wolff was intercepted and fumbled in the first half.



Nor did it help with just over 10 minutes into the first half and with WKU leading 7-0 when Zappe fired a pass into the end zone that appeared to be picked off by safety R'Tarriun Johnson then fumbled into the hands of WKU's Dakota Thomas.



The interception would not have counted as the Monarchs were penalized on the play.



Johnson came up with two big plays in the second half that blunted two drives that appeared headed for touchdowns and sparked ODU's rally.



With a first and goal at the ODU 1 WKU failed to score on two runs so Zappe rolled to his right and fired a pass that Johnson picked off. On WKU's next series the Hilltoppers had a first and goal at the 4 after a 64-yard punt return by DeAngelo Wilson in which he tripped just before he got to the end zone.



Johnson had a pass breakup that helped force WKU to settle for a field goal.



""I thought that sequence of events that I was maybe the most proud of a football team than I've been associated with in a long time"" Rahne said.



""We at least made him stumble (on the punt return) and our guys kept fighting and fighting and fighting. Our guys are to the point where they see as long as they keep fighting good things will happen.""



Good things did happen. ODU scored touchdowns on back-to-back drives that trimmed the WKU lead to 33-20.



Wolff completed five passes including three to Jennings on a eight-play 79-yard touchdown drive capped off by a 24-yard Elijah Davis touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter.



After the defense held WKU on downs the Monarchs then drove 78 yards in eight plays that Blake Watson finished off with a 7-yard run with 10:17 left that trimmed the lead to 33-20. But needing a defensive stop ODU couldn't quite git it. WKU drove just long and deep enough to set up a 41-yard Brayden Narveson field goal with 5:41 left that made the score 36-20. ODU turned the ball over on downs on the ensuing drive that put the game out of reach.



Wolff had not started a game in two years and he said it showed.



""There's a lot of room for improvement"" he said. ""There were a bunch of base plays in which I may have overlooked some things.



""Overall I kind of settled into the game as the game went on. You know that happens. It was my first start in two years. I've got to do a better job of executing the base offense and doing what the coaches ask of me.""

Chanel has awarded its global media-buying account to Omnicom after a competitive pitch ending its relationship with WPP after close to 20 years.

The Paris-based luxury fashion group is known for handling its creative in-house with a $1.77bn (£1.3bn) annual budget for “brand support activities” before the pandemic.

It is thought the US’s Omnicom and Britain’s WPP were the main contenders in the battle for the French brand’s media account and that the winning Omnicom Media Group solution sits within PHD.

Chanel said in a statement: “After a competitive pitch over several months we confirm that we have appointed Omnicom as our new global media agency from January 2022.

“We were particularly impressed by their strategic approach understanding of the brand and ability to organise around our requirements.

“We wish to thank WPP for their valued counsel over the past two decades supporting our growth.”

Campaign first reported Chanel was launching the media review in June with MediaSense the London-based pitch consultants advising on the pitch.

The French fashion house last reviewed media in 2013 when WPP created a specialist shop Plus that drew on resources primarily from Mindshare as well as MEC now known as Wavemaker plus Ogilvy and AKQA.

Chanel which was founded in 1910 and is controlled by the Wertheimer family is known for its careful decision-making but has talked about investing in technology and digital initiatives as the fashion market has rapidly evolved.

Annual results in June showed that it cut its spend on brand support activities by 23% to $1.36bn in 2020 – a steeper decline than its 18% drop in annual revenues to $10.1bn during the pandemic.

However Philippe Blondiaux the global chief financial officer pointed out: “Chanel’s focus on creativity and innovation unique savoir faire and the agility of our teams and our organisation helped to limit the impact of the crisis.

“At the same time Chanel has continued to prioritise investment to support the long-term health of the brand with record levels of capital expenditure through the year.”

Expenditure focused on offering “the best customer experience to clients” including the construction of a five-storey showcase venue in Paris 19M where 600 artisans work together the acquisition of its flagship store in New Bond Street in London and the “complete reconstruction” of its fashion and watches and fine jewellery boutique in Beverly Hills.

“Technology-related investments also remained a key focus in 2020 including the strengthening of its infrastructure as well as the development of digital initiatives to support the client experience” the company said.

Just over half of Chanel’s revenues come from Asia-Pacific close to 30% from Europe and nearly 20% from the Americas.

The launch which took place on Friday 15th of October 2021 at the Mauve 21 event center Challenge road Ibadan had in attendance crème-de-la crème in the advertising industry current and past students of the academy that are doing great in their respective fields and many other influential people in the city of Ibadan.

Speaking on the rationale behind citing the branch of the academy in the city of Ibadan the provost 02 Academy Mr. Ozone Mbanefo said the city has the highest number of people aside Lagos who register for the school. According to him ‘’We found out from our book that the highest number of people who register outside of Lagos from the neighboring state which is South Western states are from this town. 85% of people who come to 02 Academy from the neighboring states are from Ibadan and it is simply right for us to bring that thing that is getting them to come down to Lagos down to their feet and that is why we are here.”

The provost added that the 02 Experience notably attached to the Lagos head office because of the hands-on experience of practical advertising projects is going to be the same. ‘The thing is that we are talking about oxygen and anywhere you have oxygen it is the same experience you are going to get because we are a people-centric brand and not customer-centric as a brand and any brand that is people-centric is always eager and ready to solve people’s problems not just serve people but getting to the core of the things that matter to them and so it is going to be the same experience’.

The guest speakers at the event include; Sam Osunsoko CEO Cognito Lagos; Sherif Adekoya CEO Edge Forth Digital and Chamberlain Ukenedo Associate Creative Director Nitro 121.

Among the alumni of 02 Academy who spoke at the event was Mr. Samuel Akintan General Manager 32 FM Ibadan. Mr. Samuel who narrated his journey to 02 Academy and his transition to being a General Manager of a radio station said 02 Academy remains the best platform for anyone to start a career in advertising with the infusion of knowledge relevant in other fields. ‘’Everyone is creative while some can express it others cannot and that is why 02 Academy is here’’ he said.

Also speaking Israel Obatunde a former graphics artist at Nigerian Tribune and current Deputy Creative Director TBWA recounted his experience working as a creative artist before joining 02 Academy. According to him ‘’I was very good at graphics doing nonsense until I got to 02 Academy…’’

For more than a decade 02 Academy has been a training ground for people learning the rudiment of advertising art direction copywriting and digital marketing. The school was recently awarded Outstanding Brand Advertising and Digital Marketing Academy of the Decade by Marketing Edge Magazine. According to Mr. Ozone the academy produces 7 out of 10 millennials and Gen Z in the Nigeria Advertising Industry in Nigeria.",,,,,,,,,

In this stage of the pandemic demand for all kinds of semiconductor chips has exploded and semiconductor fabs are struggling to keep up. Traditional IC customers are now competing with the demands of new compute applications (such as AI and autonomous driving) to get their custom-design wafers fabricated. Unfortunately increasing the wafer capacity of semiconductor fabs to react with new waves of demand is very expensive and challenging. Once a decision is made to increase a fab’s capacity it can take months to purchase new tools install them in the fab and qualify them for production.

In cases like these a better option is to improve the the yield — that is the ratio of “good” die to total die per wafer — to get more chips out of existing capacity. Increasing the yield also directly increases fab profit margins with even small enhancements in yield driving massive profits — so let’s just increase the die yield! Easier said than done.

Before the rise of data science in the semiconductor industry device engineers would methodically hunt through available data searching for any clues or correlations to the yield. As humans we like problems where a result can be attributed to a single factor. We’d love to have a strong correlation with yield and one specific process parameter — be that a film deposition rate an etch rate a lithography dimension tolerance or any number of 1000s of process parameters. Unfortunately this is almost never the case. The processes used to make modern semiconductor chips compound on one-another constantly.

New breed of device and yield engineer is needed to work with ever increasing process complexity and volumes of metrology data— a deep understanding of device physics and fab processes must be combined with a data science toolbelt to find the true yield triggers.

Variables Overlapping

To help understand the problem consider an Aluminum routing layer. In this simple process we have an Aluminum deposition step lithography for patterning a plasma etch to define the features followed by cleans. If we were to have a simple yield failure such as neighboring lines being electrically shorting the two most likely candidates would be that the Aluminum was deposited thicker than expected (preventing the etch from fully separating the lines) or the rate of the etch was slower than expected. However in most process controlled fabs the most often answer is that both processes were within the bounds of the statistical process control (SPC) system and are therefore operating within the acceptable range. So what gives? In this case the confluence of the deposition being a little thicker than normal and the etch being a little slower than normal can be a yield killer. Extracting which combination of variables contribute to failure is a problem perfectly set up for machine learning. We’re actually pretty lucky if our problem is as simple as this Aluminum routing case — it usually gets much worse.

Consider a new IC design running on an advanced-node (16nm or less) process. Physical failures like electrical shorts or electrical opens are simple. However devices can fail to yield because the circuit timing path prevents the chip from performing it’s desired function. Maybe the turn-on voltage of the transistors is off target? Maybe the junction capacitance is high increasing the RC product and introducing delay? In a semiconductor process flow containing hundreds of process steps how would we go about finding the root cause?

Plan of attack

The benefit of a data science approach is the ability to evaluate the impacts of many variables simultaneously. In this case we can incorporate four main types of variables:

Inline metrology : physical measurements made upon the wafers as they processes including things like film thicknesses and densities lithographic size accuracy and alignment contaminant particle defects and many others.

: physical measurements made upon the wafers as they processes including things like film thicknesses and densities lithographic size accuracy and alignment contaminant particle defects and many others. End-of-line electrical test : Data from the discrete scribeline devices (devices printed in the streets between die) tested at end-of-line prior to dicing. The individual devices in the scribe are designed to tease out certain process dependencies and offer unique process insights (like Kelvin contact resistors).

The individual devices in the scribe are designed to tease out certain process dependencies and offer unique process insights (like Kelvin contact resistors). Tool process qualification runs : Tools regularly run a set process (identical to or very similar to the production process) on test wafers that can be directly measured. The results such as deposition rates etch rates or non-uniformity are tracked in a statistical process control (SPC) system and have associated date stamps.

: Tools regularly run a set process (identical to or very similar to the production process) on test wafers that can be directly measured. The results such as deposition rates etch rates or non-uniformity are tracked in a statistical process control (SPC) system and have associated date stamps. Product circuit performance: Depending on the chip and types of test equipment needed to interrogate it the product die are tested at end-of-line (before dicing) after dicing or post-packaging. Regardless this performance or yield is what we’re trying to optimize as our dependent variable. This can either be on a pass/fail criteria (classification) performance binning (also classification) or raw performance (regression).

Using all four variable types together gives the engineer significant capability in taking the outcome (measured performance) and drilling down to the physical root cause empowering engineers to directly impact yield through process tool adjustments.

Excursion versus Optimization

Where to go next really depends on what our main goals are. Did a given wafer or lot dramatically decrease in die yield? In that case we know that whatever happened happened on a wafer level. As we play detective this drastically simplifies our data preparation process. Here we’re looking for wafer-level shifts in variables meaning we can probably average values from all four variables types by wafer and still find the smoking gun. A simple check using functions like varImp() in Caret (R) or feature_importances_ in Scikit-learn (Python) can quickly give insights to which variables have direct impacts on yield.

Instead if we have a fairly stable process but on each wafer only 70% of the die are functional (or high enough performance to be sell-able) we have an opportunity to optimize. At a high level are the failed die randomly spread across the wafer or are they all grouped in one physical region of the wafer? This alone can tell us if the failures are defect-based (such as a particle landing on the wafer mid-process) or process non-uniformity based allowing us to filter many of the potential variables.

It’s important to note that wafer-level processes tend to have unique non-uniformity profiles. Many will be radial but gradient profiles are common and even sombrero-shaped profiles can occur. How these tool process profiles match up with our yield is a fantastic tool. But the human eye can only pick out so much if multiple processes overlay and again it’s data science to the rescue.

Before we get there however we have more data preparation to do for wafer-level yield engineering. While we may have end-of-line scribeline test data and metrology data that associate with each product die finding a similar association with tool-qualification (a.k.a. “qual”) data is tricky as those are often measured on unpatterned wafers with evenly distributed 9 13 or 39-point maps with radial coordinates. For our data we’ll need to map each die to the physically closest measurement which usually includes the following steps:

In our qual data we’ll translate (radius theta) coordinates to (xy) Cartesian coordinates and ensure the data collection date is in a proper datetime format. Populate our product data set with the processing date/time that the lot ran through each process that has associated qual data. For a given lot/wafer we’ll iterate over our qual data to filter down to the run with the closest possible date and find the measurement nearest to the product die coordinates.

Once our data is combined in this fashion we have a very content-rich variable data set and we can automate the process of looking for simple 1:1 correlations between any variable and our dependent variable (product die performance). However to really get down to the interlinking of our variables we’ll need to dive into creating machine learning models.

Modelling

In this step the goal isn’t to create the highest accuracy model — the goal is to create a model that does a reasonable job of predicting yield but is also easily interpreted by the yield engineer. Here we’ll want to stick to algorithms like Decision trees Linear/logistic regression Lasso regression or Naive Bayes. Once we find an appropriate algorithm we can dive into the visualizations to learn how our model “thinks” and drive actions in the fab to improve yield.

Predictive Yield

The next big leap comes from the predictive power of data science. What if we could to predict wafer yield before it even finishes processing? This kind of information could drive stakeholders to make important lot decisions such as:

Triggering a rework process (recovering and repeating a certain step)

Provide a milestone report to customers that a lot is in good health

Scrapping a lot to cut losses and prevent future tool time on a “dead” lot

Starting a “make-up” lot to replace a low-yielding lot to minimize the delivery delay to the customer.

Unlike in the yield improvement steps here we’re looking to have the most accurate model possible. Interpretability is a distant “nice-to have” so we are able to explore a much broader range of models. Once we have a model selected we can also use tools like Variable Importance and Recursive Feature Elimination to see what data is really driving our yield detectability. With that data in hand we can go as far as eliminating some existing metrology data collection to further reduce costs and process cycle times.

With a good enough model we can also do virtual process windowing — we can alter the acceptable SPC range for a process to see how broadening or tightening control limits can impact yield. Done iteratively the control limits for every process in the fab can be directly tied to wafer yield. This impacts how preventative maintenance is performed how new tools are introduced to the line and even the frequency of qual procedures — all of which impact fab costs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzE4L2ludGVsLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItY2hpcHMtbmF0aW9uYWwtc2VjdXJpdHnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel pressures U.S. government to help subsidize chip manufacturing,"Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is putting the pressure on the U.S. government to help subsidize chip manufacturing insisting the current reliance on plants in Taiwan and Korea as ""geopolitically unstable."" Why it matters: There is bipartisan support for funding the domestic semiconductor industry but Congress has yet to sign the check. The Senate has passed the CHIPS Act that includes $52 billion in semiconductor investment but it has yet to pass the House.

""If the world becomes dependent on one location that's not politically stable right"" Gelsinger told ""Axios on HBO.""

""It also isn't practical. God decided where the oil reserves are. We can decide where the fabs are.""

The big picture: While many companies design chips in the United States (including rivals Qualcomm AMD and Nvidia) most companies rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or Korea's Samsung to manufacture their leading-edge chips.

Between the lines: Not that many years ago the U.S. accounted for more than one-third of all semiconductor manufacturing but only 12% are made here today. Production cost was a big factor in that shift as other countries in Asia invested to build up their own chip industries.

""We can't be 30% or 40% more expensive than Asia"" Gelsinger said in an argument clearly aimed at Congress. ""So help us close that gap so that we can build bigger and faster on U.S. soil.""

Gelsinger stopped short of saying that Intel can't afford its manufacturing effort without U.S. government money but did say it can go bigger and faster with that funding.

""We're investing $20 billion in capital this year. So we are gonna be spending our cash flows to build labs and fabs"" Gelsinger said. ""But we also-- are looking for and-- seeking subsidies-- and support from governments.""

Gelsinger positioned it as a matter of the U.S. controlling its digital future. ""Name anything that's more important than that to our nation.""

Yes but: Even $52 billion is just a down payment on what will be needed over the next several years for Intel and the U.S. to catch up. ""I believe there will need to be a CHIPS Act 2 maybe a CHIPS Act 3 to fully realize this moonshot"" Gelsinger said.

As the world grapples with an ongoing chip shortage a quiet giant among chipmakers has committed to investing $100 billion over three years to ramp up production. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company may not be a household name but with a market value of over $550 billion it's one of the world's 10 most valuable companies. Now it's leveraging its considerable resources to bring the world's most advanced chip manufacturing back to U.S. soil. CNBC got an exclusive tour of the $12 billion fabrication plant or fab in Phoenix Arizona where TSMC will start making 5-nanometer chips in 2024. The company says it will produce 20000 wafers each month. ""These are parts that are going to be used in lots of different places: CPUs GPUs IPUs etc. They'll be used in smartphones"" Rick Cassidy told CNBC. Cassidy is TSMC's chief strategy officer and the president and CEO of TSMC's project in Arizona. TSMC makes key components for everything from cellphones to F-35 fighter jets to NASA's Perseverance Rover mission to Mars. Earlier this month it announced plans for a new factory in Japan where it will produce chips with older technologies for things like household devices and certain car components. TSMC is also Apple 's exclusive provider of the most advanced chips inside every iPhone currently on the market and most Mac computers. ""But they remain sort of in the background in terms of end markets. So Apple gets all the accolades when a new phone comes out"" said Joanne Itow managing director of manufacturing at Semico Research. ""We're low-key. We let our products speak for themselves. Their success brings all the business that we could ever hope for"" Cassidy said. The U.S. was the birthplace of advanced silicon but for decades now it's been losing market share to Asia where 79% of the world's chip production happened in 2020 according to industry association SEMI. It calculated the U.S. was responsible for 12% of worldwide chip manufacturing last year down from 37% in 1990.

TSMC's $12 billion 5-nanometer chip fabrication plant is six months into being built in northern Phoenix Arizona on September 28 2021. TSMC

TSMC alone was responsible for 24% of the world's semiconductor output in 2020 up from 21% in 2019 according to the company. When it comes to the most advanced chips used in the latest iPhones supercomputers and automotive AI TSMC is responsible for 92% of production while Samsung is responsible for the other 8% according to research group Capital Economics. ""It's become almost a monopoly at the leading edge and all of those manufacturing operations for the most part are out of Taiwan Hsinchu. That becomes a matter of national importance for the United States but not only the United States but the Western world"" said Christopher Rolland Susquehanna's senior semiconductor analyst. Along with cutting edge 3- and 5-nanometer chips TSMC also makes larger chips for products such as electric toothbrushes and coffeemakers. Cars often use less-advanced 28- to 40-nanometer chips. All types of chips have been impacted by the shortage. Carmakers including GM and Toyota have paused production at some plants. And Apple is likely to slash its 2021 production targets for the iPhone 13 with orders for some models delayed by more than a month.

World's first pure-play foundry

When Morris Chang first proposed the idea for TSMC in the 1980s investors were skeptical. Born in China and educated at Harvard MIT and Stanford Chang moved to Taiwan after 25 years at Texas Instruments . There the government asked him to create a Taiwanese semiconductor company that would become a world leader. His idea: Focus only on manufacturing — what's now known as a pure-play foundry. ""When you're just focused on one thing you do one thing really well"" said Cassidy who joined TSMC 23 years ago after what he describes as a fascinating hourslong meeting with Chang. Chang bet big on a need that didn't exist yet. When he founded TSMC in 1987 giants such as Intel and Texas Instruments took pride in designing and making their own chips. A legendary saying in the industry back then was ""Real men have fabs."" ""When Morris went out to get funding he went to many named companies that you know and they told them 'Morris your idea won't get off the ground. If you get it off the ground it can't scale.'"" But as chips got more complex manufacturing them became an enormous undertaking. Analysts say building a fab today takes at least two years and $10 billion. It's become nearly impossible for even the biggest chip companies — Intel  Nvidia  Broadcom  Qualcomm  AMD — to do it all and keep up with the most advanced tech. Intel for example still designs and makes its own chips but it's fallen behind Samsung and TSMC in recent years and now relies on TSMC to make some of its chips. ""If you were a smart designer you didn't have to have billions of dollars and a fab behind you for the first time with the emergence of TSM"" Rolland said. Now each major step of chipmaking is often handled by a separate company. Some such as Arm and MIPS focus on IP and architecture providing the core building blocks to design chips. Then there's electronic design automation companies such as Cadence and Synopsys that write the software used to design chips. Only one company ASML  makes the $180 million extreme ultraviolet light machines required to etch designs into the most advanced chips. Then there are the wildly successful fabless companies designing the chips such as Apple  Qualcomm Nvidia and many more.

As these fabless companies took off TSMC found itself on a flywheel making more and more of the world's chips. ""This has allowed [TSMC] to not only catch up but in my opinion surpass Intel to become the world's greatest manufacturing technology on the planet"" Rolland said ""one of the top 10 most valuable companies in terms of market cap in the globe."" TSMC was first listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in 1994 and in 1997 it became the first Taiwan-based company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. By the 2000s it had caught up with the 20 or so other companies making the most advanced chips at the time. As the tech kept advancing more and more companies fell behind. Today only two manufacturers remain that can make the most advanced 5-nanometer chips: TSMC and Samsung. In 2013 Apple started relying on TSMC to make its A-series chips for the iPhone as it moved away from reliance on Samsung a direct competitor in mobile phones. Today there's a TSMC chip inside every iPhone on the market. And Apple has moved away from Intel too now relying on TSMC to make the chips inside most Macs. In 2018 at age 86 Chang retired as chairman of TSMC. His radical pure-play foundry idea continues to pay off. With the opening of a new fab in Taiwan next year TSMC is in a race with Samsung to make the world's first 3-nanometer chips — with Intel planning to get there by 2025.

Bringing 5-nanometer to the U.S.

Right now no fab in the U.S. can make 5-nanometer chips. But TSMC is changing that. ""If you want more capacity you have to build more fabs. And that's one of the reasons that we're moving to the U.S."" Cassidy said. ""Our customers want us in the U.S. The U.S. government wants us here."" TSMC Technical Director Tony Chen took CNBC on a tour of the site where a four-story 2.3-million-square-foot fab is being erected. Chen has led 17 other fab construction projects in his 23 years with TSMC. ""This project is designed as a 5-nanometer fab. Actually it's a copy from the fab we have in Taiwan"" Chen said. Nearby one of the world's largest cranes was being lifted to its full height of 200 feet. The 2300-ton crane was brought to the site on 153 semitrucks. Site supervisor Jim White said contractors have moved nearly 4 million cubic yards of dirt and have used more than 260 million gallons of water since construction began in April. Building a fab and making chips takes an incredible amount of water not an abundant resource in the middle of the desert. Arizona's biggest water source is groundwater but deep wells at big farms are using water up faster than it's naturally replenished. Chen said TSMC needs around 4.7 million gallons of water each day to support production. TSMC is no stranger to water shortages. Taiwan is facing its worst drought in 56 years something that TSMC said has not impacted production. In Arizona TSMC said an on-site water treatment center will recycle up to 90% of water used at the fab. ""And then ultimately that water will be reinjected into the aquifer in partnership with the city of Phoenix after reverse osmosis and other technology solutions are provided"" said Chris Camacho president and CEO of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council. He helped negotiate the deal that brought the project to Arizona. Another challenge is that most 5-nanometer specialists are based in Asia. To solve this TSMC's academic relations manager Roxanna Vega said the company is bringing over some of its top experts from Taiwan. ""They're seen as subject matter experts on what they do in our fabs over there"" Vega said. ""It'll be a temporary assignment ... two maybe three years."" TSMC said it's already sent more than 250 new U.S. hires to Taiwan for 12 to 18 months to get up to speed. ""The opportunity to train in our 5-nanometer gigafab in Taiwan is to kind of give them that insight of how immense and how state of the art the tools machinery and everything is going to be here in Arizona"" Vega said. Diversification is a key reason for TSMC to bring advanced manufacturing to the U.S. ""Taiwan is not very good when it comes to analog semiconductor design and by moving to the United States you'd be able to tap into a much larger number of analog designers"" Rolland said.

Samsung was the leading vendor with a 23% share. Xiaomi lost the 2nd place it had gained earlier this year after Apple grabbed it thanks to strong demand for the iPhone 13.

As a result the Chinese smartphone giant currently stands at 3rd with a market share of 14%. The 4th and 5th rankings are currently held by vivo and OPPO currently both with a 10% share each (via: Canalys).

Ben Stanton Canalys Principal Analyst remarks that the chipset famine has truly arrived: “The smartphone industry is striving to maximize production of devices as best it can. On the supply side chipset manufacturers are increasing prices to disincentivize over-ordering in an attempt to close the gap between demand and supply.”

However the chip shortage will likely be continuing well into 2022 despite the measures. This combined with high global freight costs will be pushing the device retail pricing even higher.

Along with this the chip shortage is also prompting last-minute changes with regard to device specification and order quantities from the smartphone vendor end. This is critical for them since they have to select from the existing pool of available components.

Unfortunately though it leads to confusion and inefficiency when communicating with retail and distributor channels continued Stanton. Many channels are nervous heading into important sales holidays such as Singles’ Day in China and Black Friday in the west.

Smartphone channel supplies are already low and as more customers anticipate similar sales cycles the oncoming surge of demand will be impossible to meet. Customers might expect less aggressive smartphone discounts this year. Smartphone firms with tight margins on the other hand should consider bundling other devices such as wearables and IoT to provide strong incentives for customers.

What to know what's driving the stock market into the stratosphere? US Deficit Spending! (actually twin deficits including Trade).

Here's the Dow divided by the annual US budget deficit. Usually the lower the reading the better the prospects for the stock market because the stocks are being fuelled by rampant money printing deficit spending that is being monetized by he central bank on an epic scale/

No this does not mean we are about to go off to the races as deficits given the huge expansion in the budget deficit has sent the multiple towards bear market lows because we are not in a bear market instead we are on the fast track towards the German Weimar republic!

The US government has dug itself into a hole that it cannot recover from. Why? Because most of the spending that's going on is for consumption and NOT investment or a one off such as for a war so it CANNOT STOP without triggering severe economic contraction!

What's the price for rampant money printing.

INFLATION!

REAL INFLATON and not the BS statistics that the likes of the Fed and Bank of England vomit every month fake inflation statistics watered down over decades to hide the stealth theft of wealth and purchasing power of wages and savings..

I have been calculating my my own inflation measure for the UK for a couple of decades now which computes to the UK inflation rate currently being at about 16% per annum! In fact it has been in a range of 15% to 20% for over a year! Since the lockdown's when people were paid to sit at home and do nothing much productive.

As for the United States shadow stats does a good job of calculating the real rate of inflation which ia based on the US governments own 1980 formable that resolves to 13.5% vs 5.3%.

They’re world’s best malware hoster for about a decade due to O365.""

A British tech researcher who quit working as a security threat analyst with Microsoft a few months back has called on his former employer to act speedily to remove links to ransomware on its Office365 platform.

In a tweet sent on Friday Beaumont said: ""Microsoft cannot advertise themselves as the security leader with 8000 security employees and trillions of signals if they cannot prevent their own Office365 platform being directly used to launch Conti ransomware. OneDrive abuse has been going on for years. Fix it.""

He was responding to a tweet from an infosec professional using the handle TheAnalyst who wrote: ""You all have read how #BazarLoader #BazaLoader leads to #ransomware in particular #conti that doesn't care that they target healthcare etc?

You all have read how #BazarLoader #BazaLoader leads to #ransomware in particular #conti that doesn't care that they target healthcare etc? Does @Microsoft have any responsibility in this when they KNOWINGLY are hosting hundreds of files leading to this now for over three days? https://t.co/UxTDYVIXJF pic.twitter.com/uHUxzHRV8W — TheAnalyst (@ffforward) October 15 2021

""Does @Microsoft have any responsibility in this when they KNOWINGLY are hosting hundreds of files leading to this now for over three days?""

the security firm Palo Alto Networks ""BazarLoader (sometimes referred to as BazaLoader) is malware that provides backdoor access to an infected Windows host. After a client is infected criminals use this backdoor access to send follow-up malware scan the environment and exploit other vulnerable hosts on the network.""

An overwhelming majority of ransomware attacks only Windows with an analysis by staff of the Google-owned VirusTotal database last Thursday showing that 95% of 80 million samples analysed — all the way back to January 2020 — were aimed at Windows.

VirusTotal is a site where security researchers can submit any ransomware they find and have it scanned by anti-virus engines to see if it can be identified.

Beaumont said in another tweet: ""Before the train of MS employees arrive saying ‘just report it’ try getting them and future ones taken down yourselves. I did. It was a disaster.

Check out Microsoft’s average reaction time (to abuse reports). They’re world’s best malware hoster for about a decade due to O365. pic.twitter.com/95Riv0kmDg — Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) October 15 2021

""Check out Microsoft’s average reaction time (to abuse reports). They’re world’s best malware hoster for about a decade due to O365.""

And he added: ""Amusingly MS consume your API and use it to block things on your lists in their security products (I was on the team doing it) but nobody wants to clean up the network. So get screwed non-E5.""

Beaumont who has a well-earned reputation as a researcher who is quick to admit faults in his own industry acknowledged that other technology companies also played a big role in hosting malware.

Quoting a tweet from a Swiss researcher [given below] he said: ""And yes it's not just Microsoft. Tech companies have got to do better.""

Beaumont said: ""There’s somebody in the replies from Microsoft saying when things are detected by Defender they’re automatically taken down in OneDrive.

""That’s categorically not true that functionality isn’t there. Microsoft need to have a long hard look at this problem.""

There you go. Let's see how long it takes for MS to get those 867 malware sites taken down. I'm crossing my fingers ?



For the record the oldest active malware site with an age of 19 months is hosted on Sharepoint and serving GuLoader:



? https://t.co/QGqi21z7JO pic.twitter.com/7FlkaZasP4 — abuse.ch (@abuse_ch) October 16 2021

He said Bazarloader had moved from Google Drive to OneDrive. ""Their content used be taken down from Google Drive almost instantly because we Microsoft reported it to Google. It is still online days later on OneDrive despite being reported because Microsoft is fumbling it. Fix it.""

Asked by Lee Holmes the principal security architect for Azure Security whether he had reported this to Microsoft Beaumont said the Swiss researcher had done so.

""@abuse_ch does when I worked at MS I also reported them but usually they didn’t get actioned"" he responded.

""I had to do things list send to CERT get nowhere send to DSRE get nowhere cc in managers etc. O365 has https://abuse.ch takedowns pending for months.""

Beaumont said Microsoft's attitude towards the presence of malware on its Office365 platform had ""been like that for years"".

""@abuse_ch used to message me O365 misuse while I worked at MS even working there it was a struggle to find people who could remedy issues"" he added.

Had a support case recently where I was trying to request they take down malicious one note. Spent ages trying to tell me how to block an email. ?‍♂️ — Robert Pearman (@titlerequired) October 15 2021

Holmes then defended Microsoft saying: ""I was involved in the abuse reporting pipeline for Azure Storage and can tell you that almost 100% of the Twitter threads calling out malicious content had never reported those URLs to Microsoft. MS does actively seek out malicious URLs as well but no system has 100% visibility.""

To which @abuse_ch responded: ""I have applied for access for their anti abuse API 2y ago never got a response. Managers ask me to fill out forms for reporting abuse (seriously?). There is no way to signal phishing sites to MS SmartScreen. Yes this is 2021!""

Holmes then provided an URL for what he said was access to the API in question and said: ""If that fell into a black hole then let's get that fixed :) There is API access so that you don't have to do anything manually.""

@abuse_ch replied; ""There you go. Let's see how long it takes for MS to get those 867 malware sites taken down. I'm crossing my fingers Crossed fingers. For the record the oldest active malware site with an age of 19 months is hosted on Sharepoint and serving GuLoader"".",,,,,,,,,,,,

Showrunner Eliza Clark and star Amber Tamblyn took to Twitter on Sunday to announce that the adaptation of Brian K. Vaughan’s beloved comics will not return for a second season on FX on Hulu. The news which FX has yet to confirm but sources told THR happened Friday comes after a more than decade-long development process that saw the IP bounce around between studios and filmmakers before landing at FX for development back in 2015.

Clark who took over as showrunner from Michael Green and Aida Croal noted in her lengthy and thoughtful statement that she hopes the series about gender and identity will find another outlet. “FX has been an amazing partner” she wrote. “We are committed to finding Y its next home.”

FX put the Y adaptation into development in late 2015 after Vaughan reacquired the rights to his franchise; they’d previously been tied up by New Line which ultimately failed to get an effort on the screen. Vaughan told The Hollywood Reporter in November 2017 that he “wanted to find someone who loved the source material but didn’t feel so indebted to it that they would be afraid to change it.” FX and Vaughan tapped Green and Croal as showrunners. “When [Green] first pitched his take on it to Nina Jacobson and me a long time ago he came in saying he wanted to do something about toxic masculinity. It felt very relevant and unfortunately I think it’s only become more relevant with each passing day. His take on it was really brave and very different but exciting as well. I really admire how audacious he’s been with his translation.”

Green and Croal departed the series in April 2019 following creative differences with the network and producers. Clark the new showrunner was hired two months later. The series also changed leading men after Warcraft and Pride alum Ben Schnetzer was tapped to star taking over the role of Yorick Brown — the last living cisgender man on Earth — from Barry Keoghan who departed the drama starring Diane Lane.

Ordered to series in 2018 Y followed escape artist Yorick after a mysterious plague as he sets out to find what might have wiped out the male chromosome. Lane and Amber Tamblyn co-starred. Tamblyn also took to social to note that she was “disappointed” the show would not be moving forward at FX on Hulu where the bulk of FX originals now debut. “I know this extraordinary show that has so much to say and that says it so well will find a great new home soon. Looking forward to the next chapter” she wrote. “If you’re with me let the world know.

During a September interview with TV’s Top 5 podcast Vaughan conceded that his comic wasn’t the easiest to adapt for either a film or TV series. “It turns out to be challenging subject matter” Vaughan said. He noted that film takes chopped his source material down to the point where it “lost everything” and it was bordering on “becoming cartoonish.” “It can only be on television” Vaughan said. Clark meanwhile was a fan of the comics for more than a decade and was interested in exploring society’s conversation about how gender has changed in the past 20 years. “I didn’t want to change Y but wanted to take ideas that were so potent 20 years ago and move them into the world we’re living in now” she told the THR podcast adding that she envisioned Y as a five-season 50-episode series.

That plan will now need some serious help.

For some people moving money from PayPal to the bank may be easier or safer than using a check. Here are step-by-step instructions on how to transfer money from your PayPal account to your bank account.

How to Verify Your PayPal Account?

Log into your PayPal account and click on your account name at the top-right corner of your PayPal account page. Click on Profile. In the Profile page scroll down to the Account Information section and click on Add or Edit bank account button. Input your credit card or checking account’s information into the PayPal’s form provided and then hit enter. PayPal will make a small test deposit into the account and ask you to verify it. Click on Enter code and enter the four-letter code from your bank statement. After inputting the code click on Submit. PayPal will instantly verify your account once you have filled out all the required information and submitted it.

Step 1. Link an Eligible Credit/Debit Card and/or Bank Account to your PayPal Account

PayPal now offers the option of adding a credit card and/or checking account to make payments even more convenient. If you choose this option you can link up to two bank accounts and eight (8) debit or credit cards to your account. That will allow you to transfer money from your PayPal balance into your linked bank account or onto your linked credit/debit card in just one step. Note that you don’t have to link your bank or credit card account to your PayPal account to receive money. For security reasons PayPal only allows you to link your bank account and/or credit card to withdraw funds from it. PayPal also has a $500 withdrawal limit for anyone who hasn’t verified their PayPal accounts. This limitation bars you from transferring an accumulated total of $500 from your PayPal balance to your bank account or another PayPal member. You must first verify your PayPal account by inputting your bank account or credit card information into your account page’s “Profile” section to lift the ban. Once this is done you’re free to transfer up to $10 000 in a single transaction.

Step 2. How to Transfer Money from Your PayPal Account to Bank Account

Log into your PayPal account by entering your username and password. Click on “Log In” to continue. You’ll be directed to the summary page where you’ll see your PayPal balance and recent transaction history if any. Now go ahead and click on “Transfer Money” (found below your PayPal balance). You’ll be directed to the Withdrawal Section where you’re to select the bank account (in this case it’s “Bank account”). After selecting your Bank Account click on Next. You’ll then be prompted to enter the amount that you wish to transfer out of your PayPal balance into your bank account. Now go ahead and click on the “Review Withdrawal” button. You’ll then be directed to the verification page where you’ll see your bank account name amount of money that you’re about to withdraw and transaction fees (if any). Please note that you must enter the correct bank account information for this transaction to go through successfully. If the information is incorrect PayPal won’t be able to transfer your money successfully. If you need help please visit PayPal’s official website for more information on how to send a withdrawal request.

Step 3. Send the Withdrawal Request

After choosing the bank account from which you’ll send your money click on the Confirm & Pay button. You’ll then be taken to PayPal’s secure page where you can input your security information. Input the requested information and press confirm button once done. The next thing you’ll see is a confirmation message saying that your withdrawal request has been sent for processing. You may edit or cancel this request by logging into your PayPal account anytime before it’s processed. Once the money gets transferred from your PayPal balance to the bank account you’ll receive a confirmation email as well as notifications at the top of your PayPal page. If for some reason you cannot see those notifications then go to “History” on your PayPal page and click on Withdrawal Sent. You should then be able to see a record of your withdrawal request there. It may take up to six business days for your withdrawal request to be completed and processed by PayPal which is why it’s always better to send the money as soon as possible.

Four Things to Keep in Mind When Transferring Payments from Your PayPal Account to Your Bank Account

While the process of transferring money from your PayPal account to your bank account is straightforward there are some things that you need to keep in mind. Here are the four most important things you should consider before making a withdrawal request:

The Process Isn’t Instantaneous

The withdrawal process can take up to six business days which is why it’s suggested that you send the money as soon as possible. You’ll receive an email notification once your request has been processed and transferred successfully into your bank account.

There are Some Fees Involved with the Process

Depending on your country of residence you may be charged a fee for withdrawing funds from PayPal to your bank account. Fees are usually deducted from the amount that you’re transferring out of your PayPal balance into your bank account. You might want to check out with your bank to find out how much they charge for the transfers. If you encounter any issues when sending out the transfer please visit PayPal’s official website for details on how to resolve them.

PayPal Might Decline Your Withdrawal Request if You Don’t Meet Certain Requirements

PayPal may decline your withdrawal request if you don’t meet their minimum requirement or if you’re new to PayPal. Note that you’re only allowed to withdraw money from your PayPal account once it has been verified. There are also certain requirements that you need to fulfill if you want to withdraw funds to another country’s bank account. You’ll need to check with PayPal first on whether or not you meet their requirements.

You Can Cause Serious Damage to Your PayPal Account if You're Not Careful with the Withdrawal Process

When sending out your withdrawal request be sure to double-check all the information you input. Any mistake you make may raise a red alarm prompting PayPal to limit your account. Meaning you won’t be able to withdraw funds from your PayPal balance if this happens. Worse you might even lose access to your account altogether.",,,,,,

PEP,PepsiCo,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmlidW5laW5kaWEuY29tL25ld3MvcmV2aWV3cy9zdG9yeS9oZXItYXV0b2Jpb2dyYXBoeS1icmluZ3MtdGhlLXJlbWFya2FibGUtam91cm5leS1vZi1wZXBzaWNvLWNlby1pbmRyYS1ub295aS0zMjU2MzPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Her autobiography brings the remarkable journey of PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi,"Vini Mahajan

THE story of a girl born and brought up in a traditional family in Chennai who went on to become the long-serving CEO of one of the most well-known US companies is bound to operate at various levels. For all Indians in particular and the developing world in general it was a matter of the greatest satisfaction that one of our own was to head a company as well known as PepsiCo for a full 13 years.

The US corporate world and indeed that in the entire developed world is known to be dominated by white males from within the developed world. A non-white and a woman to boot ascending to the very top is a highly unusual event today and was even more so back in 2006 when Indra Nooyi was nominated Chairman and CEO of PepsiCo. It is a matter of the highest credit to her therefore that she was claimed as she mentions in the introduction itself by both the US President and the Prime Minister of India as “one of us”.

Indra’s autobiography does justice to her remarkable life. Written in a simple easy-to-read style it brings out vividly her life’s journey. It starts from growing up in a middle class Tamil Brahmin household with a revered grandfather a supportive father and a mother who as Indra puts it so evocatively had “one foot on the accelerator and the other on the brake” in the sense of encouraging her daughter to soar while emphasising the bonds and constraints for girls at so many critical times in her life. For those of us who have grown up in or experienced joint families as we call them or multi-generational families as Indra does the images of being part of a close network of cousins aunts and uncles are so familiar. Equally familiar are the images of India in the ’60s and early ’70s.

The most important phase of Indra’s life of course was her move to the US first to study management at Yale and then to work starting with BCG Motorola and ABB until finally she moved to PepsiCo in 1994. It is clear from her narrative that her rise to the top was the result of not just her skill sets of a very high order especially her ability of strategic thinking but also her capacity to work extremely hard.

She has described herself as fortunate in needing only five hours of sleep in a day and clearly much of the rest of her time was devoted to work almost seven days a week including extensive travel. She was also supported by excellent mentors who guided and helped her move up. Most importantly according to her she had the support of a caring family especially a husband who was willing for instance to move to another location when she needed to even at the cost of his own work and a mother and other family members who strongly supported her when her daughters were young. In fact a very major reason for Indra to write this book appears to be her strong conviction that workplaces and the corporate world need to do much more to support working women including more paid maternal and paternal leave a flexible and predictable work schedule and daycare facilities for children.

Indra has also brought out the need for the business world especially large corporates to be more aware of environmental challenges such as the need to conserve water and promote use of renewable energy. She has linked her strong views to her childhood in India but the issues she has highlighted are relevant across the globe. She has also brought out starkly how she promoted health and wellness by reorienting a company known for its cola and fast food to one that worked determinedly to provide customers with healthy choices.

Indra has described how early in her life in the US her then CEO noted her direct and blunt style and advised her “to be careful about throwing hand grenades”. She quickly learnt a new softer way of dealing with colleagues. This style is evident in her book which has highlighted all the positives in her life but she either did not experience too many problems other than those of child-rearing or she has chosen to play them down. About the only negative references are to her daughter facing racial discrimination as a young child at school and she herself facing a new boss who was uncomfortable working with women and regularly called her “Honey”. Perhaps the fact that she was helped in writing the book by a professional writer may also be responsible for the sense that the book does not truly bring out the passion that would have resulted in the kind of heights that Indra reached.

Nevertheless this book is a treasure for those who want to understand how a for-profit entity can reorient itself successfully to goals that may at a superficial level appear in conflict with the profit motive. It should also be essential reading for all professionals looking to understand how to deal with complex situations at work and home. But most importantly the book is a valuable guide to women who have to constantly make choices relating to the work-life balance. At the end of the book Indra promises her daughters that she will be there for them when they have their own children who need family care. The message that comes out strongly is that this promise needs to be made not just by all women to their daughters but perhaps by society to all its young families and also its elders so that the future generations can truly benefit from equal opportunity for all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVud2ljaHRpbWUuY29tL2xvY2FsL2FydGljbGUvVGhlLURpc2gtQmFyYmFyYS1hbmQtUmF5LURhbGlvLWhlbHAtR3JlZW53aWNoLTE2NTM2OTQ1LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Dish: Barbara and Ray Dalio help Greenwich Historical Society make history,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.greenwichtime.com/local/article/The-Dish-Barbara-and-Ray-Dalio-help-Greenwich-16536945.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVud2ljaHRpbWUuY29tL2xvY2FsL2FydGljbGUvVGhlLURpc2gtQmFyYmFyYS1hbmQtUmF5LURhbGlvLWhlbHAtR3JlZW53aWNoLTE2NTM2OTQ1LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmV5Y29udHJvbC5jb20vbmV3cy90cmVuZHMvZmVhdHVyZXMvcmV2aWV3LW15LWxpZmUtaW4tZnVsbC1ieS1pbmRyYS1ub295aS1saXZlcy11cC10by10aGUtaHlwZS03NTg5OTQxLmh0bWzSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25leWNvbnRyb2wuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3Jldmlldy1teS1saWZlLWluLWZ1bGwtYnktaW5kcmEtbm9veWktbGl2ZXMtdXAtdG8tdGhlLWh5cGUtNzU4OTk0MS5odG1sL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review | 'My Life in Full' by Indra Nooyi lives up to the hype,"Indra Nooyi devotes many pages in the book to a serious discussion about how companies must step up to provide employees an infrastructure of care so they can breathe easy. (Source: Reuters)

Indra Nooyi’s much-awaited book My Life in Full published by Hachette India is completely worth the hype that it has generated. Whether you want to read it as the biography of PepsiCo’s former CEO or as the story of a woman of colour in corporate America as a resource on diversity and inclusion or as an Indian immigrant’s love letter to her glorious American dream this book will not fail you. It engages with all these topics. The business leader has delivered yet another winner.

The most endearing thing about this book is that Nooyi even while talking about her achievements does not come across as blowing her own trumpet. Her gratitude for the personal and professional support systems in her life that enabled her rise and her success reverberates throughout this book.

For starters she mentions that the book was “shaped and written by Lisa Kassenaar a most gifted writer”. This acknowledgement is important yet often missing from books by celebrities who have ghost writers secretaries assistants and spouses doing a lot of the writing on their behalf. Kassenaar took Nooyi’s “stories facts anecdotes and pages of edits” to weave them into “beautiful chapters each with core lessons”. Nooyi calls Kaseenaar “a real treasure” and says “I am in awe of her skills.”

Appreciating people’s contributions is a habit that has served Nooyi well. If you read this book you will notice the profound impact that encouragement can have on the self-esteem well-being and performance of employees. Once while reflecting on how her accomplishments would not have been possible without the opportunities her parents and grandparents gave her as a young girl in Madras (now Chennai) she came up with the idea of writing to parents of her senior executives.

In the book she shares “Over the next ten years I wrote hundreds of notes thanking mothers and fathers for the gift of their child to PepsiCo. I also wrote to the spouses of all my direct reports thanking them for sharing their husband or wife with PepsiCo. I worked with my chief of staff to help personalize the letters for each recipient.” If this makes her sound like Elizabeth McCord from the television series Madam Secretary you will notice many other similarities when you read the book.

While Nooyi heaps well-deserved praise on the men who mentored her she is also candid about the discrimination that she faced as a woman in the upper echelons of power occupied mainly by men. She reveals “Golf-and-business stories may seem cliché but connections forged over eighteen holes aren’t incidental and some of the most coveted places to play in the US still bar women.”

In 2007 Don Kendall – a man who served as PepsiCo’s CEO much before Nooyi – invited her to join Westchester County’s Blind Brook Country Club. It is quite close to PepsiCo’s campus in Purchase New York. This club has been used by many of PepsiCo’s past CEOs to entertain customers and friends. Nooyi could not join it because membership was open only to men. Kendall suggested that Nooyi get her husband to become a member so that she could get access to the club as his wife.

When Nooyi checked in with her husband Raj about this idea he looked at her in horror. “Why would we ever become members of a country club that doesn’t accept women? Forget it” he said. Kendall apparently was unable to fathom why Nooyi turned down the creative work-around.

Being an immigrant and a person of colour brought her criticism from colleagues seething with resentment and jealousy. “I knew I had been referred to as a ‘quota hire’ when I joined PepsiCo in 1994” she shares. When Nooyi became a CEO it was assumed that an Indian American hire was Nooyi’s contact. Women and people of colour who were promoted by her were seen as benefiting from her diversity and inclusion agenda rather than being rewarded for their contributions.

It was frustrating but she learnt to laugh at the situation as leaders must. If they let every snub ruin their peace of mind they would never be able to do what they need to in order to run their business and make profits. Nooyi shares “Sometimes I felt like people assumed that everyone from India—all 1.3 billion people—were my cousins or somehow related to me. It was disheartening but amusing in its own disturbing way.” She writes without any bitterness and has a charming sense of humour.

While women who aspire to high-profile leadership roles in the corporate world will have much to learn from Nooyi’s journey this book must also be read by men who are unaware about the barriers women face in realizing their potential. Nooyi makes a strong case for paid maternity and paternity leave as well as childcare. She had a supportive husband mother mother-in-law housekeeper nanny and relatives to help raise her two daughters. A lot of women do not have this kind of help.

Nooyi still had to deal with pangs of guilt on several occasions when she had to be away from her family in order to fulfill professional duties and advance her career. She devotes many pages in the book to a serious discussion about how companies must step up to recognize that employees need an infrastructure of care in order to breathe easy. She says “We learned fast during the COVID crisis that our economy is fully equipped across many roles and industries for people to work remotely.”

This book does an excellent job of championing the idea that what is good for business must also be good for society. Nooyi addresses many concerns that have been raised about PepsiCo’s products in the last few decades – their impact on public health their consumption of water resources their over-dependence on plastic for packaging. The solutions and alternatives that she worked on during her tenure are presented in a manner that will appeal to those interested in innovation.

Nooyi recounts how she met the people who made her think differently and how they filled the gaps in her knowledge. The humility to admit ignorance is under-emphasized in lists of leadership qualities that are must-haves. This book is a reminder of how vital it is to be a student and listener.",,,,,,

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDE5LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA5L3BnLXNpdHRlbmZlbGQtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLWZlZGVyYWwtYXBwZWFscy1jb3VydC1oZWFyLWFyZ3VtZW50cy10aHVyc2RheS_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxOS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2FzZS1mZWRlcmFsLWFwcGVhbHMtY291cnQtaGVhci1hcmd1bWVudHMtdGh1cnNkYXkvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P.G. Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

Getting a star athlete on a video call for a reasonable fee was an easy sell to fans but not to the athletes—the company had so many athlete no-shows for calls that the effort was scuttled by constant refunds.

He has higher hopes for his second athlete venture: Finlete which keeps the fan meet-and-greet of the first effort but adds what should be a stronger motivator—more money.

“Finlete is a platform that allows fans to support for now minor league baseball players” Connolly said in a phone call. “And with the current amount of money that these athletes make in the minor leagues there’s a really interesting potential return that people participating in Finlete can see.”

Finlete is a new entry in the increasingly popular financial play of athlete investing in which funds swap an upfront payment to an aspiring pro in exchange for a fixed percentage cut of future sports income. Comcast owns 7% of Finlete’s business while famed venture capitalist Tim Draper has a $50000 seed investment in the endeavor.

For Finlete Connolly sees a lot of potential in farm team ballplayers partly because minor league baseball pays most players badly. Finlete’s first athlete Texas Rangers middle infield prospect Echedry Vargas signed with the club out of the Dominican Republic in 2022 for a $10000 bonus–the minimum at the time according to Connolly. Right now Vargas plays in A-ball where salaries max out at $27300. “He’s like a minimum wage guy … but outperforming players that signed for millions of dollars” the executive said.

Finlete is taking a crowd-funding approach selling shares in a Securities & Exchange Commission-registered offering to retail investors. Investors can buy shares in Vargas for $8 (with a 12-share minimum) with the player receiving a $500000 advance. In exchange investors get a claim of 10% of his baseball earnings for the next 25 years if he makes The Show or even if he ends up off-Broadway so to speak in the top pro leagues of Japan Korea and Taiwan according to the player agreement disclosed as part of the offering. If he fails to make the majors stateside or in Asia Vargas won’t owe anything. The offering is still raising money and has about $26000 in commitments according to the Finlete website.

The presence of smart money suggests there’s increasing traction with the idea of swapping a lump sum of cash now for a cut of athlete income later on. The current wave of start-ups was sparked by the initial success of Big League Advance a private fund that is best known for striking a deal with the now-superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. when he was a minor leaguer. Finlete joins the golf pro-focused Commonwealth Sports NFL player-backing Vestible and international soccer player investing Nordensa—which isn’t available to American investors—as more recent entrants to the budding scene.

Conscious of the other competitors in the space the company sees the carryover of the original Cameo-like idea as a key to drawing in fan investors; part of the pitch to athletes too is to build a cadre of supporters early. In Vargas’ case he commits to things such as signing 100 autographs annually and holding meet-and-greets with fans at games as perks to people buying a minimum number of shares and at least two 30-minute video-chat appearance annually under the deal.

“It’s like a PG version of OnlyFans” Connolly said. “You’re involved with the athlete on an intimate level. You get to be a part of the athlete’s journey you get to hear what they’re struggling with and what they’re working on.”

Such a relationship is also potentially lucrative for Finlete. If the current share offering in Vargas’ future income sells its maximum proposed level of $800000 (100000 shares) $300000 goes to cover the offering costs and reimbursements to Finlete. It’s not quite a fair comparison because certain costs aren’t proportional but a typical stock IPO sees about 5% of proceeds directed to expenses and commissions. Finlete also gets the right of first refusal to buy any future baseball-related income Vargas might consider selling.

“We want to do $100 million in revenue in two years. We want to create a trading platform that allows fans to buy and sell their positions … and have over 100 athletes on our platform from Nascar drivers to horse racing jockeys to baseball players and UFC fighters” Connolly said.

That’s a lot of hope riding on the shoulders of Vargas who is currently batting .227 for the Down East Wood Ducks of the Carolina League."

Warm words have given way to stern warnings on Brexit and surly trade talks. Yet there is one aspect of the relationship that certainly remains special: corporate America’s apparently insatiable appetite for British businesses.

Uncle Sam’s shopping trolley has been filled to overflowing with UK companies since the start of the pandemic as market panic gave way to a bargain-hunting frenzy that has seen bids for notable names including outsourcer G4S infrastructure builder John Laing and defence companies Meggitt and Ultra Electronics. This week will mark the next steps in three more buyouts: supermarket Morrisons inhaler-maker Vectura and bookmaker Entain.

At Morrisons shareholders are expected to back a takeover by the US private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice on Tuesday after a bid battle and auction pumped up its price. On the same day Vectura’s London-listed shares will be cancelled after its controversial acquisition by cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris.

The buyout of Entain the owner of the Coral and Ladbrokes betting brands may still have further to run but US bidder DraftKings has until Tuesday to put forward a formal offer after approaching with a $22.4bn (£16.4bn) bid that was worth almost double a previous offer by Las Vegas’s MGM Resorts. DraftKings hopes to apply Entain’s UK bookmaking expertise in the US where deregulation has triggered a breakneck race for what could be one of the world’s most lucrative gambling markets.

Hefty premiums have calmed quibbles up to now but Tuesday may see some quiet ‘whither Britain’ reflection in City pubs

The three deals would have a cumulative value of about £25bn before debt is included adding further to takeovers adding up to £36bn that were completed in the first six months of 2021 according to data from the Office for National Statistics. Foreign buyers may not match 2016’s all-time record (when a few mega-deals skewed the total) but 2021 is still likely to be one of the biggest selloffs in UK corporate history.

Hefty premiums offered by buyers have calmed quibbles from investors up to now but Tuesday evening may see some quiet “whither Britain” reflection in City pubs. Two camps have emerged in the acquisition spree: blithe spirits who are eminently comfortable with corporate Britain being for sale – for the right price – and others much more uneasy about the star-spangled banner rising over yet more former British assets.

The Morrisons deal does not lend itself well to the optimists’ argument. A share price that still lags behind the level it hit in 2013 – even after taking into account the 61% premium to the undisturbed price squeezed out of a private equity buyer – is not usually indicative of a company with spectacular growth prospects and analysts expect asset sales in the order of £2.5bn to achieve private-equity levels of return on investment. Politicians are watching (or perhaps bracing themselves) for any job cuts.

Triumphalism on the other two deals might be tempered by the ethical quandaries associated with gambling and tobacco companies – two conference events quickly dropped their Vectura sponsorship. But from a certain angle the takeovers of Entain and Vectura could be spun as optimistic tales of research prowess. Both are British companies that developed highly valued technology.

Yet the buyouts will surely also give pause to even the most ardent “global Britain” proponents. An open door to business is all very well but it will again raise the question of why British companies seem to be unable to make their own way on to the world stage.",,,,,,,,,,,,
PSX,Phillips 66,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5teWNlbnRyYWxqZXJzZXkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvZWR1Y2F0aW9uL2luLW91ci1zY2hvb2xzLzIwMjEvMTAvMTYvbmotc3R1ZGVudHMtZG9uYXRpb24tbGluZGVuLXNjaG9vbHMtYm9vc3Qtc2NpZW5jZS1jdXJyaWN1bHVtLzYwMzU2MDMwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NJ students: Donation to Linden schools will boost science curriculum,"The Linden Public School District has received a $58000 donation from Phillips 66 Bayway Refinery to support the district’s science curriculum. The funds will be used to purchase science kits for all of the district’s 400 second-graders.

“Phillips 66 and our colleagues at the Bayway Refinery support our local Linden school community in so many ways” said Cynthia Apalinski the district’s elementary science specialist. “Their generous donation is one in a long line of us joining together as partners to provide the strongest science learning opportunities possible to our students.

“This most recent support is representative of our partnership to develop the next generation of scientists and engineers. We are extremely grateful for their continuous support and with these funds we are able to purchase new science materials for our second-grade classrooms.”

The Full Option Science System (FOSS) kits supply students with materials to study and investigate units on Insects and Plants; Solids and Liquids; and Pebbles Sand and Silt. In all three units students spend significant time outdoors exploring their schoolyards and local community to make real-life connections with the science concepts they are learning about in their classrooms.

“Thank you to our neighbors at Phillips 66 for their generous support for our science curriculum” said Superintendent of Schools Dr. Marnie Hazelton. “They say it takes a village to educate a child and this kind of financial backing from one of our vital community partners puts that mantra into action.”

Access to high-quality instructional materials allows Linden’s elementary teachers to provide students with rich and engaging experiences as they investigate phenomena in science and solve problems in engineering.

“At Phillips 66 one of our key focus areas for our philanthropic giving is Education and Literacy. We are very proud to support the purchase of required curriculum materials that will help the development of local Linden students” said Chris Gallo general manager of Phillips 66 Bayway Refinery. “We have supported this community need over the past six years annually addressing a different grade level. With Bayway’s contribution this year Grades Second through Eighth in the Linden Public Schools will have state-required science kits.”

Apalinski said: “These materials allow our student scientists to develop a love of science learn how science and engineering can improve our world and solve its most challenging problems and help them envision a potential trajectory into a science-related career.”

The FOSS program gives students in-depth exposure to life physical and earth and space sciences while engaging them in the engineering design process:

Insects and Plants: Young biologists study the biodiversity of plants and animals by investigating firsthand the life cycles and behaviors of common insects and plants. They observe and care for meal worms milkweed bugs and painted lady butterflies live in their classrooms. They also plant their own seeds and collect and analyze data about their growth.

Solids and Liquids: Students explore solid and liquid materials by observing describing and sorting them according to their properties. Next they investigate interactions between solids and water liquids and water and the melting and freezing of familiar liquids.

Pebbles Sand and Silt: Student geologists observe the properties of rocks of various sizes and study the components of soil. They study and analyze the results of weathering and erosion and work collaboratively to locate natural sources of water. They discover various earth materials’ important role as natural resources and uses as building materials.

Hunterdon County Vocational School District

Hunterdon County Polytech Career & Technical High School’s Commercial Arts & Advertising Design and 3D Computer Animation Instructor Teresa De Sapio Diaz began this school year with the impressive title of Hunterdon County Teacher of the Year for 2021-2022. She was given the honor by the New Jersey Education Association. During last school year Diaz was named Educator of the Year by Hunterdon County Vocational School District (HCVSD) which put her in the running for the county-wide Teacher of the Year.

“It felt really good to be recognized and honored for the work that I do” said Diaz noting it is significant that a career and technical education (CTE) teacher was included among those selected. “It’s timely because after the pandemic people realized that what kept the economy moving is a lot of what we train our students to do.”

“We are beyond thrilled to have Mrs. Diaz not only represent our district but represent all 21 county vocational-technical schools with this honor” said HCVSD Superintendent Dr. Todd Bonsall. “It is so important for us to have visibility in the profession to help us continue to attract industry professionals who have so much knowledge and passion to share with the next generation.”

As County Teacher of the Year Diaz had to develop a platform on a topic of her choice that she would share with other county schools administrators parents and the community. Diaz selected art education and CTE. To support her platform she collaborated with several teachers throughout the county over the summer to create a program that has a curriculum with vertical alignment. The program begins in middle school and carries through to high school (Polytech) college and into a professional career.

“These kinds of things have us all excited to come back to school. It’s important to be open to change and create projects that you would be excited to be involved in. It gets you excited to teach which rubs off on your students who then get excited to do it and learn” said Diaz.

Diaz said the County Teachers of the Year received social media training to help them spread the messages of their platforms. The teachers also are asked to be involved in or speak at events to “elevate the profession of educator and encourage others to become educators.”

Diaz is sharing her experience as an educator on a panel at Seton Hall University as well as addressing the County Superintendents Roundtable Meeting.

“We also actively seek leadership positions in our schools and communities so we can pass on our knowledge to others” said Diaz. “This year I am the district SkillsUSA advisor and was named to the board of the Art Educators of New Jersey serving as the membership chairperson.” She said although she has presented at the organization’s state conferences in the past and has been a member for more than 18 years this is the first time she has taken on a leadership role. “It’s been rewarding to take on leadership roles; I’m learning and growing as a teacher networking and meeting new people. It’s fun. I’m working on writing some articles for journals and magazines. It’s all about passing on our knowledge to others.”

Diaz has felt supported on many levels. “My students were so excited for me and told their parents who were excited to have their child in the County Teacher of the Year’s classroom. It’s cool to see other people’s reactions to my honor.”

Diaz encourages other professionals to become teachers at their county vocational-technical schools. “It’s so important to share what you know especially if you’re passionate about something. You’ll want to keep that going and see that excitement and enthusiasm in someone else.”

She believes that more professionals should embrace internships and apprenticeships as well to further share their knowledge with the next generation. “It’s kind of going back in time to family businesses where you learn from your parents and grandparents. Today you can do that as a professional and pass your knowledge on to strangers and get them just as excited for the field you went into” said Diaz.

Mount Saint Mary Academy

Fordham University and the Henry Luce Foundation awarded Madeline Newall of Westfield a 2019 graduate of Mount Saint Mary Academy a Clare Boothe Luce (CBL) Scholarship for 2021-2022. Newall is pursuing an applied mathematics major with a psychology minor at Fordham.

The CBL Fund for Women in Science and Engineering at Fordham University was established in 1989 to encourage women to pursue graduate education and careers in the sciences. The scholarship covers tuition and fees not covered by other scholarships and awards for the fall and spring of the 2021-2022 academic year.

“I was extremely excited and grateful when I found out that I received the Clare Booth Luce Scholarship” said Madeline. “The scholarship will help me pursue my research endeavors with a great academic support system and it allows me to dedicate a large part of my academic life at Fordham to a great research project.”

“Achieving this scholarship would not have been possible without the support of my family and the academic foundation of the Mount where I truly found my passion for mathematics. I am extremely grateful for this opportunity” she said.

“I am interested in statistics and data analytics for my career goals” she said. “I hope to work in research possibly as a data analyst or statistician working in the sports data field or social justice using collected data to find solutions to systemic problems. Through research I can combine my passions for mathematics and psychology to create substantial change.”

Old Bridge Township Public Schools

Old Bridge School District congratulates Frau Linda Costa on her selection as the ""2021 American Association of Teachers of German (AATG) K-8 Outstanding German Educator!"" Costa was selected from a group of teachers nationwide who recognize and support the education of the German language and culture. Along with only a handful of other award recipients from across the globe Costa will be honored during an AATG virtual ceremony on November 20.

The AATG promotes the study of German and prepares students as transcultural multilingual participants in a global world. Costa has served to foster that mission throughout her career at Old Bridge School District. As the German teacher at Jonas Salk Middle School she has played a critical role in the development and growth of the world language program. Creating a need and an understanding of cross-cultural communication has become increasingly important in our world. With this in mind Costa creates an inviting environment for students to learn the German language fosters an understanding of diversity in our world and allows students to begin their love for the study of a new language and culture. She has taught French and German at both the high school and middle school levels at Old Bridge advancing student exchange programs at all levels.

The Old Bridge School District begins its study of world language in kindergarten in 2021 marking our inaugural year for such an early start. Previously elementary students were taught basics of Spanish in third fourth and fifth grades only. Aware that students acquire and retain language skills when exposed at much younger ages the world language department at Old Bridge is committed to supporting early learner language programs. Students in all elementary schools are beginning exploration programs in Italian Mandarin and Spanish this year with focus on culture and foundations of communication. Authentic learning units of study are taught at all levels increasing aural skills. The goal for our elementary program is to create a passion for the continued study of world language in the middle and high school. Old Bridge offers five language programs to students (Mandarin French German Italian Spanish) with Advanced Placement options in all.

Although the annual German Exchange voyage with students from Steinbart Gymnasium in Duisburg Germany is on temporary pause due to current pandemic travel conditions they hope to start the exchange again soon. In the interim teachers continue to plan rich virtual experiences for all students.

Somerset County Vocational and Technical Schools

In celebration of Hispanic Heritage month the Spanish Department at Somerset County Vocational & Technical High School (SCVTHS) hosted a Latin percussion workshop on October 1 featuring Hector Morales a Peruvian drummer and percussionist with over 15 years of experience as a teaching artist in the tri-state area. Morales presented six classes of Spanish music instruction to SCVTHS World Language students.

Morales who specializes in Afro-Peruvian music presented to the students how his unique music and instruments related to the Peruvian culture and its history. During the workshops Morales displayed discussed and played a variety of Peruvian percussion instruments and even invited the students to participate with him by playing some of the instruments. Morales also explained how the music ties both North American and Latin American countries together. Morales said “Music is the universal language.”

""Learning by doing or learning from concrete experience is a theory that when putting into practice creates meaningful learning” said SCVTHS Spanish Instructor Guillermo Reina. “I really liked the workshop and the students were exposed to Hispanic culture from a global point of view even connecting origins of Peruvian music from the African descendants' diaspora.""

SCVTHS junior Chase Thompson of Bridgewater said ""I found it to be both entertaining and informative. I liked how he (Mr. Morales) let us played instruments and was patient enough to teach us how to play them properly.""

Union Catholic Regional High School

Mike Minniti of Scotch Plain leads the soccer team with seven goals an honor roll student and is a member of the National Honor Society.

Minniti had a day he will never forget on Thursday October 7 when he continued his torrid goal scoring streak by finding the back of the net in overtime to give Union Catholic a dramatic 2-1 victory over Brearley on Senior Day at Ponderosa Park. That gave Minniti a team-high seven goals on the season.

After the game Minniti hustled back over to Union Catholic for a special ceremony where he was one of 128 students inducted into the National Honor Society.

Westfield Public Schools

It was a morning of fitness and fellowship across the school district as more than 2000 elementary students and their families celebrated Walk to School Day in Westfield on Oct. 6.

Organized by the Westfield BRAKES Group (Bikers Runners and Kids are Entitled to Safety) and school PTOs the event is modeled after International Walk to School Day a global effort involving communities from more than 40 countries walking and biking to school on the same day.

In Westfield students in grades first to fifth skipped hopped and walked to their school. Some received special escorts after entering and winning a raffle for the chance to walk with a police officer principal school mascot or other local dignitary.

Wilson second grader Zoey Edelstein was greeted at her front door by Mayor Shelley Brindle who escorted her to school while Franklin second grader Talia Farzad won the chance to be accompanied by Franklin principal Dr. Paul Duncan. Police Sergeant Thomas Ostrander kept pace with Kayla Marcus a third grader at Franklin and Jefferson fourth grader Owen Hennes walked and talked with school superintendent Dr. Raymond González.

“I enjoyed meeting Owen and his family” said González. “I love these types of events that really bring the community together.”

Each of the six elementary schools had banners for students to sign and “I Walked” stickers provided by Weichert Realtors.

BRAKES is an organization that works to promote safe walking and biking routes for Westfield pedestrians of all ages.

The damage from the recent California oil spill has so far been less disastrous than initially feared but it has thrust the issue of offshore oil drilling on the West Coast into some of the most hotly contested US House races in the country.

The spill created a plume that threatened beaches and wetlands all along the edge of GOP Rep. Michelle Steel’s 48th Congressional District one of three Golden State House districts Republicans flipped in November 2020. Democrats hoping to stem the traditional losses from a president’s first midterm election are trying to win back seats like the 48th District – and in offshore drilling they see a potential wedge issue that could alienate voters from their GOP representatives.

It has long been true in deep blue California where the Democratic governor overwhelmingly survived an effort to recall him last month that a sizable portion of Republican voters also are against new offshore drilling creating a political issue that doesn’t cleave neatly along party lines. Candidates on both sides in the 48th District race for example are trying to show voters their commitment to protecting the environment while their campaigns point fingers over oil-related income in their respective financial portfolios.

The environmental damage is still being assessed but a spokesperson with the US Coast Guard overseeing cleanup said Friday they are highly confident that the amount of oil released will be closer to 25000 gallons rather than up to 131000 gallons as previously feared.

Still the incident has once again raised alarm about the threats of oil drilling to the coast. Environmentalists protesting outside Steel’s office last week called on her to support a ban on new offshore drilling that congressional Democrats are trying to include in President Joe Biden’s economic spending bill likely hoping to put their GOP colleagues on record on the issue should it come up for a vote. Former Democratic Rep. Harley Rouda whom Steel defeated last year and is running again for this seat spoke at the protest and last week released a digital ad that attacked what his campaign says is Steel’s lack of position on the issue. “She refuses to answer questions about banning offshore drilling” the ad says. “When disaster strikes home we know where Michelle Steel is – standing with her oil and gas industry donors.”

A Steel spokesperson did not directly respond to CNN’s questions about what her position is on banning new drilling off the West Coast. Neither did a spokeswoman for GOP Rep. Young Kim a freshman Republican who flipped the nearby 39th District another seat Biden carried last year that Democrats are hoping to contest in 2022.

When asked about her position on new offshore drilling leases Steel’s aides said she is most focused on demanding accountability for the recent incident and exploring measures that will help guard against future spills specifically by zeroing in on the environmental threats posed by the current backlog of ships at Los Angeles-area ports. Both Steel and Young were quick to call for a federal investigation into the pipeline’s history the cause of the spill and the response of the oil company that operates the pipeline.

Shipping backlogs and drilling bans

During their time in office California Republican governors from Pete Wilson to Arnold Schwarzenegger sought to play up their commitment to conservation as a bridge to voters beyond their party. And in this politically purple area of the state Steel is leaning into environmental concerns too calling the shipping backlog “an environmental & public health crisis.”

Steel introduced legislation last week for example that would prohibit cargo ships from idling or anchoring 24 miles off the Orange County coast for up to 180 days or until a point when the President declares the backlog in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach over. Preliminary reports about the spill from both the US Coast Guard and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration indicated that the root cause of the rupture may have been a ship anchor that hooked the pipeline and created a tear.

In a tweet Wednesday Steel commended Biden for “finally taking steps to solve the port backlog that likely led to the OC oil spill.” “Now he must make a disaster declaration” she tweeted. “Unlike my opponent who is focused on political theatrics I’m focused on finding timely and pragmatic solutions.”

Steel sent a letter to officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and US Coast Guard on Thursday asking them to re-examine and survey the nautical charts near all pipelines linked to offshore oil platforms near the Orange County coast calling it an “emergency mapping issue” that could prevent another disaster.

In the effort to ban new offshore drilling California’s congressional Democrats – led by Rep. Mike Levin a former environmental attorney who represents south Orange County and North County San Diego – are pressing House leadership to retain a permanent ban on drilling in certain federal waters in the social safety net and climate package that Democrats are negotiating in Congress. In early September the House Natural Resources Committee voted to approve language banning new offshore leasing in federal waters in the Pacific Ocean the Atlantic Ocean and the Eastern Gulf of Mexico as part of their portion of the “Build Back Better Act.” It is unclear however whether the language will remain in the House bill as Democrats wrangle over the price tag – or whether it would survive in the Senate version because of potential objections from West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.

Republicans point out however that legislation banning new offshore oil drilling would not have prevented the recent spill near Huntington Beach where the pipeline that ruptured some five miles offshore was installed in 1980.

There has been no new drilling in federal waters off the West Coast since 1984 but environmentalists and even some Republican officials in coastal states were alarmed when the Trump administration announced short-lived plans to drill off the coasts of California Florida and within other previously protected federal waters in 2018. Biden signed an executive action in January halting new federal oil and gas drilling leases. Around the same time California Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation – from Sen. Dianne Feinstein in the Senate and Rep. Jared Huffman in the House – that would make the drilling ban in federal waters off the West Coast permanent.

For years in California it hasn’t just been Democrats and independents who have cited concerns about additional drilling but also many Republicans who live near the coast. The state’s environmental consciousness has been shaped by the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill when a massive well blowout at a drilling rig – and the subsequent opening of a series of undersea faults – led as much as 4.2 million gallons of crude to gush into the ocean.

In a Public Policy Institute of California survey earlier this year 72% of Californians opposed more drilling off the California coast and only 27% favored it. A full 70% of independents said they did not favor more drilling as did 43% of Republicans demonstrating how it can be an issue that transcends party lines.

“One of the things about environmental attitudes in California is that this is an area where Republicans and Democrats can coalesce around protecting the environment the water air and land” said Mark Baldassare president and CEO of the Public Policy Institute of California. Though beaches have reopened in Orange County the cleanup continues and “how those members of Congress deal with the issue is now not going to be just an abstract issue but a very concrete issue” he said.

Financial interests in oil

So far the fiercest battle over environmental politics in the wake of the recent oil spill is unfolding between Steel and Rouda as they begin to engage in what’s likely to be a 2022 rematch.

Rouda who lost his seat to Steel last year 48.9% to her 51.1% has charged that it was hypocritical for Steel to seek a major disaster declaration from Biden immediately following the spill days after she voted against a government funding bill that provided additional funding for disaster relief. The former congressman and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have sought to draw attention to Steel’s contributions from the oil and gas industry – which totaled $49712 between 2019 and this year according to OpenSecrets.

“She’s taking tens of thousands of dollars from donors tied to the oil and gas business and that’s why she’s unwilling to do the right thing which is to come out and say she will not support additional offshore drilling” Rouda told CNN. “I’ve been consistent since before coming into Congress that I want to see the offshore drilling stop for obvious reasons as to the ramifications if there is an oil spill that we are now seeing firsthand.”

Rouda and the DCCC have tried to draw attention to royalty income that Steel and her husband have earned from oil companies – which totaled between $5313 and $15200 in the personal financial disclosure report that she filed with the House Clerk as a candidate in May of 2020. Assets in personal financial disclosures are reported in broad ranges.

But Rouda’s financial portfolio has oil ties as well. He reported earning capital gains income between $100000 and $1 million from an exchange-traded fund known as Proshares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil that invests directly in oil futures according to the 2019 person financial disclosure report he filed as a member of the House.

Rouda’s campaign argues that he’s not “directly invested in the oil production that’s covered our shores” while claiming Steel’s personal finances are tied to “the very company responsible for the spill our community is cleaning up.” That is a reference to Steel and her husband’s past royalty income from Phillips 66 which fell between $202 and $1200 over the nearly two-and-a-half-year period covered in the 2019 and 2020 candidate reports she filed with the House Clerk. (Amplify Energy the company that operates the pipeline that ruptured off Orange County reported in a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission that its largest customer in 2020 was Phillips 66).

When asked why Rouda invested in an exchange-traded fund that is pegged directly to the price of crude his campaign said that the former congressman “is betting on a transition away from fossil fuels and towards a clean energy economy as we deplete this non-renewable resource.”

Steel’s campaign spokesman Lance Trover rejected that explanation of Rouda’s financial investment: “Voters recognize that is a phony response – he’s got oil investments and he just won’t own up to it. Just tell the truth.”

Trover called the renewed push by Democrats on a West Coast drilling ban political theater and a distraction. “They don’t want to talk about the real problem here – and that is that we have ships backed up off the coast for a gazillion miles and that is likely what caused this oil spill” Trover said. “They don’t want to take on the President; they don’t want to point fingers at him” he added alluding to the supply chain bottleneck that Biden attempted to address last week.

“Democrats control every lever of government in this country so if they wanted to get something done on this issue they could do it today” he added even though Washington’s politically polarized climate has made it virtually impossible to move controversial legislation through the 50-50 Senate.

Trover predicted that California voters would pay more attention to what their leaders did when tragedy struck than debates over drilling policy that would not have directly prevented the crisis. “From the very first day (Steel) was out there calling for the disaster declaration and looking at things like the SHIP ACT” he said. “I think that’s what people and communities look to – people who stood up in the moment.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc25ld3NwYXBlcnMuY29tL3dlYnN0ZXIta2lya3dvb2R0aW1lcy9sb3JldHRvLW1jZG9ubmVsbC1zY2hhcmYtdHVybnMtMTAxL2FydGljbGVfZTEwOWVkODAtMmQwNC0xMWVjLTllMGMtMTc2YmI0ZjBkNTllLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Loretto McDonnell Scharf Turns 101 | Webster Kirkwood Times | timesnewspapers.com,How Does Your Newspaper Get to You?,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdXNyYXJhY2luZy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzX2FydGljbGUuYXNwP05ld3NJRD03NDkxMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Johnson Derry Solander fly Larry McFee Trucking Night checkers at I-35 Speedway,"As the season winds down at I-35 Speedway more new cars continue to check in to the pit area.

Reece Solander won his fourth USRA B-Mod feature in his fifth start of the season at I-35 Speedway.

Solander and seven-time winner Shadren Turner waged war as they got into heavy lapped traffic toward the end of the 15-lap event.

A late caution gave Solander the clean race track he needed to pull away to secure the win.

Turner finishrf second points leader Tyler Cadwallader ran with the top two for most of the race and finished third Cole Moore was fourth and Corey Myers fifth.

Brad Derry led every lap of the Medieval USRA Stock Car feature but it wasn't easy as he had to hold off defending track champion Doug Keller Nic Hanes Ed Griggs and Thomas Roberts. Derry won in only his second trip to the famed track this season.

NORTHGLENN Colo. — Police are investigating after multiple townhomes were hit by gunfire early Sunday morning in Northglenn.

Police said the drive-by shooting happened around 4 a.m. at the Pinnacle Creek townhomes at West 112th Avenue and Huron Street.

Several apartments had multiple bullet holes in them. No injuries were reported.

“I got six” Carol Ingwersen who has lived at the complex for seven years said. “My front door has a bullet hole in it that goes through the outside door and all the inside door and then the ceiling.”

When Ingerwsen heard the gunshots early in the morning she thought something had fallen off of the cupboards or her bookshelves instead.

“Then all of a sudden I see the police cars and the lights and everything. So I opened my door and came out and asked what was going on” Ingerwsen said.

She learned later that hers was one of multiple units hit. She said she has never encountered anything like this in all of her years living in the building.

Other neighbors recognized the sound right away and were startled after the first bullet rang out.

“It was accompanied with a car actually rushing off” said Tony Raychev who immediately checked on his daughter once he woke up.

He and his family are unsure if they will stay at their apartment for the next few nights.

“We don’t know but it’s definitely not a pleasant feeling. We don’t know if that’s going to be followed up with if there is going to be a follow-up. We will have to sit down and talk” Raychev said.

Tenants who spoke to 9NEWS were told by police it was very likely the shooting was targeted. However police would not confirm any additional information about the circumstances surrounding the shooting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZXN0dmFsbGV5dmlldy5jb20vb25saW5lX2ZlYXR1cmVzL21pbGxlbm5pdW0tdGVhY2hlci1jb2FjaC1lbnRlcnMtaGFsbC1vZi1mYW1lL2FydGljbGVfMGY5OWNhMTYtMmMzZS0xMWVjLThkZjMtM2Y3MzUyNTNlZWIxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millennium teacher coach enters hall of fame | Online Features | westvalleyview.com,During his award ceremony Jermaine Austin middle invites several former teammates to join him on the stage: Georgia Southern alumni Lewis Barr Jabre Scott Eric White and Derrick Butler.,,,,,,,,,

The Denver-based cybersecurity firm whose signage adorns the top of the 1144 15th St. office tower has subleased one of its three floors in the building to PNC Bank.

The bank took the 28th floor which is 24650 square feet according to Colliers broker Matt Ball. He and colleague Chris Wiley represented Optiv in the deal. Duncan Heitman of JLL represented PNC.

Optiv still has the 29th and 30th floors of the 40-story structure developed by Houston-based Hines. The company was the first to sign a lease at the building in 2016. The space serves as Optiv’s headquarters.

PNC isn’t a stranger to 1144 Fifteenth; it already leased space elsewhere in the building.

Pittsburgh-based PNC opened its first retail branch in Denver in the spring. PNC also acquired Alabama-based bank BBVA in June and said this week that all BBVA locations in Colorado have been rebranded as PNC. The company declined to comment on the sublease.

Other tenants at 1144 Fifteenth include Bank of America Gates Corp. and six law firms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvb2N0LzE3L3N1emFubmEtbWFyaWUtZ2liYnMtZGF2aWQtY2hyaXN0b3BoZXItZHVkbGV5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WEDDING: Suzanna Marie Gibbs and David Christopher Dudley | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"Suzanna Marie Gibbs and David Christopher Dudley were united in marriage at 6 p.m. Saturday Oct. 9 in Pulaski Heights United Methodist Church.

In May of 2020 Moyer was named Pennsylvania’s Principal of the Year by the Pennsylvania Principal’s Association. In a normal year he would have then attended the national conference of the National Association of Elementary Principals at which in the past one has been chosen from each state’s nominee.

But that didn’t happen. In fact the whole conference didn’t happen. “It was supposed to take place in October last year because October is National Principal’s Month but they pushed it to January because of COVID. Then it got pushed again to the summer” Moyer told The Mercury Friday.

This summer he was joined by 49 other principals in receiving his certificate and an engraved school bell.

Moyer was also tapped to give three workshops during this year’s national conference which took place recently.

He spoke on the subjects of using social media to promote your school — which anyone who has followed his Twitter account or watched his YouTube videos knows is a subject he knows well — as well as understanding how to reach and teach children who live in poverty and self-care for principals.

This last workshop he gave in tandem with a familiar name Pottsgrove High School Principal Bill Ziegler. The two together produce and distribute on social media short forums for their fellow principals called “Principals of Knowledge.”

“We talked about work-life balance which so many people are thinking about these days” Moyer said. “We talked about the fact that there are larks people who get up early in the morning and get things done during the quiet hours; and owls the people who are sending out emails at midnight and one in the morning. And we talked about the need to make sure to make time for family and children” something his wife and two children age 15 and 17 no doubt appreciate.

Moyer said in his other talk he discussed the impacts and “culture of generational poverty. When you have a student who lives in poverty whose parents lived in poverty and whose grandparents lived in poverty that’s a different culture than a middle class culture or a wealthy culture” said Moyer.

“It doesn’t mean they’re less intelligent certainly. It just means they have a different culture background and like any culture you have to get to know it and understand it so you know the best way to reach them and figure out how they learn” Moyer explained.

Attending the national conference was “inspiring” Moyer said.

“To be around so many amazing principals hear about what they’re doing and see the things they’re trying that was just so amazing” said Moyer.

Asked if any in particular stood out to him Moyer did not hesitate. “There was a woman who spoke about losing her daughter and how hard that was but also how it helped her approach her job differently and how the community rallied around her that was truly inspiring” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks including The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

As the days go by in this world where death is never very far away she has a fateful encounter.

I visitatori avranno la possibilità di ammirare gratuitamente otto opere realizzate dagli artisti che hanno preso parte al progetto: ETNIK FONT HITNES MADE MACS SEA CREATIVE JOYS e VESOD coordinati dall’art director Enrico HEMO Sironi. Si tratta di opere site specific che dialogano proficuamente con l’ambiente circostante seppur in maniera sorprendentemente diversa.

Il parco è stato realizzato da Prologis e CEVA Logistics. Prologis Inc. è il leader mondiale nel settore immobiliare con un focus sui mercati ad elevata barriera d’ingresso e crescita mentre CEVA è uno dei principali operatori logistici caratterizzato da una strategia non-asset based.

Prologis Park Lodi rientra però in un più vasto progetto pilota promosso da Prologis nella città doi Lodi che si ispira alla filosofia PARKlife™. Questa filosofia segna un cambio di paradigma nello sviluppo dei parchi logistici di Prologis e mira a mettere al centro non solo le esigenze dei propri clienti ma anche quelle dei propri dipendenti. L’obiettivo è quindi quello di pensare al parco logistico come un luogo di socializzazione un piccolo centro urbano dove è possibile trovare una serie di servizi che vanno ad arricchire la giornata lavorativa: dal trasporto pubblico alle aree comuni dalle attività̀ nel tempo libero a occasioni di incontro. L’idea stessa di sostenibilità̀ si allarga e diventa fruibilità̀ e vivibilità̀ degli spazi grazie anche all’introduzione delle opere degli artisti.

La collaborazione di CEVA Logistics prevede anche la riqualificazione di parte del verde circostante con l’introduzione di piante ad alto fusto dai cromatismi diversi che riequilibrino gli spazi e l’ambiente creando così un naturale dialogo con le opere presenti sugli edifici. È inoltre prevista la realizzazione di aiuole con erbacee perenni che assicurino ulteriore vivacità cromatica ma anche zone a prato e speciali punti ristoro e servizio destinati a quanti frequentano il parco logistico per lavoro.

La galleria a cielo aperto vede anche l’installazione all’interno delle opere di ETNIK e VESOD veri e propri giardini verticali che costruiscono un dialogo efficace con il verde circostante. Gli otto artisti protagonisti del progetto hanno utilizzato circa 40mila metri quadrati di facciate degli edifici e serbatoi dell’acqua come tele per realizzare opere inedite ispirate da una serie di parole chiave suggerite loro da Prologis e CEVA Logistics.

«Abbiamo realizzato un itinerario che mette al centro l’individuo e la natura. Un itinerario composto da otto stili differenti che vogliono creare un ritmo e una cadenza nelle forme e nei concetti lasciando a chi lo visita un senso di nuova identità e di spirito rinnovato frutto di un perdersi e ritrovarsi nei colori e nelle forme nuove» ha commentato Enrico HEMO Sironi.

Breve guida illustrata al parco di Lodi

La prima opera che verrà sottoposta all’attenzione del visitatore è quella di LUCA FONT intitolata Evoluzione. L’opera desidera intraprendere un processo di trasformazione graduale e continuo che coinvolga il visitatore accompagnandolo dalle origini al futuro grazie anche a un sorprendente uso degli angoli dell’edificio.

È il tema della natura che invece interessa l’indagine artistica di HITNES dove ritroviamo le rotte migratorie degli uccelli scorci e suggestioni di luoghi. L’opera di MADE cattura l’occhio dell’osservatore con il suo l’intreccio astratto di cuori e picche ispirato a valori come coraggio e cambiamento attraverso l’innovazione. Lo spazio di JOYS spicca invece per sequenza di linee parallele e incrociate che si muovono con una particolare metrica e con regole ben precise che trovano perfetta armonia ed equilibrio.

MACS utilizza fantasiosamente un serbatoio dell’acqua strizzando l’occhio alle opere di Andy Warhol. SEA CREATIVE sfruttando il secondo serbatoio gioca sapientemente con le stratificazioni tipiche delle cornici ospitanti i manifesti pubblicitari. VESOD invece proietta in una dimensione onirica il visitatore astraendolo in un vortice dove si intrecciano figure e luoghi valorizzati dalla presenza di giardini verticali nel simbolo dell’infinito. Il percorso si chiude con ETNIK e la sua opera dove i volumi architettonici che rappresentano la città in cui l’uomo si muove sono quasi sovrastati dal verde dei giardini verticali in un lavoro realmente tridimensionale. Due opere queste ultime che creano un efficace e suggestivo dialogo con la natura circostante.

Il Prologis Park Lodi sarà aperto al pubblico per un programma di visite guidate gratuite sabato 16 e 23 ottobre e 13 e 20 novembre 2021 al mattino alle 10.30 e nel pomeriggio alle 14 previa registrazione su eventbrite.com alla pagina dedicata all’evento.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

When the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a global pandemic everyone was forced to work from home irrespective of the kind of job they were doing. At first this change was understandably difficult but gradually people started to figure out how to manage work-life balance. Now most workers have embraced this new flexible lifestyle and it has become the normal way of life.

You can work from any remote location and still be productive in the comfort of your home (or your vacation spot). All you need is a laptop with a camera good headphones and an internet connection. Workers save time and money by not having to commute to offices for hours and have more energy to do creative work.

This is the new age we live in and it has changed the paradigm of work moving forward.

As more people are getting vaccinated businesses have started to open up and are mandating employees return to work in physical locations five days a week. This has rubbed many employees the wrong way as they have gotten so used to working remotely and feel their employers are forcing them to make a change. Many feel they are losing their newfound autonomy and are going to go back to being ""babysat"" by management.

According to a recent Prudential Financial's Pulse of the American Worker survey 42% of the employees say they will start looking for jobs elsewhere if their current company does not continue to support remote work options. Another survey conducted by LiveCareer found that 81% of the working professionals enjoy working remotely.

Given this situation how can you convince your boss that you should continue to work remotely?

Do your homework

Before your meeting ask your boss or HR what precautions the company is taking to ensure the employees are safe within the office. Also try to get information about the procedures the employer has in place to guarantee employee safety. This will help you decide whether it is safe for you to come into the office.

Track and highlight your productivity

Before having the conversation with your boss take a couple of weeks and track your work. Make sure you spend work time on high-priority tasks and that you meet important deadlines. Use this data to show your boss how productive you were working from home and would like to continue doing the same.

Clearly express that you will not cause any bottlenecks

It is your responsibility to express with clarity that you will always be available during work hours (just like before) and try your best to ensure your availability will not cause any bottlenecks for the rest of the team members. Give your boss some assurance that you will continue to work towards team goals and deadlines.

Another approach is how you may split up your workday into different hours which could be beneficial to a team as a whole. Perhaps 4 p.m. is always a little stressful for those with young children who would be rushing to get home for bus drop-off; a team of that demographic may choose to hold standups at 8 pm post-bedtime instead. The work will continue to be completed but the flexibility in location may also help flexibility as a team.

Emphasize the fact that you are flexible

Let your boss know that you are ready to come into the office on a case-by-case basis for high-priority meetings and team activities. In this way you express your flexibility and you are not shutting down the idea of in-person visits to the office completely.

Describe how productivity can be affected if you get sick

Always approach your conversations with data and facts. It helps to better convince the other person. That being said let your boss know how productivity and work would be affected if you contract any Covid-19 variant because of in-person interactions.

Have an honest and open conversation about the way you feel

Founded in 1987 the MEBO Group led by practical regenerative medical academics and regenerative life technology has developed into an integrated large-scale high-tech transnational enterprise with a business covering clinical treatment pharmaceutics dietary supplements and medical health care services.MEBO the patentee of over 100 domestic and international patents is the owner of dozens of regenerative products with independent intellectual property including medicine healthcare and skincare products.Kevin Xu chairman of the Board of Directors of the MEBO Group told the Global Times that the company has established an international cross-border service trade platform that has connected more than 100 strategic partners since it was built in 2020.""These companies are unable to steadily export their products to their partners due to the pandemic so they chose us to give them more ways to export overseas. MEBO has developed for over 30 years and our market covers more than 80 countries and regions across the world which is the solid foundation that allows us to establish such a global service trade platform"" Xu said.MEBO a dual-headquartered global company has the capability of extending beyond China and the US.""Therefore our company can absorb more information for holistic analyses and make better decisions in order to ensure that the company can find a way to grow in a diverse environment"" Xu said.In terms of the pandemic Xu said he believes the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has offered many opportunities to the company as it has changed the way the global economy works.""The pandemic has changed the way our business will operate in the future. That is to say companies need not only to be self-productive but also to be a service platform to connect others"" Xu said.In 2020 Xu proposed building an emergency network for trauma treatment originally in China but after the COVID-19 outbreak became a global event Xu decided to connect more partners to establish the emergency network globally.Moreover Xu said that people should have a better understanding of future outbreaks and the virus itself. Together with Harvard University Xu has set up the world's first database on COVID toe syndrome so that people can learn more about the new symptoms and understand how to prevent them in the future.""The global enemy needs to be faced by the whole world together and no one can be left out"" Xu said adding that the pandemic has brought people closer. Since people have had to communicate with each other through online applications during the pandemic they need to understand that communication and mutual trust are equally important when the world is facing the same enemy.Over the past year fundamental changes have taken place in almost every field and corporate social responsibility (CSR) is no exception.""At present in addition to conforming to the times and finding a new focus for carrying out our work transparency and accountability will also become the key elements for enterprises to fulfill their social responsibility. Many companies are talking about the importance of social responsibility. Now is the best time to put it into practice"" Xu said.For many years MEBO has been committed to making its own contributions to global challenges such as poverty reduction improving health care and promoting education by making use of its innovative technologies and products. It not only has creatively developed a brand new global training paradigm by closely collaborating with the Clinton Global Initiative the UN and the Belt and Road Initiative it is also carrying out extensive international rescue and technical support.For example MEBO was one of the first to respond after the explosion happened in Beirut Lebanon in August 2020.""We MEBO firmly believe that only by actively undertaking social responsibility can an enterprise have real vitality and competitiveness"" Xu said.Looking to the future Xu said that MEBO will firmly seize the great opportunity for China to build a new development paradigm to invest more capital and resources accelerate the innovation of regenerative medicine and build a worldwide and large-scale service trade platform.As more enterprises go global Xu expects Chinese entrepreneurs to embrace the global market and seize major historical opportunities to win in this key period of developing a broader market space in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The two friends — whose fathers are Broadway legends the writer Neil Simon and the producer Manny Azenberg — are collaborating on getting Ellen Simon’s new play “Ass” ready for its world premiere production at PTC Oct. 22 to Nov. 6.

As Ellen Simon recalls meeting her longtime friend Karen Azenberg “we must have met at the first opening night when my dad worked with her dad.”

That would have been the 1972 opening of “The Sunshine Boys” written by Ellen’s dad the playwright Neil Simon and produced by Karen’s dad Manny Azenberg — whose collaboration ran for decades.

Their meeting might have been even earlier Karen Azenberg said. “We were pre-teenagers” she said. “In those first years it was that our dads were friends so we found ourselves together.”

Manny Azenberg once told Playbill the theater publication that he met Neil Simon in 1963 nine years before “The Sunshine Boys” premiered playing theater-league softball. Azenberg played shortstop Simon was covering second. The first baseman was a ringer a college athlete-turned-actor who was the male lead in Simon’s “Barefoot in the Park”: Robert Redford.

The friendship between the daughters has endured and they’re back together this month in Salt Lake City. Karen Azenberg the artistic director of Pioneer Theatre Company and is directing Ellen Simon’s long-gestating and provocatively titled play “Ass” which will have its world premiere run at PTC Oct. 22-Nov. 6.

‘A woman’s voice’

The play is a mix of comedy and drama about strained family ties and the question of whether great art outweighs the artist’s bad behavior. At the center is Jule Waterman a famous sculptor in failing health who is creating what might be his last major work — prominently featuring the titular body part — while also dealing with Tory his ninth wife and his underachieving adult son Will.

“The son in this play is desperate for his father’s attention” Simon said. That’s one aspect of the story that mirrors her own life. “I was always trying to get [my dad’s] attention trying to be seen by him. … Growing up as Neil’s daughter I didn’t have an easy time of it.”

The sculptor she added “is so different in every single way from my dad except for his position in the world. The character is even at a more elevated position than my dad. Or at least he thinks himself so. … Visual artists tend to be sort of very showy and big.”

On the other hand “My dad was way more humble and very introspective” she said. “My dad was just a quiet shy family guy who was really introverted and into his own work and spent so much time in his own head.”

Azenberg has noted the autobiographical bent of the play. “I know there are parts of the play that are out of her real-life conversations but it isn’t for me to say which ones” Azenberg said. “Like her dad she takes the life experience and then goes away from it heightens it.”

Simon Azenberg said inherited many skills from her dad. “Her ability to rewrite — somebody’s got to get that gene out of the Simon line because it’s genius” Azenberg said.

The two friends — whose fathers are Broadway legends the writer Neil Simon and the producer Manny Azenberg — are collaborating on getting Ellen Simon’s new play “Ass” ready for its world premiere production at PTC Oct. 22 to Nov. 6.

Also Azenberg said “there’s a rhythm — it’s not the same rhythm but there is a rhythm to the words and the lines and the scenes and the way it plays to get you to the joke or to get you to the moment of [gasps] emotion.”

What’s different about Ellen Simon’s writing compared to Neil Simon’s is her voice Azenberg said. “It’s a woman’s voice. It’s a little more contemporary. And there’s an ability to immediately go to what is the drama narrative as opposed to the comic narrative.”

In comparing writing styles with her dad (who died in 2018) Simon said “I might be a tad darker. I’m going to risk everything saying this: I might be a little less rose-colored in approach. Things don’t wind up in a good way all the time. Resolution isn’t necessary for me as a writer.”

“Ass” Simon said “really walks the line between realism and buh-dum-bump comedy. It needs the timing that I learned growing up with my dad and watching his plays come to life. But I also tried to make it really poignant and really honest brutally honest about what it feels like — what does it mean — to be the progeny of somebody like that?”

Shifting to the ‘90s

Simon said she has been working on “Ass” for 15 years. In 2018 she workshopped it at PTC’s “Play-by-Play” reading series. The play was set to premiere at PTC in late March 2020 — until the COVID-19 pandemic shut everything down.

Simon spent months at home. “I live practically off the grid in Connecticut in the woods with my daughters” she said. “So we watched the animals and I tried to write a number of different projects.”

Trying to write during the pandemic the social unrest following the death of George Floyd and a contentious election was a challenge. “I had problems connecting and knowing what feels right for this moment right?” she said. “Our attention has been focused so much on so many gigantic huge issues that seem unapproachable or unfixable or devastating. They felt so biblically huge that it just didn’t feel like the right way to hold an intimate family story about ego and narcissism and bad communication.”

With those outside issues looming so large Simon decided in “a shift I had to make” to rewrite “Ass” as a period piece set in 1990.

Azenberg said Simon was contemplating the time change before the production’s 19-month postponement.

“What was important was we hold onto the story of family and relationships” Azenberg said. The social awakening of 2020 Azenberg said “is not the topic of the play. … So how do you navigate it in today without dismissing it and pretending the last 18 months haven’t happened?”

Simon said that when she started writing “Ass” 15 years ago “I felt at that moment that it was weird to do a memory play that didn’t have a good enough justification or context about why to set it 15 years prior. Now I can set it 30 years prior around the Berlin Wall coming down and the early ‘90s.”

The ‘90s she said “was a quieter simpler time. There’s no internet back then. There’s more urgency to the personal communication. What happens in the room is more alive I think in that era.”

‘We’re in this together’

Simon said she’s been given opportunities to premiere “Ass” in New York but she stuck with PTC so she could work with Azenberg to get it just right.

“She’ll look at me and I’ll know that she’s going to fix what she knew that I hated. And vice versa” Simon said. “We almost don’t need to speak. … It’s not just invaluable it’s — I don’t know how to say it — it’s magical.”

(Pioneer Theatre Company) The cast of Pioneer Theatre Company's production of Ellen Simon's play ""Ass"": (from left) Ben Cherry Laura J. Hall T. Ryder Smith Vince McGill and Elizabeth Ramos. The cast is gathered in a studio at the University of Utah's Department of Art and Art History.

Azenberg said that during rehearsals “we’ll sit there and sometimes we’ll just look and she’s like ‘I know’ and she makes a little ‘X’ [in the script]. Or I’ll just circle one word and she just whispers ‘I heard it’ and the next day she’ll come back with another line. …

“There’s an inherent trust that I’m not in this for myself we’re in this together” Azenberg continued. “I can say something to her about a line or a scene or a moment and she doesn’t have to at any point go to a defensive point about it. It’s a conversation between two people who not only have this history and know each other but have a trust about the work. And it’s about getting to the best of the work.”

Azenberg sees in her working relationship with Simon a connection to their fathers. “I think this is how our dads worked” Azenberg said. “They had this ability to have these candid conversations. And it was always OK because it was about the work. And I think somehow that has passed down to us.”

Their friendship started because of proximity Azenberg said. “You get brought to all of those opening-night events. And when you’re 12 you’re probably one of only two 12-year-olds at a thing like that” she said.

As the two got older each took an interest in dance and choreography. Simon said that when she performed at Jacob’s Pillow the renowned dance retreat and festival in the Berkshires in Massachusetts Azenberg and her dad attended — and Simon was in the audience when Azenberg performed there. (That history will repeat itself: Manny Azenberg who’s 87 is planning to attend a performance of “Ass” during its Salt Lake City run his daughter said.)

While their interest in dance and theater grew Azenberg said her sister Lisa and Ellen’s sister Nancy were tennis players. “There were these continuing parallels between the two families that were funny and odd” she said.

Because of their friendship — and living as they put it as “two Jewish girls” whose fathers both worked on Broadway — “we share a life history that no one really can” Azenberg said.

The households were separate Simon said but equally intense.

“When [our dads] came together and Manny and Neil put on shows with like George C. Scott — or all the huge actors with their personalities who came around — we were little girls watching” she said. “That’s a very exciting and terrifying environment to think about.”

Some of that intensity made its way into Simon’s script for “Ass.”

“Our cast looks at us and they’re like ‘Some of this is mean’” Simon said “and we look at each other and are like ‘No that’s the nice part.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZWNvcmRlci5jb20vbmV3cy80MDEyNzI0Ny9wdGMtc2F5cy1oYXMtcGxhbnMtdG8tYWNoaWV2ZS0xMDBwYy1jYXJib24tbmV1dHJhbGl0edIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PTC says has plans to achieve 100pc carbon neutrality,"ISLAMABAD: Chief Executive Officer of Pakistan Tobacco Company Limited (PTC) Syed Ali Akbar said Saturday that the company has ambitious plans for achieving 100 percent carbon neutrality and greener Pakistan.

CEO PTC has made this announcement Saturday on the occasion of the Climate Action Day.

In line with the British American Tobacco (BAT) vision the Chief Executive Officer of Pakistan Tobacco Company Limited (PTC) Syed Ali Akbar said that to build a better tomorrow we at PTC have also embarked upon our journey to achieve 100% carbon neutrality in our operations. In 2021 we at PTC installed a ""3.1MW On-site solar plant"" in both our factories and we have ambitious plans in the coming years to ensure that we are amongst the biggest contributors to BAT's agenda of achieving Carbon Neutrality. To further contribute to a greener Pakistan PTC in 2021 has planted and distributed more than 40+ million saplings he added.

On the occasion of the Climate Action Day British American Tobacco (BAT) BAT announced that it has signed up to the UN-backed Race to Zero campaign committing to net zero emissions by 2050.

According to the details the race to zero is the largest ever alliance committed to halving global emissions by 2030 and achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The campaign represents over 4000 businesses estimated to cover nearly 25% global of carbon dioxide emissions and more than 50% of GDP.

Kingsley Wheaton Chief Marketing Officer BAT said that our purpose of building ""A Better Tomorrow'' ensures that sustainability is front and centre in all we do. We are proud therefore to support the Race to Zero campaign. In 2020 alone BAT achieved a 30.9 percent reduction in emissions from its operations contributing to a 37.4 percent reduction against a 2017 baseline he added.

BAT was named as a 2021 Climate Leader by the Financial Times a European ranking that recognizes the top 300 of more than 4000 companies that have achieved the highest reduction in core greenhouse gas emissions in relation to revenues for the period between 2014 and 2019.

What will be your top priority if elected to office? I have learned from experience that cooperation collaboration and team effort pay off for citizens of Ironton. I pledge to work with my follow council members and the mayor to make the right decisions for the city.

What makes you the best candidate for the job? I bring a depth of knowledge and a breadth of experience to the council table. I have served as council member vice mayor and mayor so I understand the inner workings of council and city government.

What professional accomplishments are you most proud of? First all accomplishments result from a team effort. We have no progress without cooperative work. I am happy to work with the mayor council and the CAO in order to build projects that bring progress to our city. Here are a few accomplishments we have made:

• I was first elected in 1989; I then served as vice mayor from 1991-1993.

• We purchased the Penney’s building renovated it and opened a new city center that met ADA requirements. (1992)

• In this time we built and dedicated the water plant (1993)

• We cooperated and bought new fire trucks.

• We built a new modern fire station.

• As mayor of Ironton I signed the original contract with the State of Ohio to build the Ironton-Russell Bridge (which took 13 years to bring to completion). If I had to pick one from this list I would say this has brought great growth to our city.

• I worked with others to recruit St. Mary’s to open a medical facility in Ironton.

What would you do to increase cooperation in our government? I pledge to be a problem solver not a problem maker. I seek solutions never to be divisive. I think treating people with respect wins the day. We must communicate seek understanding and negotiate in good faith. I know that a cooperative spirit is contagious.

What can be done to improve streets in the city? Paving! Paving! Paving! I helped create the Street Paving Fund (Fund 13) in 2018 to improve city streets roadways and bridges. I helped obtain the 2021 bond to establish the Roadway and Bridge Improvement Fund (Fund 51). This will be used for the North Street Bridge repair along with various roadways within the City of Ironton. Additionally we are working with several different entities to have the streets and roads “ranked” or “scored” to set priorities for paving. We also have identified several grants enabling monies and funds for which we can apply to bring dollars into the effort of paving. This is a pressing need.

What is your plan for upgrading the water plant? In 2020 the Great Lakes Community Action Partnership (RCAP) began an assessment of the city’s water infrastructure and the water plant. We approved their plan for system upgrade and it went into effect in 2021. This includes a city website (for better communication) provides for all necessary improvements for the entire water system and provides for maintenance and upgrades for the water plant infrastructure as well (into the next decade).

Political Experience: Ironton City Council member 2017-current

Occupation: Personal finance and business teacher Portsmouth City School District Portsmouth; insurance agent Greg Gibson Insurance and Financial Services Ashland Kentucky

Civic Involvement: Volunteer for Ironton In Bloom and The Friends of Ironton Knights of Columbus Council #1405

What will be your top priority if elected to office? My top priority if elected will be to continue working to put the city in a financial position to address a range of issues including condemnation and demolition of blighted property waterline replacement street improvements stormwater management sewer plant improvements maintaining full time police and fire departments increasing recreation opportunities and being a quality partner for community and economic development.

What makes you the best candidate for the job? I have experience and an understanding of public finance. I have worked extremely hard over the last four years with mayors and other council members to move the City of Ironton forward and put the city in a position to begin addressing some of the issues it faces. Change doesn’t happen overnight but I believe change started four years ago and I would like to serve our residents for another four years to keep the momentum going.

What professional accomplishments are you most proud of? I am proud to have been elected four years ago by the residents of Ironton to serve and represent them on the Ironton City Council. This is a great honor and I work hard. I am also especially proud to be able to work in education for the last 17 years with so many kids. I enjoy being able to teach financial literacy to our youth which is something they will always use in their life.

What would you do to increase cooperation in our government? I have always said that I am willing to work with anyone who is also willing to move the City of Ironton forward. I believe open and honest communication is extremely important even though there may be different opinions. I have and would continue to work with whoever may be in city government positions.

What can be done to improve streets in the city? Earlier this year Ironton City Council passed legislation for the city to enter into a bond agreement to receive $2281000 for road and bridge improvements. The city plans to use this money to improve our streets and to use as a match for grant opportunities to secure even more money for street improvements. Improvements will begin next year 2022 and will include repaving one of the worst sections of roadway in town South Third Street from Lorain Street to the Ice Creek Bridge. This project includes waterline replacement and the city will receive a grant match of approximately $400000 to help complete this.

What is your plan for upgrading the water plant? Providing clean water to residents is a tremendous priority. Approximately two years ago the debt borrowed to build the Water Filtration Plant was paid off. The city invested an additional $600000 to make sure the Water Filtration Plant stayed in great shape. It is one of the best assets the city currently has. The city is set to focus on improving water lines throughout the city to continue providing quality drinking water. Because the Water Filtration Plant is not yet producing at full capacity with current users it is my hope the city can market and sell bulk water to other water providers to help offset the cost of future water line replacement projects.

The city is also working to address storm and waste water management through a process called “Integrated Planning.” With this the city has invested money to be able to address stormwater the sewer plant and pump stations holistically because they are all related to each other. The city’s contracted engineering firm is currently in the process of performing a feasibility study on how to best address these issues. I plan to hear what the engineer’s recommendations are and to work with council members and the mayor to continue improving the city’s infrastructure.

Professional Background: Business ownership marketing grantwriting development/funding behavior management.

Political Experience: None

Civic Involvement: President of local fraternal organization Rotary Columbus

What will be your top priority if elected to office? Community improvement and economic development by way of grants and 25 years of professional networking.

What makes you the best candidate for the job? The aforementioned 25 years of networking combined with a passion to see my community succeed and my tenacity to ensure that it gets done.

What professional accomplishments are you most proud of? To acquire a $200000 ADA grant for a special needs child and family.

What would you do to increase cooperation in our government? A quarterly town hall type event rotating between area schools churches and businesses allowing citizens greater access to elected officials. Providing at least a quorum of the legislative body in a more in casual environment than traditional council meeting settings would I believe allow for greater visibility and would lead to greater understanding.

What can be done to improve streets in the city? I believe coupling the federal infrastructure money on the near horizon with private money from companies like AEP would allow Ironton to accomplish three goals in one fell swoop. First and second those streets in town most in need of paving or repair could also be the first streets to begin underground utility construction to occur at the same time. This would allow our city to start the tedious but ultimately necessary process of removing overhead power lines. Those communities with little or no high tension wires ultimately find themselves with fewer instances of power outages as a result of storms or other unforeseen situations. The third and most importantly added benefit to an undertaking such as this would be good paying jobs in our community and a sustainable income tax base for our city to rely upon for years to come.

What is your plan for upgrading the water plant? EPA and other federally guaranteed grant and community gifts to upgrade and improve our aging water plant. Most grant opportunities have a contingency built in for maintaining an efficient system of operating procedures and are more generous in awarding future grants if those efficiency guidelines are adhered to. Essentially I believe the answer to the last two questions fall into the realm of our city engaging in a symbiotic relationship between development opportunity providers and overall infrastructure modernizing effort.

What will be your top priority if elected to office? To listen to the people and citizens voices with hopes of making changes they are concerned about.

What makes you the best candidate for the job? Not sure if any one particular candidate can be the best but I am willing to get in there and do my best because I care about our world and if our small town can set example of what is better for the people then I am willing to fight for what is “Best.”

What professional accomplishments are you most proud of? The fact that I have proven myself to the people in Ironton and the Tri-State area who doubted my integrity back in the ‘60s. Now they know for sure that I am serious about any project that I do get involved with. I also am a strong believer of doing the right thing for our city our children and the future of the world we live in.

What would you do to increase cooperation in our government? Look around at what is not working for the city employees or the people talk and listen for solutions to better the problems. Educate the citizens more as to why there is not enough money to correct a lot of their concerns. Look at budgets and explain to the public what can affordably be done. Make sure all city employees are treated as equals and they get paid for their worth.

What can be done to improve streets in the city? Look for any grants available to help a city in distress. Vote to raise the employment tax on those working folks. The employee tax has not been raised in over 50 years. Why do they keep adding more cost on to the water bills of people who are on a fixed income disability or Social Security? The City of lronton charges the lowest rate of employee tax of any city on the river. If we want to repave the streets the money has to come from somewhere and every little bit helps!

What is your plan for upgrading the water plant? Same as how do we improve our personal homes? Look for grants or loans available to get the money. Improvements cannot be made if there is not enough money available. Manpower also is a problem without good pay there are no employees to do the job.

What can be done to improve streets in the village? Overall we have wonderful streets to drive on in South Point. We currently have a water project going on which is vastly improving the quality of water our citizens receive.

Some disruption in traffic flow and pavement has happened but our contractors are doing a fantastic job of restoring the streets as they work. Also there are a handful of other streets that are slated to be shored up structurally and resurfaced soon.

What is your plan for upgrading the water plant? South Point is blessed to be one of the few places in the State of Ohio that controls their own waterworks.

The mayor village administrator and those of us on council have been actively working to invest in the modernization of the water plant.

I will continue to support funding for upgrades to the water and sewer department going forward while ensuring affordable rates. Also we must actively do our part in controlling waste and overuse to help us maintain our independence for years to come.

ST International HQ and SongEun Art Space by Herzog & de Meuron | The Strength of Architecture ...,"Project description by Herzog & de Meuron



A new home for SONGEUN and the people of Seoul

The new ST SONGEUN Building houses art spaces for the SONGEUN Art and Cultural Foundation – a non-profit organization established in 1989 – together with headquarter offices for ST International. Our experience designing contemporary museums increasingly focuses on how we can bring art and people together. How can we make a space that works for the art and the artist for the curator and the public?



When Herzog & de Meuron was commissioned to design the new SONGEUN Art Space in 2016 the ambition was clear: to create a cultural anchor that invites the public and broadens the exposure of Korean artists to the international contemporary art scene. By offering non-commercial art spaces within one of the most commercial areas of Seoul the project aims to strengthen SONGEUN's presence and significantly contribute to the city’s cultural topography and diversity.



A precise geometry in the heart of Cheongdam Dong

The site is located on the highest point of Dosan Daero a thoroughfare located in Cheongdam Dong in southern Seoul renowned for its international flagship stores restaurants and bars. While the neighborhood mainly consists of low-rise buildings the zoning allows for higher density towards the main street. Catalyzed by the area’s rapid transformation and densification a myriad of volumetric strategies responding to various plot regulations sit along the street front.



A sharp triangular volume distinguishes the ST SONGEUN Building. Resulting from the envelope specified for the site the building’s unified form maximizes the allotted floor area while exploring the sculptural potential of the zoning law. A tall front facade faces the main street and hosts the building’s core and a low back facade faces the garden where a more intimate scale defines the surrounding neighborhood. With 11 stories aboveground and 5 floors underground the completed building comprises over 8000 square meters.



A cultural anchor open to the city

The building expresses difference and openness despite or rather because of its hermetic street side. A cut out of the base invites visitors from the street to the main lobby and the intimate garden open to the public at all times. At the entrance a column wrapped in a seamless LED screen acts as an attractive lantern announcing current shows and a further place to present artistic content.



On the west side of the building the car ramp is treated as a sculptural volume. The curve of the descending ramp carves an opening in the ceiling of the underground exhibition space connecting this sunken gallery to the activity sound and light at street-level. With its concrete walls this cave-like space contrasts with the reflective finishes of silver leaf lining the ramp’s interior and parking space beneath. The ramp spirals around a triple-height void and defines the geometry of the grand staircase which acts as both a threshold and auditorium space for screenings and lectures leading to the second-floor galleries. An experimental and unexpected mix of art spaces offices and public areas unfolds above and below ground creating a new urban complex that invites the public to engage with contemporary art in Seoul.

“Hidden Pine Tree”: a face for SONGEUN

Enhancing the facade’s continuous surface the building is cut by only a few defining apertures. Two tall vertical windows puncture the south facade and create framed views of the city. A triangular opening spans between levels 3 to 8 on the east while the rear is almost completely glazed behind a layer of balconies which bring light and air into the offices.



The concrete mass not only carries the entire structure but also defines all space and ornamental surfaces. Using larch plywood boards rotated in a 1-by-1 meter grid the concrete facade is imprinted with wood grain patterns and expresses the meaning behind the name SONGEUN: “Hidden Pine Tree”. This unique texture invites the eye and hand to explore its different qualities bringing the building’s urban presence down to a tactile human scale.",,,,,,

If it looks good why change it?

Being similar to the TicWatch Pro 3 the new Ticwatch Pro 3 Ultra - GPS is the Bluetooth and the standard is the 4G/Cellular version - and comes with a slightly redesigned stainless steel and high-strenght nylon with fiberglass case. It measures 47x48x12.3mm and weighs 41g making it slightly lighter and just 0.1mm thicker compared to the TicWatch Pro 3.

It still comes with a standard interchangable 22mm watch strap and as it was the case with most Mobvoi watches you get a fluro rubber strap for ""challenging conditions"" on the GPS version and it appears that the genuine leather silicon strap will be either optional or coming with the 4G version giving the watch a bit more stylish look. There is only one color to choose Shadow Black.

The TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra still uses a 1.4-inch 454x454 resolution Full Color Always-on AMOLED display with a low-power FSTN display on top of it which uses minimal power. The FSTN monochrome display which has an option of customizing the color of the backlight (18 color options) gives you all the basic info like the time date step count workout stats and probably even more and extends the battery life in the so-called Essential Mode to up to 45 days. In the normal Smart Mode the battery life drops down to 72 hours which is not half bad considering it is the same 577mAh battery.

Other notable features include 810G military grade and IP68 which makes it extremely durable and screens are protected with Corning Gorilla anti-fingerprint cover glass.

Qualcomm and Mobvoi dual system

The SoC specifications are a bit weird as some sources list it running Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 4100 Platform with a Mobvoi dual processor system while other sources like the official press specification list says it is the faster Snapdragon 4100+ Wear dual system. We are waiting for confirmation so we'll update the article accordingly.

The 4100 Wear Platform is paired up with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of ROM and you still get Bluetooth 5.0 802.11bgn Wi-Fi and all the usual sensors like GPS+Beidou+Glonass+Galileo+QZSS Accelerometer Gyro Sensor HD PPG Heart Rate Sensor SpO2 Sensor Low Latency Off-Body Sensor Barometer and Compass as well as NFC for Google Pay. It also has integrated microphone and speaker.

The Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra runs on Google's Wear OS has 24/7 heart-rate and blood oxygen levels monitoring and 20+ professional workout modes.

Refresh comes at the same price

The updated TicWatch Pro 3 Ultra is already available at $299.99 ($300) the same price that the non-Ultra launched. On the other hand the TicWatch Pro 3 non-Ultra which is still a great smartwatch will be discounted to $255.

Spandragon vs Exynos: History repeats itself





Historically compared to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips Exynos processors have been:



Less powerful

Less power-efficient

More prone to overheating

Less capable when it comes to image processing

Worse in terms of battery life/endurance

Yes in case you didn’t know not all ARM processors are made equal. For example the image processing unit in Apple’s A15 Bionic is different to Huawei’s found in the Kirin 9000 and you guessed it - the same applies to Exynos and Snapdragon.



So to get to the point - Samsung basically sells “the same” smartphones under the names “Galaxy S21” “Galaxy S21+” and “Galaxy S21 Ultra” which are powered by completely different processors depending on where in the world you are. This wouldn’t be a “big deal” if this processor disparity didn’t affect everything from performance to battery life and photography - which is the focus of today's story.



While in past years things have been even worse this year’s Galaxy S21 phones powered by Exynos chips seem to be particularly underwhelming when it comes to video capture. Take a look at these samples courtesy of







As you can see although the Galaxy S21 Ultra you get all over the world is supposed to be the same phone it really isn’t. The Galaxy S21 Ultra with a Snapdragon processor renders video with noise but defined textures. It’s still very far from the leader in the class - iPhone 13 Pro but the videos it takes are usable.



When we move onto the Exynos Galaxy S21 Ultra things start to look very concerning for Samsung. Videos are soft cartoonish and just… bad - especially for a phone that costs so much money and wants to be the best camera phone of 2021.



Video on the Exynos-powered Galaxy S21 Ultra resembles GTA Vice City’s gameplay especially when it comes to rendering fine textures like grass. The bad picture quality is present on all lenses but it's particularly noticeable with the ultra-wide-angle camera and also with the primary shooter.



What's the (camera) problem... “technically”: Galaxy S21 Ultra with Snapdragon vs Exynos Yes in case you didn’t know not all ARM processors are made equal. For example the image processing unit in Apple’s A15 Bionic is different to Huawei’s found in the Kirin 9000 and you guessed it - the same applies to Exynos and Snapdragon.So to get to the point - Samsung basically sells “the same” smartphones under the names “Galaxy S21” “Galaxy S21+” and “Galaxy S21 Ultra” which are powered by completely different processors depending on where in the world you are. This wouldn’t be a “big deal” if this processor disparity didn’t affect everything from performance to battery life and photography - which is the focus of today's story.While in past years thingseven worse this year’s Galaxy S21 phones powered by Exynos chips seem to be particularly underwhelming when it comes to video capture. Take a look at these samples courtesy of Golden Reviewer . The Snapdragon-powered Galaxy S21 Ultra is on the left and the Exynos one is on the right.As you can see although the Galaxy S21 Ultra you get all over the world is supposed to be the same phone it really isn’t. The Galaxy S21 Ultra with a Snapdragon processor renders video with noise but defined textures. It’s still very far from the leader in the class - iPhone 13 Pro but the videos it takes are usable.When we move onto the Exynos Galaxy S21 Ultra things start to lookconcerning for Samsung. Videos are soft cartoonish and just… bad - especially for a phone that costs so much money and wants to be the best camera phone of 2021.Video on the Exynos-powered Galaxy S21 Ultra resembles GTA Vice City’s gameplay especially when it comes to rendering fine textures like grass. The bad picture quality is present on all lenses but it's particularly noticeable with the ultra-wide-angle camera and also with the primary shooter.









The Exynos is likely trying to overcompensate for its lack of ability to deal with low-light video by making everything smoother in an attempt to get rid of noise. Hence it ends up creating what looks like a painting. On the other hand the Spandragon-powered S21 Ultra takes natural-looking videos and lets the noisy parts of the image be noisy. This isn’t ideal by any means but it’s preferable in this case.



But guess what - none of the technicalities matter!

And in case you are in the US and feel good about yourself thinking the Snapdragon version of the Galaxy S21 is the better one I’ll have to disappoint you.

I mean... It’s a different phone folks! It’s a different phone... Here’s what’s going on: Samsung sells two versions of the Galaxy S21 series of phones which on top of differences in battery life and performance are worlds apart when it comes to taking videos especially in low-light! This is simply unacceptable and doesn’t sit well with a company of Samsung’s rank. We aren’t sure why and how Samsung is able to get away with this but it has been doing so forAnd in case you are in the US and feel good about yourself thinking the Snapdragon version of the Galaxy S21 is the better one I’ll have to disappoint you. While Snapdragon wins when it comes to videos the Exynos S21 seems to perform better when it comes to 3x portrait photos. On top of all the phones process pictures with different colour profiles. According to our ""Snapdragon 888 vs Exynos 2100"" comparison from February 2021 and several external reports battery life and performance also tends to swing back and forth.The saddest part about this whole situation is that the Galaxy S21 Ultra tested in the video above runs on recent software which means things aren’t going to get better. If Samsung intended and could fix these S21 camera issues it would have done so shortly after launch or even before that - as it should be.And if you thought it won’t get worse it looks like the upcoming Galaxy S22 series of phones are also expected to keep creating the same divide between US and ROW Galaxy flagships.

Moreover it looks like the upcoming Google Pixel 6 has a great shot at becoming the best Android camera phone of 2021 if not the best camera phone of 2021 overall. So the ball is in Samsung’s court.The Galaxy S22 Ultra can’t be “the best camera phone in the US” and be “an OK camera phone in the rest of the world” right? For the record: I don’t know about you but I am definitely not buying a Galaxy flagship here in Europe until Samsung takes care of what I'll call #Chipgate.

Now in this day and age the difference between smartphone cameras and smartphones in general is usually marginal and will depend on one’s taste. For example when taking photos the new iPhone 13 series favours heavy contrast while the Galaxy S21 likes to boost shadows and preserve highlights at any cost.On the video front it’s a totally different story. While Samsung technically offers more flexibility thanks to an additional 10x periscope zoom camera the iPhone 13 remains untouchable when it comes to dynamic range stabilization in dimly lit environments as well as overall picture quality. The last is especially true for low light where the iPhone 13 Pro dominates not only the Galaxy S21 Ultra  but any other flagship. You'd be able to see the two compete in our upcoming camera comparison!So the S21 Ultra is already pretty underwhelming compared to iPhone 13 Pro as far as video is concerned. However unfortunately for team Galaxy Samsung hasandproblems when it comes to the cameras.Of course we’re referring to the fact that for some reason Samsung sells Snapdragon-powered flagships in the US but resorts to using its own Exynos chips for the rest of the world.

According to the report Nothing is working behind the scenes to launch a smartphone sometime next year and a power bank by the end of the year.

Nothing Phone and Power Bank Tipped

Citing tipster Mukul Sharma as the source the report claims that Nothing could launch its first phone in early 2022. Thanks to Nothing’s partnership with Qualcomm one would assume that the handset will feature Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chipset under the hood.

If Nothing is planning to stick to the naming conventions of its earbuds we could expect the company’s first phone to be called something along the lines of Nothing Phone (1). Or it could be Nothing Ph(1) right?

Another speculation about Nothing’s first phone is with respect to its design. Just like Nothing ear (1) a transparent design is likely to be the highlight of the device. If that’s something Nothing is planning to implement it will be interesting to see if it will merely be a sticker like what we saw in Red Magic 6 Pro Transparent Edition or a truly transparent one.

Moreover we could expect Nothing to put the trademarks it acquired from Essential to good use. Does that mean Nothing will launch devices with crazy form-factors like the Essential Phone 2? That’s something we will have to wait and find out. As of now we don’t have the exact details about Nothing’s first phone.

The report further hints that Nothing is working on a power bank. Dubbed Nothing Power (1) the power bank may launch before the Nothing Phone. The power bank is said to be unveiled in the coming weeks or before the end of the year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZW4udmlldG5hbXBsdXMudm4vdmlldG5hbS1ob2xkcy1wb3RlbnRpYWwtZm9yLXJvYm90LWFpLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LWluc2lkZXJzLXBvc3QyMDk4MTIudm5w0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vietnam holds potential for robot AI development: insiders,"Vietnam holds huge potential in the application and development of new technologies amid the wide utilisation of robot and artificial intelligence (AI) in daily life activities.

Hanoi (VNA) – Vietnam holds huge potential in the application and development of new technologies amid the wide utilisation of robot and artificial intelligence (AI) in daily life activities.

Speaking at a recent webinar on media response and pioneering technologies OhmniLabs CEO Thuc Vu said the COVID-19 pandemic has fostered the development of the robotics industry.



In the future robot can facilitate remote travel as tourists may stay in Vietnam and shop in Paris visit a museum in New York and join a meeting in Tokyo he said expressing his hope that ‘Made-in-Vietnam’ robot may earn international recognition in terms of technology.

Bui Hai Hung head of VinAI Research a member of Vingroup said that with Vietnam’s development and potential in human resources there are plenty of room for AI's growth in the coming time.

He hailed ability of young Vietnamese as they are able to swiftly grasp new technologies and fully engage in international studies in a short period of time. This is a positive sign for Vietnam’s AI development capacity he added.

For his part Thieu Phuong Nam CEO of Qualcomm Vietnam Laos and Cambodia underlined that Vietnam is turning into an innovative hub in Southeast Asia.

Vietnam is also the third nation that Qualcomm has chosen to arrange its innovation challenge for tech startups as the firm has realised potential and ability of tech workers in the Southeast Asian nation.

The application of advanced technology is key for economic growth amid the shift toward higher-value-added activities Nam said.

In addition to a new phone Nothing is also developing its own power bank called the Nothing Power (1). The power bank is expected to launch before the end of the year reports Android Central.

The report doesn’t include any details about the key specs or features of the phone it is likely to be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset.

The firm earlier this week announced that it has raised $50 million from strategic and private investors and collaborated with chip-maker Qualcomm to power its upcoming products.

The startup said it will use the funds towards research and development in preparation for the brand’s entry into new product categories as part of its ecosystem.

“We look forward to working alongside Qualcomm Technologies and our strategic investors to achieve Nothing’s next phase of growth” Carl Pei Founder Nothing said.

Nothing is a privately-held company with backing from GV (formerly Google Ventures) and other private investors including Tony Fadell (Principal at Future Shape & inventor of the iPod) Casey Neistat (YouTube personality and Co-founder of Beme) Kevin Lin (Co-founder of Twitch) and Steve Huffman (Co-founder and CEO of Reddit).

The group which counts 11 luxury outlet villages in England Ireland Continental Europe and China said it has witnessed the quality of sales improve since lockdown ended and seen further proof of its retail-as-hospitality concept.

More from WWD

Similar to what luxury brands experienced as they navigated the various worldwide lockdowns BVSC saw sales shift to the digital sphere and a big uptick in spending from the local customer base.

“There is no return to normal” said Malkin founder and chairman of BVSC’s parent Value Retail. He added that the business has over the past 18 months become more sophisticated and rigorous in terms of its approach to customer acquisition and experience – and its relationship with the brands.

Priorities have changed: Malkin believes that open-air shopping today has a new appeal in the post-pandemic world with customers seeing the villages as out-of-town “oases of comfort and welcome.”

That’s why he believes it’s more important than ever to deliver a polished offer to visitors and to work as closely as possible with the brands to ensure that the inventory and merchandising are top notch. Indeed the company continues to pitch itself to brands as a “full-price customer acquisition platform” rather than a place to park out-of-season stock.

To that end Value Retail has made a series of key hires in the past month from big brands including Gucci Burberry La Rinascente and Ermenegildo Zegna.

They include Monica Marsilli formerly vice president and global general merchandise manager of Gucci and buying and merchandising director at La Rinascente and Paul Price formerly chief merchandise officer at Burberry and executive vice president of Lucky Brand Jeans.

Value Retail has also taken on Franck Collin former managing director at DFS merchandise director at the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton Group and Guillaume Desjardins who was previously global customer experience director of Givenchy and customer experience director of Europe for Ralph Lauren.

According to the company sales growth through the summer and into the early autumn has been accelerating while the average transaction value across the collection is up by 13 percent compared with 2019.

Villages including La Vallée in France; Maasmechelen in Belgium; Wertheim and Ingolstadt in Germany and Kildare in Ireland have seen their spend-per-visit rise by between 25 and 32 percent compared with 2019.

Story continues

Spend-per-visit at Shanghai Village has increased by 82 percent while Suzhou Village has risen by 47 percent in the nine months to September versus 2019.

In terms of total sales growth China has been leading the way with sales at Suzhou Village and Shanghai Village up 78 percent and 113 percent respectively compared to the same period in 2019.

According to Malkin BVSC has been hard at work refining its relationships both with its “guests” – as it refers to customers – and the brands. Malkin never wanted to go the e-commerce route – he sees these shopping villages more like luxury resorts than retail outlets – but that didn’t stop him and the team from delivering digitally during lockdown.

The villages offer virtual shopping with customers able to contact the boutiques directly make an appointment to shop virtually via phone video call email or WhatsApp.

The company said thst in the first half of 2021 14 percent of total sales across the villages in Europe came through virtual shopping services which launched at the start of 2021.

During the summer as footfall to the villages grew significantly BVSC said that the average transaction value of purchases made using the virtual shopping service also increased – to almost seven times the amount of those made in person.

Like luxury stores – and brands – BVSC has been hosting special events for customers and increasing its personal shopping offer at the villages.

Over the past year it has hosted more than 355 special brand events across its European villages and nearly 100 in China. “These events held both at our Village Apartments and within boutiques have contributed significantly to customer acquisition average transaction value and spend per visit” the company said.

Pre-pandemic many of the villages were tourist magnets with Bicester a prime example. Until COVID-19 struck Bicester outside Oxford was the second-most visited site for Chinese tourists in the U.K. after Buckingham Palace.

With inbound travel still recovering in the U.K. and various quarantine measures still in place worldwide tourism has slowly been recovering. BVSC said it saw “early green shoots of a tourism rebound” during the summer months.

Across the collection visits from Saudi Arabia increased by 146 percent; Kuwait by 102 percent; Qatar by 172 percent and UAE by 91. The number of Americans rose 7 percent year-on-year in the first nine months.",,,,,,,,,

But the difficulties continued this time with a 32-31 loss.

The Bulls’ painful end came in the final minutes with Tulsa (3-4 2-1 AAC) driving and facing fourth and 3 at the USF 20 with 1:52 remaining. But Davis Brin completed a 6-yard pass to Josh Johnson for the first down. Three plays later Shamari Brooks scored on a 3-yard run finishing the nine-play 42-yard drive and giving the Golden Hurricane the lead for good with 47 seconds left.

Before Tulsa’s winning drive the Bulls (1-5 0-2) had a chance to solidify their 31-26 lead with 4:20 remaining and possibly run out the clock. Facing fourth down and a foot at the USF 42 Bulls coach Jeff Scott decided to go for it with a handoff to Jaren Mangham. But Tulsa stuffed the USF running back short of the first down.

“I felt very confident in that situation with Jaren Mangham to get that yard” Scott said. “I decided to be aggressive in that situation. Get the yard and run out the clock that was the thinking. That is on me.”

Scott praised his team’s effort and fight after its rough start to the season. Entering the game the Bulls were one of only two teams — Arkansas being the other — in the 130-member Division I-A to have played four opponents currently ranked in the Associated Press Top 25.

“It’s a gut-wrenching loss not because we were up and then let it get away but because our guys played their tails off” he said. “I am so proud of the way they fought.”

For much of the game USF played like a winning team particularly in the first half behind a host of big plays.

On the first play of the second quarter there was linebacker Antonio Grier crunching Tulsa running back Anthony Watkins popping the ball loose grabbing it and taking off before being tackled at the Hurricane 12. Three plays later Mangham bulled in from the 1 giving the Bulls a 10-3 lead.

There was Grier again with 5:54 remaining in the second quarter intercepting a pass and returning it 69 yards for a touchdown to expand USF’s advantage to 24-10.

Between those highlights there was freshman Brian Battie weaving through and racing past Tulsa defenders ultimately returning a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown. It was the third 100-yard kickoff return in the Bulls’ 25-year football history.

Sprinkled among all that was a pass off a fake field goal to kicker Spencer Shrader that fell just short of a first down at the Tulsa 20 and a couple of stellar defensive stops inside the USF 5 resulting in two Hurricane field goals instead of touchdowns.

But there also were mistakes that proved costly.

With a minute remaining in the second quarter freshman Jimmy Horn fumbled a kickoff return. Tulsa capitalized Brin passing 37 yards to Sam Crawford for a touchdown cutting the Bulls’ lead to 24-20 heading into halftime.

USF extended its lead to 31-20 with 4:30 left in the third on the strength of a couple of nice defensive stops sandwiched between a 10-play 81-yard touchdown drive — freshman quarterback Timmy McClain running the final 8 yards for the score.

But the Bulls could have held a bigger advantage if not for another key mistake. With 9:52 left in the third they roughed Tulsa punter Lachlan Wilson wiping out a 54-yard punt return for a touchdown by Xavier Weaver.

McClain finished 10-of-25 passing with no touchdowns or interceptions. He also rushed 14 times for 24 yards and the touchdown. In the second half McClain and the offense put together only one consistent drive the 81-yarder in the third quarter. That lack of offense helped Tulsa outscore USF 12-7 in the second half.

The Hurricane severely outgained the Bulls in total yards 535-268 including a 172-32 advantage in the fourth quarter.

“You can’t really put words to this loss” USF linebacker Dwayne Boyles said. “It hurts.”

Just before The Blacklist took over NBC‘s ratings star James Spader had a hand in creating the iconic criminal informant he plays on the show. The long-running drama first featured Spader’s newly shaved head covered only by his [now] trademark fedora.

“I thought it would be a great moment when he surrenders himself and takes his hat off and the juxtaposition of the shot with him in the long hair [that you see in his mug shot]” he previously told Entertainment Weekly.

His reasoning came from a lot of thought about how a most-wanted criminal could fly under the radar and escape at a moment’s notice. Shaving his head meant less maintenance so that Raymond Reddington could focus more on chasing the bad guys rather than styling his hair.

“The way his life has been for the last 20 years he’s moving from place to place. I thought that he should have a haircut that he could do himself if he cares to or he could go to some barbershop in Cambodia and cut his hair in 10 minutes” he said.

Going into The Blacklist Season 9 the actor went a step further.

‘The Blacklist’ Season 9 star James Spader on Raymond Reddington’s new look

During an appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers Spader commented on the newly released Blacklist trailer where Reddington is shown entirely bald.

“I noticed from the clip you had a shaved head” Meyers said asking if it’s a bald cap.

“No no no” Spader replied. “It’s a shaved head. It isn’t that much further than this” he jokes.

He continues: “This year starts two years later and he was you know sort of lost for a couple of years and came down with terrible mange and so terrible hot spots and they had to get rid of it — yuck — and start over.”

It’s hard to tell if Spader is joking about the mange or not but season 9 will reveal all.

Spader revealed a Reddington-like experience in Mexico

Spader has opened up in the past about early jobs before he landed on acting. The Blacklist star once worked as a real-life conman posing as a yoga instructor after seeing a brochure for yoga classes. In the same Late Night interview the actor opened up about working for a small record store with owners who had many scripts for Quaaludes. During a trip to Mexico he spent much of his time looking for a drugstore that sold the drug in the most Reddington way possible.

“I was so bored and miserable that I killed two whole days out of I don’t know a five-day trip; two whole days in town trying to go to pharmacies because I’d been told they sell Quaaludes in pharmacies in Mexico” he said. “It was a bunch of bull s***.”

In the end he didn’t find the drug but ended the interview asking “where the hell are we headed with this?”

I just haven’t figured out whether that was yesterday or today.

You see I’ve been thinking about the Jon Gruden email situation and what it meant for Tampa Bay. Specifically whether his name should be removed from the team’s Ring of Honor.

My first reaction was no. And I felt that way for a variety of reasons.

Mostly it was because the Ring of Honor is as much about Bucs fans as it is the person being feted. The names emblazoned on the façade of the Raymond James Stadium upper deck signify moments and memories that are dear to folks who live and die with the accomplishments of a franchise.

So why should their recollections of Tampa Bay’s first Super Bowl title be besmirched by revelations of Gruden’s crass emails that were written after he was no longer on the Bucs sideline?

Just about the time I came to that conclusion the Glazer family announced that Gruden’s name would be removed from the Ring of Honor. Their decision was so swift and emphatic I was completely caught by surprise.

So were the Glazers wrong?

In retrospect I don’t think they were. They have been pioneers for inclusivity going back to the 1990s when they hired Tony Dungy as head coach and if they decide they want to disassociate themselves from someone who was using racist sexist and homophobic language they have every right. In fact they should be applauded for taking a stand.

So does that mean my initial impulse was wrong?

Yes? No? Possibly?

The idea of wiping the slate clean of Gruden’s presence might feel like justice for a lot of people — particularly people who have been forever marginalized by just the kind of rhetoric found in Gruden’s emails — but I think it’s a cursory solution to a centuries-old problem.

I fear we have taken a story of monumental significance and turned it into WWE-style entertainment on social media. Too many people it seems want to posture or gawk.

The moral may seem to be about one man’s downfall but it really isn’t. The backlash may seem aimed at mob justice but that’s just an opportunistic talking point.

The real issue is us. You me everyone.

What the Gruden saga has done is provided an opportunity to consider the words we use the biases we hide the misperceptions we cling to. Instead we’re just getting multiple choruses of condemnation.

There are those who slam Gruden then those who slam the so-called woke culture then those who slam everyone who doesn’t see the situation exactly as they do.

Dungy who is among the most honorable and kindhearted men I know was blasted on Twitter for his response to the Gruden news. Did he defend what Gruden said? No he said it was indefensible. Did he say Gruden was unfairly treated by the Raiders? No he said Las Vegas should have dismissed him.

So what did Dungy say that was so objectionable to so many people? Because of his Christian values Dungy said if Gruden showed true remorse and changed his mindset and actions he should be forgiven.

And Dungy was taken to task for that.

Think of the irony. We should loudly condemn someone like Gruden who mocked people who were different from him but it’s okay to mock Dungy for adopting a Christ-like approach to the issue?

Look I’m not trying to turn this into an us-versus-them debate. I’m not even sure who “us” and “them” are anymore. When I said this was a story of monumental significance I meant that it was a real opportunity for change.

Gruden was once celebrated in this community and across the NFL. He was funny headstrong macho and charismatic. Now it turns out behind closed doors he was also crude intolerant and lacked empathy. The point is he was one of us until he wasn’t.

So how many more people are like that around the NFL? How about in our neighborhoods? Our schools? Our police departments and government buildings? How about in our own families?

That’s the significance of the Gruden saga. It shouldn’t be that Gruden lost his job and his reputation. It should be that we can all afford to have a little more grace in our souls.

Some admittedly more than others.

Keeping their tradition alive of launching a new graphics architecture every two years this year NVIDIA introduces its Ampere GPU. The Ampere GPU is built upon the foundation set by Turing. Termed as its biggest generational leap the NVIDIA Ampere GPUs excel compared to previous generations at everything.

The Ampere lineup offers faster shader performance faster ray tracing performance and faster AI performance. Built on a brand new process node and featuring an architecture designed from the ground up Ampere is a killer product with lots of numbers to talk about.

The fundamental of Ampere was to take everything NVIDIA learned with its Turing architecture and not only refine it but to use its DNA to form a product in a completely new performance category. Tall claims were made by NVIDIA when they introduced its Ampere lineup earlier this month & we will be finding out whether NVIDIA hit all the ticks with its Ampere architecture as this review will be your guiding path to see what makes Ampere and how it performs against its predecessors.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Gaming Graphics Cards - The Biggest GPU Performance Leap in Recent History

Turing wasn't just any graphics core it was the graphics core that was to become the foundation of future GPUs. The future is realized now with next-generation consoles going deep in talks about ray tracing and AI-assisted super-sampling techniques. NVIDIA had a head start with Turing and its Ampere generation will only do things infinitely times better.

The Ampere GPU does many traditional things that we would expect from a GPU but at the same time also breaks the barrier when it comes to untraditional GPU operations. Just to sum up some features:

New Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)

New Turing Tensor Cores

New Real-Time Ray Tracing Acceleration

New Shading Enhancements

New Deep Learning Features For Graphics & Inference

New GDDR6X High-Performance Memory Subsystem

New 2nd Generation NVLINK Interconnect

New HDMI 2.1 Display Engine & Next-Gen NVENC/NVDEC

The technologies mentioned above are some of the main building blocks of the Ampere GPU but there's more within the graphics core itself which we will talk about in detail so let's get started.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series Pricing Per Segment

NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 30 series is made up of a diverse portfolio of graphics cards. Currently you will only be limited to the higher-end configurations starting at $499 US for the GeForce RTX 3070 $699 US for the GeForce RTX 3080 and $1499 US for the GeForce RTX 3090. NVIDIA themselves call the GeForce RTX 3080 the flagship graphics card and not the GeForce RTX 3090.

The RTX 3080 & RTX 3070 are both priced well and in-line with their predecessors but the GeForce RTX 3090 goes all out with a price of $1499 US. NVIDIA calls the GeForce RTX 3090 the ""BFGPU"" and as per the terminology it seems like this is a new marketing name for the Titan graphics card. It is likely that we could see a Titan based card under the Quadro branding with faster specs out of the box but the GeForce RTX 3090 is purely a gaming graphics card first with all the horsepower for intense professional and workstation workloads.

With that said the GeForce RTX 3080 replaces the RTX 2080 SUPER at the same price point and the GeForce RTX 3070 replaces the GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER at the same price point. Given this trend we might see the more mainstream variants cost just as much as their RTX 20 SUPER series cards but with a higher performance out of the box.

In addition to the specs/price update NVIDIA's RTX technologies are being widely adopted by major game engines and APIs such as Microsoft's DirectX (DXR) Vulkan Unreal Engine Unity and Frostbite. While there were only three RTX titles around the launch of the RTX 20 series cards NVIDIA now has at least 28 titles that utilize their RTX feature set to offer real-time ray tracing with more coming soon.

In addition to that with the upcoming consoles confirmed to feature ray tracing developers can also make use of the RTX technology to fine-tune future games for the GeForce RTX hardware. Currently NVIDIA has 13 game engines that are leveraging their RTX technologies for use in their upcoming and existing games while both Vulkan and DirectX 12 Ultimate APIs are part of the RTX ecosystem on the PC platform.

So for this review I will be taking a look at GALAX's flagship GeForce RTX 3080 HOF graphics card which goes for a premium of $2200 US since it is a limited edition product aimed at enthusiasts & modders.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Graphics Card

At the heart of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card lies the GA102 GPU. The GA102 is one of the many Ampere GPUs that we will be getting on the gaming segment. The GA102 GPU is the fastest gaming GPU that NVIDIA has produced. The GPU is based on Samsung's 8nm custom process node designed specifically for NVIDIA and features a total of 28 Billion transistors. It measures at 628mm2 which makes it the 2nd biggest gaming GPU ever produced right below the Turing TU102 GPU.

2 of 9

The new shader core on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture is 2.7x faster the new RT cores are 1.7x faster while the new Tensor cores are up to 2.7x faster than the previous generation Turing GPUs. The 2nd Generation RT core delivers dedicated hardware-accelerated ray-tracing performance & features twice the ray/triangles intersection with concurrent RT graphics and compute operations.

For the GeForce RTX 3080 NVIDIA has enabled a total of 68 SM units on its flagship which results in a total of 8704 CUDA cores. In addition to the CUDA cores NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3080 also comes packed with next-generation RT (Ray-Tracing) cores Tensor cores and brand new SM or streaming multi-processor units.

In terms of memory the GeForce RTX 3080 comes packed with 10 GB of memory and that too the next-generation GDDR6X design. With Micron's latest and greatest graphics memory dies the RTX 3080 can deliver GDDR6X memory speeds of 19.0 Gbps. That along with a bus interface of 320-bit will deliver a cumulative bandwidth of 760 Gbps.

On Twitter tech-leaker @momomo_us posted the specifications of the new MSI motherboards confirming the initial lineup for November’s launch. The company is now planning MEG Ace as the flagship model possibly with an enthusiast model MEG Godlike coming at a later time.

MSI will also introduce the MEG Unify series which is based on stealthy black aesthetics however those were not features in the teaser. The mid-range MPG series will include Carbon Wifi Edge Wifi and a new model called Force Wifi. It is unclear which model specifically was featured in the teaser but it will feature a silver color scheme. The entry-level MAG series will feature Tomahawk and Torpedo SKUs (do note that the specs below incorrectly mention LGA1200 socket).

It appears that only MAG and PRO series (not included in the teaser) will have a dedicated models with DDR4 memory support while MEG and MPG series would exclusively support DDR5 technology.

However the release of the GeForce RTX 3080 FTW3 hit a snag due to some testing faults Gamers Navy reported. Nvidia announced that the rollout of the GPU has been delayed after some issues were raised during testing.

Nvidia Exec Reveals Reason behind Product Delay

According to Nvidia product manager Jacob Freeman the team discovered ""a full 6 POSCAPs (conductive polymer tantalum solid capacitors) solution cannot pass the application testing"" Gamers Navy stressed in the report. Freeman said it to almost a week for the company's research and development team to address the problem. As they brought down the POSCAPs to four and added 20 multi-layer ceramic capacitors (MLCC) before shipping the boards the company eventually decided to put the EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 on hold because they were not able to produce and ship the 6 POSCAP-manufactured RTX 3080 FTW3 boards.

Product reviewers evaluating the GPU however were able to use a limited number of pre-manufactured units of the EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 FTW3 that had 6 POSCAPs Freeman added. He said Nvidia is coordinating with these reviewers to replace their boards with tested production units.

But those users who did advance testing of the product reported crashes including a flickering black screen while playing desktop games. These affected users said the crashes happen in games wherein their GPU boost clock rate hits around 2GHz or more.

The Gamers Navy report said that the reason behind those crashes cannot be determined as of yet. However they suspect that the cause could be the drivers poorly arranged GPUs power supply concerns or a combined set of problems.

Possible Solutions to Address RTX 3080 Crashes

Because of this some users analyzed the problem closely and found fixes to address the issue. First they used brand-new updated Nvidia drivers and dialed back the maximum GPU Boost clock in those RTX 3080 units to prevent the crashes from happening. However the root cause of the problem remains unknown.

Users can also attempt to slightly reduce the GPU's speed by utilizing third-party apps such as MSI Afterburner or EVGA's Precision X1. Such apps are normally used to increase clocking speeds but in this case they can be utilized as well to lower the clock speed as well.

However users who encounter crashing report that lowering the clock speed can also cause a system halt. To avoid this users can start with a slightly smaller number and not a dramatic reduction in clock speed to prevent crashing. Reducing this speed will also lower prime performance.

Undervolting or reducing the amount of power or voltage being directed to the graphics card is another wise choice that could enhance power efficiency but this may be too complicated for the average user.

As such users might have to wait for Nvidia's eventual updates and fixes to the EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 FTW3 before they could achieve ideal optimal crash-less performance from the card.

An agent hired by Inserra Supermarkets Inc. to promote the new store said its opening is slated for 7 a.m. on Halloween.

The occasion will mark the end of a years-long pursuit by public officials to bring back life to the heart of the Hamburg Turnpike business zone. The mall stood there for four and a half decades until it was demolished in February 2019.

Inserra a Mahwah-based grocery chain runs 23 ShopRite locations and two PriceRite Marketplace locations in Garfield and Paterson.

Its new store in Wayne at 74554 square feet will be its biggest supermarket yet. It will have a bakery staffed by professional cake decorators a gourmet kitchen with seating and a produce department with at least 400 offerings.

It will also feature Patsy's Butcher Shop named for the Inserra family patriarch whose vision for the company began with a humble meat counter at the intersection of Ridge Road and Second Avenue in Lyndhurst in October 1936.

This week much of the property in Wayne remained closed off by a chain-link fence. The parking lot was freshly paved and long rows of unused shopping carts lined the front of the supermarket.

Newly installed traffic lights dangled above the entrance to the former mall on Berdan Avenue.

The Inserra representative said the township's existing ShopRite which anchors Plaza Square shopping center at 625 Hamburg Turnpike will permanently close at 6 p.m. on Oct. 30.

Eric Davidson a spokesman for Florida-based Regency Centers Corp. which owns the shopping center said a new tenant has not been found to lease the 60000-square-foot space.

But a small firm based in Belgrade – L&L Site Services – is trying for a second time to crack the Missoula market by arguing it can provide lower prices and better service.

“There’s a definite need over there and Republic definitely wants to keep their monopoly” says Lance Johnson owner of L&L Site Services. “What we see across the state for a 95-gallon garbage can they are the highest (rate) across the state.”

Starting Monday morning in a room on the University of Montana campus the state Public Service Commission will hold a multi-day hearing on L&L’s request to get a “certificate of public convenience and necessity” for Missoula.

MTN News Lance Johnson owner of trash-hauler L&L Site Services of Belgrade.

The PSC doesn’t regulate garbage rates in Montana but it does decide whether a hauler can serve an area by issuing the certificate.

L&L and Republic officials will testify at this week’s hearing present witnesses and be cross-examined. Members of the public also get to testify and both sides are expected to line up customers to argue on their behalf.

Chad Bauer Republic’s municipal manager for Montana says the company provides good service to Missoula and that a competitor isn’t needed. He notes that L&L tried to get a certificate to serve Missoula three years ago and ultimately was denied by the PSC.

“It’s our opinion that there haven’t been any changes since then” he told MTN News on Friday. “We take great pride in meeting all of the county’s needs and we want to continue to support that.”

L&L initially won a certificate to serve Missoula in late 2018. But through a series of legal twists and turns the PSC reversed that decision 10 months later – and now L&L has reapplied.

Johnson says the reaction after getting denied the first time convinced him that Missoula needs a competing garbage service.

After the PSC initially approved his permit in October 2018 customers began calling asking about service – and that didn’t stop after the PSC reversed itself in August 2019 he says.

“It wasn’t really publicized so people still thought we had the permit” Johnson says. “We still had a lot of people from Missoula County calling us signing up for service – and that’s when you find out more truth of what’s going on finding out there’s a huge need for it.”

The current case before the PSC isn’t the first time L&L has tangled with Republic.

L&L began hauling construction trash in 2006 in Gallatin County and then decided to apply for a certificate to compete against both Republic and the city of Bozeman in Gallatin County for regular garbage pickup.

It won that permit and started competing with Republican in suburban and rural areas outside Bozeman where Republic had been the only trash hauler.

“We came in at a fair price very competitive and put it on the street and ever since then Republic’s prices have been coming down to get closer to ours” Johnson says.

Johnson says L&L charges residential customers in Gallatin County anywhere from $78 to $86 per quarter or $312 to $344 a year and offers discounts to certain customers.

Republic charges customers in Missoula $360 a year Bauer says.

Republic also owns the only landfill in Missoula County that takes trash not only from Missoula but from towns all across western and southwestern Montana.

But Johnson says Republic has made it clear that if he wins the certificate it won’t let him bring Missoula trash to its landfill. Johnson says he’s already arranged to take the trash to a landfill near Helena.

“Republic has a good monopoly going and this vindictive selfish attitude towards Missoula County and the citizens is a good example of why Missoula needs another choice” he says.

Bauer says no decision has been made on whether L&L could use Republic’s landfill.

“We evaluate all applications to use the landfill” he says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8xNi9lcGhyYWltLW1jZG93ZWxsLWhlYWx0aC13ZWxjb21lcy1wc3ljaGlhdHJpc3QtdG8tbWVkaWNhbC1zdGFmZi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ephraim McDowell Health welcomes psychiatrist to medical staff - The Advocate-Messenger,"Ephraim McDowell Health welcomes psychiatrist to medical staff Published 8:30 am Saturday October 16 2021

The Secretary-General commended the development describing it as a “critical step” which is in line with a roadmap for peace adopted in September by the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region an intergovernmental organization of 12 African countries.

Some leaders of the main rebel alliance the CPC have reportedly welcomed the ceasefire.

The CAR has faced cycles of rebel violence since the 2013 ouster of former leader François Bozize and despite the signing of an agreement between the Government and 14 armed groups two years ago.

A UN mission known by the French acronym MINUSCA has been in the country since 2014 with a mandate to protect civilians and support peace processes.

Respect the ceasefire

“The Secretary-General calls on all the other parties to immediately respect this ceasefire and renew efforts to advance the implementation of the 2019 Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation” the statement said.

He further called for the sides to engage constructively through an inclusive political dialogue.

To be honest I didn't find the first 10 to 15 minutes that convincing. It was a bit back and forth it was a very intense game. But then the first half from the 30th minute onwards was gigantic. Our opponents tried to counter us with intensity. The opener came after three or four minutes which suited us well of course. After that we absolutely dominated the game. The distribution of space was really good today. We always had a lot of players between the lines especially behind the two sixes. That's how we kept injecting speed into the game.""

Reaction from the home camp:

Gerardo Seoane (Bayer Leverkusen head coach): ""FC Bayern did very well today. When they have a great day and we don't you can fall foul of results like this. They were also very effective today.""

Jonathan Tah (Bayer Leverkusen): ""We weren't awake and at it enough from the off. That was what we had set out to do. Then Bayern got going and it made us unsettled. That mustn't happen to us. We lacked compactness so we switched to a three-man defence in the second half. In the second half it was also about not conceding any more goals. It was clear that it would be difficult to catch up to Bayern numerically.""

Lukáš Hrádecký (Bayer Leverkusen): ""We didn't deserve a full stadium this great atmosphere alongside our performance today. The first goal threw us off-course. Then the other goals came in a flurry of a few minutes. That was the end of it. At half-time the game was already over for us. Everyone has to ask themselves whether they gave everything. We'd set ourselves a lot of targets.""

The surprise says Robert Gehrke is who is ...,"At the Utah Legislature the climate may finally be changing on climate change — or at least some lawmakers in the Republican majority are getting serious about reducing pollution along the Wasatch Front.

No matter how you package it the two invariably go hand-in-hand with benefits for both.

So it was a pleasant surprise when Senate Majority Assistant Whip Kirk Cullimore announced on Tuesday he would sponsor what is likely the most ambitious and sweeping clean air bill the Utah Legislature has seen.

Cullimore’s proposal — developed with the nonprofit O2 Utah founded by former Salt Lake City mayoral candidate David Garbett — would seek to cut harmful pollutants in half by 2030. To do it Cullimore is entertaining ideas that might not fly among some of his Republican colleagues and floating big ideas that were steadfastly resisted by the Utah Legislature a decade ago.

For example he wants to reduce auto emissions by implementing tiered pricing for vehicle registrations — cleaner cars would pay less to register the most polluting automobiles would pay more.

It’s a good idea that takes aim at tailpipes — the source of roughly half of the air pollutants in a typical inversion — and attempts in some measure to attach a price to the pollution.

A drawback is that many who drive older dirtier cars aren’t doing it by choice. They simply can’t afford to upgrade. So Cullimore is embracing a proposal by Rep. Jeff Stenquist R-Draper to run a sort of state-level “Cash-For-Clunkers” program.

Stenquist’s House Bill 176 last year would have allowed anyone who lives in a nonattainment area for air quality and owns a car built before 2003 or a vehicle that failed an emissions inspection to receive up to $5500 (depending on their income) toward the purchase of a low-emission or zero-emission vehicle.

Cullimore also said he hopes to push the expansion of cleaner-burning Tier 3 gasoline.

The senator wants to impose new building standards for new homes and commercial structures — the source of 39% of our pollution — that improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions. He also wants to provide incentives to retrofit older buildings to make them more efficient like the state tried to do with an incentive to replace wood-burning stoves.

Perhaps most surprisingly he said he would push for a “simplified cap-and-trade permitting system” for large industrial polluters. While the details are still vague presumably it would put a ceiling on the amount of pollutants that can be emitted and require any new emissions to be offset by other improvements.

More than any other of the proposals even flirting with cap-and-trade shows how far Utah Republicans have come. Back in 2007 then-Gov. Jon Huntsman signed Utah onto the Western Climate Initiative a group of Western states and Canadian provinces that agreed to a cap-and-trade system.

Republican legislators at the time passed resolutions demanding the state withdraw from the accord and enacted legislation to hinder unilateral climate action by the governor. In 2011 Utah and several other Western states withdrew from the initiative.

Cullimore also wants to establish an air quality research unit at the University of Utah and a fund to help pay for asthma expenses exacerbated by Utah’s poor air quality.

All of this is going to cost money potentially quite a bit of money and Cullimore is counting on the Biden Administration getting climate and infrastructure legislation across the finish line to help pay for some of it.

“This upcoming session we’re likely to see significant federal funds” he said during Tuesday’s news conference. “A lot of these federal funds are going to have earmarks and parameters and we anticipate a lot of those parameters will allow us to use these funds to address air quality and environmental concerns.”

The benefits of advancing an ambitious air quality plan are obvious. A study released last year by Isabella Errigo and a team of Brigham Young University scientists found that Utahns could be losing roughly two years on their life expectancies due to poor air quality. And pollution is costing Utah’s economy in the neighborhood of $2 billion a year in health care expenses lost work time and indirect costs like lost tourism and decreased growth.

Now I’ve criticized Cullimore in the past for appearing to use his position in the Legislature to write laws that help landlords evict renters and in turn help his father’s law firm which handles more evictions than any other firm in the state. His emergence as a leader on air quality and climate issues doesn’t erase any of those concerns.

But for too long the issue of air quality had been a focus for Democrats like Reps. Patrice Arent and Joel Briscoe. It’s refreshing to see over the last several years Republicans like Reps. Stenquist Ray Ward and Stephen Handy and Sen. Todd Weiler advancing the cause.

With Cullimore joining the cause there is a Republican with a leadership position joining the fight and thinking big. Maybe it’s too big for some of his GOP colleagues but embracing such an ambitious plan offers the potential to reframe how the Legislature approaches Utah’s climate challenges and push the body to take some significant steps toward improving the air we breathe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vZW4uYXMuY29tL2VuLzIwMjEvMTAvMTcvc29jY2VyLzE2MzQ0ODY2NThfMzIxNjEwLmh0bWzSAUxodHRwczovL2VuLmFzLmNvbS9lbi8yMDIxLzEwLzE3L3NvY2Nlci8xNjM0NDg2NjU4XzMyMTYxMC5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bayern Munich score five first-half goals against Bayer Leverkusen,"Bayern Munich became the third-fastest side in Bundesliga history to score five goals in an away match as they raced into a 5-0 lead against Bayer Leverkusen inside 37 minutes.

The reigning champions tasted their first defeat of Julian Nagelsmann's tenure at home to Eintracht Frankfurt prior to the international break but they responded in style at BayArena.

Lewandowski gets the ball rolling

After going back-to-back league games without scoring for the first time in two years Robert Lewandowski flicked Bayern into the lead inside three minutes in Sunday's match.

Lewandowski scored a second on the half-hour mark and Thomas Muller was next on the scoresheet four minutes later.

Serge Gnabry added a quickfire brace of his own the Germany international dinking in Bayern's fourth of the contest before slotting in number five two minutes later.

Only twice before in Bundesliga history has an away side scored five goals in a quicker time from kick-off – Borussia Dortmund against Schalke (23 minutes) and Karlsruhe versus Frankfurt (30 minutes) both in 1964.

Bayern thrashings

There have been 10 occasions when teams have scored five or more goals in the first half of a Bundesliga game this century with Bayern responsible for six of those 45-minute thrashings including when they put five past Dortmund before the break in March 2018 on the way to a 6-0 win.

Level on points in first and second before the weekend the gulf in class between the two teams became apparent as Bayern put their hosts to the sword with a brutal and brilliant first-half performance.

“It sounds a bit strange when you’ve scored five goals but we could have had six or seven in the first half today” Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann told broadcaster DAZN.

The 31-time German champions smashed in four goals in the space of seven minutes in the first half to humiliate a young Leverkusen side and go a point clear of Borussia Dortmund at the top of the table.

“It was clear after 45 minutes that the three points were coming to Munich” said Lewandowski who kick-started the rout with the opening two goals.

“We knew that we would have to play our football from the beginning today and the result shows how well we played.”

‘Best team in Germany’

It took Bayern less than four minutes to go ahead Lewandowski converting a Dayot Upamecano cross with a brilliant backheel to net his eighth goal of the season.

Leroy Sane hit the post shortly afterwards as Leverkusen struggled to control a sparkling Bayern attack.

On the half-hour mark the visitors carved through their opponents on the counter-attack with Alphonso Davies bursting into the box to set up a poacher’s finish from Lewandowski.

Thomas Mueller quickly made it 3-0 deflecting a Niklas Suele shot past a helpless Lukas Hradecky.

Any hope of a Leverkusen fightback was buried just seconds later as Mueller set up Gnabry with a low cross to make it 4-0.

Gnabry added a fifth on 37 minutes after a sharp one-two with Leon Goretzka.

Leverkusen rallied in the second half Kerem Demirbay forcing a save from Manuel Neuer before Patrik Schick pulled a goal back.

“Bayern showed us today why they are the best team in Germany and one of the best in Europe” said Leverkusen coach Gerardo Seoane.

English defender Omar Richards came on as a second-half substitute to make only his second appearance for Bayern since signing from Reading earlier this year and Lucas Hernandez started the game despite being expected in court in Spain on Tuesday.

SALISBURY — Kaman Distribution Group has acquired Salisbury-based Integro Technologies.

Integro Technologies was founded in Tom Campion’s home in Pennsylvania in 2001 and moved its headquarters to Salisbury in 2005. In its 20-year history Integro has evolved into an award-winning international business anchored at 301 S. Main St.

Integro is an industrial automation company that specializes in machine vision inspection. The company’s tech can be found at the Rowan County Courthouse where thousands of visitors have walked through a temperature scanning tunnel as part of the court’s COVID-19 safety protocols.

Based in Connecticut Kaman Distribution Group is a $1.2 billion national distributor of highly engineered products and services with over 220 locations in the U.S.

“We are very excited to have Integro join KDG” Ben Mondics president and CEO of Kaman Distribution Group said in a news release. “Integro is a leading player in machine vision inspection and we look forward to pairing their capabilities with our national scale to bring significant value to our respective customers and suppliers. The founders of Integro have built a great organization with a talented and dedicated group of associates and we look forward to their continued contribution and success as part of KDG.”

Integro will be a part of Kaman’s automation business unit but will support the entire platform across a number of industries including pharmaceutical medical automotive aerospace consumer products packaging and logistics.

“We are very excited to partner with KDG and leverage their national footprint and value-added capabilities” Tom said in a news release. “Working as a team we have always improved and evolved to accomplish far more than we could ever achieve individually. Joining forces with KDG represents an important milestone in our journey to help accelerate our growth.”

Tom’s brother and current Integro president Shawn Campion said the company has been approached by close to 30 companies with acquisition proposals since 2013. Kaman Distribution Group he said stood out from the pack.

“Kaman Distribution Group reached out along with a number of other companies and we felt like they were a good fit” Shawn said. “They have a new strong management team and they have ambitious goals which will align with our ambitions also. It felt like a great fit and the right timing.”

The acquisition Shawn said won’t change much in Integro’s day-to-day operations.

“We’re maintaining the same healthcare same 401K same vision and insurance same bonus structures same commission same everything across the board” Shawn said. “It’s not disruptive or going to be a painful event in their lives. We want a very smooth transition and to keep people focused on what we do best and that’s to develop solutions for engineering customers and that’s what we’re doing.”

The deal also doesn’t mean Integro has plans to leave Salisbury anytime soon.

“It’s not purchase us and move us” Shawn said. “It’s purchase us and grow us.”

Shawn said there could be plans down the road for Integro to become a technology center for the southeast but there are still many details to work through.

Integro announced a $2.67 million expansion of its Rowan County facility in late 2020 that would add 30 workers to its ranks bringing its total number of employees to over 70.

While the physical expansion to add 2500 feet onto the current facility hasn’t materialized Shawn said the company has already started working toward its goal of hiring 30 employees.

“We began hiring almost immediately” Shawn said. “We’ve been hiring steadily for a variety of positions. A lot of them are high travel positions working in Amazon and Walmart logistics centers and other distribution centers across the country. We continue to seek talent with work ethic and drive to take on new technologies and apply them in the industry.”

The expansion was incentivized by level one economic development investment grants from both the Salisbury City Council and the Rowan County Board of Commissioners. Those grants will have the county return 75% of the company’s paid taxes for a five-year period contingent on Integro meeting certain employment requirements.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1YnVzaW5lc3NsaW5lLmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvbW0tZm9yZ2luZ3MtYWNxdWlyZXMtY2Fmb21hLWF1dG9wYXJ0cy9hcnRpY2xlMzcwMzAwNTUuZWNl0gFtaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHVidXNpbmVzc2xpbmUuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9tbS1mb3JnaW5ncy1hY3F1aXJlcy1jYWZvbWEtYXV0b3BhcnRzL2FydGljbGUzNzAzMDA1NS5lY2UvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MM Forgings acquires CAFOMA Autoparts,"MM Forgings (MMFL) has announced that it has acquired acquired CAFOMA Autoparts Pvt Ltd (CAFOMA) a leading supplier of machined crankshafts catering to the tractor and industrial segments for a sum of ₹28 crore in cash and ₹5 crore of debt.

Along with investments at MMFL’s own facilities and the acquisition of CAFOMA MMFL’s machining capacity of crankshafts will be enhanced to 25000 crankshafts per month in South India. With these a significant presence in South India will be established claimed the statement.

MMFL expects this acquisition to add about ₹100 crore plus of turnover with the development of new parts and markets. Thus the acquisition of CAFOMA will unlock capabilities of both MMFL and CAFOMA.

Over the next few months MMFL’s total capacity of machined crankshafts will be about 60000 crankshafts per month.

This will launch MMFL into the top league of integrated crankshaft suppliers in India with in-house forging and machining facility it said.",,,,,,,,,

Shots were fired today on Talking Smack when Seth Rollins implied he will induce Edge to make his rightful exit from WWE similarly to his past Hell in a Cell opponents Jon Moxley (fka Dean Ambrose in WWE) and Bray Wyatt after next Thursday's Crown Jewel.

In his interview Rollins mentioned that his HIAC track record is quite polished. And thanks to his dangerous schemes in this type of structure he can make anyone disappear which he proceeded with telling panelist Kayla Braxton that if she doesn't believe him she should go ask his former challengers. But then he backtracked his initial remark by saying that option is off the table since ""Two out of the three aren't here anymore"" referencing Moxley and Wyatt.

As most recall Rollins and Moxley crossed paths in the main event of Hell In A Cell back in 2014 where Rollins picked up the victory in less than 15 minutes. And then again in 2019 when he battled ""The Fiend"" which ended with an awkward referee stoppage. The latter was ranked by fans as the ""Worst Match of the Year"" on several platforms.

""I'm going to reiterate what everybody knows: Edge is afraid of me"" Rollins began. ""He thinks he has it covered but look he doesn't have it covered. In fact I've actually spent more time inside the cell than Edge has and I'm capable of being more dangerous inside the cell than he is.

""Look if you don't believe me you can just ask the guys that I've been in the cell with. Oh that's right two out of the three of them aren't here anymore [he lets out a cackling laugh].""

So far in their long-standing rivalry this year both Edge and Rollins are tied 1-1 with Edge gaining his first win at SummerSlam and Rollins scoring his victory at the Super SmackDown show in Madison Square Garden last month.

On this week's Supersized SmackDown WWE Hall of Famer Edge delivered his final words to Seth Rollins ahead of their Hell in a Cell match this Thursday at the Crown Jewel pay-per-view.

Edge admitted that Rollins invading the Copeland residence a few weeks ago was right out of his playbook.

""I should have seen it coming"" Edge said. ""It's straight out of my playbook. Remember years ago when I slapped Cena's dad? I underestimated you just like you underestimated me at SummerSlam.""

Later in the promo Edge threatened to invade Rollins' home to confront SmackDown Women's Champion Becky Lynch.

""Now I could go to your home and have a chance encounter with Becks"" Edge said. ""Heaven knows we have some history. But I'm not going to do that.""

Edge was referring to his in-ring segment with Lynch on SmackDown 1000 in 2018. During that segment Edge tried to convince Lynch that she was making a mistake by ruining her friendship with Charlotte Flair. Lynch then asked Edge to leave the ring unless he wants her to injure his neck again. The segment ended with a brawl between Lynch and Flair as a helpless Edge looked on.

""Big Time Becks"" responded to Edge's promo by posting a picture of their segment from a few years ago. Her tweet can be seen below.

Earlier this month a Twitter user who goes by @JumanneWay posted a video of himself on Twitter trashing the store of his employer Subway in order to get Meek Mill's attention in hopes of getting signed. The dire attempt appeared to fall on deaf ears by most of the internet until it became a trending topic on Twitter on Sunday (Oct. 17). In one of the videos the man trashes the back of the establishment purposefully spilling food contents all over the floor.

""At Meek Mill. Tell Meek Mill to sign me"" the man says while vandalizing the store. ""Let him know I'm trying to get signed to DreamChasers. Fuck all this Subway shit. Fuck all this Subway shit bro. At Meek Mill let him know I'm trying to get signed. I'm deadass. I'm done working at Subway. Deadass.""

Strangely the man says his stunt is not for clout. ""At Meek Mill. Let him know DreamChasers I'm not with none of this clout-chasing shit bro"" he says. ""All of this clout-chasing shit is temporary bro. Deadass. I don't want to do this. I really don't want to be doing none of this.""

In a strange twist after destroying the store the man then claimed he would be cleaning up the mess. ""I gotta clean all this up"" he adds. ""This is the aftermath. I'm trying to reach out to Meek. Like I said or anybody that's in a position to help put me in a better position. This right here bro this is like...I don't think y'all know how much I had to go through to get to this point that this became acceptable to me. This isn't...this is crazy man.""

Meek Mill who recently released his new album Expensive Pain has yet to respond to the videos. However Subway has reportedly fired the man since the clips went viral. In a statement released to NewsWeek the fast-food franchise confirmed the unnamed worker in the video was a former employee who has been fired for his actions. ""Subway and our network of franchisees take health and food safety extremely seriously and don't condone any behavior that violates our strict policies in these areas"" the statement read.

The man also posted video placing food items on the restaurant's toilet.",,,,,,,,,

TAMPA FL — There is good news for Tampa Bay residents dreaming of taking a long relaxing ocean voyage and businesses eagerly anticipating the economic impact from the return of cruises to Port Tampa Bay.

Port Tampa Bay and Royal Caribbean International celebrated the return of cruising on Saturday with the arrival of the Serenade of the Seas a week ahead of her first commercial cruise and first revenue cruise from the port in more than 18 months. Port Tampa Bay welcomed Royal Caribbean’s Serenade of the Seas to Cruise Terminal 6 before she departs on her maiden voyage next Saturday.

This will be the first cruise ship to depart from Port Tampa Bay since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a no-sail order on March 14 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Port of Tampa Bay

Port Tampa Bay President and CEO Paul Anderson presides at a news conference Saturday as the Serenade of the Seas made its way into Port Tampa Bay. The Royal Caribbean cruise will be followed by cruises with Celebrity Cruises and Carnival Cruise Line in November and Norwegian Cruise Line in December departing from Port Tampa Bay.



""The return of cruising will have a far-reaching impact on our region with many small and local businesses standing to benefit"" Port Tampa Bay President and CEO Paul Anderson said. ""Business Research & Economic Advisors estimated that a 3000-passenger ship generates an average of $334000 in passenger and crew onshore spending per call in a home port city."" Anderson was on hand at a news conference at the Joseph Garcia International Building at 1101 Channelside Drive in Port Tampa Bay to celebrate the cruise comeback Saturday. Joining him were Russell Benford Royal Caribbean Group vice president of government relations Americas; Santiago Corrada president and CEO of Visit Tampa Bay; and Vicky Evans assistant vice president for The Auto Club Group.

Port authorities say the Tampa port is becoming a coveted destination.

""The development of Sparkman Wharf Water Street Armature Works and other hotel dining shopping and entertainment projects in Tampa continues to boost the attractiveness of the Bay area as a home port"" Anderson said. ""Cruise visitors to Tampa have the convenience of accessing a nationally top-ranked airport secure parking garages – just steps away from all three cruise terminals world-class beaches and local attractions like Busch Gardens the Florida Aquarium and Ybor City."" He noted that the return of cruise ships to Tampa will not only impact the cruise lines and the port but will have a far-reaching impact on Tampa Bay in general. ""Tampa has long been regarded as an attractive home port thanks to the variety of quality hotel and dining options our world-class beaches and nearby attractions"" Anderson said. ""The return of the cruise industry will have a far-reaching economic impact on our region."" Florida is home to some of the busiest ports in the world 15 in all including Port Miami Port Canaveral Port Everglades Port Manatee Port Tampa Bay Port St. Joe Port of Palm Beach Port of Fort Pierce Port of Pensacola Port of Panama City Port of Fernandina and Port of Key West. Not only are the ports the berths for some of the country's biggest cruise lines but are integral to international trade importing and exporting cargo to and from countries around the world.

After losing $14.1 billion in trade during the pandemic Michael Rubin program administrator for the Florida Seaports Transportation and Economic Development Council said Florida's ports are poised for a major comeback. ""While most individual seaports experienced declines consistent with the overall trend for 2020 Florida's 15 seaports are resilient and we expect to see a near complete recovery in 2021"" said Rubin. The cruise industry is getting some help to ensure that there's smooth sailing ahead. In late July DeSantis and DOT Secretary Kevin Thibault allocated $250 million in federal relief to shore up Florida's seaport industry and replaced the 169000 jobs and nearly $23 billion lost during 2020. Port Tampa Bay's share was $20120889.

NASSAU BAHAMAS — The entrepreneur behind the proposed $2 million restoration of Paradise Island’s lighthouse said yesterday that he has “every confidence” the Davis administration will honor his Crown land lease.

Toby Smith principal of Paradise Island Lighthouse & Beach Club company in an interview with Eyewitness News said: “I have every confidence that Prime Minster Davis is going to act in the best interest in what I’m a proposing and honor the Crown land lease agreement so that we can employ Bahamians and try and pull ourselves out of this economic situation we are in.

“The revenues generated by Paradise Light House and Beach Club will remain in The Bahamas.”

Smith said he is still pursuing legal action over the matter.

“My case remains in the hands of Munroe and Associates and my diligent expert legal team which I’m sure will bring about a favorable result” he said.

Smith said he is extremely concerned with how Royal Caribbean has been able to proceed in the matter.

Royal Caribbean is investing $50 million to develop a beach club destination a move that is expected to generate an extra $26 million in visitor spend.

Meanwhile Smith has proposed a $2 million restoration of Paradise Island’s lighthouse and is embroiled in an ongoing court battle with the government over a Crown land lease agreement that covers land included in Royal Caribbean’s lease.

Smith maintains that he was granted a valid Crown land lease for the land on which the lighthouse is situated and the area at Colonial Beach for his “beach break” destination.

In June he claimed in a public statement: “I am pleased to have spoken to Philip Brave Davis the leader of the opposition who has stated that the Progressive Liberal Party’s view is that that Crown land should be for Bahamians.

“He has openly and publicly stated that any agreement done for Crown land with Royal Caribbean will be canceled.”",,,,,,,,,

At Herold Flags in Rochester customers were snapping up Minnesota flags — plural.

""In all the years I've been in business I've never even come close to selling any flag more than the U.S. flag"" owner Lee Herold said. ""Now I've been selling more state flags than U.S. flags.""

The new state flag: bold blues and sharp angles. The old state flag: long ignored long derided suddenly in demand. And the North Star flag. The one Herold co-designed decades ago when he launched his long campaign for a flag all Minnesotans could get behind.

""Frankly I was astounded that people were still coming in to get it"" he said. The flag he designed to represent Minnesota is a golden star on a field of blue for Minnesota's lakes and rivers white for our winters green for our farms and forests.

There were probably more Minnesota homes flying North Star flags than the actual flag when the search for a replacement began last year. Some Minnesotans still make room for it in their hearts and on their flagpoles.

""I had someone come in this morning and they got both. They got the new [flag] design and the North Star"" said Herold who has also had several customers double up to purchase both the old state flag and the North Star.

When Minnesota launched its search for a new flag last year Herold submitted his North Star for consideration.

It wasn't the flag the committee chose. None of the thousands of flags Minnesotans designed quite match the version that now flies above the state.

But the flag competition brought out the best and weirdest in Minnesota. There were lady slippers and laser loons. There were flags that evoked Ojibwe beadwork or heirloom quilts. There were constellations of stars in a kaleidoscope of colors.

All of them represented Minnesota to somebody. That's a pretty great thing to represent.

Minnesota made its choice. And so did Minnesotans who have flocked to online and brick-and-mortar shops to buy whichever design says ""Minnesota"" to them.

Welcome to the second life of Minnesota's second-place flags.

A month before Statehood Day a new flag rose over the crowd at a Minnesota United game. A bright white flag with the image of a bag and the legend printed in letters big enough for the players to read and share the thrill of Minnesota pride: BAYG.

Bayg flag — beloved crowd-pleasing longshot in the state flag redesign contest — lives.

The State Emblems Redesign Commission for reasons that surpass all understanding declined to choose even one of the flag designs that feature loons shooting lasers out of their eyes. Yet laser loon lives — on flags on totes on stickers on any surface that could be improved by the addition of a laser loon.

Including your library card if you're lucky enough to live in St. Paul.

""One of the joys of my job is asking 'what if?'"" said Claire Huber marketing and communications specialist for the St. Paul Public Library. After watching social media collectively melt down with glee over the funniest state flag designs she wondered: ""What if we made a laser loon library card? Wouldn't it be funny if we did?""

After watching several ""how to draw a loon"" tutorials online Huber designed her own laser loon with the legend: ""READ.""

Suddenly a library card was the hottest ticket in town. The library gave away all 500 new cards — and 500 laser loon stickers for existing cardholders — in a matter of days and quickly printed a thousand more.

""One of the best things about this project has been to bring delight to people"" she said. ""To see something so silly but so community-driven. Everyone has an opinion about the flag … I think it taps into the innate pride of the North.""

Minnesota hasn't quite realized Herold's dream of one flag we can all rally behind.

""Reminder"" Gov. Tim Walz posted on social media on Friday. ""Minnesota's new official state flag will be raised for the first time tomorrow.""

Suddenly here he was clean through on goal: the best player in the world the hometown icon who has come to symbolize P.S.G.’s ambition prowess excess and hubris his flashbulb moment at his fingertips.

While participating in the on-field drills at the NFL Combine Oladapo suffered a broken toe. He had surgery on it a few weeks before the draft and the hope is that he will be good to go for training camp in August.

However in the meantime while Oladapo will still be involved in the team meetings he’s not going to have the opportunity to apply what he’s learning in the practice field.

An offer for Packers fans For the best local Wisconsin news sports entertainment and culture coverage subscribe to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. $1 for 6 months

“Just staying in the training room getting the swelling down getting my range of motion back” said Oladapo. “And then just staying locked in mental reps on the sideline and then meet with the coaches after make sure I get the game plan.”

Not that Oladapo will have the same fate as Grant DuBose – Oladapo’s path to contributing as a rookie is much more clear – but we saw just last offseason how an injury during this time of the year derailed any sort of roster push DuBose was hoping to make. He didn’t return to the practice field until mid-August and was playing catch up at that point.

At a minimum Oladapo figures to be a core special teams player for the Packers. Defensively while versatile like Javon Bullard and Evan Williams Oladapo fills more of the traditional safety role as GM Brian Gutekunst described it able to fill both the “free and strong safety role” who can also line up as the “big nickel Sam linebacker.”

“As we can move him around more” said defensive backs coach Ryan Downard “the walk throughs are going to become vital because these guys you teach them what you can but until you go out and do it and walk through it that’s to me where the real learning takes place.

“You can sit in a classroom and learn something but until you either have to teach it back or you take them out there physically let them walk through it that’s I think where the growth takes place.”

Downard added that Oladapo’s intelligence and football IQ will help him stay up to speed throughout this process. Downard liked what he saw from him during rookie minicamp and made sure to fire questions Oladapo’s way to keep him engaged.

The addition of Oladapo – along with Bullard and Williams – provides that interchangability that GM Brian Gutekunst was looking for at the position. Increased versatility at the position opens up the playbook for Jeff Hafley from a game-planning perspective and makes it more difficult for opposing offenses pre-snap not knowing who will have what responsibility.

Another element that these three players bring is speed and physicality. Along with finding the right players from a schematic standpoint there is a certain play-style that the Packers want to have under Hafley.

“I’m comfortable anywhere on the field” said Oladapo. “Whatever the team needs me to do: be in the box be in the post blitz guard tight ends guard slots. I can do it all. I feel comfortable just having my two feet on the grass.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL2xvY2FsL3JlZ2lvbmFsL3dpbGtpbnNidXJnLWFubmV4YXRpb24tZmFpbHVyZS1yZWZsZWN0cy1tZXJnZXItaHVyZGxlcy1mb3ItcGEtcy0yNTYwLW11bmljaXBhbGl0aWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wilkinsburg annexation failure reflects merger hurdles for Pa.'s 2560 municipalities,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://triblive.com/local/regional/wilkinsburg-annexation-failure-reflects-merger-hurdles-for-pa-s-2560-municipalities/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYmxpdmUuY29tL2xvY2FsL3JlZ2lvbmFsL3dpbGtpbnNidXJnLWFubmV4YXRpb24tZmFpbHVyZS1yZWZsZWN0cy1tZXJnZXItaHVyZGxlcy1mb3ItcGEtcy0yNTYwLW11bmljaXBhbGl0aWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Kyle Tobener was balancing a full-time gig as a director of enterprise security at the tech giant Salesforce and fighting stage 3 extragonadal testicular cancer (which meant it had traveled to his chest) when he found TikTok.

Since discovering the app in May 2020 and making his first videos in November Tobener has racked up 6.5 million likes and 237000 followers for videos in which he ""hacks"" The New York Times' paywall pokes fun at Republican politicians and reviews entry-level security-job postings on LinkedIn. He's most known lately for the latter.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

At the age of 36 he didn't expect the platform filled with teenage dance crazes to be all that entertaining. He was surprised though to find so many funny videos on TikTok that distracted him from intense chemo treatments not to mention the global pandemic.

With more than a decade at Salesforce under his belt Tobener decided to lean into what he knows for his videos so he teaches a new generation of hackers what it means to be a cybersecurity expert.

His first viral hit received 5 million likes. In the TikTok Tobener showed viewers how to bypass The New York Times' paywall by deleting a segment of the URL. The publication ended the hack by patching the flaw a few months later.

It dawned on Tobener that people ""kind of understood what hacking was for the first time"" with that video he said.

""Being able to see 'Oh you just changed the URL. I can do that. I just changed the URL. And then it does something that it's not supposed to do'"" Tobener said. ""That clicks for people.""

This response radically changed the way he approached TikTok.

Since that video Tobener has firmly planted his feet in educating viewers about cybersecurity fundamentals simple hacks and how to find an entry-level position.

""People were like 'This is so cool. I would love to do this. How do I get into security? How do we learn to do this?' And I think that's such an interesting question because I taught myself just reading things online. There aren't many university programs that really teach security"" Tobener said.

""When I get those messages of people asking for help I try and take time to respond and help and give them advice because I know how hard it can be to break into the industry"" he added.

His efforts have certainly made a difference. One TikTok follower even messaged Tobener on LinkedIn this month to thank him.

""Thank you for all of your advices"" the follower told Tobener over LinkedIn. ""Thanks to you I got my first cyber security job one that I have been looking for year and a half to help my mom.""

Tobener who now works at the devops startup Copado as the vice president of security and IT said that he likes to assure his audience that it's not ""actually their fault"" that they haven't landed an infosec job. It's that the job ads are badly written.

""There's this misconception out there that cybersecurity cannot be entry-level because it has to build on previous years of experience in other technology-related roles. This perception is incredibly harmful to the pipeline of cybersecurity candidates and total horseshit"" Tobener said.

""I encourage everyone who watches my TikTok content to add me on LinkedIn"" he continued ""which leads to a ton of feedback from people on how my content has given them motivation to keep pursuing cybersecurity roles and not take the failings of my field on as their own failures.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vd29ya2xpZmUvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIxMTAwOC1ob3ctZmVydGlsaXR5LWJlY2FtZS1hLXdvcmtwbGFjZS1wZXJr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How fertility became a workplace perk,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS8xMC8xNi9ob3ctYWRvYmUtYmVjYW1lLXNpbGljb24tdmFsbGV5cy1xdWlldC1yZWludmVudG9y0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Adobe became Silicon Valley's quiet reinventor,"B Y SILICON VALLEY standards Adobe is a dull company. Nudging 40 it is middle-aged. It does not make headlines with mega-mergers or have a swashbuckling chief executive. “I feel very comfortable not being out there pounding my chest” confesses its boss Shantanu Narayen in a rare interview. All the while Adobe has quietly managed to adapt to the age of cloud computing. It has done a better job of reinventing itself perhaps even than Microsoft the technology industry’s best-known comeback kid. Microsoft’s CEO  Satya Nadella is said to have examined Mr Narayen’s handiwork closely—and not just because he attended the same secondary school in India as Adobe’s leader albeit a few grades down. Since 2007 when Mr Narayen took the helm Adobe’s market capitalisation has swelled from $24bn to $276bn.

UBS strategist Keith Parker says his firm is focused on the companies that have the most pricing power and highest stock upside. They determined which companies are most easily able to raise their prices and developed a metric that combines pricing power momentum in profit margins and the companies' exposure to input costs that could rise.

Parker only looked at companies that scored in the top 33% of their sectors and picked companies that have ""Buy"" ratings and upsides of at least 10% to UBS analysts' price targets.

The supply chain problems are getting a ton of attention right now but they won't be easily solved. Evidence is mounting that the snags will last well into 2022 even as the economy gets back on its feet. So the companies that can manage those problems might have a durable advantage.

He also said a handful of companies are looking at serious trouble identifying major downside for Occidental Petroleum and American Airlines with limited additional downside for Comerica Huntington Bancshares and Prudential.

The top picks are somewhat more diverse as the consumer discretionary technology real estate and industrial sectors are all represented.

The following companies are the ones with the most upside according to UBS and Parker's analysis. They're ranked from lowest to highest based on how far they will rise if UBS' 12-month price targets are accurate.

With oil prices at seven-year highs and investors worried about supply chain problems and inflation Wall Street is on the hunt for companies that will avoid the worst of the pain of rising costs — or turn it to their advantage.

One way to do that is through pricing power which is shorthand for a company's ability to raise prices to cancel out rising costs and maintain the profits and margins that investors want to see.

HOUSTON / ISTANBUL

International oilfield services company Schlumberger announced on Oct. 15 a significant contract award by the Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO or TP) for the engineering procurement construction and installation (EPCI) of end-to-end production solutions for the Sakarya Gas Field Turkey’s largest gas reserve.

The contract is awarded to Schlumberger and Subsea 7 an engineering company registered in Luxembourg and headquartered in London as part of a consortium.

The integrated project scope will cover subsurface solutions to onshore production including well completions subsea production systems (SPS) subsea umbilicals risers flowlines (SURF) and an early production facility (EPF) Schlumberger said in a statement.

Schlumberger will deliver the well completions scope and the design construction and commissioning of the early production facility. The SPS and SURF scope will be delivered by OneSubsea the subsea technologies production and processing systems division of Schlumberger and Subsea 7.

“This end-to-end production solutions contract award demonstrates the confidence placed in our ability to accelerate discovery to first gas and enhance value creation for TP in the Sakarya offshore gas field” said Donald Ross the head of production systems at Schlumberger.

“Through open collaboration and by leveraging innovative production solutions Schlumberger will drive local content value creation and remains committed to supporting Turkey’s energy sector” he added.

Subsea 7 also confirmed the award of a major contract worth over $750 million by TPAO.

Project management and engineering have already commenced and will be managed from the Subsea 7 office in Istanbul it said.

“Subsea 7 looks forward to building a long-term relationship with Turkish Petroleum and to making a significant contribution to the development and growth of the Turkish energy industry” said John Evans the chief executive officer of Subsea 7.

The Sakarya Gas Field represents the largest ever gas reserve discovered in Turkey. The subsea development will be located approximately 100 nautical miles into the Black Sea.

The scope of work comprises the EPCI of the subsea pipelines and associated equipment to connect the subsea wells in approximately 2000 meters of water depth to the EPF.

Turkey’s largest gas find which reached 405 billion cubic meters (bcm) was discovered by drillship Fatih last year.

In June Turkey announced a second discovery of 135 bcm bringing the cumulative gas discovery total to 540 bcm.

Energy and Natural Resources Minister Fatih Dönmez previously said the maximum annual production from the field could range between 15 and 20 bcm corresponding to around 30 percent of the country’s yearly gas consumption which reached 48.2 bcm in 2020.

Turkey’s new gas discovery could alleviate its gas import dependence 48 bcm of which mainly comes from Russia Azerbaijan and Iran via pipelines along with liquefied natural gas from several countries including Nigeria Algeria and the United States.

In recent years Turkey has paid approximately $12 billion for natural gas imports.

The first production from the Sakarya field is forecast to start by 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEwLzE2L2ZyaWVuZHMtZmVhci1ueWMtYXJ0LXdvcmxkLWhlaXJlc3MtaXMtaXNvbGF0ZWQtYnktZGF1Z2h0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Friends fear NYC art-world heiress is isolated by daughter,"Marie-Christophe de Menil’s East 81st Street home was for years a haven. The oil heiress and art patron used to host lively inebriated parties that earned her the nickname Prosecco. After the overdose death of her adored grandson Dash Snow in 2009 de Menil opened her doors to the hell-raising artist’s friends. But more recently the baroque townhouse has become a crime scene.

On March 2 Alina Morini a Romanian immigrant who told The Post she spent 15 years working for de Menil and six years living with her — as an assistant caregiver and friend — was arrested at the home for trespassing. She was per a summons-with-notice imprisoned for 30 hours partly at the notorious Manhattan Detention Complex.

“Christophe did not want me to be arrested” Morini told The Post. “She put out her hands and said ‘Arrest me with her.’”

Now Morini has filed a lawsuit claiming her arrest was “planned” by Taya Thurman the daughter of de Menil and her ex-husband Robert Thurman. (He is also the father of Uma Thurman making Taya and the actress half-sisters.) Morini seeks at least $5 million in restitution from Taya and others for charges including false arrest and imprisonment and wrongful eviction.

The filing also claims a “forced and ongoing isolation of [de Menil] at the hands of her daughter” who was previously estranged from her mother for “more than 30 years.”

Taya has not yet responded to the filing. But a growing group of de Menil’s friends has expressed concern that they can’t contact the 88-year-old.

“I get calls from people close to her. They say they are cut off and concerned” attorney Robert Hantman who represents Morini told The Post.

“I’m concerned about her well-being. Christophe is one of my oldest and closest friends. I tried for a little over a year now to be in touch and I have not heard back from her. It is very disturbing” playwright and director Robert Wilson told The Post. “I was told that she was no longer receiving telephone calls and not allowed to see anyone.”

Nico Iliev a friend of de Menil’s for the last 15 years wrote a letter to Catherine McCaw an assistant district attorney in NYC. Included in the court filing it claims that de Menil is being isolated. Iliev wrote: “I was [recently] allowed to visit [Christophe] for 17 minutes … During the quick visit … she shared that she is ‘in jail.’”

He added that Christophe’s “landline and cell phone were disabled.”

Taya’s attorney Sheila Tendy told The Post: “Christophe is not isolated from anyone.”

Both sides accused the other of greed. Heirs to the Schlumberger oil fortune and art patrons who have been called the “Medici of modern art” de Menil and her five siblings are said to be worth over $100 million.

The summons alleges that Taya was aiming “to exercise greater control over Christophe for…selfish economic gain.”

Hantman told The Post: “[Taya] wanted to keep away anyone who is close to Christophe and could … influence her.”

Meanwhile Tendy said “Alina is asking for $5 million for herself. Her claims are to smear the family for financial gain period.”

Nobody expected de Menil — a vibrant light on the social scene who has funded works by Philip Glass and Twyla Tharp — to lead such a controversial life in her golden years.

6 De Menil was close to artist grandson Dash Snow (right) before his 2009 overdose death but reportedly didn’t speak to her only child Taya Thurman (second from left with son Max) for three decades. Patrick McMullan

Her parents John and Dominique de Menil moved from Paris to the US in 1941 after France fell to the Nazis. Blossoming art collectors they landed in Houston Texas where the family’s oil services firm Schlumberger Limited was based.

“Houston was the biggest city in Texas but at the time it had very little [in the way of culture]” William Middleton author of “Double Vision” a biography of the couple told The Post.

So John and Dominique started buying art and working with local institutions before launching a privately funded museum of their own the Menil Collection in 1987.

Their eldest daughter Christophe grew up around fine art living in a home designed by Philip Johnson and decorated by couturier Charles James. In her early 20s she had moved into her parents’ Manhattan apartment. At age 27 in 1960 she wed Robert Thurman then 19. Taya was born that year and the couple divorced in 1961.

Around that time de Menil began hanging out with a group of avant-garde artists including musician John Cage dancer Merce Cunningham and painter Robert Rauschenberg. She put together “happenings” in the Hamptons supported the work of her favorite performers and designed costumes for playwright Wilson before launching her own fashion line.

Thanks in part to her the Menil Collection loaded with some 20000 works ranks among the world’s finest small museums. It includes coveted pieces by Pablo Picasso Max Ernst’s portrait of Dominique and a Renzo Piano-designed gallery devoted to Cy Twombly.

Wilson recalled how de Menil helped him. “I wrote a play called ‘A Letter for Queen Victoria’ [about] an autistic boy. I performed it for two months to sold-out houses in Paris. We came to New York and [critic] John Simon said ‘Robert Wilson takes advantage of a brain damaged boy and puts him on stage.’ Damn right I did. [The rhythm] was mathematical and the words were constructed like Mozart. But the play was a disaster in NY. Christophe saw it. I woke up one morning and in the mail was a $25000 check and a note that read ‘Thank you for this wonderful work. I do not want mention of my name.’ She did not want her name celebrated. She was extremely discreet” he said.

6 Taya has moved into her mother’s home and allegedly cut off the phone line and banned de Menil’s friends like Alina Morini (left) from seeing her. Thurman claims Morini conned her way into living with de Menil for six years. DANIEL TOROK

But pressure was building in her private life. As Wilson described it: “For a number of years there [had] been tension between Christophe and her daughter.”

It seemed that de Menil and her only child disagreed over how to handle Taya’s wild-child son Dash. (Taya and musician ex-husband Christopher Snow also share son Max an acclaimed photographer and daughter Caroline an actress.)

“Dash was put into a diabolical boarding school” Morini told The Post. “He complained to Christophe and she got him out.”

Tendy responded “Alina’s characterization of anything involving Dash is not credible. She is in no position to know.”

6 Morini alleges Thurman arranged for her to be arrested when she returned to the townhouse. As evidence to support her claims Morini included a written statement that she claims was penned by de Menil that says: “live with me in my home.”

In Dash de Menil saw a kindred spirit.

“She realized that there was suddenly in the family a great artist. She understood him in a way that very few people did. He had problems with drugs but that did not stop her from supporting him as an artist” Wilson said. “They bonded and he did not have that kind of relationship with his mother.”

Middleton added of de Menil: “I know that she believed in Dash Snow as an artist. We discussed Dash and his importance.”

Dash ran with a crew of wild creatives including Dan Colen and Ryan McGinley who embodied downtown debauchery in the early 2000s. His work reveled in the controversial: inspired by his wild life of sex and drugs and incorporating his own semen sometimes splashed across photos of cops. It earned him solo shows and a spot in the 2006 Whitney Bienniel.

In 1999 Dash then 18 and his 19-year-old bride Agathe Aparru had moved in with de Menil. “Christophe was his life” said Morini. “They were very close.”

It was through Dash that Morini — who described herself as Agathe’s “godmother” — met de Menil.

“Dash was excited for me to go meet his grandmother” Morini recalled. “He said she would love me.”

Indeed the two women became close friends according to several sources.

Dash overdosed in 2009 leaving behind his wife and their daughter Secret. Morini was there for de Menil.

“This woman is my best friend my power my strength. We became attached at the joint” Morini told The Post. “The only thing we didn’t have was sex. About six years ago Christophe broke her hand and asked me to move in with her.”

Some suggest that Morini was like family for de Menil. “Last time I saw Christophe was a Thanksgiving dinner in 2018. It was lovely” Middleton recalled. “Clearly Christophe and Alina were close. Members of the family were there but it felt like Alina was co-host of the dinner.”

According to Wilson “No way as far as I could see was Alina taking advantage of Christophe. She is a friend.”

Taya for one doesn’t seem to buy this.

“We have tapes of her being [verbally] abusive to Christophe” Tendy said of Morini.

Tendy told The Post that there is audio of Alina being “very condescending … ‘You stupid’ this and ‘stupid’ that … Nobody would want a person like [Alina] caring for their aging mother.”

Morini acknowledges in the summons that the tape exists. She told The Post that it was recorded by a “maid who was fired” and captures “a stupid argument about going to the Hamptons. Christophe called me names. I called her names … People fight once in a while.”

She claims in the filing that Taya “had her wrongfully and illegally expelled from Christophe’s residence” in which she had been residing for six years.

“Taya started harassing me and she bullied me to go to a hotel” which the de Menils paid for Morini said. “They said they would get me a lawyer.”

That lawyer was Cesar de Castro who is listed on the Tendy Law website as “counsel to the firm.” Morini claims in the summons that she was the victim of a “scheme.”

Refuting this Tendy said “Cesar de Castro has his own law firm. He is of counsel to my firm. While the family had no obligation to pay for counsel to Alina they did so out of a courtesy to her. Alina could have chosen any attorney she wanted.”

After being in the hotel for more than a month Morini told The Post her attorney advised her to return to de Menil’s townhouse. “Christophe was very excited. She said ‘Oh my Lu Lu is back’ — that’s her nickname for me. [Then] the police came.

“I want to be reunited with Christophe. She has a few good years left and I want her to live them with dignity” Morini said.

In Tendy’s estimation “Alina Morini is not a friend or a family member. She is a disgruntled person who was arrested for conning her way into Christophe de Menil’s home.”

As for Christophe The Post was given a statement attributed to her: “I recognize Alina Morini’s words for what they are and I’m very sorry and disappointed. I love my daughter and she has taken good care of me. I don’t support this lawsuit and I wish it would stop.”

But perhaps it is Dash’s widow who delivered the most damning portrait of this art-world family and their friends. “Not trying to get involved in their messes any longer” Agathe Snow texted The Post. “I cannot surround myself with such bad energy … It is the same story over and over again no imagination no soul and no care.”",,,,,,,,,

It’s undeniable that this has been the year of green from kelly to hunter and back around to sage. Looking ahead to 2022 it seems the hype will only continue. Almost every major paint brand has announced their respective Colors of the Year this month including Benjamin Moore on Wednesday and one thing is clear: paler verdant shades aren’t going anywhere.

All of the green hues—Breezeway Olive Sprig October Mist and Evergreen Fog—were influenced by the soothing quality of nature (essential in our uncertain world) and how we are looking outward after our lives have been pushed indoors. Behr’s Breezeway is a silvery hue reminiscent of sea glass while Sherwin Williams’s Evergreen Fog reminds us of the Pacific Northwest’s signature weather patterns. Benjamin Moore’s October Mist specifically looks to flower stems while PPG’s Olive Sprig a slightly darker and more pure version of the shade takes inspiration from its namesake.

We asked seven designers to give us their thoughts on how to use these greens in real life. These are colors made to relax and after this year we could all use a breath of fresh air.

A Little Goes A Long Way

I love Evergreen Fog as an accent color. Brilliant for a bookcase in a satin finish. Or why not paint the wood floor of your mudroom or maybe your exterior shutters? The list is endless. —Kimille Taylor Interior Designer

Back to Bed

Both PPG and Behr’s colors are not only beautiful but invoke a serene feeling that’s destined for the walls of a bedroom. This calming effect would allow you to start decompressing the minute you walk into the space. —Andi Morse founder Morse Design

Feeling Light

October Mist has an intriguing undertone that evokes both winter and spring at the same time. I see utilizing this palette in open loft-like spaces; there’s an optimistic and lightweight quality to this color.—Robert Highsmith Co-founder Workstead

Time to Wash Up

I’m definitely a fan of Behr’s Breezeway. With its soothing aesthetic I would use it in a bathroom to complement white tile and marble. —Michelle Lisac founder Michelle Lisac Interior Design

Take It Outside

With such a variety of undertones Behr’s Breezeway showcases its range differently in every light making it the perfect blue-green for a porch ceiling.—Maggie Griffin founder Maggie Griffin Design

Anchors Away

These colors are soothing and natural—gray to calm the soul a touch of green to connect to nature. Pale green is almost a neutral so it can be used in most spaces in the home especially those where we rest reflect and recharge. It’s also a great base that can anchor pops of color. —Nina Blair founder Nina B. Design

Adding a fresh coat of paint is one of the most impactful (and affordable) ways to completely transform a space. But without the right paint roller the DIY you saw on Pinterest becomes more of a headache than a simple before-and-after. “It’s sort of like putting the cheapest gas in a Ferrari” says Nicole Gibbons founder of Clare. “If you’re using premium paint you should be using the most premium materials. The supplies you choose are one of the most important things that impact how your project is going to turn out.”

With the right roller painting a room can be an easy—and dare we say relaxing—experience. We tapped reno pros to find the best paint rollers for the smoothest finish no matter your project or level of expertise. With these no-fail picks you’ll want to refresh every room in your house.

A Few Things to Keep in Mind

Easy-to-grip frames: If you’re going to be painting for a while you’ll want a roller frame that’s both comfortable and ergonomic. According to Gibbons most roller frames you’ll find at a paint store are designed for professionals and not the average DIYer. She recommends one with a thin soft grip or using an extension pole for even more control and speed.

Length: While a bigger roller might seem more efficient when painting a larger surface it’s actually much harder to hold and control according to Connie McKinney senior product manager at Sherwin-Williams. “If I’m painting a standard room a 9-inch roller is going to be the one I choose” she says. But for smaller surfaces like molding or that awkward space between a counter and a window a 4-inch roller will work and be much speedier than just a brush.

Material and fabric: There are three kinds of materials that roller covers are made out of: wool microfiber and foam. For the smoothest application Gibbons suggests using microfiber as it has a tight stipple pattern and holds more paint. “Woven naps tend to have more texture which means you can leave texture marks on the wall you’re painting” she says. “The more woven your nap is the smoother the results.” However wool covers can be useful when using oil-based paint.

Type of painting surface: The thickness of the roller you need also known as the nap depends on the surface you’re painting. The standard roller nap is ⅜ inch but if you’re painting something really textured like stucco walls or brick you’ll need a thicker nap to get into those grooves and work the paint into all the nooks and crannies. McKinney recommends going up to ½ inch or higher in these cases.

Our Top Picks

Best Overall: Purdy White Dove Roller Cover

Shop

The average home painter wants a tightly knitted roller that will leave behind a uniform color without any loose fibers left behind. Made of woven Dralon an acrylic fiber the Purdy White Dove does just that and can be washed for several reuses. “This roller is going to leave a really smooth finish” says McKinney. “It’s going to have that tight stipple pattern so it will have a uniform look to it and leave no lint behind.” Plus at 9 inches long and with a ⅜-inch nap it’s the ideal length and thickness for most rooms and it works with all paint types.

Best Starter Kit: Clare 7-Piece Kit

Shop

Beginners will appreciate this kit from Clare that has everything you could possibly need for a standard paint job. It comes with a plastic drop cloth painter’s washi tape a 2-inch paintbrush a roller frame a 9-inch roller cover a metal tray and a tray liner.

The roller has a ⅜-inch nap which is ideal for painting smooth–to–lightly textured surfaces. It’s made of a premium German microfiber that creates a clean application with minimal splatter and it works particularly well with Clare’s paints and primer.

“Our products are designed to give the best performance with our paint and customers who are novice painters achieve quality results” says Gibbons. “The roller is really high quality has virtually no shedding and helps achieve the smoothest possible application.”

Best Value: Home Depot Polyester Paint Roller Cover

Shop

While most roller covers aren’t terribly expensive this six-pack is particularly economical. The polyester paint roller covers are 9 inches long and have a ⅜-inch nap which makes them ideal for most standard walls. They’re best for use with nonfinish coatings on smooth to semi-smooth surfaces and can be used only once—which makes them a good option for anyone who has one small project or doesn’t want to bother with washing covers.

Shop

More experienced painters can benefit from a larger roller which can cover twice the amount of wall in one swoop (or tackle more annoying tasks like painting a ceiling). This one is 18 inches long and has a ⅜-inch nap with premium woven fabric for a smooth finish. Note that because the roller is longer it will also be heavier so you’ll want a longer roller frame and an extension pole for better control.

Best for Textured Walls: Wooster Pro Super Roller Cover

Shop

Using a standard ⅜-inch nap on a textured wall is going to leave lots of little grooves unpainted (and leave you frustrated). Enter this roller cover which goes up to 1 ¼ inches thick meaning it will get into even the spaces between bricks easily. Designed for extra-rough surfaces it resists matting which is especially important as cheaper covers are likely to shed or rip from the texture of the wall.

Best for Big Projects: Wagner Spraytech Electric Powered Roller

Shop

If you’re spending your day painting multiple walls and want to make the most of your time any help is appreciated. This electric-powered roller from Wagner attaches to the paint can and automatically reloads your roller for continuous painting. You can control the flow using a button on the handle and the design eliminates back discomfort from repeated bending down and the risk of accidentally knocking over a paint can which is all we can hope for when tackling a huge paint job. The 16-foot hose also makes it possible to reach the tippy-top of walls or the ceiling.

Ask Domino

Q: What roller material gives the smoothest finish?

Tightly woven microfiber gives the smoothest finish on a standard wall. It has a minimally textured surface that will leave behind less of a stipple effect compared to a wool roller cover. “​​Microfiber also holds more paint so you spend less time dipping your roller into the tray to reload your roll with paint” says Gibbons.

Q: What’s the best way to clean and dry a paint roller after use?

A quality roller cover can be used multiple times—as long as it’s cleaned correctly. To clean a roller McKinney recommends using a 5-in-1 tool and scraping paint off the roller and back into the paint can. “You’ll be shocked at how much paint is in that roller cover” she says. “This will save so much time in your utility sink.” From there you can roll off any remaining paint onto a piece of cardboard before rinsing the roller cover with some mild soap until the water runs clear. Then just leave it out to air-dry.

Q: My paint roller keeps shedding fibers into the wet paint. Help!

If your paint roller starts shedding Gibbons recommends stopping your project immediately and getting a new quality roller cover—otherwise it will just keep shedding. However there are a few things you can do to prevent shedding in the first place. McKinney recommends rinsing your roller before dipping it into the paint to remove any loose fibers and to prime it to hold more paint. She also advises painting less visible areas first such as a closet which gets any inconsistencies out of the roller before you paint a wall in a high-traffic area like a living room.

The Last Word

Picking out the right paint roller depends mostly on the type and size of the surface you’re painting. Once you figure that out you can adjust the material length and nap of the roller to best fit your project and get rolling. Purdy’s White Dove Roller Cover is a great all-rounder that leaves a smooth even finish but if you’re a DIY rookie opt for ​​Clare’s 7-Piece Kit which includes all the tools and accessories you need.

From the moment Jerrell Cummings and Dayton Ingenhaag combined on a touchdown-saving tackle to stuff a fourth-and-one on the Simon Fraser goal-line on the first drive of the game you got the feeling Saturday might indeed be a special day for the dedicated but long-suffering fans of the football team from Burnaby Mountain.

Turns out it was indeed a sign of great things to come.

SFU (1-4) snapped a seven-game losing streak dating back to October of 2019 scoring all of its points unanswered en route to a decisive 30-3 victory over the Montana State Northern Lights (0-7) a team playing out of the NAIA’s Frontier Conference.

“We came out flat and so that goal-line stand created energy for us and our defence stepped up” said SFU head coach Mike Rigell after his first college football victory on Saturday. “Right now this defence is playing on a high.

“Coach Erdman and the rest of the staff have gotten them there and now they are flying around and having fun doing it together” he said of a group led by defensive coordinator Jerome Erdman.

On the day the Simon Fraser defence made four interceptions including one by linebacker Brendan Lowry the Okotoks’ Ala. native who in the first quarter snared a tipped ball and returned it to the Montana State Northern 26-yard line.

Three plays later on a third-and-11 Seiber broke out of the pocket trained his eyes down field and hooked up with his most familiar target connecting with receiver Riley Morrison on a 27-yard touchdown. The PAT failed but SFU led 6-3.

The goal-line stand and the Lowry pick one which had followed another earlier by halfback Kolby Buljevic seemed to be the spark that turned the game around.

Just nine seconds into the second quarter with the hosts hemmed deep in their own end zone the Simon Fraser special teams unit got a great push up front knocking an MSU-Northern player backwards and having the ensuing punt ricochet off his back and into the end zone where SFU junior linebacker Isaac Muckian fell on it for a touchdown.

Kicker Kristie Elliott made the extra point for a 13-3 lead.

“It was great to see the special teams come out of their shell today” explained Rigell. “They hadn’t done anything to hurt us but today was kind of a statement day for them. They came out and they took charge. Any time you can get a turnover on special teams and turn it into a touchdown that is a special thing.”

Special enough to spark a span of 10 points scored in under one minute.

Elliott came back later in the quarter capping a 10-play 44-yard drive with a 23-yard field goal her first ever to extend her team’s lead to 16-3.

Then just 43 seconds later SFU turned the game on its ear.

Cummings appeared to tip a pass by Lights’ quarterback Devonte Anderson which linebacker Drew Nicholson picked off and turned into a 28-yard pick-six for a 23-3 halftime lead.

The second half was a sloppy affair yet one in which the SFU defence continued to hold the line and complete their game-ending 43-minute stretch of shutout play.

With 4:14 left in the game Seiber who went 12-of-30 for 190 yards and two touchdowns on the day connected with receiver Aidan Pearce on a 63-yard touchdown strike to wrap up the scoring.

Pearce the former North Vancouver-Argyle star was impressive after the catch snaring it along the sidelines and gaining separation by the stride from a host of Lights on his way to the end zone.

Elliott finished her day going 3-of-4 on PATs to go along with her field goal. She’s been making history all season and that continued on two more counts Saturday.

When she booted the extra point following the Pearce TD in the fourth quarter Montana State Northern’s broadcaster summed up her day by announcing that she had become the first female to ever score a point in a college football game played in the state of Montana.

Yet that’s certainly not to say that everything was perfect about the team’s performance.

Playing against an NAIA team which remains winless on the season SFU had three passes intercepted lost both of their fumbles and went one-of-two on fourth down in addition to being flagged nine times for 93 yards in penalties.

Yet on a day when the team wins for just the third time in the past three seasons that is nitpicking.

And besides the SFU offence was able to show some depth and dimension over the course of the day.

Running back Somto Anyadike a Winnipeg native carried 13 times for 77 yards and caught two passes for 21 yards as Simon Fraser rushed for 87 yards on the game. He had yet to play a featured role in the backfield in the team’s first four games.

Additionally receiver Caelin Johnson a big target for Seiber earlier in the season when he caught nine passes for 193 yards and three touchdowns in a loss at Linfield returned after six weeks injured and caught two passes for 21 yards. Morrison led the way with five catches for 81 yards.

Linebacker Griffin Barrett again topped the tackling chart with 13 while corner Kimo Hui halfback Buljevic and lineman Jakob Mozill had eight apiece.

Defensive back Khaleeb Webb a junior from Los Angeles made the team’s fourth interception of the game just before halftime.

“The team is ecstatic and jumping around you feel like a monkey has been taken off your back” said Rigell. “But we just talked about trusting the process and not worrying about any of the distractions. We are really happy for all of the players for our administration and for everyone at SFU in general.”

The 27-point victory was the team’s most decisive road triumph since the Jacques Chapdelaine regime. Back on Oct. 4 2014 SFU went to Utah and handled Dixie State by a 29-19 score.

SFU takes a huge jump up in competition this coming Saturday when the team heads south to face Angelo State in a 4 p.m. kick-off in San Angelo TX.

Davis

Special to Akron Beacon Journal

The quiet community of Orrville known worldwide as home to the J.M. Smucker Co. corporate headquarters is a peaceful thriving location where people can raise families and enjoy the surroundings.

Although small Orrville offers a wide variety of agritourism and sprawling farms big and small businesses industries local shops nearby dining and enviable scenery.

Location

State Route 57 runs through the heart of Orrville’s downtown district. U.S. 30 can take drivers across much of the country. Other connectors are U.S. 250 and state routes 585 83 and 3. Note too that this city of nearly 8500 residents has Orr Park and three satellite parks and is surrounded by the Wayne County communities of Dalton Marshallville Rittman Smithville and Wooster.

Educational facilities in Orrville include the Orrville City Schools and the University of Akron's Wayne College.

History

The first settlers arrived in 1814 and the city was incorporated in 1950.

Among the oldest businesses still operating in Orrville is the Schantz Organ Co. which was founded in 1873. The firm is a builder of distinguished pipe organs for churches schools public facilities and residences. Its instruments are known for artistry quality and reliability.

Smucker's other highlights

Close behind Schantz is the J.M. Smucker Co. which was founded in 1897 by Jerome M. Smucker who began as entrepreneur selling apple cider and apple butter door to door from the back of his horse-drawn wagon. The firm became incorporated in 1921.

Today Smucker employees more than 1700 at its Orrville facilities and over 7000 worldwide. Since 1962 Smucker has marketed its products with the slogan: “With a name like Smucker’s it has to be good.”

In its fifth generation of family stewardship the company is led by President and CEO Mark Smucker who accepted the top leadership role in 2016. Smucker's jellies and jams are part of over 35 Smucker brands including coffee consumer foods pet food and snacks.

""I've always believed that our responsibility ultimately is to help make the world a better place Smucker said. ""We do that by providing food [that] people and pets love but also through our commitment to thrive together with all those who count on our business.""

The company owns and operates more than 30 manufacturing facilities and offices across America to ensure quality production or its products. Smucker's expanded in the late 1980s to producing and marketing its products internationally first in Canada and then Australia.

Smucker’s headquarters is at 1 Strawberry Lane while its company store and cafe is located at 333 Wadsworth Road.

Long-time Orrville business Smith Dairy founded in 1909 by Peter and John Schmid became SmithFoods in 2015 reportedly to take advantage of new products and marketing opportunities. John Schmid’s great-grandson Nate Schmid became the firm’s fourth-generation family member to lead the firm when he was named president in December 2017. SmithFoods’ brand covers a wide range of dairy and non-dairy products.

While Smith Dairy the facility made it into the Guinness Book of World Records in 1989 — a year after purchasing Ruggles Ice Cream — by producing the world’s largest milkshake at 1891 gallons.

Lori Reinbolt president and CEO of the Orrville Area Chamber of Commerce with membership of over 350 businesses said Orrville “a community where progress and tradition meet.""

""We are innovative in our thinking and grounded in the values of tradition"" she said. ""One of the things that makes Orrville so special is the Character Education Program throughout our schools. The program instills value-based education for every student from kindergarten through 12th grade and has been followed for 30 years through the non-profit Heartland Education Community.”

Ramseyer Farms

Known for what seems like forever for its excellent potato crops the 700-acre Ramseyer Farms at 4000 Ramseyer Lane off state Route 585 near Orrville between Smithville and Wooster took a sharp turn four years ago and stopped growing potatoes to focus on corn soybeans wheat pumpkins and sunflowers.

Since 2000 much of the large business owned by Dennis and Karen Ramseyer has become a farmland playground and tourist attraction which has been expanded often to provide fun and visual enjoyment for youngsters and adults alike.

Marketing Manager Aaron Bontrager said the farm has two 8-acre corn mazes a giant corn barn where youngsters can play a playground made of more than 300 recycled tires games and smaller mazes for younger children hayrides through fields and woods and up-close views of farm animals. Bontrager also touted the Hide and Seek Hill with tunnels and 60-foot slides pedal cart race track and barnyard basketball plus pumpkin picking.

Unfortunately the fall fun and frolic is expected to end Oct. 31 said Bontrager who added the last weekend will feature a not-so-spooky Halloween venture with trick-or-treating around the facility.

Riceland Golf Course

For those who would rather play golf this fall Riceland Golf Course at the intersection of U.S. 30 and state Route 57 will be open according to Larry Lisic who has operated the 18-hole privately owned venue since 1984 and has owned it since 1986. Lisic said the course was established in 1922.

According to others the course is believed to be the oldest privately owned course east of the Mississippi River.

SNA,Snap-on,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzaGIuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9jaGllZnMtcWItcGF0cmljay1tYWhvbWVzLW9uLWNtb24tbWFuLWludGVyY2VwdGlvbi10aGF0cy1iYWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chiefs QB Mahomes on 'C'mon Man' interception: 'That's bad',"KANSAS CITY Mo. — The play was supposed to be a run for Darrel Williams.

Instead Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes fumbled the snap for a second straight week.

Mahomes’ first instinct was to scramble for whatever yards he could get after picking up the ball.

Instead he spotted tight end Travis Kelce a few yards downfield.

Mahomes decided belatedly to chuck it to his sure-handed buddy.

Instead the ball slipped from Mahomes’ hand went almost straight into the air and was intercepted by Bobby McCain.

With it went any hope the Chiefs had to score — and tie the game or take the lead — late in the first half Sunday against the Washington Football Team at FedEx Field.

“It was bad” Mahomes said after the game. “... But you’ve got to bounce back in this league. It’s going to look bad. It’s probably going to be on ‘C’mon Man’ or something like that.”

“C’mon Man” is a weekly segment on ESPN’s Monday night pregame show that highlights some of the previous weekend’s NFL lowlights.

Mahomes’ miscue — one of two interceptions he threw giving him eight on the season — almost certainly will make the cut.

But so too will a few highlights after he finished the game 32 of 47 for a season-high 397 yards with two second-half touchdowns leading the Chiefs to a 31-13 comeback win with a dominant second half after trailing 13-10 at halftime.

“The biggest thing was the guys kept believing in me; that was the biggest thing to me” Mahomes said. “Orlando (Brown Jr.) Travis (Kelce) Tyreek (Hill) — all those guys they came right up to me and were like ‘You keep being you. We know you’re competing; we know who you are. Don’t let that one thing affect how you play.’

""You saw in the second half. I kept doing stuff kept throwing across my body and doing all that different type of stuff because I know those guys believe in me and I’m going to keep being that and keep fighting until the end.”

Kansas City head coach Andy Reid said it’s not hard to surmise the root cause of the turnovers including another interception off a ball that went through wide receiver Hill’s hands earlier in the first half.

“It’s not good but he came back and he’s such a tough competitor” Reid said. “He’s trying to make things happen and he was probably forcing it there. I think that’s obvious but you really can’t do that.”

Mahomes was 13 of 23 for 222 yards with no touchdowns and two picks in the first half a dismal 53.2 quarterback rating.

He went 19 of 24 for 175 yards with two scores and no turnovers in the second half a robust 124.83 QB rating.

Mahomes who threw only six interceptions in 2020 and only five in 2019 isn’t happy with the early-season struggles. But he said winning makes it easier to swallow so he won’t dwell on the mistakes or let them define and change him.

“I just move on to the next play” Mahomes said. “... I’ve had a lot of interceptions this year. It’s not a secret. You kind of have to just move and keep playing.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvdXRoYmVuZHRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy8yMDIxLzEwLzE2L21pY2hpZ2FuLWhpZ2gtc2Nob29sLWZvb3RiYWxsLXNjb3Jlcy1yb3VuZHVwLW1oc2FhLXdlZWstOC84NDQxODE0MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michigan high school football scores roundup for MHSAA Week 8,"No commitment required.

Low pressure towards the start of the week will bring “spells of wet and windy weather in all of the UK” according to Sarah Kent a Met Office meteorologist.

Temperatures will remain in the high teens for the next few days up to 18 degrees in places which is warmer than the average for this time of year.

However this will change overnight on Wednesday and into Thursday as the wind direction changes Ms Kent told i which will bring much colder temperatures and see temperatures plunging to single digits.

This will bring an “increasing chance of rural frosts” Ms Kent said with a possibility of snow in the Scottish mountains. “If you’re out mountaineering don’t be surprised if you get wintry weather” she said.

However the cold spell is only expected to last a couple of days with temperatures rising again towards the weekend.

John Hammond former BBC weatherman and meteorologist for Weathertrending told The Sun that the “polar vortex” could weaken soon leading to possible snowfall elsewhere in the UK in the coming weeks.

The polar vortex is a “circulation of winds high up in the stratosphere” according to the Met Office. It influences the type of weather the UK experiences during the winter with a strong polar vortex corresponding with a stronger jet stream which brings warmer weather across the Atlantic.

When it weakens more frequent spells of northerly or easterly winds come to the UK bringing in very cold air from the Arctic and continental Europe. Sometimes it can break down entirely an event called a ‘Sudden Stratospheric Warming’ which has been linked to spells of cold winter weather in recent years.

This could lead to the possibility of snow in the south of England in late October. However Mr Hammond said this is highly unusual. “The last time that lowland southern Britain saw significant snowfall as early as October was in 2008 – a measure of how rare it is” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay90di90di1uZXdzL3N0cmljdGx5cy1yaHlzLXN0ZXBoZW5zb24tbG9va3MtdmVyeS0yNTIwNzM4MdIBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay90di90di1uZXdzL3N0cmljdGx5cy1yaHlzLXN0ZXBoZW5zb24tbG9va3MtdmVyeS0yNTIwNzM4MS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Strictly's Rhys Stephenson looks very different in throwback snap with nod to dance,"Strictly Come Dancing star Rhys Stephenson had seemingly been in preparation for his Spider-Man-themed routine for many years if this photo is anything to go by

Strictly's Rhys Stephenson looks very different in throwback snap with nod to dance

Rhys Stephenson swung his way to dizzying heights on the leaderboard during last week’s Strictly Come Dancing.

The CBBC presenter who is partnered with professional dancer Nancy Xu won the first 10 of the series with their couple’s choice commercial street dance routine.

Inspired by Spider-Man Rhys came to movie week as the Miles Morales version of the web-shooting super hero while Nancy was dressed up as Spider-Woman.

Rhys was so in character that he was flying around the dance floor with head judge Shirley Ballas asking: “I've never seen anyone jump that high. So athletic do you have springs in your shoes?""

The couple finished second in the standings after receiving an impressive score of 37 including that perfect 10 from Motsi Mabuse.

Before taking to the dance floor last weekend Rhys shared an incredible throwback snap which proved he has been in training for the Spider-Man role for years.

The Strictly star posted a snap on Instagram showing him stood with three pals in a field wearing a black Spider-Man t-shirt.

Alongside the cute picture he wrote: “Never thought I’d still be getting use out of my favourite shirt from way back when thanks boys”

The next photo then showed Rhys in present day wearing exactly the same top while practising his best Spidey poses with Nancy during a training session.

Last week Rhys explained the meaning behind his costume and how it would come together on the dance floor.

“I’m playing Miles Morales from Into the Spider-Verse. Nancy plays Spider-Gwen so it’s not a case of Spider-Man and a damsel in distress” said Rhys.

“We’re both playing superheroes we’re both fighting together.

“Miles Morales is mixed-race Black Latino Spider-Man Gwen Stacy is Spider-Woman and they’re from parallel universes but they come together here.”

Speaking of T-shirts Rhys actually used one to let his parents and two sisters know he was going to appear on Strictly.

“I came to see them and I had on a T-shirt and opened my shirt and revealed it to them like that” he said.

“It was brilliant my sisters screamed one of them jumped on me.

“Friends have been super excited. One screamed so loud she gave herself a headache. It’s been really fun.”

Rhys has been enduring gruelling 10-hour training sessions in a bid to levitate himself to the top of the Strictly leaderboard.

The CBBC presenter is determined to give his all to the competition - and is not too fussed about receiving negative comments from the judges.

“The funny thing is the judges are a small part of what’s a very busy week. They’re all lovely” he said.

“Craig’s lovely too. Everything he’s said so far I’ve agreed with. They don’t want you to fail. They don’t want to see someone make a horrible mistake on the dancefloor.

“All Craig is doing is saying the truth that you could do more of this or do that better. There’s no malice and it’s all constructive criticism.”

So so hard and sad to lose Josie on this Earth but I’m sure she is already telling jokes and being creative in Heaven plus she is with your Dad Paula her family and Your dad’s family. She’s one person I never thought about leaving here- but even through sadness know that she is where she longed to be. You all loved her with a special love as did many others. What a talented and creative Mom and grandmother and relative!!! For a long time if I ever needed help with a creative idea she would have one for me. We loved your parents your parents loved us and what a day of rejoicing that will be to see Jesus our parents and many others. Much love always!!! ❤️ - Don and Kathy Maxwell  Elberton  Georgia

I was scrolling the obituaries and I saw where our dear sweet Josie passed awaymy heart brokeshe and your dad were a very special couple to me and I will forever cherish their memory.Thanks be to the lord for sharing the gift of their lives with us for so many years.I know in my heart that earth has lost a saintbut heaven has gained an angel.You will all be in my thoughts and prayers during this difficult timeand just know that I love you all so much.Friends alwaysNancy Fender Martin - Nancy Martin  SAVANNAH  Georgia

On behalf of the Southern Company Gas team we express our extreme condolences and prayers to the Spivey family. The thoughts and prayers of our team are with the family during this time of grief and healing. - Southern Company Gas  Atlanta  GA

I can not possibly express how sad I am to hear about Mrs. Spivey's passing. She is probably the most important influence that led me to become an educator. I carried her silly grammar songs and grammar graveyards into my practice as a middle school language arts teacher. One thing that always makes me smile when I think of her is the knowledge that a not very small piece of Josie Spivey lives in all of us who were privileged enough to be her students. The last time I came to visit her in Savannah she gave me her copy of Truman Capote's ""A Christmas Wish."" She read that story to our class at Christmas time. I then shared it with my classes every year until I left the classroom in 2018. Now even those students can say they were touched by her. I was never able to read the whole thing without crying and passing it to one of my students to finish. I will cherish those memories for as long as I live. She was the embodiment of the sentiment ""to teach is to touch a life forever."" I will NEVER forget her. - Mimi Witherington Allen  Rifle  CO

So sad to hear this news. Of course John & Josie were good friends of my parents Jane & Doby and to all us Krafts through those many Savannah Electric years. I have such a clear recollection of your mom's always-sweet reaction on greeting me and seemingly always with a smile a little pivot forward to come in for a hug and I'm pretty sure a twinkle in her eye. I know you'll miss her bunches. - John Kraft  Acworth  GA

I’m so sorry for your loss. Mrs. Spivey was one of my all-time favorite teachers. In addition to being a creative and brilliant educator she was a nurturing and caring person. I’m now a retired teacher and principal and I can honestly say Mrs. Spivey is the exemplar of what a great teacher looks like. She would climb on a desk under a table and step in the trash can to help us learn prepositions. Each Halloween we “buried” double negatives and other grammatical errors. While her lessons were amazing creative and overall fantastic what stands out to me is how much she cared and made all of us feel welcomed and loved when we entered her room. She made us want to learn what she had to teach because she was just that special of a person. My grade was so lucky because we had her for 7th grade and 8th grade English. I am so thankful for her and the lessons she taught. What a great legacy she leaves behind. Prayers for all of her family and loved ones. There are many many people who are better off now than they would have been if they had not known Mrs. Spivey. - Paige Conner Dickey  Rincon  GA

Our thoughts and prayers are with you. - Gary Branch  Glennville  Georgia

A candle has been lit! A candle has been lit! She was my friend that I Loved from the bottom of my heart she was ""MA-Josie"" - The McDonald Family  Glennville  GA

You are all in my thoughts and prayers. Josie was a very special Lady and will be missed by many who loved her. I had the privilege of knowing Josie and John and they both hold a special place in my heart. - Ellen Spivey  Pooler  GA

Mrs. Spivey was without a doubt my favorite teacher. She made learning English grammar fun and memorable. (I still remember the ""Not is not a verb"" song). She made us feel loved and appreciated and special. I will always remember her fondly and smile when I think of her. My deepest condolences to her family and friends. May her memory be a blessing. - Sandra Karlin  Savannah  GA",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYy5lZHUvY29udGVudC9iYy13ZWIvc2Nob29scy9seW5jaC1zY2hvb2wvbHluY2gtbmV3cy9hbHVtbmktYW5kLXN0dWRlbnQtbm90ZXMtZmFsbC0yMDIxL05ldy1Cb2FyZC1vZi1UcnVzdGVlcy1tZW1iZXIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Triple Eagle is named to BC's Board of Trustees - Lynch School of Education and Human Development,"Triple Eagle is named to BC's Board of Trustees

Denver International Airport | Vince Bzdek,"Denver International Airport CEO Phil Washington is off to a rough start.

Since he was named to his new job in June the airport has experienced massive parking shortages a janitors strike hours-long security waits thanks to a lack of TSA workers and a maze of construction walls a slew of Southwest Airlines flight cancellations train malfunctions that stranded passengers in tunnels a spike in car thefts from its lots and in a sure sign of end times a naked woman with a water bottle running around the concourses.

“How are you doing? Where are you from?” the naked lady asked bystanders in a video shared with CBS.

Her greetings made me wonder if this is part of a new airport ambassador program to distract us from all of DIA’s other woes.

DIA my friends is a nightmare.

As pent-up demand sends Americans back en masse into the air the problems are beginning to pile up like a bunch of suitcases overflowing a baggage carousel.

I traveled through the airport recently on the way to Seattle and encountered a kind of transit hellscape. First of all of course you have to drive to Kansas to get there so you already arrive in a foul mood. Then you have to park in Nebraska because 17000 parking spaces in the Pikes Peak and Elbert lots are closed due to a lack of shuttle drivers. Airport staff were telling people last weekend not to drive to the airport at all because for the first time ever they pretty much ran out of parking spaces.

Once you get inside you have to navigate so many artificial walls due to construction it quickly becomes a game of “Will I make my flight on time?” All this while you’re hyperventilating in your required mask and social distancing is impossible because the airport is so crowded.

Then of course there is that centralized snarl of security lines in the Great Hall. Why can’t DIA move security to the concourses like so many other airports so there are several smaller lines rather than one massive warren of checkpoints? I waited about an hour in that security line and then naturally my gate was 6 miles away at the end of Concourse B — and of course several of the moving walkways weren’t working so I got my 10000 steps in just getting to my gate.

But at least the trains were working. In August thousands of people were left waiting multiple hours after a circuit breaker shut down four of the trains. Lines backed up so far they snaked outside the terminal and eventually folks were bused across the tarmac. Repairs took 10 hours after emergency personnel escorted travelers through the tunnel walkways and then swept the tunnel to be sure they hadn’t left anyone behind.

The new CEO has maintained a low profile during this pileup of woe letting his communications folks handle all the flak from passengers and press.

There was some conflict you may recall after it was revealed that Mayor Michael Hancock nominated Washington for DIA’s top job without searching for any other candidates. Hancock said he did it to save time and money since he was confident Washington was right for the position.

Also Washington had no previous airport experience before taking the job. His background is in managing transit agencies like RTD in Denver and LA Metro in Los Angeles.

Featured Local Savings

Passengers like me are starting to wonder who is minding the store.

To be fair Washington has inherited many of his problems such as the giant construction project in the Great Hall that has been delayed repeatedly by contract trouble.

Phase 2 of the Great Hall Project began this summer (before Phase 1 is finished) and should eventually improve things by enhancing security and enlarging capacity including a new security checkpoint on Level 6 West. But be forewarned: The construction won’t be finished until 2024.

And some of DIA’s problems can be attributed to simple growing pains. Over the last 26 years DIA has grown from 33.1 million annual passengers to more than 69 million passengers so that it is currently the third busiest airport in the world according to Alex Renteria DIA’s public information officer.

To accommodate that growth DIA is building 39 new concourse gates during the expansion project increasing overall capacity at the airport by 30%. Some of those concourse extensions will have some pretty cool features too like outdoor patios and firepits.

Much of DIA’s trouble can be attributed to the same lack of workers the whole country is facing. About 30000 people work at DIA total and currently there are about 1500 jobs open.

The airport is holding job fairs to find employees and the TSA is even offering new security hires $1000 bonuses CNBC recently reported.

As far as parking the hope is to hire enough drivers to have the Pikes Peak and Mount Elbert lots opened by the end of the year. The Pikes Peak Lot was scheduled to open temporarily this weekend then shut down again Saturday night.

“We understand that construction is frustrating and long lines are really frustrating” said Renteria the spokesman for the airport. “We’re doing our best to ensure that this is a brief moment in the history of our airport. Really soon it will be a state-of-the-art airport that people will be really proud of and we really look forward to that moment.”

The bad news is this will all get worse in the coming months as the holidays hit and the busiest days of the airport return. Renteria doesn’t foresee the lines abating much until DIA’s staffing shortages end.

It’d be nice to hear from the new CEO that some how some way DIA will be able to handle the holiday crush a little better than it is handling things now. Renteria said right now Washington is focused on the “big picture” of the Vision 100 project which is all about getting the airport ready to accommodate 100 million passengers a year by 2030-2035.

But in lieu of a Washington sighting if you find yourself tearing your hair out over the coming weeks just look for a naked lady running about.

These are bogus even though they were shared widely on social media. Here are the facts:

CLAIM: A Delta Airlines pilot who had recently been vaccinated for COVID-19 died mid-flight within the last 10 days forcing the plane to make an emergency landing.

THE FACTS: This false claim circulated widely on video-sharing websites blogs and Instagram this week following a Monday segment on the conservative talk show “The Stew Peters Show.” Show guest Jane Ruby a political pundit said that she had heard about the incident from three whistleblowers.

“A pilot died in flight within the last I’d say 10 days according to these sources” Ruby said. “The flight had to make an emergency landing.” Ruby added that the pilot was based at the Los Angeles International Airport and that staff on board “did land the plane safely.” She also said she had heard from one of the whistleblowers that the pilot had recently received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose.

But the claim is entirely false Delta Airlines said in a statement addressing the topic on Wednesday. “Delta is aware of reports suggesting one of the airline’s pilots passed away from vaccine complications while operating a flight resulting in an emergency landing” the statement read. “All of these allegations are false.”

The FAA also told the AP in an email it “has found no evidence such an event occurred.” Emergency landings or medical issues on commercial flights frequently appear in news articles but an internet search turned up no news article matching any similar incident from October 1 to 11 2021 the time period that the claim referenced. A search on a website tracking global aviation-related incidents also turned up no emergency landing incidents involving Delta Airlines during this time period.

The media company that hosts “The Stew Peters Show” did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Peters or Ruby. The false story was one example of misinformation that surged online this week surrounding airline pilots and COVID-19 vaccinations. When Southwest Airlines canceled more than 2000 flights last weekend social media users made the unverified claim that it was because of employees protesting vaccine mandates. Southwest Airlines denied these claims saying bad weather and air traffic control issues caused the disruptions.

— Ali Swenson

CLAIM: Video shows people dropping “dead” outside a COVID-19 vaccination clinic in London after receiving a shot.

THE FACTS: The video which circulated on Twitter does not show anyone dying or even collapsing after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Rather it shows a protest outside the North Kensington Fire Station in London where a bus was providing COVID-19 vaccinations.

The nature of the protest isn’t entirely clear from the video but it appears to be related to COVID-19. In the video a woman passes the bus as she walks down the street and then collapses off camera. The woman can then be seen lying on the sidewalk as onlookers are heard asking if she is all right. A man asks if the woman was “jabbed” a common way of asking if someone has received the vaccine.

“Protesters outside a covid vaccination clinic watch in horror as people drop dead before their eyes!!!” states the tweet making the false claim. The incident took place on Oct. 6.

In fact the woman “had not been on the bus but was walking on the road where the vaccine bus was parked” according to a spokesperson for the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. “She fainted” the spokesperson said. “I am not sure what the cause was. Only that she didn’t have a vaccine from the vaccine bus.”

The Associated Press also reached out to the London Fire Brigade for further details. A spokesperson with the brigade said no information had been logged by the North Kensington Fire Station about the incident.

Oakland: 9 Key Differences,"Separated by a bay San Francisco and Oakland (along with San Jose) are home to 7.1 million people living across nine counties in the Bay Area. While mentioning San Francisco is likely to immediately fill your mind with images of crimson-and-gold cable cars and one of the world’s most famous suspension bridges you may draw a blank when it comes to Oakland.

As a teenager living in the Bay Area my parents wouldn’t think twice about my friends and I heading into San Francisco for the day staying long past sundown. But my mom would’ve been concerned if I’d told her I was going to Oakland. Back then Oakland was plagued by economic hardships caught in the crosshairs of violent gangs and dealing with a crack epidemic.

But many years have passed and times have changed (although apparently these 1980s fashion trends are back). Today Oakland is a bustling culturally diverse city offering plenty of interaction with the locals. Here’s how it compares with San Francisco one of the Golden State’s top travel destinations.

1. Getting There

The Bay Area is located near the midpoint of California’s coastline roughly halfway between Los Angeles and the Oregon border. Both San Francisco and Oakland have large international airports serviced by carriers like Delta Southwest and Alaska Airlines.

Because I’m a loyal Southwest Airlines customer I prefer to fly in and out of Oakland even if San Francisco is my final destination. It’s not the most luxurious airport you’ll ever visit but it gets the job done. You can zip across the Bay on BART and arrive in the heart of San Francisco in about 40 minutes. While the ride is about 10 minutes longer than the route from SFO I find that the Oakland Airport’s smaller size is easier to navigate and that I typically make up those 10 minutes. However if you prefer to fly American or United Airlines those carriers recently dropped service in Oakland (in large part due to the COVID-19 pandemic) so you’ll want to opt for SFO instead.

While you should always be aware of your surroundings in large metropolitan areas you’ll want to be especially vigilant against car break-ins near the Oakland airport. Our family is always drawn to the big yellow arrow and cherry red palm trees of In-n-Out Burger the moment we land and there is one just minutes from Oakland Airport. However signs posted in the strip mall where it is located warn visitors about break-ins. It is only thanks to the security guard posted outside the burger joint who shooed off two guys about to break out our back window that our car wasn’t vandalized in broad daylight on our last visit. And we’ll probably visit a different location next time.

2. Golden Gate Vs. Oakland Bay Bridge

With its fire engine red towers piercing through the fog as it connects San Francisco to Marin County the Golden Gate Bridge is one of the most recognizable bridges in the world. Meanwhile connecting Oakland and the rest of the East Bay to San Francisco the Oakland Bay Bridge carries more than a third of the traffic of all state-owned bridges combined. I often joke that the Golden Gate is the beauty and the Bay Bridge is the workhorse.

It will cost you about $8 to cross the Golden Gate Bridge by car but the Oakland Bay Bridge toll currently caps out at $7 with lower prices extended on weekends off-peak hours and to commuters who carpool.

3. Size And Location

In terms of population San Francisco is more densely populated with 875000 people packed into just under 50 square miles. With half as many residents and about 10 more square miles of land Oakland can feel a little less crowded.

Both San Francisco and Oakland are about an hour’s drive north of the Bay Area’s largest city San Jose making them excellent day trips when visiting Silicon Valley. San Francisco is a straight shot from San Jose along US-101 and Oakland is due north of San Jose via I-880.

4. Weather

While San Francisco is famous for its fog and year-round 60-something temperatures across the Bay Bridge the weather in Oakland is nearly always warmer (and sunnier) especially from May through September. So if your Bay Area itinerary is packed full but you are sick and tired of being cold (especially in July) then take a day trip across the bay to Oakland and warm up!

5. Things To Do And See

With a National Historic Landmark you can ride an infamous prison a pier packed with sea lions and so much more San Francisco has a long list of well-known attractions. Other favorite things to see and do include wandering through Golden Gate Park grabbing a bite at the Ferry Building ascending the Coit Tower and driving down Lombard Street (called the most crooked street in the world even though it’s really not).

While it’s hard to compete with one of America’s most visited cities from across the San Francisco Bay Oakland offers some of the best views of San Francisco. In Oakland you can also explore Jack London Square and hike the Bay Bridge Trail. And because Oakland flows smoothly into surrounding areas like Berkeley and Richmond I recommend spending a day in eclectic Berkeley and touring the Rosie the Riveter National Historic Park during your visit.

6. Cheer For The Home Team

The Bay Area is a great destination for sports fans with six major league teams. In San Francisco the locals cheer for the Giants while across the bay they support the Athletics (known affectionately as the A’s). But now that the Oakland Raiders have relocated to Las Vegas American football fans will want to leave their silver and black at home and don red and gold to cheer on the 49ers. Basketball fans won’t want to miss a Golden State Warriors game at Chase Center but soccer and hockey fans will have to travel about an hour south of both San Francisco and Oakland to cheer on the Earthquakes and Sharks.

7. Cost

California is one of America’s most expensive states so neither San Francisco nor Oakland is exactly a budget destination. However everything from accommodations to after-dinner drinks tends to be more affordable in Oakland as opposed to San Francisco.

For example if you spend your first night in a Bay Area king room with a balcony overlooking the courtyard at the Courtyard Marriott near the Oakland Airport you can expect to spend about $180 on a weeknight. Across the Bay a similar room (without a view) at the Courtyard by Marriott San Francisco Airport is about $475.

And the next morning whether you grab coffee and breakfast at a local restaurant or a chain you’ll typically find slightly lower prices in Oakland versus San Francisco. But believe it or not the sales tax is higher in Oakland (10.25 percent) than in San Francisco (8.625 percent).

8. Fantastic Food

When it comes to delicious places to dine both San Francisco and Oakland are filled with tasty options. Because both cities are located on the coast seafood is a popular choice. In San Francisco try the Pacific Cafe at the corner of 34th and Geary where you can enjoy complimentary wine while you wait. Or dine at Hog Island Oyster Co. in the Ferry Building just south of Pier 1. On the other side of the bay Scott’s Seafood overlooking the colorful Oakland Harbor at Jack London Waterfront is a great option.

And if you appreciate fine dining the Bay Area is the place to be. San Francisco boasts 117 restaurants in the Michelin Guide while Oakland is home to 22 Michelin star eateries.

Pro Tip: Here are several other delicious places to eat in San Francisco.

9. Amazing Architecture

Even if you haven’t visited San Francisco chances are you can immediately recognize its skyline due to the unique shape of one of its tallest buildings the Transamerica Pyramid. You’re also likely to recognize the city’s Painted Ladies lining the east side of Alamo Square from the opening credits of Full House and you may be able to identify the firehose shaped structure perched on Telegraph Hill as the Coit Tower or the city’s newest landmark.

But you may have a tough time naming even one notable landmark across the bay in Oakland. From my point of view this means it’s a wonderful place to explore if you’ve already crossed all of the San Francisco landmarks off your bucket list or you enjoy taking the road less traveled. Check out the 16th Street Station a century-old railroad station that’s been given new life as a private events venue. Or visit the 100-year-old Cathedral Building the first Gothic Revival-style skyscraper west of the Mississippi that’s since been transformed from office space to apartments.

One of the best things about visiting the Bay Area is that you don’t have to choose between San Francisco and Oakland. Rather you can pick and choose the airport accommodations eating establishments and sights that work best for you."

It’s kind of surprising that even though it’s been around for years in other parts of the world Starbucks has yet to bring its Been There drinkware line to Japan. This is a country that absolutely loves both the coffeehouse chain’s beverages and localized collector knickknacks so what’s the holdu-

Oh wait they’re here.

As of October 13 the line has finally arrived in Japan with the simultaneous release of no less than 20 different designs each one filled with playfully stylish nods to the regional culture and attractions of a different part of Japan. Naturally one of those parts is Tokyo whose mug is decked out with illustrations of the Kaminarimon gate of Asakusa the cherry blossoms of Ueno Park the crepes and frilly dresses of Harajuku and loyal dog/Shibuya meeting spot Hachiko.

Both entire prefectures and individual cities are represented stretching from Hokkaido in the north to Okinawa in the south.

▼ Speaking of Hokkaido you’ll find snowy scenery and wildlife such as a deer and bear on its mug.

In addition to mugs certain locations also get stainless steel drink bottles. Let’s start with a cross-country tour of the mugs though where in addition to Tokyo and Hokkaido we’re making the following stops to see sights including:

▼ Kyoto (temple pagodas and maiko/geisha in training)

▼ Osaka (takoyaki octopus dumplings and the Ebisu Bridge of the Dotonbori entertainment district)

▼ Nara (the free-roaming deer of Nara Park)

▼ Hiroshima (beautiful red maple leaves and the Shimanami Kaido island-hopping bicycle route)

▼ Yokohama (the Minato Mirai harbor district skyline and a plate of shumai dumplings from Chinatown)

▼ Oita (hot springs)

▼ Kanazawa (Kenrokuen Garden)

▼ Nagano (world-class skiing and a starry night sky free of the light pollution of big cities)

▼ Gifu (cormorant fishing and the preserved thatch-roof farmhouses of Shirakawa-go)

▼ Fukuoka (tonkotsu ramen food carts and mentaiko spicy cod roe)

▼ Kumamoto (Kumamoto Castle)

▼ Sendai (one of the tree-lined streets the city is famous for plus a view of the nearby islands of Matsushima)

▼ Tochigi (mountain scenery and the hear-no-evil speak-no-evil see-no-evil monkeys of Nikko)

▼ Nagoya (the mythical Kinshachi creatures from the roof of Nagoya Castle and a car likely from the nearby Toyota factory)

▼ Kobe (the city’s harbor and preserved Meiji-period western architecture)

▼ Nagasaki (a dragon dance in Chinatown)

▼ And last Okinawa (a sandy beach and some shisa guardian lions)

In alphabetical order that’s Fukuoka Gifu Hiroshima Hokkaido Kanazawa Kobe Kumamoto Kyoto Nagano Nagasaki Nagoya Nara Oita Okinawa Osaka Sendai Tochigi Tokyo and Yokohama. If you’re having trouble playing favorites though there’s also an all-purpose “Japan” design with Mt Fuji cherry blossoms and susuki.

All 20 designs are available as mugs and seven (Fukuoka Hokkaido Kyoto Okinawa Osaka Tokyo and Japan) also come in bottle form.

The mugs are priced at 1980 yen (US$18.15) and the 473-milliliter (16-ounce) bottles at 4840 yen. The specific-place Been There designs do indeed require you to have been there as they’re only sold at Starbucks branches in those locations but the Japan design is available through Starbucks Japan’s online store here.

It's that time of year: pumpkin spice season is here.

Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte kicked off a pumpkin spice economy with millennials leading the way.

Love it or hate it pumpkin spice is a cultural icon here to stay thanks to the power of exclusivity and nostalgia.

Syrup. Fig Bars. Hot Chocolate. Pancakes.

They're all part of the pumpkin spice economy that famously began with Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL). Whether you love it or love to hate it what was once a trend has become a fall icon.

Since introducing the PSL in 2003 the coffee chain had sold 424 million PSLs worldwide as of 2019. Starting at $5.25 a cup that's more than $2.2 billion in revenue. Such success has sparked copycat lattes by competitors like Dunkin' Donuts and Tim Hortons pumpkin spice-flavored products at stores like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's and even non-food pumpkin spice items like candles and hand sanitizer transforming the flavor into both a $500 million annual industry and a season.

Starbucks' famous Pumpkin Spice Latte started it all.

Starbucks



But pumpkin spice didn't really become a phenomenon until the last decade. As digital savvy consumers took to Twitter and Instagram to share their affinity for the PSL it quickly gained a reputation as the autumnal version of avocado toast for millennials.

Dozens of articles hundreds of memes and thousands of Tweets associated the PSL with a ""basic"" white girl millennial. Look no further than the PSL's shoutout in Bustle's ""How to Spot a Basic Bitch"" or even millennials mocking themselves with Tweets like ""common white girl #PSL.""

-Parks and rec (@_PWHITT) October 17 2013

Hating on the pumpkin spice trend had become a trend of its own. Some have even called the demise of pumpkin spice as far back as 2015 but six years later it's retained a powerful foothold in the autumnal lexicon. For all the stereotypes millennials get for the PSL they propelled a food revolution with a broad appeal that has become deeply embedded in American culture.

A picture-perfect drink is born

Pumpkin spice – typically a blend of cinnamon nutmeg ginger allspice and cloves – has actually been around for over two centuries. It first appeared in a ""pompkin"" pie recipe featured in a 1798 reprint of ""American Cookery."" By the 1930s spice manufacturing companies like McCormick had introduced their own blends.

But Starbucks ushered in a whole new era. Director of Espresso Peter Dukes was on a mission to recreate the success of Starbucks' limited edition winter drinks like Peppermint Mocha for fall. He thought he found something special because ""there wasn't anything around pumpkin at the time"" he told The Daily Meal back in 2013.

They rolled the PSL out as a test at 100 stores in 2003 debuting it nationwide in 2004. That October company sales increased by 11% compared to the year prior thanks in large part to the PSL according to local publication SeattleMet. But it was social media advancements in the 2010s that really made pumpkin spice blow up.

Starbucks was targeting the social-media-using millennial with disposable income Kara Nielsen director of food and drink at trend forecasting company WGSN told Insider. As part of this strategy it launched an official Twitter account and Instagram for the PSL.





A post shared by Diana🍂 (@kaleidoscopiccmind)

Past generations didn't grow up with Starbucks Nielsen added and millennials were frequenting Starbucks and developing a latte habit. They also had started carrying around phones and proven themselves to be consumers interested in trying new things. ""This wasn't the target of a coffee connoisseur really looking forward to an exceptional coffee experience"" she said.

Millennials easily succumbed to the magic of a limited time offer which created a sense of urgency and exclusivity. While this marketing strategy is a popular tactic Nielsen said it was especially enticing to young adults who would post pictures of themselves enjoying the PSL on social media. This publicized pumpkin spice making it even more of a frenzy.

And so the pumpkin spice economy was born all from a flavored special drink that Nielsen says has become part of many people's identity and part of a seasonal performance.

The power of comfort and nostalgia

Nearly 20 years later the novelty factor of pumpkin spice is long gone. The appeal now lies in a sense of comfort.

This dates back to the 2008 financial crisis when pumpkin became part of the comfort food trend of the Great Recession. It was during the recession's recovery that it began to move into ""a more experimental realm"" Suzy Badaracco a chef who runs food trend forecasting company Culinary Tides told Vox back in 2014.

It's popularity hasn't always been consistent seeming to have peaked in 2017 according to Google search trends. But Nielsen said the pandemic has only strengthened pumpkin spice's comfort attribute cementing it as a permanent fixture in American society. Returning to pre-pandemic routines like picking up a PSL on a crisp fall morning she said gives people a sense of normalcy that they're so desperately craving.

That comfort is linked to nostalgia which people have been seeking during the pandemic. Recent research from Johns Hopkins University found that pumpkin spice's popularity lies in its smell which is the strongest sense to trigger powerful memories. The scent of pumpkin spice evokes cozy autumnal memories. Even knowing that your drink or food is pumpkin spice revs up the brain telling it to anticipate the smell and helping us perceive the taste more distinctly.

-𝐀𝐮 𝐧𝐨𝐦 𝐝𝐞 𝐥’𝐚𝐫𝐭. (@aunomdelart) October 11 2021

Jason Fischer a JHU professor of psychological and brain sciences and one of the researchers behind the study told Insider that nostalgia for pumpkin spice is stronger than other flavor and aroma combinations because of the ""whimsical feeling of familiarity"" that it summons up. It's a ""feeling that has been built up over the years as pumpkin spice products emerge to mark the change of the season"" he said.

Fischer noted that the perception of pumpkin spice as a millennial drink may be based more on a social narrative than actual buying habits. But nostalgia could be more potent for the generation he added since science shows we form stronger associations between odors and memories earlier in life.

""For someone who has spent a large portion of their life experiencing the seasonal pumpkin spice craze year after year the link between pumpkin spice and fond memories of fall is bound to be especially strong"" he said.

What began as a millennial drink has ultimately become a cultural marker both beloved and reviled that's launched an entire industry and a more experiential food economy. Nielsen said pumpkin spice has added to the richness of American food culture in a way that didn't exist 20 years ago with brands working to create unique seasonal flavors like spiced pear or salted maple.

As for pumpkin spice itself Nielsen said ""It may not always be the most popular but it's place in history is secure.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtcG9wdWxhci1jb2ZmZWUtY2hhaW4tY3VycmVudGx5LW91dHBlcmZvcm1pbmctc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWFuZC1kdW5raW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Popular Coffee Chain Is Currently Outperforming Starbucks and Dunkin',"If you haven't been to a Dutch Bros. coffee shop yet you likely live in a state in the eastern half of America. That's because the chain is already spread out far and wide across the West and is now rapidly expanding in Texas and the rest of the Great Plains.

But the number of locations does not tell the real story behind this chain's success: for that story look to Dutch Bros.' latest sales numbers and compare them to those of Starbucks and Dunkin' the two largest coffee chains in the nation. In terms of same-store visits Dutch Bros. is crushing its major competitors.

Founded in Grants Pass Ore. as a pushcart espresso vendor by brothers Travis and Dane Boersma in 1992 Dutch Bros. took many years to grow into the powerhouse coffee chain it is today. And with a fiercely loyal customer base and a highly efficient drive-thru business model—which was at the crux of its pandemic success—Dutch Bros. looks set to keep on growing.

Here's what you need to know about this customer-favorite brand that's smoking the competition. For more check out Wendy's Just Struck a Deal That Will Drastically Change the Way It Operates.

Dutch Bros. is big and getting bigger

At present there are more than 470 Dutch Bros. locations according to The San Joaquin Valley Sun and more are on the way. Though the first Dutch Bros. in Texas opened earlier this year a Placer.ai report states that the chain hopes to have around 100 locations in that state alone by the end of the year 2023. The West Coast states are currently the most heavily saturated with Dutch Bros. shops though Arizona Idaho and Colorado also have many locations.

A pandemic success story

Before the coming of COVID-19 Dutch Bros. was doing just fine but they hardly stood out as a threat to Starbucks and Dunkin'. That all changed in April 2020 mere weeks into the pandemic. According to Placer.ai that month saw visits to Starbucks and Dunkin' plummet by a significant 60% while Dutch Bros. visits only dropped by 11.4%.

This modest drop was largely due to the chain's well-established drive-thru business model which allowed for minimal customer contact during transactions. And in the spring and into the early summer of 2020 Dutch Bros. not only made up for that 11.4% drop in visits but saw its customer traffic surge by more than 50% even as visits to Starbucks and Dunkin' remained below pre-pandemic levels.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Dutch Bros. is still outperforming its rivals today

As it turns out Dutch Bros. success—and its outperforming of Dunkin' and Starbucks—was no mere pandemic fluke. Currently the chain is still outperforming the giants. Data from Placer.ai shows that as of September 2021 Dutch Bros. received 113.8% more visits than it had in October 2019 compared with an 11.9% increase for Dunkin' and a 1.8% decrease for Starbucks.

A customer favorite

Dutch Bros. is not only seeing more growth in terms of locations but it's seeing better same-store sales and increased customer loyalty. According to Placer.ai in September of this year visits to Dutch Bros. locations were up approximately 112% compared to the same time period in 2019. (Q3 of 2019 is used as a basis for comparison in the report in general.) Dunkin' meanwhile saw only an 11% rise in traffic during that month while Starbucks saw a dip of 3.4%.

Starbucks and Dunkin' beware

Dutch Bros. has only been a publicly traded company for a few weeks but if the company's IPO is any indicator it could be poised to take an even bigger share of the fast-food coffee market from the major coffee chains.

The Dutch Bros. initial public offering on September 15 saw around 24.2 million shares offered at a starting price of $23 according to a Dutch Bros. press release. Within hours the stocks were trading for more than $36 according to Yahoo! Finance and at present BROS shares are valued at $55.22. The stock's all-time high so far is $60.05 more than 2.6 times its value at the IPO.

(Yonhap) A truck that reads “We want to sell coffee not engage in marketing and promotions” drives through the streets of Seoul on Oct. 7 after a promotional event drew long lines of customers at Starbucks stores. (Yonhap)



Stung by its employees‘ first collective action Starbucks Korea said Sunday that it will hire 1600 more baristas and store staff by the end of this year and improve working conditions.



The hiring plan is part of the firm’s package of measures announced in response to recent complaints from in-store staff that they were overworked and underpaid.



“We plan to hire in order to secure more staff and enhance work efficiency at stores nationwide. The company is also reviewing potential changes to the wage structure which would include a pay raise for store managers improved incentive plans and differentiated hourly wages based on experience” the company said in a press release Sunday.



From Oct. 7-8 store employees and baristas mobilized two trucks in Seoul emblazoned with words of protest in the first collective action in 22 years at Starbucks Korea where there is no labor union.



The action organized through Blind an anonymous social media app was triggered by a reusable cup marketing event that drew long lines of customers at Starbucks stores.



Announcing the measures Starbucks also said it would look for ways to prevent marketing and promotional events from putting too much pressure on employees and that it would form a special task force dedicated to the effort.



The team will predict customer demand and provide real-time support for difficulties faced during such promotions Starbucks said.

They wanted a big wedding with their friends and family in attendance Laurie said but the COVID-19 pandemic kept getting in the way.

Now with Devlyn in the hospital fighting COVID-19 for the second time they decided it was as good a time as any to tie the knot.

The couple who have been together for more than three years got married Saturday at Sparrow Specialty Hospital with decorations cobbled together from their doctor's basement and her own wedding. The two married in T-shirts labeled ""bride"" and ""groom"" with two patient care technicians acting as the flower girl and ring bearer.

They found a minister to marry them through Facebook and organized everything in less than two weeks.

Laurie said the experience has been overwhelming but wonderful. She and Devlyn didn't want to put off their wedding any longer after his latest COVID scare she said.

""Do what you want to do don't wait"" Laurie said.

Devlyn has been in the hospital since Aug. 28 recovering from COVID-19. He was on a ventilator.

This was his second time with COVID-19 this year. After a mild first case in April he was advised to wait 90 days before getting vaccinated. But before he could get the shot he got the virus again he said.

The second bout has been ""terrible"" Devlyn said.

""I didn't know where I was at I didn't recognize anybody"" he said.

When asked what kept him going Devlyn said ""she did.""

Devlyn said he should be released from Sparrow Specialty Hospital in about a week but he isn't going home right away. He'll transition back home at Clinton Memorial he said.

Roger Taylor who has been friends with Devlyn for more than 50 years acted as the best man Saturday. Devlyn was the best man in his own wedding several decades ago.

""I know he's honorable I know he's loyal. He's always been that way towards me"" Taylor said. ""We're raising our glasses to the new married couple Devlyn and Laurie Kuehl.""

Kristy Beckholt Devlyn's doctor and the executive medical director at Sparrow Specialty Hospital said she wanted do to something special for them because of how positive they always were.

""That's what makes this place so special"" Beckholt said ""that we're here for the whole patient not just the disease.""

Sparrow Specialty Hospital has been treating a lot of long-term COVID-19 patients Beckholt said. Right now one-third of their 30 beds are filled with COVID patients.

""And they keep coming"" she said. ""It can be really scary.""

Beckholt said she highly recommends people get their COVID-19 vaccine if they have not already. If they are hesitant about it they should talk to their physician or use reliable sources like the Centers for Disease Control to do research.

To the east South Bend Avenue/State Road 23 is seeing a building boom.

Unlike Eddy Street Commons which was started in 2007 by Indianapolis-based Kite Realty largely on undeveloped land multiple developers are replacing old buildings with new ones along South Bend Avenue.

Work on some of the projects already is visible. Drive & Shine is far along on building a new car wash and oil change location at 2046 South Bend Ave. after buying and demolishing several businesses including the former Coach’s Sports Bar & Grill.

Liquor store denied: Council says no to developer who wants to be part of Eddy Street commercial growth

Also beginning to take shape a few lots south of that site former Notre Dame basketball standout and current Milwaukee Bucks star Pat Connaughton’s Three Leaf Development has started construction on a two-structure apartment complex where Venezuelan eatery Mango Café once stood.

Two floors of high-end apartments to be marketed toward university faculty and alumni will front South Bend Avenue above ground-floor retail while the second building at the rear of the site will include three stories of apartments atop an indoor parking garage.

“I think Pat realizes that once people graduate there they’re tied to Notre Dame forever” said Joe Stanton Three Leaf’s director of project management. “They want to come back and experience football games and all the things the university has to offer. That’s kind of why Notre Dame is such a big name and one of the best universities in the world.”

Notre Dame alumni fueling development

Marketing condos to alumni for home game weekends is nothing new around Notre Dame but leasing them apartments will be. The project will offer luxury units mostly two- and three-bedrooms with higher-quality finishes including stone counters hardwood floors and stainless steel appliances. Monthly rents will range from $1400 to $4000.

Noah Davey senior broker and partner with NAI Cressy Commercial Real Estate who listed the Mango Café site agreed that alumni continue to fuel land development around the campus. He said he also is fielding interest from developers in 1432 South Bend Ave. which contains a two-story home just north of Parisi’s Ristorante Italiano.

The house likely will be demolished to make way for whatever is coming but also could be moved because of its “character” Davey said.

“The price point evidence is the value of the land” Davey said noting it’s listed for $1025000. “It wouldn’t be crazy that possibly some alumni would have interest in maybe occupying the home. What makes this corridor interesting is you have a lot of alumni that key into Notre Dame. Often the pricing that you see here in this market compared to say Chicago or California often looks like a deal to people who live in some of those major markets.”

Davey said he only started listing the property a couple weeks ago but interest already has grown since the South Bend Common Council Oct. 4 passed a bill increasing the height limit on buildings outside the downtown from three to four stories.

“Obviously the taller you can go the more density you can achieve” Davey said. “The more density you achieve the higher the price you can pay for ground. Historically in the South Bend area you wouldn’t see taller buildings anywhere but downtown. Now you’re seeing it pushing into the East Bank and around the university.”

Davey called the council’s action “progressive.”

It came in response to a bill from the Mayor James Mueller administration after the city’s Board of Zoning Appeals Aug. 2 in a 3-2 vote rejected a plan for five-story condos and a rooftop bar with campus views at the site of the former Mulligan’s Bar and Grill near the busy South Bend Avenue/Angela Boulevard/Edison Road intersection.

A 'rooftop experience'

In presenting the four-story bill to the council city Zoning Administrator Angela Smith has said the city has increasingly fielded requests from developers to build higher than three stories because more units are needed to offset elevator construction costs. Davey said costs to demolition of existing buildings and property improvement costs exceeding land values also have been “barriers to entry” for the market.

Having already closed on the Mulligan’s property the developer on that project Seattle-based Network Ventures Inc. is again eager to move forward said partner Chris Gormley.

Smith said Network Ventures can now either build only four stories try again for a special zoning exception for five stories or wait until the administration brings another bill to the council seeking a five-story limit. Mueller spokesman Caleb Bauer confirmed that’s in the administration’s plans but said there’s no timeline for that next bill.

“We’re super thankful that the fourth floor was amended” Gormley said. “I know there’s some conversations we’re having with the city about the fifth level and what that’s going to look like because we do want to provide a rooftop experience not only for the condominium owners but also ideally a retail space.”

Gormley said plans for the restaurant and bar and therefore the question of whether to build four stories or seek a fifth floor are in flux because of an easement or right-of-way that runs through the site from the Ivy Court Condominiums west of the site to South Bend Avenue.

Depending on how negotiations go with the Ivy Court owners who opposed the five-story plan before the BZA Network Ventures might need to move the restaurant and bar to the fourth floor with steps leading up to the rooftop bar said Gormley who said he became familiar with Notre Dame as a Kalamazoo native.

“We want to set precedent for the city” he said. “We believe in the growth of South Bend we believe in the growth of Notre Dame. We understand where the city wants to go and we want to be a pioneer of that so to speak. We’re not trying to build some skyscraper over there but we want to push this thing if we can.”

Immediately north of that site Fort Washington Pa.-based Toll Brothers Apartment Living has big plans for Campus View apartments student housing that was built as Turtle Creek apartments in 1970. The Fortune 500 company plans to demolish the entire complex and replace it with new student apartments townhomes and a parking garage. It has received a favorable recommendation from city planners.

The council Monday (Oct. 11) was slated to give a public hearing and final vote on the proposal.

Davey the NAI Cressy broker said there are some other deals in the works to build multi-family and office uses along South Bend Avenue but he couldn’t yet comment on them because they are still pending.

“It’s an older corridor and with Notre Dame continuing to expand its geography and really its education base it was just kind of prime for redevelopment” Davey said. “There’s a lot of properties that are just underutilized. With interest rates being so low with the demographic of the student population being what it is they can afford to pay the kind of rents that new construction drives.”

Davey said this kind of redevelopment is happening in many college towns.

“If you’re from the area it’s always been a little sleepy in the sense that some of the things you see in other university towns haven’t yet materialized” Davey said. “The climate is really right. Nationally the economy is doing really well. We’re seeing kind of unprecedented land transactions not just South Bend Avenue.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZG4uY29tL2FsYXNrYS1uZXdzLzIwMjEvMTAvMTYvYWxhc2thLXdpbGwtYWxsb3ctYXR2cy1vbi1yb2Fkcy1zdGFydGluZy1qYW4tMS1idXQtc25vd21hY2hpbmVzLWFuZC1ob3ZlcmNyYWZ0LWFyZW50LWluY2x1ZGVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alaska will allow ATVs on roads starting Jan. 1 but snowmachines and hovercraft aren't included,"People travel on a four wheeler towards the village of St. Michael on the gravel road that connects Stebbins and St. Michael on the Norton Sound coast in Western Alaska on Thursday June 27 2019. (Bill Roth / ADN)

Beginning in 2022 Alaskans can drive four-wheelers and other “all-purpose vehicles” on public roads that have speed limits of 45 mph or less in places where local governments haven’t banned their use.

Snowmachines and hovercraft remain prohibited on state roads but on Thursday Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer signed regulations that remove restrictions on many other vehicles starting Jan. 1.

Local bans on the use of such vehicles within municipal or borough boundaries must still be followed. In the Municipality of Anchorage for example driving those vehicles on roadways will still be prohibited. Many other cities and boroughs lack similar rules and places like the Fairbanks North Star Borough and Matanuska-Susitna Borough lack policing and road authority which may make it impossible to create local bans.

Vehicles eligible under the new rules must follow certain guidelines:

• All-purpose vehicles must have a headlight a rear-facing red light a rear-facing red reflector and a rear-facing red brake light. The vehicle must have brakes a muffler carburetor and throttle.

• Drivers must have a valid driver’s license and insurance but don’t have to wear a helmet. Passengers need to wear helmets.

• If the vehicle has seatbelts they must be used and any vehicle with seatbelts must use a child seat when carrying a child young enough.

• The vehicle must be registered and have license plates.

Alaska’s rule change began with a push this spring by the administration of Gov. Mike Dunleavy. The Department of Administration — which operates the state’s DMVs — and the state Department of Public Safety proposed it together.

Soon after the rule change was proposed former Public Safety Commissioner Amanda Price said on social media that within her department it was assumed that the idea came from a close friend of the governor or a donor to his campaign. She said officials within the department cautioned the governor’s office against moving forward saying it could result in additional road deaths.

She reconfirmed those comments Saturday morning but said she doesn’t know what the agency discussed later. Price resigned in February before the proposal was launched.

The Department of Public Safety and Department of Administration told the Alaska Legislature in April that the goal was “to provide Alaskans the greatest opportunity to safely and affordably travel throughout the state.”

Snowmachines and four-wheelers are already used in rural Alaska as regular forms of transportation and numerous small towns and villages permit them on locally owned roads.

The spring proposal would have allowed snowmachines and hovercraft as well as wheeled vehicles on state-owned roads.

That garnered a mixed reaction as Alaskans submitted dozens of comments for and against the proposal. Opponents generally criticized the idea on safety grounds.

Alaska House Transportation Committee chairman Grier Hopkins D-Fairbanks was particularly skeptical. In an April hearing he hosted University of Alaska Fairbanks civil engineering professor Nathan Belz assistant director of the Center for Safety Equity in Transportation called the original proposal “potentially dangerous and ill-advised.”

Hopkins said Friday that his views haven’t changed. He believes municipalities should be able to opt into the changes not be forced to opt out by enacting rules.

“This is so dangerous” he said.

Proponents have said other states — including Arizona Utah Montana and Wyoming — already allow off-road vehicles under certain circumstances and Alaska should do the same.

“The vast majority will use this to enjoy Alaska in the respectful spirit of our culture” said Charles Preston of Chugiak."

Belson is the founder of numerous successful medical device companies such as Neoguide Systems (acquired by Intuitive Surgical in 2009) Vascular Pathways (acquired by CR Bard in 2014) Zipline Medical (acquired by Stryker in 2019) Qool Therapeutics Radiaction Medical and Emboline. He also serves as an independent board member at a number of prominent Israeli companies such as GI View and Ceretrieve.

GIBF is a Chinese medical investment fund established in 2016 in partnership with the Government of Guangzhou the capital of Southern China. The first fund which is valued at about $100 million has so far made 12 investments in Israeli medical device and digital health companies.

GIBF recently announced it was closing its second fund which was planned to amount to about $300 million and will focus on Western pharmaceutical companies that develop innovative drugs in phase 2-3 of clinical trials.

As part of the collaboration announced Sunday GIBF invested in two of Belson’s new companies: $4 million in Modular Surgical which develops innovative endoscopic tools including for robotic surgeries; and $3.5 million in Follisave which develops a novel solution for preventing hair-loss in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy especially women with breast cancer.

“My activity has focused so far mainly on the American market. However for many years I was looking for the right pathway to operate also in China which is the fastest growing medical device market worldwide” Belson said.

“When I met with GIBF people I realized this is the best model currently available for foreign medical device companies to remove concerns regarding their IP protection while building their own value in the huge Chinese market and not giving it away early in the process in favor of a local partner.”

Noy who will serve as a board member on behalf of GIBF in the two companies added: “We are proud of the collaboration with an entrepreneur on the scale of Dr. Belson that illustrates the power of our investment model. The Covid-19 pandemic not only did not stop us but actually highlighted the fact that our set-up is one of the only ones currently capable of executing cross-border transactions in China.”",,,,,,,,,

Sachem Head has a history of solid value investing but we believe that they really found their activist stride in 2020 with their investment in Olin. Scott Ferguson took a board seat at Olin – the first public company board seat he has taken in an investment that was not part of a group – and created tremendous value there where he remains on the board. His next activist 13D was at Elanco where he again took a board seat and is in the process of creating value there. Taking board seats signifies both commitment and contribution and this philosophy and style is really paying off for Sachem Head.

Sachem Head subtly signals in its 13D filing that it might be interested in a board seat. It states in the filing that Sachem Head has entered into an agreement with Bernardo Hees who has agreed to serve as an advisor to Sachem Head and as a potential director nominee. This makes sense as Sachem Head founder Scott Ferguson is already on two public company boards and Hees has extensive industry and operating experience.

But to truly understand Sachem Head's thesis here we have to go back to August 2015 when Trian filed a 13D on USFD competitor Sysco and Nelson Peltz took a board seat creating significant value for shareholders by improving operating margins and focusing more on Sysco's higher margin businesses. Three years later in 2018 Sachem Head took a 2% position in USFD stating in a letter to investors that USFD could benefit from many of the same steps Sysco took at the urging of Trian. Sachem Head further stated: ""With the help of an activist shareholder Sysco meaningfully expanded profitability by improving discipline around pricing and increasing focus on high-margin private label goods and lucrative smaller restaurant customers.... US Foods can implement many of the same initiatives while innovating in other areas such as technology and central replenishment."" In 2018 Sachem Head predicted that the company could generate $3 in earnings per share in 2020 with a stock price of $45. Cut to 2020 and both gross and operating margins are worse than 2018 earnings per share is $1.66 and the stock price is $36.08. So there is even more work to be done and more opportunity for value creation.

However while Scott Ferguson does have extensive activist experience he is already on two public company boards and does not have the operating experience of Trian's Nelson Peltz (few activists do). So he wisely partnered with Hees who has extensive operating experience. Hees is a former partner of 3G Capital and former CEO of Kraft Heinz and H.J. Heinz from 2013 to 2019. Interestingly Nelson Peltz was a director of H.J. Heinz and served on the special committee of the board that negotiated the acquisition of Heinz by 3G Capital in 2013. Two years later Peltz started an activist campaign at Sysco. Two years after Hees left Heinz he is starting one with Sachem Head at Sysco competitor USFD. The blueprint to this campaign has already been written and Sachem Head seems to have recruited the right players for shareholder value creation. The only question that remains is does the company see it that way?

(Here are some of the best iPhone 13 deals around.) AT&T came out of the gate essentially giving away the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Mini for a starting price that can go as low as ""free"" to new and existing customers. Verizon later effectively matched that offer while AT&T bumped its deal to also allow for a free iPhone 13 (and will also offer $1000 off the iPhone 13 Pro Max with qualifying trade-ins too).

T-Mobile is similarly offering all three devices for free to both new and existing customers.

In all cases there are plenty of caveats. It all depends on the phone model you're trading in the wireless plan you have and the financing.

AT&T/Screenshot by CNET

The iPhone 13 models are now available (already backordered in some cases). To help you avoid having to comb through the fine print we've outlined the key details on the three carriers' respective trade-in offers.

Note: These deals don't include taxes in their prices which are often based on the full price of the phone. Some carriers may also charge a one-time activation or upgrade fee (usually around $30) as well.

Sarah Tew/CNET AT&T iPhone 13 offer Potentially a free iPhone 13 Pro 13 or 13 Mini on unlimited plans The deal only applies to those with an unlimited plan and a 36-month installment plan.

You also must have an eligible trade-in that's in good working condition. The iPhone 11 and 12 lines (and XS Max) as well as recent phones like the Samsung Galaxy S20 S21 Note 20 Google Pixel 5 and LG Wing are among the phones that can get the full discount on the iPhone 13 Pro.

Others like the iPhone X XS and XR Galaxy S10 line Pixel 4 line and OnePlus 8 line are among the phones able to get the iPhone 13 Mini for free. You can check how much your device is worth at AT&T's trade-in site.

As with other carrier deals you won't get the full value upfront with AT&T instead dishing the discount as a monthly bill credit for the next three years to keep you on its network. If you switch carriers or cancel service early you'll be responsible for the remaining balance on the phone. See at AT&T

Verizon/Screenshot by CNET Verizon iPhone 13 offer Potentially a free iPhone 13 Pro 13 or 13 Mini with certain plans Current and new Verizon customers can get an iPhone 13 Pro (128GB only) with select trade-in -- damaged phones included -- on a ""qualified"" unlimited plan.

Eligible plans include Play More Do More and Get More as well as the older Above Unlimited and Beyond Unlimited. Note: The line you are upgrading will need to be on one of these plans.

If you move your phone number to Verizon from another provider you can get up to $500 to ""help you switch carriers.""

Similar to AT&T's promo the trade-in credit (up to $1000) is applied in monthly installments over 24-30 months. The promotion credits will end if you leave Verizon or change your plan.

The exact value will adjust based on the phone you are buying and trading in. For the full $1000 on an iPhone 13 Pro you need to trade in an iPhone 11 Pro/11 Pro Max or iPhone 12 Pro/12 Pro Max.

The list is a bit wider if you want $800 off (for a free iPhone 13) or $700 off (for iPhone 13 Mini). Eligible phones here include the iPhone SE (2nd gen) iPhone X 11 12 Mini or 12. A large number of Android phones are also in this class including most Galaxy S phones (S9 or later) Note (Note 10 or later) Google Pixel (Pixel 4 or later including the 4A line) OnePlus 7 (or later) and LG and (V50 or later Velvet 5G UW and Wing 5G UW).

If you don't have a phone to trade-in you could in theory buy an iPhone SE (2nd gen) or Samsung Galaxy A42 5G. Both phones retail for $400 and Verizon will give you a trade-in value of up to $800 so long as you are buying a new iPhone and meet all the other listed requirements mentioned above.

Verizon will take broken phones including ones with busted screens but they can't have any battery damage. All trade-in devices will also need to have Find My features turned off.

More details are outlined in the release here. See at Verizon

Sarah Tew/CNET T-Mobile iPhone 13 Magenta Max offer Potentially a free iPhone 13 Pro 13 or 13 Mini if you have T-Mobile's top plan. T-Mobile is offering new and existing users up to $1000 on the iPhone 13 Pro $800 on the iPhone 13 and $700 on the iPhone 13 Mini with an eligible trade-in but you will need to have its top Magenta Max unlimited plan and buy directly from them.

Older top plans from T-Mobile or Sprint are also eligible. For older T-Mobile plans this includes Magenta Plus or One Plus. For Sprint this includes Sprint Max Plus or Premium Unlimited.

Credits from the trade-in will be distributed over the course of 30 months. If you leave T-Mobile before then you will forfeit whatever is left and need to pay off the balance owed on the phone.

For the $1000 off you will need to purchase an iPhone 13 Pro or Pro Max and trade in an iPhone 11 Pro or 11 Pro Max or an iPhone 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max.

The list is a bit broader for the ""up to $800 off"" list. Eligible phones here include the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini iPhone 11 and iPhone X/XR/XS/XS Max. You can also trade in a variety of Android phones including the Galaxy S20 and S21 lines Note 10/Note 20 lines Motorola Razr 5G and OnePlus 8 5G and 8T 5G.

Older devices can get up to $400 off a new iPhone. Full details can be found by clicking on Terms and conditions for the deal on T-Mobile's website. It is also worth noting that T-Mobile has added a new Magenta Max iPhone upgrade program it calls Forever Upgrade that will guarantee you ""up to $800"" back (up to $700 for the Mini or less if you're buying an iPhone 12 today) in future trade-in credits. The catch here: You will need to wait two years to trade in the iPhone 13 or iPhone 12 that you're buying today to get the credits and you will need to be on Magenta Max for the entire time. Those with other T-Mobile plans can get up to $500 off but you will need to trade in an iPhone 11 Pro or 11 Pro Max or an iPhone 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max to get that discount. Those with older devices can get up to $400 offer with full details available by clicking on the ""On us with Magenta Max with trade"" link on T-Mobile's product pages. See at T-Mobile

The COVID-19 lockdowns pushed the college lecturer’s classes online. But her home on a dirt road minutes outside the village of Manchester 25 miles southeast of Ann Arbor remained stuck in an internet “dead zone” Deacons said.

At home a pricey cell service booster gave her one or two bars enough to text. After years chasing AT&T trucks to pester them about internet service the broadband technicians installed “works 50% of the time” chopping up Zoom calls into word salad she said.

So last year Deacons went to Panera Bread in Ann Arbor. They closed. She perched on benches and picnic tables outside libraries. And finally she ended up underneath the golden arches in Clinton just across the Washtenaw County line.

Twice a week for two hours Deacons slid the driver’s seat of her blue Ford Equinox back placed a laptop on the armrest and twisted to face her students aspiring teachers at Eastern Michigan University.

“I’m pretty easy going. I can roll with the punches but where it got really bad was last November” she said recalling how she would swaddle herself in blankets to keep from shivering through her courses.

Deacons wasn’t alone then and she isn’t now.

Spotty infrastructure leaves thousands without affordable high-speed internet access in Washtenaw County. They must adapt to a digitizing world accelerated by a global pandemic.

The Ann Arbor News/MLive spoke with five residents about the struggle to stay connected. Some are minutes from one of the top research universities in the country while others are in far-flung corners of the county marked by farmland and dirt roads.

Among them: A young family whose new home came with a nasty surprise. A retired online business owner who fears disconnections with doctors. And a condo resident who can’t afford the internet that’s available hindering access to food stamps and unemployment.

Their stories mirror those described in dozens of letters from residents urging officials to get serious about extending broadband across Washtenaw County a longtime goal boosted in recent years by federal and state grants.

Last month county leaders threw $15.5 million in federal COVID stimulus dollars at the problem supercharging an ambitious effort to fill a gap left by other funding sources and connect the remaining roughly 3300 homes extending speedy internet access countywide.

Deacons doesn’t expect rapid changes.

While she still takes meetings near the drive-thru line in the worst months of the pandemic Deacons found another option. A colleague took pity on her as temperatures dropped setting aside a room in their house as an office for the parking lot-bound instructor.

Many weren’t as fortunate. Here are just some of their stories.

‘It was shocking to us’

When Noah Coward walked through the house that he and his wife Alexandria a nurse were considering buying he spied an encouraging sign.

The previous owner had a work-from-home set-up the 30-year-old construction manager noticed.

Coward who then lived in Howell was on the hunt for a bigger property closer to where he and his wife worked a place to raise their infant son Jason with their two dogs. The house on five acres in a rural area just six miles north of the Ann Arbor city limits was it.

It even had an Ann Arbor address.

Noah Coward Alexandria Coward and their 10-month-old son pose outside their home in Northfield Township on Thursday Oct. 7 2021. The Coward family purchased the home in spring 2021 only to find the previous homeowners' T-Mobile cell service internet contract wouldn't carry over once they moved in. Now they're on a months-long waitlist for cell-based internet service and while there's a fiber optic cable that terminates less than a mile away from their home Noah Coward says the couple is considering selling their new home and moving if they can't find an internet solution within a year.Jacob Hamilton | The Ann Arbor News

He joked with the previous homeowner about how unfortunate it would be if the young couple couldn’t get internet there but didn’t think much of it. The home’s occupants clearly had a connection.

But when Coward went to enroll in the cellular-based service they had used offered by T-Mobile it wasn’t there for him. Five months later the Cowards are still stuck on a waiting list. They’ve been told it’s “indefinite” with a limited number of homes served at one time.

He talked to his neighbors who had an unlimited data plan with AT&T. That option is no longer offered Coward learned.

Fiber optic lines end three fourths of a mile up the pothole-marked dirt road (Coward knows the spot). Satellite internet would run the family $100 to $120 a month capping their data at 30 gigabytes. “That’s not really feasible” he said.

“It was shocking to us when we found out and to be quite frank with you we would not have purchased this property if we knew that” Coward said.

He attended a town hall meeting about broadband access and reached to his county commissioner Sue Shink who lives nearby. Ironically he said she was having connection issues when they spoke.

Coward sees the money Shink and the rest of the county board put toward broadband access as a “light at the end of tunnel” but working in construction he knows that the pandemic has strained supply chains.

Moving out and leaving behind the tree-lined property with a horse corral out front is still on the table if the infrastructure doesn’t materialize Coward said.

The lack of broadband availability might even affect his property values according to research showing a 3% gap in prices between homes that have a decent connection and those that don’t.

Coward doesn’t want his 10-month-old child to grow up without adequate access. He wants to lay down roots in Northfield Township. But the broadband situation is forcing him to have second thoughts.

“Young couples such as myself would have no desire to move to this area if they knew there were issues” he said.

When broadband is available but still out of reach

When Carolina Barillas introduced herself to a new neighbor the response was immediate. “Oh you’re the lady without the internet” he said to her.

Barillas who serves on her condominium’s volunteer board in the small village of Manchester had been branded that way by the transition to Zoom during the pandemic.

She was laughed at she said. “It’s like saying oh you don’t have electricity.”

Barillas lost her job as a nanny during the lockdown and was rationing gas. Even with work now as a home health care aide there’s no room in her strict budget for the bills from Comcast or AT&T she said.

She’s lived in Manchester since 2003 and luckily now stays a five-minute walk from the library housed in what was once a factory owned by Henry Ford that produced gauges for the dashboards of cars and tractors.

Banks of public computers are a lifeline for people like her. But the library shuttered for several months last year and the Wi-Fi was spotty outside. “I was just cut off” Barillas said.

Carolina Barillas poses at Manchester District Library in Manchester on Monday Oct. 11 2021. Barillas says she can't afford the inflated fee for broadband service in her Manchester Mich. home so she checks out a mobile hotspot from the library or takes advantage of their public computers and Wi-Fi connection which was more difficult to access when the library closed during the pandemic.Jacob Hamilton | The Ann Arbor News

That meant struggling to find a way to apply for unemployment and food stamps. She burned precious gas to submit a paper application in Ypsilanti and was denied she said. “It’s just roadblock after roadblock.”

According to a Washtenaw County report the trickle effects of living without reliable broadband are many from missing out on consumer savings to facing disadvantages in educational settings like the free college program Barillas applied to but wasn’t able to finish registering for.

Now Barillas is back in the library where she spends free time researching genealogy. She also checks out one of 10 hotspot devices the library has which are constantly in demand according to Library Director Kathleen Dimond.

“It’s always been really the bane of my existence trying to get something that’s relatively inexpensive” Barillas said.

County leaders have dedicated $800000 in federal COVID recovery dollars to people in her exact situation although it’s unclear exactly when that money will be available to the public.

Now the county is working to develop “a framework to responsibly spend” the sum to address internet access affordability and literacy issues Peter Lindeman the county board’s communications and operations manager said in a text message.

Lindeman points residents in need of emergency assistance to a COVID rent and utility assistance program.

Still in Manchester Barillas feels locked out by the companies offering her internet at prices she can’t afford.

“It should be like a regular utility” Barillas said “Their business model doesn’t help people of lower income.”

‘They think we’re living in the Dark Ages’

What does it mean to not have access to high-speed broadband? For many it’s repeated attempts to cajole for-profit internet providers to extend service while navigating a shifting array of options.

Megan Gore home-schooled her daughter virtually during the pandemic from their house in rural Manchester Township.

The family first used HughesNet a satellite internet service but it would go out when there were storms and the costs added up. Gore who teaches digital media and communications at EMU researched another service which didn’t quite cover their area.

“They said to us well you can pay to put up a tower at your house” she said. “We were thinking well wouldn’t you pay us to put up a tower so that you could continue on.”

Gore’s family now relies on three cell phones and hotspots with costs that can exceed $250 a month.

That’s a familiar story for Sally Wetzel.

Wetzel who is retired but runs a small art business online has lived in Sylvan Township four miles west of Chelsea for 25 years.

She went door-to-door to convince neighbors to pool resources to foot the bill for Comcast lines. “Some people have just sort of given up” she said. One neighbor who didn’t own a TV wasn’t interested.

In the end “none of us could afford it” she said.

Internet service providers are slow to expand their service into rural areas where return on the investment is low with fewer households served county officials have concluded. That’s spurred a push to find grants and other injections of money to get the work done led by the county’s Broadband Taskforce.

Still a solution for some 8000 homes and 20000 people targeted for connection could still be years away.

For a brief time last year Wetzel tried a T-Mobile cellular plan which was like “living in a whole new world” for two months until problems cropped up.

“When I called to say I’m having issues they’re like oh yeah we lost a cell tower” Wetzel said.

Access is worse at her house than on a far-flung island in the Upper Peninsula accessible only by boat and plane where her son has property with high-speed internet she said.

That means missing out on parts of daily life many take for granted.

Wetzel and her husband who has a pacemaker have been kicked off of telehealth calls with physicians. “It’s just a high-speed world and we’re not up to it.”

She has family near Chicago.

“They think we’re living in the Dark Ages” she said.

Spandragon vs Exynos: History repeats itself





Historically compared to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips Exynos processors have been:



Less powerful

Less power-efficient

More prone to overheating

Less capable when it comes to image processing

Worse in terms of battery life/endurance

Yes in case you didn’t know not all ARM processors are made equal. For example the image processing unit in Apple’s A15 Bionic is different to Huawei’s found in the Kirin 9000 and you guessed it - the same applies to Exynos and Snapdragon.



So to get to the point - Samsung basically sells “the same” smartphones under the names “Galaxy S21” “Galaxy S21+” and “Galaxy S21 Ultra” which are powered by completely different processors depending on where in the world you are. This wouldn’t be a “big deal” if this processor disparity didn’t affect everything from performance to battery life and photography - which is the focus of today's story.



While in past years things have been even worse this year’s Galaxy S21 phones powered by Exynos chips seem to be particularly underwhelming when it comes to video capture. Take a look at these samples courtesy of







As you can see although the Galaxy S21 Ultra you get all over the world is supposed to be the same phone it really isn’t. The Galaxy S21 Ultra with a Snapdragon processor renders video with noise but defined textures. It’s still very far from the leader in the class - iPhone 13 Pro but the videos it takes are usable.



When we move onto the Exynos Galaxy S21 Ultra things start to look very concerning for Samsung. Videos are soft cartoonish and just… bad - especially for a phone that costs so much money and wants to be the best camera phone of 2021.



Video on the Exynos-powered Galaxy S21 Ultra resembles GTA Vice City’s gameplay especially when it comes to rendering fine textures like grass. The bad picture quality is present on all lenses but it's particularly noticeable with the ultra-wide-angle camera and also with the primary shooter.

The Exynos is likely trying to overcompensate for its lack of ability to deal with low-light video by making everything smoother in an attempt to get rid of noise. Hence it ends up creating what looks like a painting. On the other hand the Spandragon-powered S21 Ultra takes natural-looking videos and lets the noisy parts of the image be noisy. This isn’t ideal by any means but it’s preferable in this case.



But guess what - none of the technicalities matter!

I mean... It’s a different phone folks! It’s a different phone... Here’s what’s going on: Samsung sells two versions of the Galaxy S21 series of phones which on top of differences in battery life and performance are worlds apart when it comes to taking videos especially in low-light! This is simply unacceptable and doesn’t sit well with a company of Samsung’s rank. We aren’t sure why and how Samsung is able to get away with this but it has been doing so forAnd in case you are in the US and feel good about yourself thinking the Snapdragon version of the Galaxy S21 is the better one I’ll have to disappoint you.

For the record: I don’t know about you but I am definitely not buying a Galaxy flagship here in Europe until Samsung takes care of what I'll call #Chipgate.

Now in this day and age the difference between smartphone cameras and smartphones in general is usually marginal and will depend on one’s taste. For example when taking photos the new iPhone 13 series favours heavy contrast while the Galaxy S21 likes to boost shadows and preserve highlights at any cost.On the video front it’s a totally different story. While Samsung technically offers more flexibility thanks to an additional 10x periscope zoom camera the iPhone 13 remains untouchable when it comes to dynamic range stabilization in dimly lit environments as well as overall picture quality. The last is especially true for low light where the iPhone 13 Pro dominates not only the Galaxy S21 Ultra  but any other flagship. You'd be able to see the two compete in our upcoming camera comparison!So the S21 Ultra is already pretty underwhelming compared to iPhone 13 Pro as far as video is concerned.

TROW,T Rowe Price,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vcGl0Y2hib29rLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzL2VsZWN0cmljLXZlaGljbGVzLXNwYWMtYm9vbS12ZW50dXJlLWNhcGl0YWwtZWxlY3RyaWZpY2F0aW9uLXN0YXJ0dXBz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As EV blank-check boom fades VCs double down on electrification startups,"When Nikola Motor made its stock market debut a little more than a year ago the battery-powered truck company signaled the start of a hype cycle that has reverberated from leading automakers down to the startups serving the coming electric vehicle economy.

More than a half-dozen rivals followed Nikola in signing similar blank-check deals. Big automakers like GM and VW have since forsworn internal combustion engines and sold their investors on an all-electric future. And venture capitalists this year have bet almost $18 billion on startups that support the EV transition—from batteries and charging to lithium mining and fleet financing.

In recent months much of the sheen has worn off alongside sinking share prices for EV makers that merged with SPACs. Nikola itself has seen its stock drop more than 70% since its merger deal was completed.



Meantime however venture-backed startups in the industry have been a hit in the private market. Global VC investment in electric vehicle startups has topped $17.8 billion this year blowing past last year’s total of $10.6 billion according to PitchBook data.

“The mobility SPAC boom shepherded a lot of private capital towards early-stage startups because venture investors now have a more clear line of sight to a successful exit than they did before” said Asad Hussain an emerging tech analyst at PitchBook.

Some of the largest funding rounds have gone to vehicle manufacturers like Rivan and China’s Weltmeister. But increasingly the spoils are shared by startups that aim to support electric vehicle adoption in other ways such as battery makers Svolt and Sila Nanotechnologies.

Despite significant advances in batteries their limited driving range remains a top concern for car buyers. That might explain investors’ bullishness on entrepreneurs seeking to cram more energy into batteries while reducing space costs and charge times.

In August China-based Svolt raised $1.6 billion from state-backed funds and investors like IDG Capital and China Renaissance. And earlier in the year California-based Sila raised $590 million in fresh cash.

Another approach that continues to attract funding is battery swapping which can be attractive for fleet operators that want to avoid long charging times. Startups Ample and Aulton recently raised mega-rounds to target the taxi and ridehailing industry in China and the US.

As electric vehicles become more commonplace they are likely to become platforms akin to the Apple app store that will support a marketplace for new services said Vitaly Golomb a partner at Drake Star who has advised on mobility tech deals.

“As soon as [EVs get] to a certain critical mass of customers you’re going to get these third parties that will start showing interest to get into the market” Golomb said.

The challenge is that EVs have yet to reach the scale needed to make that vision a reality. Battery-powered cars accounted for just 4.6% of global auto sales in 2020 according to the International Energy Agency.

Still many startups are building capacity to meet the industry’s future large-scale needs.

A looming challenge is to address what happens when batteries reach the end of their useful life and investors are already picking winners. Redwood Materials has emerged as an apparent leader in the US raising $700 million this year led by T. Rowe Price to build its battery recycling operations. Because the average life cycle of batteries is predictable companies like Redwood can easily gauge future recycling demand based on current EV sales.

Major automakers have announced a spate of partnerships and pilot projects with startups to recapture EV batteries which are expected to see shortages within the decade according to the Center for Automotive Research. By reclaiming critical metals from spent batteries companies hope to offset this shortage and reduce dependence on foreign supply chains.

This supply chain challenge has also spurred VC interest in tomorrow’s lithium mining technology.

Lilac Solutions recently raised $130 million from investors including BMW I Ventures and SK Materials. Its mission: to extract lithium from saltwater deposits without using evaporation ponds and reduce the environmental impact of the process which has contributed to water shortages and contamination.

Fintech companies have also spotted an opportunity in EVs by providing leasing options with little upfront investment. British startup Onto raised $175 million in equity and debt to build a leasing platform for consumers. In the US Highland Electric raised $235 million to finance and manage all-electric fleets of school buses.

While unproven EV makers have seen their stock prices sink from the sky-high levels seen at the start of 2021 there’s still juice in the tank for the most promising candidates.

Polestar which spun out of Volvo in 2017 was valued in September at $20 billion in a deal with a SPAC backed by the Gores Group and Guggenheim Partners. And Rivian is reportedly seeking a valuation of around $80 billion in its imminent IPO.

Time will tell who the winners and losers are in the EV race but for now the industry’s continued growth is pulling more investors into the electricity ecosystem’s burgeoning market.",,,,,,,,,,,,

These rumors and leaks can give rise to various theories that raise the hopes of fans. One such theory was recently discovered that reveals GTA 6 Release Easter Eggs in Red Dead Redemption 2. This theory claims to offer details on when Rockstar Games will reveal more information about GTA 6.

Rockstar Games puts Easter eggs for GTA 6 in RDR2

Rockstar has been very quiet regarding any details about GTA 6 currently focussing on the porting and development of GTA V for next-gen consoles. Rockstar loves teasing fans about their upcoming projects through Easter eggs and it seems like they have done the same for GTA 6 as well.

The Easter egg is a letter that is supposed to be pointing at Rockstar’s relationship with Take-Two Interactive. The letter is written by Rockstar’s founder Dan Houser to his brother Sam Houser. Dan had an active role in creating the narratives for both GTA and Red Dead Redemption games before parting ways with Rockstar after Red Dead Redemption 2.

The letter in RDR2’s meta mentions “heading east” which might be Dan telling Sam to not rush with the development of GTA 6 because of the current ongoing success of GTA 5. The letter mentions a date 24 November. While it is hard to figure out what the date exactly means several other rumors also claim a possible GTA 6 reveal in November.

So if the theory comes true people might see a GTA 6 reveal from Rockstar next month. This theory has been making the rounds in the community of Grand Theft Auto since August and many think the reveal is indeed coming next month. And there is a good chance the community is right judging from how Rockstar previously teased GTA V in the first Red Dead Redemption game.

On the other hand Rockstar has just revealed the release of their remastered versions of GTA III Vice City and San Andreas as a Definitive Edition marking the 20th anniversary of the series. The series will feature high-resolution graphics and offer loads of nostalgic moments from the earlier GTA titles.

China tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile in August that circled the globe before speeding towards its target demonstrating an advanced space capability that caught US intelligence by surprise.

Five people familiar with the test said the Chinese military launched a rocket that carried a hypersonic glide vehicle which flew through low-orbit space before cruising down towards its target.

The missile missed its target by about two-dozen miles according to three people briefed on the intelligence. But two said the test showed that China had made astounding progress on hypersonic weapons and was far more advanced than US officials realised.

The test has raised new questions about why the US often underestimated China’s military modernisation.

“We have no idea how they did this” said a fourth person.

The US Russia and China are all developing hypersonic weapons including glide vehicles that are launched into space on a rocket but orbit the earth under their own momentum. They fly at five times the speed of sound slower than a ballistic missile. But they do not follow the fixed parabolic trajectory of a ballistic missile and are manoeuvrable making them harder to track.

Taylor Fravel an expert on Chinese nuclear weapons policy who was unaware of the test said a hypersonic glide vehicle armed with a nuclear warhead could help China “negate” US missile defence systems which are designed to destroy incoming ballistic missiles.

“Hypersonic glide vehicles . . . fly at lower trajectories and can manoeuvre in flight which makes them hard to track and destroy” said Fravel a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Fravel added that it would be “destabilising” if China fully developed and deployed such a weapon but he cautioned that a test did not necessarily mean that Beijing would deploy the capability.

Mounting concern about China’s nuclear capabilities comes as Beijing continues to build up its conventional military forces and engages in increasingly assertive military activity near Taiwan.

Tensions between the US and China have risen as the Biden administration has taken a tough tack on Beijing which has accused Washington of being overly hostile.

Michael Gallagher a Republican member of the House armed services committee said the test should “serve as a call to action”.

“The People’s Liberation Army now has an increasingly credible capability to undermine our missile defences and threaten the American homeland with both conventional and nuclear strikes” said Gallagher. “Even more disturbing is the fact that American technology has contributed to the PLA’s hypersonic missile programme.”

US military officials in recent months have warned about China’s growing nuclear capabilities particularly after the release of satellite imagery that showed it was building more than 200 intercontinental missile silos. China is not bound by any arms-control deals and has been unwilling to engage the US in talks about its nuclear arsenal and policy.

Last month Frank Kendall US air force secretary hinted that Beijing was developing a new weapon. He said China had made huge advances including the “potential for global strikes . . . from space”. He declined to provide details but suggested that Beijing was developing something akin to the “Fractional Orbital Bombardment System” that the USSR deployed for part of the Cold War before abandoning it.

“If you use that kind of an approach you don’t have to use a traditional ICBM trajectory. It’s a way to avoid defences and missile warning systems” said Kendall.

In August General Glen VanHerck head of North American Aerospace Defense Command told a conference that China had “recently demonstrated very advanced hypersonic glide vehicle capabilities”. He warned that the Chinese capability would “provide significant challenges to my Norad capability to provide threat warning and attack assessment”.

Two of the people familiar with the Chinese test said the weapon could in theory fly over the South Pole. That would pose a big challenge for the US military because its missiles defence systems are focused on the northern polar route.

Hu Xijin editor of Global Times an ultranationalist Chinese state-run media outlet tweeted that Beijing would improve its nuclear deterrence to “ensure that the US abandons the idea of nuclear blackmail against China”.

The revelation comes as the Biden administration undertakes the Nuclear Posture Review an analysis of policy and capabilities mandated by Congress that has pitted arms-control advocates against those who believe the US must do more to modernise its nuclear arsenal because of China.

The Pentagon did not comment on the report but expressed concern about China. “We have made clear our concerns about the military capabilities China continues to pursue capabilities that only increase tensions in the region and beyond” said John Kirby spokesperson. “That is one reason why we hold China as our number-one pacing challenge.”

The Chinese foreign ministry denied that China had tested a hypersonic missile. “This was a routine test of a space vehicle to verify technology of spacecraft’s reusability” said Zhao Lijian a spokesperson without explaining why China did not announce the test at the time.

One Asian national security official said the Chinese military conducted the test in August. China generally announces the launch of Long March rockets — the type used to launch the hypersonic glide vehicle into orbit — but it conspicuously concealed the August launch.

The security official and another Chinese security expert close to the People’s Liberation Army said the weapon was being developed by the China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics. CAAA is a research institute under China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation the main state-owned company that makes missile systems and rockets for the country’s space programme. Both sources said the hypersonic glide vehicle was launched on a Long March rocket which is used for the space programme.

The China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology which oversees launches on July 19 said on an official social media account that it had launched a Long March 2C rocket which it added was the 77th launch of that rocket. On August 24 it announced that it had conducted a 79th flight. But there was no announcement of a 78th launch which sparked speculation among observers of its space programme about a secret launch. CAAA did not respond to requests for comment.

Subsequent to publication of this story the Financial Times learned that Beijing had conducted two hypersonic weapon tests with the first occurring on July 27. The FT later published an account of both tests here

Now an impending lithium mining project by Rio Tinto is threatening to upend the lives of these villagers and deprive them of their land. With the government effectively in the pocket of the investors environmental activists remain the villagers' only ray of hope.

'It is unacceptable for us to sell this soil for mining purposes' is the common chant by villagers nowadays.

'We will do everything according to the law and abide by ecological standards' respond the investors.

'We will call for a referendum if necessary' chime in the authorities.

""Finally the environment has become the top issue in the country!"" exclaim local activists.

Discovering lithium in Serbia

In 2004 during geological explorations in Serbia the Anglo-Australian multinational metal and mining corporation Rio Tinto discovered the mineral jadarite named after the nearby Jadar tributary of the Drina river which runs by the town of Loznica. The mineral contained lithium - the essential component in batteries.

With an estimated 200 million tonnes of ore it is now believed that the area around the Loznica is one of the most abundant deposits of lithium in the world.

Due to the expansion of the electric cars industry it is projected that the global demand for lithium will grow fourfold in less than ten years. Rio Tinto therefore is in a hurry to start the mining. The area's residents however do not seem excited about the idea.

ACTIVISTS Raise their demands

“If we notice any [machinery] moving towards the field we will organise ourselves immediately [...] and we will defend our nature with our bodies just as we did with the water last year"" Aleksandar Jovanović Ćuta an environmental activist told FairPlanet. ""It will be a general mobilisation with thousands of people there. That is our plan for the future: we wait for them at the barricades.""

The studies on the project's feasibility and environmental impact are due by the end of the year. Relying on the results of these assessments the government has repeated that there is no need for civil resistance to the mining before these two primary documents are on the table.

However activists worry that the studies won’t be conducted independently as they are funded by the project's investor and are therefore likely to be written in the latter's favour. Such is the praxis not only in Serbia but in the neighbouring countries too activists highlight.

In April a massive protest in the capital Belgrade took place against the deforestation construction of hydropower plants and air and water pollution caused by various industries. At that time demonstrators have demanded that the government expose all classified documents related to contracts and agreements with Rio Tinto.

Protesters then claimed that the government did nothing about their requirements so they organised additional demonstrations in September and temporarily blocked traffic in the capital. This time protesters focused specifically on Rio Tinto demanding that the government annul all its obligations to the investor.

“This is an environmental uprising"" Jovanović said. ""We gave a clear message: Rio Tinto go away. People have united regardless of their political agenda. Finally the environment became the top issue in this country.""

relocating villagers IS THE RED LINE

The valley of the river Jadar is one of the most populated rural areas in Serbia with some 18000 people leading a stable life off of agriculture. Unlike most villages in the rest of the country which face a demographic collapse the Jadar river valley is home to towns such as Gornje Nedeljice which has about a thousand inhabitants plenty of families with three children and a school with 200 pupils; the towns farmer also produce roughly one million liters of milk annually.

“This is about survival. If our government agrees to relocate people from their homes to please investors then no one else will protect us but ourselves"" Jovanović said. ""For our air food water and soil we are the last line of defense.""

""There are a lot of examples from abroad of how Rio Tinto makes a catastrophic landscape and violates human rights where it operates"" he added. ""The most recent case is the demolition of the Aboriginal sacred site which had evidence of 46000 years of continuous human occupation and was considered the only inland prehistoric site in Australia.""

In May the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) organised a scientific gathering titled Jadar Project: What is known? where a group of academicians warned the government that the jadarite mine could cause irreversible damage to an area as big as 516 football stadiums.

Rio Tinto later accused SANU of spreading panic. The government emphasised that the project is a 450 million dollar investment which would employ more than 2000 people in its initial stages and span across more than 50 years of exploitation.

Furthermore in an attempt to discredit the project's opponents and create a false image that they are all on the same side the government chose not to mention activists such as Jovanović.

Stefan Slavković a journalist at the Serbian weekly NIN wrote in his op-ed for the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network that “environmental activism has significant if not the most significant potential to seriously challenge the authoritarian and environmentally-harmful neoliberal policies of Serbia’s ruling Serbian Progressive Party’s SNS.""

When China banned the import of used plastics in late 2017 the move threw recycling programs worldwide into turmoil. China was the world’s top importer of plastic waste. Cities worldwide had fallen into the habit of simply shipping to China the plastic they collected from residents instead of reckoning with the waste themselves.

But many environmentalists saw a positive side to China’s import ban. Shipping plastics out of sight and out of mind was unsustainable they claimed. China’s plastics recycling industry was haphazard and probably did more damage than good to the planet. The environmentalists predicted that the Chinese ban though hard to swallow at the time would lead to more investment in recycling plants worldwide.

This optimistic take seems to be playing out and Japan is leading the charge. Japan has long been a leader in recycling technologies but Japanese companies found it nearly impossible to deploy their processes in ways that made commercial sense. Shipping waste to China was much cheaper. Now China’s ban and a Japanese recycling law passed in June are combining to spur expansion of Japanese plastics recycling capacity—particularly the chemical recycling techniques advocated by the chemical industry.

According to Japan’s Plastic Waste Management Institute the country has long boasted a plastics recycling rate of 85%. But that number is misleading because it represents merely the share of plastic waste that is collected and sorted in Japan. Until 2017 a lot of it was shipped to China. And since China’s ban a lot of it has been burned.

“Immediately after the ban waste plastics accumulated in Japan and had nowhere to go” says Toshiaki Yoshioka a professor at Tohoku University’s Graduate School of Environmental Studies who specializes in the chemical recycling of plastics. Japan he says has no choice but to invest in local processing capacity for used plastics a move that “has strengthened the trend that the waste must be properly recycled within Japan.”

The Act on Promotion of Resource Circulation for Plastics a law enacted in June is also poised to reshape Japanese plastics recycling—and Japan’s plastics industry overall.

The law encourages manufacturers to design products for ease of recycling. In addition it requires major retailers and hotel chains to offer plastic products that are 60% derived from recycled or biodegradable materials by 2030. Also by April convenience stores and hotels will have to start charging for plastic items including disposable cutlery and hotel toothbrushes. In response retailers and hotels are mapping out plans to recycle plastic packaging or replace it with biodegradable materials such as paper.

Producers of packaging material are already feeling the changes. The beverage company Kirin Holdings famous for its namesake beer is a major producer of plastic containers both for its own products and for sale to other firms. Kirin has set a target to use at least 50% recycled plastics in its products by 2027 and it is planning to build new manufacturing facilities to achieve that goal.

Through a venture with Mitsubishi Chemical announced in December Kirin will research and develop a commercially viable process for the large-scale depolymerization of polyester bottles into monomers that can be turned into polymers again. Kirin would use the resulting product to help meet its recycling target.

The project is one of many recycling initiatives for Mitsubishi which sees a business opportunity in the field. Today the plastics that are recycled in Japan are typically processed by mechanical methods. But these methods have drawbacks. For example they deteriorate the plastics’ physical properties and aren’t well suited for materials destined for food contact. Mitsubishi and other chemical makers argue that chemical recycling methods like depolymerization are necessary to increase recycling rates in Japan.

Another area of investment for Mitsubishi is polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) an acrylic plastic sold under names such as Plexiglas and Lucite. Mitsubishi owns Lucite International a maker of PMMA and is the world’s top producer of PMMA’s monomer methyl methacrylate. Global demand for PMMA amounts to 3.7 million metric tons (t) annually according to Mitsubishi.

In May Mitsubishi teamed with Osaka Japan–based Microwave Chemical to develop a new microwave-based technology for PMMA depolymerization. The partners plan to set up a commercial plant that will start operating in 2024 producing methyl methacrylate of the same quality as virgin monomer which Mitsubishi will use to make new PMMA.

The two firms started to test the process in July by depolymerizing waste resin at Microwave Chemical’s Osaka factory. “We’ll first start on a small scale” says Kenichiro Mawatari general manager of Mitsubishi’s circular economy promotion division. The two companies plan to collaborate with Honda Motor in the future to recover waste acrylic from the taillight covers of cars headed to the scrapyard. “We set our sights on recovering waste extensively in the future” Mawatari says.

Microwave Chemical isn’t Mitsubishi’s only partner for PMMA recycling. A year ago Mitsubishi announced that it was working with US-based Agilyx to develop new chemical recycling processes for acrylics. Initial tests of Agilyx’s method at its Oregon pyrolysis facility exceeded expectations Mitsubishi said last year. The two partners aim to have a commercial process ready by 2023. “We are planning to build and operate PMMA recycling plants in Japan and Europe around 2024” Mawatari says.

Recycling a clean sorted plastic like PMMA is one thing; finding value in mixed plastic waste is more difficult. To address that challenge Mitsubishi concluded a license agreement in June with the UK firm Mura Technology. Mitsubishi is the first international licensee for Mura’s HydroPRS process which uses supercritical water at high temperature and pressure to turn waste plastics into an oil that can be used as fuel or as a feedstock for new chemicals.

Mitsubishi will implement Mura’s process at a plant to be built with the Japanese oil producer Eneos at Mitsubishi’s site in Ibaraki Japan. The facility is scheduled to open in 2023 with 20000 t per year of capacity. Almost at the same time Idemitsu Kosan another oil producer will start up a 15000 t per year plant in Chiba Japan that will implement a catalytic plastics recycling process from the Japanese firm Environment Energy.

Although Mitsubishi and Idemitsu are turning to new processes for their plastics recycling facilities technology has not been the main hurdle in Japan when trying to turn waste into raw material. Rather the primary challenge has been the availability of waste material at a commercially viable cost. Two decades ago Japanese firms built several plants to convert waste plastics into oil but they have since closed because the feedstock was too expensive.

Japan’s new environmental law and the loss of China as a cheap way to dispose of waste plastics are making the feedstock issue less challenging. Before the 2017 ban Japan exported 800000 t of waste plastics to China annually according to Japan’s Ministry of Finance. The US shipped a similar amount while Europe shipped about 2 million t according to the polystyrene producer PS Japan.

“It is important to establish a cost-effective collecting system for waste plastics” Tohoku University’s Yoshioka says. Luckily Japan is a world leader in training its citizens to sort and dispose of their trash. In Tokyo for example combustible waste is gathered only on Mondays and Thursdays. Paper glass containers and aluminum cans are picked up every other Tuesday. Trash collectors pick up polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles only on certain days. Meanwhile supermarkets have been given the job of collecting from customers the plastic trays used to package fresh food like meat and fish.

Successful collection paves the way to successful recycling Yoshioka says. “If each local administration works out a program for collecting a sizable amount of plastic resources with certain quality it will raise chemical recycling rates by leaps and bounds” he says.

Japan’s Plastic Packaging Recycling Council which represents manufacturers of confectionery beverages and cosmetics says Japan can do more. “Japan lags behind Europe in sorting of plastic waste” says Naoki Kubo the council’s senior managing director. He adds that he saw some very advanced plastic-sorting facilities on a tour of Europe. “If the administration and privately owned corporations jointly establish a system to mechanically sort synthetic resins by their types it will accelerate social implementation of recycling.”

In those days exports of used plastics to China had higher economic efficiency than recycling them in Japan. Kenji Omi general manager of the sustainability planning division PS Japan

One reason for the viability of Mitsubishi’s recycling venture with Eneos is the participation of Refinverse a recycling business that Mitsubishi invested in last year. Refinverse will be responsible for supplying feedstock to the Ibaraki facility.

Executives at Teijin a Japanese plastics and chemical producer understand well both the convenience that Japan enjoyed in having China as an outlet and the promise of a recycling rebirth in Japan. Ten years ago the company built a plant in China with a local partner to depolymerize used polyester clothes sent from Japan and turn them into virgin polyester. But the venture folded after China instituted its ban on importing other countries’ waste.

Teijin now wants to replicate the recycling concept at its home base. Working with the Japanese partners Itochu and JGC Holdings the firm seeks to license the depolymerization technology in Japan and elsewhere to process either used PET bottles or discarded polyester clothing. “Chemical recycling is positioned to curtail CO 2 emissions in the whole supply chain” says Akimoto Uchikawa an executive officer and board member at Teijin.

An advantage of the Teijin project is its reliance on proven technology. Several firms have sought to license it Uchikawa says.

When it comes to the public’s awareness of plastic waste polystyrene probably tops the list. In years past public pressure forced fast-food makers around the world to abandon polystyrene foam clamshells and use paper or aluminum wrappers instead. Seeking to fend off more loss of business several Japanese companies are expanding their efforts to develop commercial methods of recycling polystyrene waste.

PS Japan for instance is building a 1000 t per year demonstration plant in Mizushima Japan that will turn polystyrene food trays and containers back into styrene. The plant cobuilt with Toshiba Plant Systems & Services is scheduled to open in December 2022. PS Japan Japan’s largest polystyrene producer is owned by Asahi Kasei and Idemitsu Kosan. If the Mizushima plant works as expected PS Japan plans to start up a larger facility in 2025.

Toshiba Plant Systems & Services has been working on polystyrene recycling for many years. With a subsidy from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization Toshiba built its first polystyrene recycling plant in 2001. The small facility produced styrene that was 99.7% pure meeting quality standards set by Japan Industrial Standards and ASTM International. It also successfully processed 60% of the polystyrene waste fed into it.

But the plant closed in 2005 because at the time it made more economic sense to ship polystyrene waste to China. “In those days exports of used plastics to China had higher economic efficiency than recycling them in Japan” says Kenji Omi general manager of PS Japan’s sustainability planning division. “We couldn’t collect a sufficient amount of used styrene products” Omi says.

Now the company is revisiting polystyrene recycling. Takenori Kondo the firm’s managing director says PS Japan is exploring opening a recycling facility in 2024.

China’s abrupt end to waste plastic imports is brightening prospects for firms like PS Japan that couldn’t obtain enough material until recently. Japan is not alone in feeling the effect of China’s ban on waste plastic imports. But that ban and the extra pressure of the country’s strict new recycling law is leading to a rapid buildup of the country’s recycling infrastructure.

“We should soon be able to raise the scale of chemical recycling to 2.5–3 million t per year” Tohoku University’s Yoshioka says. Rather than exporting its plastic waste to China Japan could someday be importing it from other countries.",,,,,,

With oil prices at seven-year highs and investors worried about supply chain problems and inflation Wall Street is on the hunt for companies that will avoid the worst of the pain of rising costs — or turn it to their advantage.

One way to do that is through pricing power which is shorthand for a company's ability to raise prices to cancel out rising costs and maintain the profits and margins that investors want to see.

Or follow us on Google News

We’ve had our Tesla Model 3 SR+ for a bit more than 2 years now. I recently had a service visit for a couple of things but rather than write only about them I figured it would be useful for people to see our full service history with the car. I’m going to go backward from most recent to least recent since the recent stuff is more interesting. Here we go….

Opening Trunk

A few months ago I went to open the trunk and it wouldn’t open. After a day of not getting it to open and needing to get some tennis equipment out of it for my daughters I realized I might be able to go through the back seat and open it from the inside. Indeed that worked since there’s a manual latch in the trunk door. The trunk then worked so I figured it was just a temporary glitch.

At around the same time the backup camera didn’t work a few times. But then it came back and worked like normal.

We were going to Europe for a month and a half to spend time with my wife’s family so I didn’t want to mess with service appointments at the time and everything seemed to be back to normal.

After we returned though within a couple of days the trunk wouldn’t open again. And the camera acted up a few times just like before. I opened the trunk manually several times but it wouldn’t start working correctly again so I knew it needed service. I scheduled a mobile service visit and a few days later the ranger came and checked it out. He hadn’t seen this problem before but talked to a colleague who had seen it a few times in Texas. Here’s what it turned out the issue was:

There’s a wiring harness in the trunk door that carries wires from various things back there to the front (including from the cameras and trunk latch). If a wire or two gets damaged things stop working. In such a case the whole harness has to be replaced. Here’s a short video of me just showing that the trunk won’t open trying from either the touchscreen or the trunk itself:

This is not a mobile service task and Tesla had to order a part before providing the service. Eventually though 3 weeks after I put in the initial service request I had an appointment at the local Tesla service center and brought the car in for the harness to be replaced. It was all done under warranty so at no cost to me aside from the time.

Replacing Tires

When the mobile service technician visited to look at the trunk and also at a previous service visit when he came to replace the 12V battery (see below) he checked the tire treads and some other things and told me the tread level was low and should be replaced soon. Not wanting to bother with taking the car to a separate place for tires and trusting that Tesla would give me a good deal since Tesla’s aim is to not make a profit on service and to treat customers well I decided to just go with Tesla’s recommendations and not stress. I have since been told by another Tesla owner to just buy tires through Tire Kingdom and that I paid way too much. Next time I will shop around a bit more and have more faith in local tire shops….

In any case after two years and fewer than 17000 miles I replaced all four tires at a cost of almost $1700 ($1671.64 to be exact). Yikes. More than I expected.

It seems I’m on the worse end of tire wear and tear. I was told that the normal range is between 15000 and 25000 miles. I hardly ever drive on the Interstate and I drive quite calmly (see my Safety Score below) so I was surprised to be on the low end of this window. Though I have been known to enjoy a good blast-off at almost every chance (red light) that I get. I’ll also admit that I’m almost 40 but do still often feel like a kid (when I’m not thinking about my bum knee or growing belly). Perhaps I am having too much fun. I have committed to trying to be a bit more calm at traffic lights. Sort of.

12V Battery Replacement

As I reported a few months ago I had to have my 12V battery replaced just after 15000 miles and nearly two years of ownership. The cost was $0 since it’s included under warranty but once you’re out of warranty you may want to keep the cost of a 12V battery in your long-term Tesla Model 3 maintenance budget. You can read more about all of that here.

Tire Rotation

After a few months more than one year of ownership and 8 months before replacing the tires I had the tires rotated by Tesla. That came at a cost of $35.00.

Cabin Air Filter Replacements

At the same time as the above-mentioned tire rotation I had the cabin air filter replaced. The specific description from Tesla on the invoice is “A/C Odor Removal (Using Evaporator Foam Cleaner Replace Cabin Filters).” The cost was $50.50 for parts and $39.75 for labor so $90.25 in total.

That was the second time I had the cabin air filter replaced. The first time was a year before and just a few months after buying the car. We bought the car right around the time Tesla implemented a software update to better lengthen the life of the air filter since in humid climates (like Florida) it was getting stinky too quickly. As a result of all of that Tesla replace the filter as a complimentary service (no charge).

Tesla Model 3 Maintenance Summary

So in summary (and going from oldest to newest this time) in two years of ownership and 17000 miles (actually two years two months and 18728 miles as I write this) I’ve had the air filter replaced twice ($0 goodwill service the first time $90.25 the second) the tires rotated once ($35) the 12V battery replaced once ($0 under warranty) and all 4 tires replaced once ($1671.64). That comes to a total cost of $1796.89 for just over two years of Tesla Model 3 maintenance — which compares pretty favorably to other premium brands.

During the various service visits above I also had them check out a few things that ended up being nothing or unidentifiable matters that went away (truly little things). Additionally they refilled my windshield wiper fluid during service center visits and I’m yet to buy any myself.

I also spent $0 charging for almost two years of ownership but a few months ago moved into a home with a garage and have spent some amount of money (I haven’t kept track) charging at home.

The focus of this article was Tesla Model 3 maintenance service visits and total cost of ownership. For more of a “long-term review” see the full archives for that and see this article in particular: “16 Months With Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus (Video Summary).”

But that certainly doesn't mean all parts are made here. Click to expand...

There are several outfits that try to quantify the amount of US-made content in cars. The last time I checked this (2+ years ago) the Tesla Model 3 was high on most such indexes but not at the very top. I just checked again and the Model 3 is now #1 on at least one such list the Cars.com American-made index. That list puts the Ford Mustang (the gas-powered version) at #2 and the Model Y at #3. Another similar list the Kogod index has a slightly different ranking. According to them the Mustang is #1 the Corvette Sting-Ray is #2 and the Model 3 is #3. (The Model S and Model Y tie for #5 on this index.) The Kogod index specifies that the Model 3 has only 65% USA/Canada content. I haven't dug deep enough to know what their criteria are. Both these lists are for MY 2021 vehicles.My own 2019 Model 3's window sticker specifies 50% USA/Canada content and 25% Mexican content. I seem to recall reading somewhere that Chinese content was next on the list for the 2019 Model 3 but I don't see that on the window sticker so either I read it elsewhere or I'm not remembering correctly. My guess -- and it's only a guess -- is that a lot of the chips and other electronics come from China since that's one area where Chinese manufacturing is very strong.I've seen some reporting that Tesla is considering using Chinese-made batteries in SR+ Model 3s -- even those made in the USA. If this happens then that will change the made-in-China percentage for these vehicles in a big way.

But the most important thing to know before buying an EV: the state of its battery.

""The main problem is not knowing battery health"" said Recurrent CEO Scott Case. The company provides battery reports kind of like a Carfax for electric vehicles.

Used car sales hit record highs this year propelling the average cost of a used car to over $25000. That's almost 30 percent higher than the 2020 average.

Looking at zero-emission options used car platform Vroom found the most popular makes and models based on its buying data. The Nissan Leaf BMW i3 and Tesla Model S are at the top of the list. Here's the top 10 with the average selling price:

Nissan Leaf ($13541) BMW i3 ($21000) Tesla Model S ($48000) Chevrolet Bolt EV ($22500) Tesla Model 3 ($42000) Fiat 500e ($9200) Volkswagen e-Golf ($15000) Tesla Model X ($71000) Chevrolet Spark EV ($10100) Kia Soul EV ($14000)

This list also shows how young the used EV market is. The Leaf first came out in 2010 with under 75 miles of range. The BMW i3 the company's first EV came out in 2013. Tesla released its first car in 2008.

But it can feel like ""you have to have a Ph.D. in statistics"" to understand if you're getting a good deal or buying a car about to plummet in range Case said.

Here are some tips so you won't regret buying a used electric vehicle.

1. Do a battery and range check

When buying a gas-powered used car you probably first check the odometer. But when it comes to EVs the battery is most important. And a battery's health isn't always reflected in the number of miles driven. An EV with high range could have been overcharged or kept in a cold climate. So even a car with a low odometer reading could have dismal range.

Recurrent the battery analysis tool helps uncover the mysteries hidden within the power train. The company provides free reports for the following cars as of mid October:

Tesla Model 3

Tesla Model Y

Tesla Model S

Tesla Model X

BMW i3

VW e-Golf

Nissan LEAF

Head to the ""Shoppers"" tab on the Recurrent website. Once you've set up a free account you can plug in the VIN or license plate info of the car you're looking into buying.

The website will ask you to use your phone to take photos of the dashboard while the car is in eco-mode with all the heaters and AC options off. You'll send in photos of the battery percent listed range estimate and odometer reading from the dash. Then Recurrent puts together and sends you a report.

2. Consider where you'll be driving

Weather and climate can affect your battery performance. If your car is going to be in a super cold or hot place that's going to shorten its battery life.

If you need a certain amount of range and you live in Minnesota you need to make sure the EV's range won't drop too low when the mercury drops.

3. Think ahead

With Recurrent's tool you get a projection of how your battery will fare for the next three years. If it looks like the range will drop too low for your commute it's probably not a good fit.

If you're considering an older EV for the immediate savings think about what it'll be like to constantly charge when the range plummets in the coming years.

If you're inheriting an old battery you'll likely need a new one when the car hits the 10-year mark. It'll cost at least $10000 for the battery itself but you'll need to pay for service and labor. You can set up a battery replacement through the manufacturer (like Tesla or Nissan) or work with a repair shop that does battery swaps. Ideally to make things easier the service center would also be able to sell you a new battery.

4. Consider resale value

Look through buying guides.

Recurrent compiles data from almost 6000 EVs across the country with information on how much most models usually sell for. Its guides could give you a good sense of how much that Chevy Bolt will be worth after a few years.

5. Shop at specialty dealers

Throughout the country (well more so in EV-friendly states like California and New York) there are dealerships that specialize in EVs. You'll get more information about battery stats charging recommendations and general EV expertise compared to traditional dealerships.

The most popular states this year (so far) for EV purchases are Texas California Illinois Florida and New York according data from automotive marketplace ACV.

Recurrent works with 25 EV dealers such as Green Eyed Motors in Colorado that provide a battery report for free. (The dealership pays for a Recurrent subscription not the shopper.)

Veloz has a search tool to find an EV dealer near you as part of its ""Electric for All"" campaign.

6. Dig up everything

If you're buying an EV through a friend or individual sale try to get as much info about the car's life as possible. Was it charged daily putting a strain on the battery? Or was it only charged weekly?

Did it spend winters in upstate New York or summers in Phoenix where the battery was exposed to extreme temperatures? Was it part of a recall like the Chevy Bolt?

You'll want to know it all so ask questions even if it seems mundane. It'll help you paint a picture of the car's battery health.

7. Compare to other EVs

Tesla's used car site doesn't provide a lot of details on the car you're about to buy. You can see how many miles are on the odometer if it had previous repairs and what model year it is.

But for this 2016 Model S which is selling for $76000 the estimated range is still 315 miles. That's the range listed when it was new. Five years later the battery has at least somewhat degraded — but that's not noted on the listing.

""Transparency reduces that uncertainty"" Case said.

So you'll want to compare it to similar Teslas in similar conditions to get a sense of how its battery has aged.

8. Check the warranty

Most EVs offer a battery warranty that covers at minimum eight years or 100000 miles. If you find a ""younger"" EV still under warranty you could potentially get a replacement battery in your pre-owned ride.

But the battery would have to be degraded enough to qualify for a replacement — in most cases down to around 70 percent of its original range. Let’s say you start with 300 miles of range but it drops to 200 miles within the first eight years. In that case you could get a new battery for free. California is considering a measure to raise that threshold to 80 percent which could increase the number of people eligible for new batteries.

In a year of regular EV use you should only lose about 1 to 2 percent of the original charge levels.

9. Wait it out

Each year more EVs are entering the market. Already there are 70 models available in California the most EV-friendly state. In 2022 another batch of EVs will be available.

Tesla



Tesla started delivering the updated version of its Model X SUV on Sunday.

The first deliveries come several months after Tesla promised.

Elon Musk has attributed the delay to supply-chain issues and difficulties in ramping production.

Tesla announced the revamped version of its Model X SUV back in January. Now after months of delays it's delivering them to customers at long last.

The electric-car maker posted photos to Twitter on Sunday of the ""first deliveries of new Model X."" Customers picked up the first examples outside of Tesla's Fremont California factory.

It's the most significant update to Tesla's largest and priciest vehicle since the model launched in 2016. The biggest changes come on the inside of the SUV. The $100000 Model X now has a landscape-oriented display (rather than a vertical one) a second screen in back for rear passengers and a rectangular steering yoke like something you'd see in an airplane.

Tesla gave the Model X a new battery pack and an exterior a facelift as well. Bits that used to be chrome like the door handles and window trim are now painted black. The front bumper looks different too. As part of the updates Elon Musk's automaker also introduced a high-performance Plaid version of the Model X which promises more than 1000 horsepower and a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds.

When Tesla announced major updates to the Model X SUV and Model S sedan in January Musk – ever the optimist when it comes to timelines – said deliveries of the new Model S would begin in February with shipments of the Model X starting shortly thereafter. New Model S deliveries started a few months behind schedule in June.

On Tesla's first-quarter earnings call in April Musk said Tesla had encountered ""more challenges than expected"" in developing the new Model S and Model X. That included navigating supply-chain issues and figuring out new internal production processes for the updated vehicles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hMzc5Nzk0NDYvdGVzbGEtY3liZXJ0cnVjay1zcGVjcy1yZW1vdmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla Removes Cybertruck Specs from Website Still Taking Deposits,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a37979446/tesla-cybertruck-specs-removed/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmFuZGRyaXZlci5jb20vbmV3cy9hMzc5Nzk0NDYvdGVzbGEtY3liZXJ0cnVjay1zcGVjcy1yZW1vdmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

As the world grapples with an ongoing chip shortage a quiet giant among chipmakers has committed to investing $100 billion over three years to ramp up production. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company may not be a household name but with a market value of over $550 billion it's one of the world's 10 most valuable companies. Now it's leveraging its considerable resources to bring the world's most advanced chip manufacturing back to U.S. soil. CNBC got an exclusive tour of the $12 billion fabrication plant or fab in Phoenix Arizona where TSMC will start making 5-nanometer chips in 2024. The company says it will produce 20000 wafers each month. ""These are parts that are going to be used in lots of different places: CPUs GPUs IPUs etc. They'll be used in smartphones"" Rick Cassidy told CNBC. Cassidy is TSMC's chief strategy officer and the president and CEO of TSMC's project in Arizona. TSMC makes key components for everything from cellphones to F-35 fighter jets to NASA's Perseverance Rover mission to Mars. Earlier this month it announced plans for a new factory in Japan where it will produce chips with older technologies for things like household devices and certain car components. TSMC is also Apple 's exclusive provider of the most advanced chips inside every iPhone currently on the market and most Mac computers. ""But they remain sort of in the background in terms of end markets. So Apple gets all the accolades when a new phone comes out"" said Joanne Itow managing director of manufacturing at Semico Research. ""We're low-key. We let our products speak for themselves. Their success brings all the business that we could ever hope for"" Cassidy said. The U.S. was the birthplace of advanced silicon but for decades now it's been losing market share to Asia where 79% of the world's chip production happened in 2020 according to industry association SEMI. It calculated the U.S. was responsible for 12% of worldwide chip manufacturing last year down from 37% in 1990.

TSMC's $12 billion 5-nanometer chip fabrication plant is six months into being built in northern Phoenix Arizona on September 28 2021. TSMC

TSMC alone was responsible for 24% of the world's semiconductor output in 2020 up from 21% in 2019 according to the company. When it comes to the most advanced chips used in the latest iPhones supercomputers and automotive AI TSMC is responsible for 92% of production while Samsung is responsible for the other 8% according to research group Capital Economics. ""It's become almost a monopoly at the leading edge and all of those manufacturing operations for the most part are out of Taiwan Hsinchu. That becomes a matter of national importance for the United States but not only the United States but the Western world"" said Christopher Rolland Susquehanna's senior semiconductor analyst. Along with cutting edge 3- and 5-nanometer chips TSMC also makes larger chips for products such as electric toothbrushes and coffeemakers. Cars often use less-advanced 28- to 40-nanometer chips. All types of chips have been impacted by the shortage. Carmakers including GM and Toyota have paused production at some plants. And Apple is likely to slash its 2021 production targets for the iPhone 13 with orders for some models delayed by more than a month.

World's first pure-play foundry

When Morris Chang first proposed the idea for TSMC in the 1980s investors were skeptical. Born in China and educated at Harvard MIT and Stanford Chang moved to Taiwan after 25 years at Texas Instruments . There the government asked him to create a Taiwanese semiconductor company that would become a world leader. His idea: Focus only on manufacturing — what's now known as a pure-play foundry. ""When you're just focused on one thing you do one thing really well"" said Cassidy who joined TSMC 23 years ago after what he describes as a fascinating hourslong meeting with Chang. Chang bet big on a need that didn't exist yet. When he founded TSMC in 1987 giants such as Intel and Texas Instruments took pride in designing and making their own chips. A legendary saying in the industry back then was ""Real men have fabs."" ""When Morris went out to get funding he went to many named companies that you know and they told them 'Morris your idea won't get off the ground. If you get it off the ground it can't scale.'"" But as chips got more complex manufacturing them became an enormous undertaking. Analysts say building a fab today takes at least two years and $10 billion. It's become nearly impossible for even the biggest chip companies — Intel  Nvidia  Broadcom  Qualcomm  AMD — to do it all and keep up with the most advanced tech. Intel for example still designs and makes its own chips but it's fallen behind Samsung and TSMC in recent years and now relies on TSMC to make some of its chips. ""If you were a smart designer you didn't have to have billions of dollars and a fab behind you for the first time with the emergence of TSM"" Rolland said. Now each major step of chipmaking is often handled by a separate company. Some such as Arm and MIPS focus on IP and architecture providing the core building blocks to design chips. Then there's electronic design automation companies such as Cadence and Synopsys that write the software used to design chips. Only one company ASML  makes the $180 million extreme ultraviolet light machines required to etch designs into the most advanced chips. Then there are the wildly successful fabless companies designing the chips such as Apple  Qualcomm Nvidia and many more.

As these fabless companies took off TSMC found itself on a flywheel making more and more of the world's chips. ""This has allowed [TSMC] to not only catch up but in my opinion surpass Intel to become the world's greatest manufacturing technology on the planet"" Rolland said ""one of the top 10 most valuable companies in terms of market cap in the globe."" TSMC was first listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in 1994 and in 1997 it became the first Taiwan-based company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. By the 2000s it had caught up with the 20 or so other companies making the most advanced chips at the time. As the tech kept advancing more and more companies fell behind. Today only two manufacturers remain that can make the most advanced 5-nanometer chips: TSMC and Samsung. In 2013 Apple started relying on TSMC to make its A-series chips for the iPhone as it moved away from reliance on Samsung a direct competitor in mobile phones. Today there's a TSMC chip inside every iPhone on the market. And Apple has moved away from Intel too now relying on TSMC to make the chips inside most Macs. In 2018 at age 86 Chang retired as chairman of TSMC. His radical pure-play foundry idea continues to pay off. With the opening of a new fab in Taiwan next year TSMC is in a race with Samsung to make the world's first 3-nanometer chips — with Intel planning to get there by 2025.

Bringing 5-nanometer to the U.S.

Right now no fab in the U.S. can make 5-nanometer chips. But TSMC is changing that. ""If you want more capacity you have to build more fabs. And that's one of the reasons that we're moving to the U.S."" Cassidy said. ""Our customers want us in the U.S. The U.S. government wants us here."" TSMC Technical Director Tony Chen took CNBC on a tour of the site where a four-story 2.3-million-square-foot fab is being erected. Chen has led 17 other fab construction projects in his 23 years with TSMC. ""This project is designed as a 5-nanometer fab. Actually it's a copy from the fab we have in Taiwan"" Chen said. Nearby one of the world's largest cranes was being lifted to its full height of 200 feet. The 2300-ton crane was brought to the site on 153 semitrucks. Site supervisor Jim White said contractors have moved nearly 4 million cubic yards of dirt and have used more than 260 million gallons of water since construction began in April. Building a fab and making chips takes an incredible amount of water not an abundant resource in the middle of the desert. Arizona's biggest water source is groundwater but deep wells at big farms are using water up faster than it's naturally replenished. Chen said TSMC needs around 4.7 million gallons of water each day to support production. TSMC is no stranger to water shortages. Taiwan is facing its worst drought in 56 years something that TSMC said has not impacted production. In Arizona TSMC said an on-site water treatment center will recycle up to 90% of water used at the fab. ""And then ultimately that water will be reinjected into the aquifer in partnership with the city of Phoenix after reverse osmosis and other technology solutions are provided"" said Chris Camacho president and CEO of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council. He helped negotiate the deal that brought the project to Arizona. Another challenge is that most 5-nanometer specialists are based in Asia. To solve this TSMC's academic relations manager Roxanna Vega said the company is bringing over some of its top experts from Taiwan. ""They're seen as subject matter experts on what they do in our fabs over there"" Vega said. ""It'll be a temporary assignment ... two maybe three years."" TSMC said it's already sent more than 250 new U.S. hires to Taiwan for 12 to 18 months to get up to speed. ""The opportunity to train in our 5-nanometer gigafab in Taiwan is to kind of give them that insight of how immense and how state of the art the tools machinery and everything is going to be here in Arizona"" Vega said. Diversification is a key reason for TSMC to bring advanced manufacturing to the U.S. ""Taiwan is not very good when it comes to analog semiconductor design and by moving to the United States you'd be able to tap into a much larger number of analog designers"" Rolland said.

In this project the expression data of lncRNAs in glioma tumor tissues (n = 168) and normal brain tissues (n = 150) were downloaded from TCGA and GTEx databases respectively. Next differentially expressed lncRNAs (|log 2 FoldChange | ≥1 and P < 0.05) were identified in glioma samples versus normal brain tissue samples. The top 100 up-regulated lncRNAs in glioma tissues were presented in Fig. 1A. After literature retrieval 3 lncRNAs (RMRP HOXA-AS3 and CASC9) related to glioma tumorigenesis and progression were screened out for further investigations. Moreover GEPIA database analyses revealed that expression levels of RMRP HOXA-AS3 and CASC9 were notably up-regulated in glioma tissues than in normal tissues (Fig. 1B). Given the association of tumor recurrence and drug resistance expression patterns of RMRP HOXA-AS3 and CASC9 were examined in tumor tissues isolated from glioma patients without any treatment (n = 20) and glioma patients suffered from recurrence post-treatment (n = 12). Results showed that RMRP and HOXA-AS3 expression levels were higher in tumors isolated from patients with relapsed glioma compared to the untreated group (Fig. 1C–E). To our knowledge the association of HOXA-AS3 and drug resistance has been reported in two previous articles [22 23]. which showed that HOXA-AS3 knockdown weakened the resistance of non-small-cell lung cancer and bladder cancer cells to cisplatin. However no or few studies were performed to explore the correlation of RMRP and drug resistance in glioma. TMZ is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug for glioma patients [8 9]. Hence the roles and molecular basis of RMRP in glioma tumorigenesis and TMZ resistance were further investigated in the subsequent experiments.

Effects of RMRP knockdown on glioma cell proliferation apoptosis and TMZ resistance

To have a deep insight into the functions of RMRP in glioma progression and TMZ resistance 3 siRNAs targeting RMRP (si-RMRP#1 si-RMRP#2 and si-RMRP#3) and a scrambled control siRNA (si-NC) were synthesized. Subsequent transfection efficiency analyses revealed that the transfection of si-RMRP#2 or si-RMRP#3 could markedly reduce RMRP abundance in U251 and LN229 cells compared to the si-NC-transfected group (Fig. 2A). Considering the best knockdown effect of si-RMRP#3 on RMRP si-RMRP#3 was selected for the following loss-of-function experiments. CCK-8 assay revealed that RMRP depletion strikingly weakened the proliferative ability of U251 and LN229 cells (Fig. 2B). Moreover RMRP knockdown led to an approximately 2.7-fold increase in cell apoptotic percentage (Q1-UR + Q1-LR) in U251 cells (Fig. 2C). Also an approximately 2.6-fold increase in cell apoptotic rate was observed in si-RMRP-transfected LN229 cells than that in the si-NC-transfected cells (Fig. 2C). In addition TMZ-resistant glioma cell lines (U251/TMZ and LN229/TMZ) were successfully constructed as evidenced by the marked increase of TMZ IC 50 values in U251/TMZ and LN229/TMZ cells compared to corresponding parental cells (Fig. 2D). Furthermore our data revealed that RMRP depletion led to the notable reduction of TMZ IC 50 values in U251 LN229 U251/TMZ and LN229/TMZ cells (Fig. 2E and F) suggesting that RMRP loss weakened TMZ resistance in parental and TMZ-resistant glioma cells. In summary these outcomes presented that RMRP knockdown curbed cell proliferation facilitated cell apoptosis and reduced TMZ resistance in glioma cells.

A U251 and LN229 cells were transfected with si-NC si-RMRP#1 si-RMRP#2 or si-RMRP#3. Forty-eight hours later RMRP level was examined through RT-qPCR assay (n = 3). B Cell proliferative ability was estimated through CCK-8 assay in U251 and LN229 cells transfected with si-NC or si-RMRP#3 at 0 24 48 72 h post-plating (n = 3).

E and F U251 LN229 U251/TMZ and LN229/TMZ cells were transfected with si-NC or si-RMRP#3. Transfected cells were seeded into 96-well plates for 24 h and then treated with different concentrations of TMZ for an additional 24 h.

Effects of RMRP knockdown on the growth of TMZ-treated glioma xenograft tumors

As shown in Fig. 2D the IC 50 values of TMZ were 350.9 and 623.8 µM in U251/TMZ and LN229/TMZ cells respectively. To reduce TMZ dosage U251/TMZ cells were used in our animal experiments. In vivo experiments demonstrated that there was a notable reduction of tumor volume and weight in TMZ-treated glioma xenograft tumors derived from U251/TMZ cells infected with sh-RMRP lentiviruses compared to the uninfected group or sh-NC group (Fig. 3A–C). RT-qPCR assay further validated that RMRP level was markedly reduced in glioma xenograft tumors derived from U251/TMZ cells infected with sh-RMRP lentiviruses relative to the sh-NC group (Fig. 3D). That was to say RMRP knockdown hindered the growth of TMZ-treated glioma xenograft tumors in vivo.

ZNRF3 was a target of RMRP3

Recently emerging evidence shows that lncRNAs can exert their biological activities through regulating gene expression [24]. To identify genes related to RMRP gene differential expression analysis was performed for glioma data (n = 168) downloaded from the TCGA database and normal brain tissue data (n = 150) downloaded from the GTEx database. Moreover co-expression relationships of RMRP and the top 50 down-regulated genes (Supplementary Table 3) in glioma were predicted through the GEPIA database. Results showed that expression levels of 13 genes were negatively associated with RMRP level (P < 0.05) in glioma (Supplementary Table 4). Based on P-value (P < 0.01) 7 genes whose expression was highly associated with RMRP level (TOMM6 ZNRF3 EEF1G ADORA2A KIAA0408 KREMEN1 XBP1) were pricked out for further explorations. The Ualcan database analysis further revealed that glioma patients with low ZNRF3 expression had a poor prognosis (P = 0.037) while the expression of the other 6 genes was not associated with the survival of glioma patients (Fig. 4A). These data suggested the potential regulatory relationships between RMRP and ZNRF3 in glioma. Subcellular localization analyses revealed that RMRP was located in the nuclear and cytoplasm of U251 and LN229 cells (Fig. 4B). In addition RT-qPCR and western blot assays demonstrated that RMRP depletion led to the remarkable elevation of ZNRF3 mRNA and protein levels in U251 and LN229 cells (Fig. 4C and D). Furthermore ActD assay showed that RMRP loss enhanced the stability of ZNRF3 mRNA in U251 and LN229 cells (Fig. 4E). In a word these outcomes showed that RMRP knockdown promoted ZNRF3 expression and improved ZNRF3 mRNA stability in glioma cells.

ZNRF3 down-regulation weakened the effects of RMRP knockdown on glioma cell proliferation apoptosis and TMZ resistance

Knockdown efficiency analyses revealed that the transfection of si-ZNRF3#1 or si-ZNRF3#3 led to the notable down-regulation of ZNRF3 mRNA expression level in U251 and LN229 cells (Fig. 5A). Next si-ZNRF3#3 was used in the following experiments because of its stronger knockdown effect. CCK-8 assay showed that ZNRF3 knockdown markedly abrogated the detrimental effect of RMRP depletion on cell proliferation in U251 and LN229 cells (Fig. 5B). Moreover ZNRF3 loss triggered a notable reduction in cell apoptotic percentage in U251 cells transfected with si-RMRP (Fig. 5C). Also cell apoptotic percentage was markedly reduced in si-RMRP-transfected LN229 cells following the introduction of si-ZNRF3 (Fig. 5C). Moreover ZNRF3 depletion abolished the inhibitory effect of RMRP knockdown on cell survival in TMZ-treated parental glioma cells (U251 and LN229) and TMZ-resistant glioma cells (U251/TMZ and LN229/TMZ) (Figs. 5D and E). Additionally there was an obvious increase of TMZ IC 50 value in cells co-transfected with si-RMRP and si-ZNRF3 compared to cells transfected with si-RMRP alone (Figs. 5D and E). In summary these data revealed that ZNRF3 knockdown weakened the effects of RMRP depletion on glioma cell proliferation apoptosis and TMZ resistance. In other words RMRP knockdown inhibited glioma cell proliferation facilitated glioma cell apoptosis and weakened the resistance of glioma cells to TMZ through up-regulating ZNRF3.

RMRP regulated ZNRF3 expression and mRNA stability through IGF2BP3

Recently emerging studies show that RNA binding proteins (RBPs) with the binding activities with multiple RNA molecules including mRNAs and non-coding RNAs play vital roles in regulating RNA metabolism and tumor development [252627]. Thus RBPs that could bind with RMRP and ZNRF3 mRNA were screened out through the POSTAR database. Combined with the aforementioned TCGA/GTEx differential gene expression data 17 RBPs with the possibility to interact with both RMRP and ZNRF3 mRNA were found to be differentially expressed in glioma (Fig. 6A Supplementary Table 5). Among these RBPs IGF2BP3 was picked out for further examinations given its noticeably high expression in glioma tissues (Supplementary Table 5). RIP assay coupled with RT-qPCR assay demonstrated that RMRP and ZNRF3 mRNA could be substantially enriched by the IGF2BP3 antibody in U251 cells (Fig. 6B). Considering the central role of the 3’ non-coding region (3’UTR) region in determining mRNA stability the essential sites in controlling the binding activity of IGF2BP3 and ZNRF3 mRNA in the 3’UTR were further examined. POSTAR2 database revealed that there were 5 potential IGF2BP3 binding sites in the 3’UTR of ZNRF3 mRNA. These binding sites were presented in Supplementary Table 6. RNA pull-down assay showed that IGF2BP3 protein could be largely pulled down by biotin-labeled ZNRF3 mRNA 3’UTR fragment 2 (2445–3539 nt) but could not be pulled down by biotin-labeled ZNRF3 mRNA 3’UTR fragment 1 (1-2477 nt) and fragment 3 (3506-3912 nt) (Fig. 6C). Because ZNRF3 mRNA 3’UTR fragment 1 contains IGF2BP3 binding site 1 and 2 fragment 2 contains binding site 2-4 fragment 3 covers the binding site 4 and 5 we believed that IGF2BP3 binding site 3 in ZNRF3 mRNA 3’UTR (chr22: 29056929-29056950 GCTTTTAAAATGAGGTCTAAAA) might mainly govern the binding activity of ZNRF3 mRNA 3’UTR and IGF2BP3 protein. The m6A2Target prediction analysis suggested that IGF2BP3 protein could bind with ZNRF3 mRNA in an m6A-independent manner (http://m6a2target.canceromics.org/#/binddetail/Human/IGF2BP3/ZNRF3/HEK293T). Recently some studies showed that IGF2BP3 could regulate gene expression by altering the interaction of mRNAs and RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [28 29]. Thus we supposed that IGF2BP2 might influence ZNRF3 expression through a RISC-dependent mechanism. Given the vital role of Argonaute 2 (Ago2) in RISC the effect of IGF2BP3 knockdown on the interaction of Ago2 (a core component of RISC) and ZNRF3 was examined in our project. Results showed that IGF2BP3 loss led to the notable reduction of ZNRF3 level enriched by Ago2 antibody in U251 cells (Fig. 6D) suggesting that IGF2BP3 knockdown weakened the interaction of ZNRF3 and RISC in glioma cells. Next overexpression efficiency analyses showed that the transfection of pcDNA3.1-RMRP overexpression plasmid markedly improved RMRP expression level in U251 and LN229 cells compared to the pcDNA3.1 control group (Fig. 6E). Moreover RT-qPCR and western blot assays demonstrated that RMRP overexpression led to the notable reduction in ZNRF3 mRNA and protein levels in U251 and LN229 cells (Fig. 6F and G). Additionally ectopic expression of RMRP reduced ZNRF3 mRNA stability in U251 and LN229 cells (Fig. 6H). Furthermore IGF2BP3 knockdown markedly alleviated the detrimental effects of RMRP on ZNRF3 expression and mRNA stability in U251 and LN229 cells (Fig. 6F–H).

RMRP knockdown reduced β-catenin expression by up-regulating ZNRF3 in glioma cells

Next the western blot assay showed that ZNRF3 loss led to the notable increase of β-catenin protein level in U251 and LN229 cells (Fig. 7A). Also enhanced β-catenin protein signals were observed in U251 and LN229 cells transfected with si-ZNRF3 compared with si-NC-transfected cells (Fig. 7B). In addition western blot and IF assays showed that RMRP silence reduced β-catenin protein expression and attenuated β-catenin signal intensity while ZNRF3 down-regulation markedly alleviated the inhibitory effect of RMRP loss on β-catenin expression in U251 and LN229 cells (Fig. 7C and D). Moreover the introduction of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway inhibitor XAV-939 abrogated RMRP-mediated TMZ resistance and inhibited the increase of cell survival rate induced by RMRP in U251/TMZ and LZ229/TMZ cells (Fig. 7E).

Fig. 7: RMRP knockdown inhibited β-catenin expression by up-regulating ZNRF3 in glioma cells. A B Cells were transfected with si-NC or si-ZNRF3 for 48 h followed by the measurement of β-catenin protein level via western blot assay A (n = 3) and IF assay (n = 1) B. C D Cells were transfected with si-NC si-RMRP or si-RMRP + si-ZNRF3. At 48 h post-transfection western blot assay C (n = 3) and IF assay D (n = 1) were performed to examine the protein expression pattern of β-catenin. E U251/TMZ and LN229/TMZ cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-RMRP for 24 h and then stimulated with or without DMSO/XAV-939 (10 µM) and different doses of TMZ for 24 h followed by the measurement of TMZ IC 50 values via CCK-8 assay (n = 3).

β-catenin facilitated RMRP transcription by transcription factor 4 (TCF4) in glioma cells

Additionally a previous study suggested that TCF4 might participate in mediating the regulatory effect of β-catenin on RMRP in HEK293 cells [30]. TCF4 is a member of the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factor family which has been reported to be the major downstream effectors of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway [313233]. Thus we further investigated whether β-catenin could regulate lncRNA RMRP expression by TCF4 in glioma cells.

Our data disclosed that β-catenin and TCF4 overexpression could lead to a notable increase of RMRP expression in U251 and LN229 cells (Fig. 8A and B). Moreover there was a higher RMRP expression level in U251 and LN229 cells co-transfected with β-catenin and TCF4 than in cells transfected with β-catenin or TCF4 alone (Fig. 8A and B). These data suggested that β-catenin could function as a coactivator of TCF4 to induce RMRP expression. Additionally β-catenin overexpression notably increased the luciferase activities of TCF/LEF1-Luc reporter containing TCF/LEF1 response elements in U251 cells (Fig. 8C) suggesting that β-catenin could induce gene transcription activation by binding with TCF/LEF1 binding elements. Hence TCF4 binding elements in the 2000-bp promoter sequences upstream of the RMRP transcription start site were predicted by the JASPAR website (http://jaspar.genereg.net/). Results showed that there were 3 potential TCF4 binding elements in the promoter sequences of RMRP (Relative profile score threshold: 90%). The promoter sequences of RMRP and the predicted TCF4 binding sites in the sequences (marked in bold) were shown in supplementary file 1. Next RMRP gene promoter fragment containing putative TCF4 binding site 1 2 or 3 was constructed into the pGL3-Luc reporter and generated recombinant plasmid was named pGL3-luc-TBE1 pGL3-luc-TBE2 or pGL3-luc-TBE3 respectively. Subsequent luciferase assay further demonstrated that TCF4 overexpression markedly enhanced the luciferase activities of the pGL3-luc-TBE3 reporter containing TBE3 (TCF4 binding site 3) but did not influence the luciferase activities of a pGL3-luc-TBE1 reporter containing TBE1 (TCF4 binding site 1) or pGL3-luc-TBE2 reporter containing TBE2 (TCF4 binding site 2) in U251 cells (Fig. 8D). These data suggested that TCF4 could activate the transcription of RMRP by interacting with the binding site 3. To further validate the vital role of TBE3 in TCF4-mediated transcription activation of RMRP promoter pGL3-luc-TBE3 (MUT) reporter with mutant TCF4 binding site 3 was constructed. Luciferase reporter assay showed that the mutation of TCF4 binding site 3 abrogated TCF4-mediated transcription activation at the RMRP promoter in U251 cells (Fig. 8E). Additionally the CHIP assay also demonstrated that TCF4 could bind to the promoter region of RMRP and β-catenin overexpression further potentiated the binding activity of TCF4 and the RMRP promoter region (Fig. 8F). Taken together these data suggested that β-catenin could activate RMRP transcription by TCF4.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hub2xvZ3lyZXZpZXcuY29tLzIwMjEvMTAvMTYvMTAzNzMwMy9pbi11bnByZWRpY3RhYmxlLXRpbWVzLWEtZGF0YS1zdHJhdGVneS1pcy1rZXkv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGVjaG5vbG9neXJldmlldy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8xNi8xMDM3MzAzL2luLXVucHJlZGljdGFibGUtdGltZXMtYS1kYXRhLXN0cmF0ZWd5LWlzLWtleS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In unpredictable times a data strategy is key,"A worldwide survey of 357 business executives conducted by MIT Technology Review Insights and Amazon Web Services shows that organizations of all sizes and across industries understand how crucial it is to become data-driven. Most important they’ve learned that a supportive and successful data strategy cannot be left to chance.

Data value is front and center

The past year and a half were disruptive to businesses across industries due in large part to the pandemic. The initial shutdowns in March 2020 meant that many companies had to turn on a dime to arrange for an all-remote workforce while also keeping up with wild shifts in consumer behavior and market demand.

The good news is even during an unprecedented crisis a large number of organizations continued to grow. In fact nearly half of the survey respondents (45%) characterize their companies as “thrivers” saying they boosted business growth over the past 18 months.

But not surprisingly after such a challenging period many other organizations could do little more than hold steady or try to hang on: the remaining 55% of those surveyed managed to maintain their efforts conducting their usual level of business or simply didn’t shut down.

Yet whether organizations are thriving maintaining or just surviving there’s no doubt that the power of data is top-of-mind for all businesses looking to succeed. In today’s digital world companies gather or have access to vast amounts of data. Thanks to technologies such as cloud computing analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) they can also store process analyze and put this treasure trove of data to use in a meaningful way to boost business outcomes.

As a result there are many possibilities to gain business value from large data sets. According to the survey the most common value companies are hoping to take advantage of is smarter decision-making (79%). They also want to more deeply understand their customers and industry trends (61%) provide better services and products (42%) and implement more efficient internal operations (33%).

Companies also learned valuable lessons about the importance of data as they struggled to stay competitive during the pandemic. Roughly four out of 10 survey respondents for example report that they need to look at more sources of data including demographic geospatial and competitor information. More than a third (37%) are evaluating machine learning and analytics—technologies essential to extract critical insights from their data. And 34% need help acting on the vast sums of data they gather and process.

For Thermo Fisher Scientific a US biotechnology company with more than 80000 employees in 50 countries thriving in today’s competitive life-sciences landscape is all about helping customers accelerate research solve complex analytical challenges improve patient diagnostics and increase laboratory productivity. Through a scalable and secure platform on which researchers and scientists can collaborate conduct research and improve medical treatments “we help our customers make the world healthier cleaner and safer” says Mikael Graindorge senior manager of commercial analytics and insight at Thermo Fisher. The company wants to provide the best service and products as well as the best ways for customers to efficiently complete their scientific research he explains. “But to do that we need more and more data which means more complexity so we need to expand our data science investment to continuously innovate for our customers.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDE5LTAyMS0wNDI0Mi0x0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cofilin1 oxidation links oxidative distress to mitochondrial demise and neuronal cell death | Cell Death & Disease,"Cell culture

HT22 cells originate from immortalized primary mouse hippocampal neurons. HT22 cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s high glucose medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich Munich Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 20 mM HEPES 100 units/mL penicillin 100 µg/mL streptomycin and 2 mM glutamine.

For efficient cofilin 1 knockdown HT22 cells were transfected with 15 nM cofilin1 siRNA for 48 h using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany) according to the manufacturer. Following siRNA sequences were obtained from Dharmacon: scrambled siRNA (scrsiRNA 5′-UAAUGUAUUGGAACGCAUA-3′) Cofilin1 siRNA1 (CflsiRNA1 5’-AGACAAGGACUGCCGCUAU-3’) and Cofilin1 siRNA2 (CflsiRNA2 5’-GGAAUCAAGCAUGAAUUAC-3’). The sensitivity of HT22 cells to glutamate highly depends on cell density and on cysteine-glutamate antiporter (xCT) expression levels. In this biological system glutamate concentrations are usually adjusted between 5 and 10 mM to achieve 70–80% cell damage. Erastin toxicity also depends on cell density and xCT expression and also needs adjustment within a concentration range between 0.7 and 3 µM.

Primary cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic mouse brains (E18) as described previously [21]. Genetically modified mice expressing cofilin1 allele with exon 2 flanked by loxP sites were used as controls (Ctrl) [29]. Cofilin1 knockout was achieved by expression of the Cre enzyme capable of recognizing loxP sites and thus specifically deleting exon 2 of the cofilin1 gene region resulting in a nonfunctional gene product. Since a systemic knockout of cofilin1 is embryonically lethal [30] Cre expression is under the control of a CaMKIIα promotor to specifically delete cofilin1 in excitatory neurons for the forebrain-including cerebral cortex neurons [31]. Neuronal cultures were grown in neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany) supplemented with 1.2 mM glutamine 2% B27 Plus supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany) 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Glutamate treatment (25 μM) was conducted at day 30 in culture (DIV30) for 24 h. NMDA-antagonist MK801 (Merck KGaA Germany) was added as a control at a concentration of 10 μM simultaneously to glutamate addition. Rho-activator II CN03 (Cytoskeleton Denver USA) was applied at a concentration of 1 µg/mL 3 h prior to glutamate treatment.

RT-(q)PCR

Total RNA was isolated by using InviTrap Spin Universal RNA Mini Kit (Stratec Biomedical Birkenfeld Germany) 48 h after siRNA transfection. SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany) was used to perform reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and specific oligonucleotides (Gapdh (399 bp) forward 5′-CGTCTTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC-3′ and reverse 5′-AAGGCCATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCC-3′ and Cofilin1 (146 bp) forward 5’-GCCAACTTCTAACCACAATAG-3’ and reverse 5’-CCTTACTGGTCCTGCTTCC-3’). The amplification products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis after staining with ethidium bromide by illumination with UV light.

Quantitative PCR was conducted in the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Fisher Scientific GmbH Schwerte Germany). mRNA was extracted using the InviTrap Spin Universal RNA Mini Kit (Invitek Molecular GmbH Berlin Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and treated with Turbo DNA-free Kit. cDNA synthesis was conducted with 200 ng of DNAse-treated RNA via iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH Munich Germany) and then diluted 1:5 with aqua bidest and added to a mastermix containing iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH Munich Germany). The respective primer pair for the genes of interest in a MicroAmp™ Fast Optical 96-Well Reaction Plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA). Relative gene expression levels were analyzed by double-delta C T analysis and shown as 2-ΔΔCτ. The following oligonucleotides were used for RT-qPCR measurements: Cofilin1 forward (AGGACCTGGTGTTCATCTTCTG) Cofilin1 reverse (TGCTTGATTCCTGTCAGCTTCT) GAPDH forward (CCCTTCATTGACCTCAACTA) GAPDH reverse (CCAAAGTTG TCATGGATGAC) U6 forward (CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA) U6 reverse (AACGCTT CACGAATTTGCGT).

Protein analysis

Protein extraction and Western blot analysis were performed as previously described [11]. Briefly cells were ruptured in a lysis buffer containing 0.25 M d-mannitol 0.05 M Tris base 1 mM EDTA 1 mM EGTA 1 mM DTT and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Diagnostics Mannheim Germany). The total protein amount was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany). Proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Roche Diagnostics Mannheim Germany). Cofilin1 and phospho-Cofilin1 (Ser3) (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology Danvers USA) as well as α-tubulin as a loading control were analyzed using indicated primary antibodies (α-tubulin antibody 1:10000; Sigma-Aldrich Munich Germany). After incubation with the appropriate secondary HRP-labeled antibody (Vector Laboratories Burlingame CA USA) Western blot signals were detected by chemiluminescence with Chemidoc system (Bio-Rad Munich Germany).

Cell viability

Cell viability was assessed by a colorimetric assay based on the yellow-colored MTT reagent (3-(45-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-25-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide 0.5 mg/mL for HT22 cells and 1 mg/mL for primary cortical neurons; Sigma-Aldrich Munich Germany) which is reduced to a purple-colored formazan quantified by absorbance measurement at 570 nm with a reference filter at 630 nm by FluoStar OPTIMA reader (BMG Labtech Ortenberg Germany). Cell death was monitored in real-time using the xCELLigence Real-Time Cell Analysis (RTCA; Roche Diagnostics Mannheim Germany) system as previously described [32]. Changes in the impedance are depicted as normalized cell index.

Flow cytometry

Different cellular and mitochondrial parameters of the glutamate- or erastin-induced cell death pathways were analyzed using the Guava easyCyte 6–2 L flow cytometer (Merck Millipore Darmstadt Germany) upon harvesting adherent HT22 cells and following the addition of different fluorescent dyes. Apoptotic and late necrotic cells were identified using the Annexin V-FITC Detection Kit (Promokine Heidelberg Germany). Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining were performed for 5 min in the dark at room temperature after harvesting the cells with trypsin. By staining the cells with BODIPY 581/591 C11 (44-difluoro-5-(4-phenyl-13-butadienyl)-4-bora-3a4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-undecanoic acid; Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany) oxidized lipids and membranes were detected. Following 8 h of glutamate treatment the cells were stained with 2 µM BODIPY dye for 1 h at 37 °C. The cell-permeable dye 2’7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H 2 DCF-DA) was used to evaluate the accumulation of cellular reactive oxygen species upon 30 min incubation of 20 µM DCF dye in DMEM without serum. For evaluation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species accumulation MitoSOX Red indicator (Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany) was applied at a concentration of 1.25 µM for 30 min at 37 °C. For the MitoSOX measurement with isolated mitochondria 10 µM of the complex III-inhibitor antimycin A (AA) was used as a positive control and incubated simultaneously with MitoSOX Red indicator at a concentration of 1.25 µM and afterward measured with Guava easyCyte 6–2 L flow cytometer (Merck Millipore Darmstadt Germany). Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured upon staining the cells with MitoPT TMRE Kit (ImmunoChemistry Technologies Hamburg Germany). Therefore cells were incubated with 0.2 µM TMRE (tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester) for 30 min at 37 °C. For investigation of the mitochondrial membrane potential of isolated mitochondria from adult mouse brain tissue 40 µg mitochondria were diluted in 150 µL 1× mitochondrial assay solution (MAS: 70 mM sucrose 220 mM mannitol 10 mM KH 2 Cl 2  5 mM MgCl 2  2 mM HEPES 1 mM EGTA 0.20% BSA pH 7.2) supplemented with 2 µM rotenone and 10 mM succinate. In total 50 µM of the uncoupler CCCP was used as a positive control. Mitochondria were incubated with 0.2 µM TMRE for 15 min and then measured with Guava easyCyte 6–2 L flow cytometer (Merck Millipore Darmstadt Germany). Staining the cells with the mitochondrial selective dye Rhod-2 AM (rhodamine-2 acetoxymethyl ester; Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany) allows for specific evaluation of mitochondrial calcium accumulation. Therefore Rhod-2 AM was reduced to Dihydrorhod-2 AM and incubated at a concentration of 2 µM in DMEM without serum for 1 h.

Measurement of ATP mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR)

Cellular ATP levels were measured using the ViaLight Plus Kit (Lonza Verviers Belgium) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly cells were lysed transferred to a white-walled 96-well plate and the ATP monitoring reagent was added to the cell lysate. Afterward the luminescence was detected with a FLUOstar OPTIMA reader (BMG Labtech Ortenberg Germany). Determination of the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate as an indicator of mitochondrial respiration was performed using the Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer (Agilent Technologies Waldbronn Germany). Cells were plated in XFe96-well microplates (6000 cells/well Seahorse Bioscience) and 1 h prior to the measurement the growth medium was replaced by the seahorse assay medium (4.5 g/l glucose 2 mM glutamine 1 mM pyruvate pH 7.35). After recording three baseline measurements four compounds were added by injection.

The compounds and final concentrations used are as follows: oligomycin 3 µM FCCP 0.5 µM rotenone 0.1 µM and antimycin A 1 µM. For measuring mitochondrial respiration 5–12 µg of isolated mitochondrial protein was measured in 1×MAS containing the complex II substrate succinate (10 mM) and the complex I inhibitor rotenone (2 µM) to focus on mainly complex II- and complex III-driven respiration. For slight attachment of the plated mitochondria at the bottom of the cell plate a centrifugation step of the whole plate at 2000×g for 20 min at 4 °C was indispensable (Heraeus Megafuge 40 R; Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany). Indicated compounds for the injections were used in the following final concentrations: 4 mM ADP 2.5 µg/mL oligomycin 4 µM FCCP and 4 µM antimycin A (AA). Three basal and three measurements after each injection were recorded with the Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer (Agilent Technologies Waldbronn Germany).

Mitochondrial isolation

Mitochondrial isolation of freshly dissected cortical or hippocampal brain tissue (~50 mg) was performed as previously described [21]. The tissue was embedded in 2 mL mitochondrial isolation buffer (composed of 300 mM sucrose 5 mM TES 200 µM EGTA pH 7.2) and roughly homogenized with a 20-G Neoject needle (Dispomed Gelnhausen Germany) and then sieved through a 100-µm nylon cell strainer (Corning Incorporated Corning NY USA). To homogenize the tissue efficiently and extract mitochondria from the cell structure thoroughly a cell homogenizer (Isobiotec Heidelberg Germany) with 1 mL gas-tight syringes (Supelco Munich Germany) was used to ensure a constant rate of 700 µL/min. The cell homogenizer contained a spherical tungsten carbide ball with a clearance of 10 µm to decompose the tissue but simultaneously maintain the integrity of mitochondria. The cell homogenate was transferred into 1.5 mL tubes and centrifuged at 800 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Afterward the supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube and centrifuged at 10000 x g again for 10 min at 4 °C (Heraeus™ Fresco™ 17 Mikrozentrifuge; Thermo Fisher Scientific Darmstadt Germany). The resulting pellet consists of the crude mitochondrial fraction which was finally resuspended in MSHE-BSA (composed of 70 mM sucrose 210 mM mannitol 5 mM HEPES 1 mM EGTA 0.5% (w/v) BSA pH 7.2) buffer. The seahorse measurement was performed in mitochondrial assay solution composed of 70 mM sucrose 220 mM mannitol 10 mM KH 2 PO 4  5 mM MgCl 2  2 mM HEPES 1 mM EGTA 0.2 % (w/v) BSA pH 7.2). All steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Pierce™ BCA Kit was used to determine the protein amount of the mitochondrial fraction.

Protein expression and purification

Human cofilin1 was amplified by PCR using specific oligonucleotides (forward: 5’-CATATGGCCTCCGGTGTG-3’ reverse: 5’-GGATCCTCACAAAGGCTTGCCCTC-3’) and cloned into the pET-15b vector (Novagen Millipore UK). By using site-directed mutagenesis the cysteine residues of cofilin1 were mutated into serine residues using complementary oligonucleotides harboring the nucleotide exchanges (Cys39Ser: forward: 5’-GTGCTCTTCTCCCTGAGTG-3’ reverse: 5’-CACTCAGGGAGAAGAGCAC-3’; Cys80Ser: forward: 5’-CATAAGGACTCCCGCTATGC-3’ reverse: 5’-GCATAGCGGGAGTCCTTATC-3’; Cys139Ser: forward: 5’-CAAGCAAACTCCTACGAGGAG-3’ reverse: 5’-CTCCTCGTAGGAGTTTGCTTG-3’; Cys147Ser: forward: 5’-GACCGCTCCACCCTGG-3’ reverse: 5’-CCAGGGTGGAGCGGTC-3’) and the KOD Hot Start Mastermix (Merck Darmstadt Germany). The plasmids were confirmed by sequencing (Seqlab Göttingen Germany).

The human cofilin1 WT the mutant lacking two Cys residues (Cys139/147Ser 2Cys → Ser) and the mutant lacking all four Cys residues (4Cys → Ser) were expressed as His-Tag fusion proteins in E. coli as described before [33]. The proteins were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using the His Trap Kit from GE Healthcare Life Science USA. Expression and purification efficiency were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using precast gels from Bio-Rad USA and Coomassie staining. Proteins were re-buffered into PBS using Zeba Spin columns and the thermal stability of the proteins was analyzed by recording the emission at 600 nm over time with increasing temperature from 20 to 70 °C (2 °C per 3 min) using the Shimadzu UV1800.",,,

With oil prices at seven-year highs and investors worried about supply chain problems and inflation Wall Street is on the hunt for companies that will avoid the worst of the pain of rising costs — or turn it to their advantage.

One way to do that is through pricing power which is shorthand for a company's ability to raise prices to cancel out rising costs and maintain the profits and margins that investors want to see.

That's according to online lending marketplace Lending Tree which recently published a study on which U.S. cities currently offer the best range of conditions for entrepreneurs looking to start a new business. At the top of the list: Raleigh North Carolina a capital city with low unemployment and a well-educated population of workers.

In fact multiple cities in North Carolina ranked high on Lending Tree's rankings prompting the report to name the Tar Heel State the country's best place to start a new business. Charlotte and Durham ranked third and fourth respectively. And Greensboro and Winston-Salem came in 39th and 48th.

One reason for North Carolina's strong representation: The state offers among the country's lowest corporate tax rates. It also has the country's lowest maximum corporate tax rate at 2.5% helping it land the No. 2 spot on CNBC's 2021 ranking of the best U.S. states for businesses.

The Lending Tree study scored the 100 largest U.S. metro areas by population based on factors like the proportion of residents who hold a bachelor's degree state corporate tax rates and local housing costs. The study drew from U.S. Census Bureau data and analysis from entrepreneurship nonprofit Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.

Raleigh shot to the top of the rankings thanks to its relatively low unemployment rate which was 3.9% in July. That's well below the national rate which was 5.4% at that time and has since fallen to 4.8%.

More than half of the city's population which stands at 468000 people according to the Census Bureau is between ages 24 and 55. And 48% of the city's residents hold at least a bachelor's degree which is the seventh-highest proportion on Lending Tree's ranking of cities.

When you go on vacation you want to feel like a VIP. You’ve worked hard so you deserve it – and you’re not alone in feeling that way.

Cancun is home to Mexico’s second-largest airport which has over 30 million visitors passing through each year – and this number keeps increasing despite the pandemic. Cancun has spotted this growing market and is catering to it with gusto.

With so many tourists entering the country by air there are more takers for VIP airport services to minimize stress and up the luxury factor. You can take advantage of the VIP lounges use the meet and greet service or arrange a VIP transfer making sure you start and finish your vacation in style.

● VIP Lounge

Terminals 2 and 3 at Cancun Airport both have a VIP Lounge and each is bookable in advance. It’s great for getting away from the crowds and kicking back during the (sometimes long) wait for the announcement of your departure gate. The VIP Lounges are free to use for Premier Pass holders business-class and first-class travelers. Other visitors can pay an entry fee at the door.

● Terminal 3

Open daily from 7 am until 10 pm the Mera VIP Business Lounge Lounge is exclusively for passengers waiting to board departing international flights. You’ll have to pay $29 usd to enter and priority pass or business class tickets won’t exempt you from this but because of that it’s less crowded than some lounges. The lounge offers hot and cold meals. Pasta sandwiches tamales hummus veggies and salads. The lounge is located in Terminal 3 after security next to Gate 17.

● Terminal 2

This VIP Lounge is open from 6 am until 10 pm each day and is available exclusively for passengers with scheduled flight departures. The lounge offers hot drinks and snacks comfortable seating and tables but conferencing facilities are chargeable. Guests are limited to 3 hours for international flights and 2 hours for domestic.

● VIP Meet And Greet With Fast Track

There are a number of private companies offering Meet and Greet packages at Cancun airport.

Using this service will save you precious time so you can be en route to your resort much more quickly. It’s also great to know someone will be there to guide you through what can sometimes be a stressful and confusing process.

One company offering this service is AssistAnt which has over a decade of experience and promises clients the following assistance:

You will be met at the arrivals gate and driven to passport control.

They will assist with collecting your luggage.

They’ll take you through the customs process.

Departures

They will arrange transportation for you from your accommodation to the airport if required.

Use their expedited services to get through check-in security and passport control quickly and easily.

If you’re a first-class/business ticket holder you will be escorted right to your departure gate.

● VIP Transfer Service

Once you’re through all the formalities of the airport you may want to add on a VIP transfer service too. This is perfect to avoid the confusion and potential lines you may encounter when arranging your own transport at a busy international airport.

We recently tested out Cancun VIP Transfers and the company did an amazing job. Our driver was on time waiting at the arrivals area with our name on a sign. The Escalade was luxurious comfortable and well stocked with ice cold water soda and beer.

Of course there are other less costly ways to get from the airport to your resort such as Cancun Transfers Van Service.

The Irish have now won 36 straight games over an unranked opponent after Irish kicker Jonathan Doerer drilled the 46 yard field goal with seconds on the clock handing the Irish a 32-29 win.

Head Coach Brian Kelly gave the nod to grad transfer quarterback Jack Coan to start the game however after a few drives he handed the reins over to freshman Tyler Buchner.

The freshman quarterback recording his first career rushing touchdown as he took it to the house on a three yard run in the 2nd quarter. He later connected with junior running back Kyren Williams for his 2nd touchdown of the game.

Buchner is the first true freshman to have a passing and rushing touchdown in the same game.

“He did some really good things. And then he did some things that are inexperienced"" Irish Head Coach Brian Kelly said. ""He’s getting there but he’s not there yet. The maturation process continues but man is

he a gamer. He’s tough he’s fast he’s competitive he’s unflappable too. He just keeps coming back. I’m glad he’s on our team.”

The Irish have a bye week this upcoming weekend their next match up is considered one of the greatest rivalries as Southern California comes to South Bend for their 92nd all time meeting.

The rivalry dates back to Calvin Coolidge's presidency with the Irish leading the all time series 49-36-5.

The Irish and Trojans will meet in the house that Rockne built on October 23rd for their 6th night game in South Bend kick off is set for 7:30.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVscGFzb3RpbWVzLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvc3BvcnRzLzIwMjEvMTAvMTcvcGhvdG9zLXV0ZXAtZm9vdGJhbGwtdnMtbG91aXNpYW5hLXRlY2gtdGVjaC84NDkzMjM2MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: UTEP football vs. Louisiana Tech Tech,"Photos: Louisiana Tech visits UTEP Miners football at Sun Bowl

Pennypack Creek was one of several creeks that crested their banks in August as the remnants of Hurricane Ida hit this region hard and also caused Schuylkill and Delaware River flooding.

Preventing stormwater runoff from reaching the Delaware helps provide safer water for native wildlife and the city residents for whom the river is a primary source of drinking water.

“I would say particularly in Northeast Philadelphia the Delaware River in Philadelphia provides 60% of the city’s drinking water. So having the upside reducing the pollutants that get into the river a variety of trees help create a buffer between the city and the river. That really helps us in keeping the river” Phillips said. “We have monthly cleanup days on the shoreline. You would not believe the number of plastics that we clean up along the shoreline and just in one year alone we cleaned up 12000 pounds. It was mostly plastic water bottles. You know all of that stuff that just gets into our sewer system.”

Trees also keep the city cooler and reduce the urban heat island effect Phillips said. “Something that Philadelphia definitely is feeling is climate change. We’ve had noticeably hotter summers in the last few decades.”

Since 2017 the Arbor Day Foundation which bills itself as the largest nonprofit membership organization planting trees has helped Riverfront North Partnership’s efforts every spring and fall.

“Because of that support we have plans … by the end of this year for 1200 trees in Northeast Philadelphia” Phillips said.

“It is inspiring to see Philadelphia enrich their green spaces and neighborhoods with trees that play an important part in a greener future” Dan Lambe president of the Arbor Day Foundation said in a news release. “The city’s goal to have at least 30% tree canopy cover in each of its neighborhoods by 2025 is commendable and we are pleased to support them in their efforts.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvb2N0LzE3L3VuaGFwcHktcmFuY2hlcnMtdG8tYnVpbGQtdGhlaXItb3duLWJlZWYtcGxhbnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unhappy ranchers to build their own beef plants | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"DES MOINES Iowa -- Like other ranchers across the country Rusty Kemp for years grumbled about rock-bottom prices paid for the cattle he raised in central Nebraska even as the cost of beef at grocery stores kept climbing.

He and his neighbors blamed it on consolidation in the beef industry stretching back to the 1970s that resulted in four companies slaughtering over 80% of the nation's cattle giving the processors more power to set prices while ranchers struggled to make a living. Federal data show that for every dollar spent on food the share that went to ranchers and farmers dropped from 35 cents in the 1970s to 14 cents recently.

It led Kemp to launch an audacious plan: Raise more than $300 million from ranchers to build a plant themselves putting their future in their own hands.

""We've been complaining about it for 30 years"" Kemp said. ""It's probably time somebody does something about it.""

Crews will start work this fall building the Sustainable Beef plant on nearly 400 acres near North Platte Neb. and other groups are making similar surprising moves in Iowa Idaho and Wisconsin. The enterprises will test whether it's really possible to compete financially against an industry trend that has swept through American agriculture and that played a role in meat shortages during the coronavirus pandemic.

The move is well timed as the U.S. Department of Agriculture is now taking a number of steps to encourage a more diverse supply in the beef industry.

Still it's hard to overstate the challenge going up against huge well-financed competitors that run highly efficient plants and can sell beef at prices that smaller operators will struggle to match.

The question is whether smaller plants can pay ranchers more and still make a profit themselves. An average 1370-pound steer is worth about $1630 but that value must be divided between the slaughterhouse feed lot and the rancher who typically bears the largest expense of raising the animal for more than a year.

Consolidation of meatpacking started in the mid-1970s with buyouts of smaller companies mergers and a shift to much larger plants.

Census data cited by the USDA shows that the number of livestock slaughter plants declined from 2590 in 1977 to 1387 in 1992. And big processors gradually dominated going from handling only 12% of cattle in 1977 to 65% by 1997.

Currently four companies -- Cargill JBS Tyson Foods and National Beef Packing -- control over 80% of the U.S. beef market thanks to cattle slaughtered at 24 plants. That concentration became problematic when the coronavirus infected workers slowing and even closing some of the plants and a cyberattack last summer briefly forced a shutdown of JBS plants until the company paid an $11 million ransom.

The Biden administration has largely blamed declining competition for a 14% increase in beef prices from December 2020 to August. Since 2016 the wholesale value of beef and profits to the largest processors has steadily increased while prices paid to ranchers have barely budged.

The backers of the planned new plants have no intention of replacing the giant slaughterhouses such as a JBS plant in Grand Island Neb. that processes about 6000 cattle daily -- four times what the proposed North Platte plant would handle.

However they say they will have important advantages including more modern equipment and they hope less employee turnover thanks to slightly higher pay of more than $50000 annually plus benefits along with more favorable work schedules. The new Midwest plants are also counting on closer relationships with ranchers encouraging them to invest in the plants to share in the profits.

The companies would market their beef both domestically and internationally as being of higher quality than meat processed at larger plants.

Chad Tentinger who is leading efforts to build a Cattlemen's Heritage plant near Council Bluffs Iowa said he thinks smaller plants were profitable even back to the 1970s but that owners shifted to bigger plants in hopes of increasing profits.

Now he said ""We want to revolutionize the plant and make it an attractive place to work.""

Besides paying ranchers more and providing dividends to those who own shares the hope is that their success will spur more plants to open and the new competitors will add openness to cattle markets.

Unless smaller plants can keep expenses down they will need to find customers who will pay more for their beef or manage with a lower profit margin than the big companies.

According to the North American Meat Institute a trade group that includes large and mid-size plants the biggest challenge will be the shortage of workers in the industry.

The proposed new plants come as the USDA is trying to increase the supply chain.

He and his neighbors blamed it on consolidation in the beef industry stretching back to the 1970s that resulted in four companies slaughtering over 80% of the nation’s cattle giving the processors more power to set prices while ranchers struggled to make a living. Federal data show that for every dollar spent on food the share that went to ranchers and farmers dropped from 35 cents in the 1970s to 14 cents recently.

It led Kemp to launch an audacious plan: Raise more than $300 million from ranchers to build a plant themselves putting their future in their own hands.

""We’ve been complaining about it for 30 years"" Kemp said. ""It’s probably time somebody does something about it.""

US GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATING RISING BEEF PRICES DURING CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

Crews will start work this fall building the Sustainable Beef plant on nearly 400 acres near North Platte Nebraska and other groups are making similar surprising moves in Iowa Idaho and Wisconsin. The enterprises will test whether it’s really possible to compete financially against an industry trend that has swept through American agriculture and that played a role in meat shortages during the coronavirus pandemic.

The move is well timed as the U.S. Department of Agriculture is now taking a number of steps to encourage a more diverse supply in the beef industry.

The Biden administration last month said it was concerned that the meatpacking industry was ""pandemic profiteering"" announcing that the USDA will invest $1.4 billion in assistance to food processers harmed during the pandemic.

According to Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller pushing back against the big processers is the right move for ranchers and would benefit both ranchers and consumers.

""Ranchers have been getting screwed long enough it is time we fight back. This is how we do it we go head to head with the big processors."" Miller told Fox News.

Still it’s hard to overstate the challenge going up against huge well-financed competitors that run highly efficient plants and can sell beef at prices that smaller operators will struggle to match.

The question is whether smaller plants can pay ranchers more and still make a profit themselves. An average 1370-pound steer is worth about $1630 but that value must be divided between the slaughterhouse feed lot and the rancher who typically bears the largest expense of raising the animal for more than a year.

David Briggs the CEO of Sustainable Beef acknowledged the difficulty but said his company’s investors remain confident.

""Cattle people are risk takers and they’re ready to take a risk"" Briggs said.

Consolidation of meatpacking started in the mid-1970s with buyouts of smaller companies mergers and a shift to much larger plants. Census data cited by the USDA shows that the number of livestock slaughter plants declined from 2590 in 1977 to 1387 in 1992. And big processors gradually dominated going from handling only 12% of cattle in 1977 to 65% by 1997.

Currently four companies — Cargill JBS Tyson Foods and National Beef Packing — control over 80% of the U.S. beef market thanks to cattle slaughtered at 24 plants. That concentration became problematic when the coronavirus infected workers slowing and even closing some of the massive plants and a cyberattack last summer briefly forced a shutdown of JBS plants until the company paid an $11 million ransom.

'THE 'FIVE' ON RISING FOOD GAS PRICES

The Biden administration has largely blamed declining competition for a 14% increase in beef prices from December 2020 to August. Since 2016 the wholesale value of beef and profits to the largest processors has steadily increased while prices paid to ranchers have barely budged.

The backers of the planned new plants have no intention of replacing the giant slaughterhouses such as a JBS plant in Grand Island Nebraska that processes about 6000 cattle daily — four times what the proposed North Platte plant would handle.

However they say they will have important advantages including more modern equipment and they hope less employee turnover thanks to slightly higher pay of more than $50000 annually plus benefits along with more favorable work schedules. The new Midwest plants are also counting on closer relationships with ranchers encouraging them to invest in the plants to share in the profits.

The companies would market their beef both domestically and internationally as being of higher quality than meat processed at larger plants.

Chad Tentinger who is leading efforts to build a Cattlemen’s Heritage plant near Council Bluffs Iowa said he thinks smaller plants were profitable even back to the 1970s but that owners shifted to bigger plants in hopes of increasing profits.

Now he said ""We want to revolutionize the plant and make it an attractive place to work.""

Besides paying ranchers more and providing dividends to those who own shares the hope is that their success will spur more plants to open and the new competitors will add openness to cattle markets.

Derrell Peel an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University said he hopes they’re right but noted that research shows even a 30% reduction in a plant’s size will make it far less efficient meaning higher costs to slaughter each animal.

Unless smaller plants can keep expenses down they will need to find customers who will pay more for their beef or manage with a lower profit margin than the big companies.

""We have these very large plants because they’re extremely efficient"" Peel said.

According to the North American Meat Institute a trade group that includes large and mid-size plants the biggest challenge will be the shortage of workers in the industry.

It’s unfair to blame the big companies and consolidation for the industry’s problems said Tyson Fresh Meats group president Shane Miller.

""Many processors including Tyson are not able to run their facilities at capacity in spite of ample cattle supply"" Miller told a U.S. Senate committee in July. ""This is not by choice: Despite our average wage and benefits of $22 per hour there are simply not enough workers to fill our plants.""

The proposed new plants come as the USDA is trying to increase the supply chain. The agency has dedicated $650 million toward funding mid-size and small meat and poultry plants and $100 million in loan guarantees for such plants. Also planned are new rules to label meat as a U.S. product to differentiate it from meat raised in other countries.

From a tornado that devastated parts of South Jersey to severe flooding in Pennsylvania the damage was widespread throughout our region.

With so much rain falling across the headwaters of the Brandywine River which ends in Wilmington some residents living along the water had to be rescued from their homes after surging water overflowed the banks.

Many businesses were also devastated. Further upstream in the city the Hagley Museum and Library saw significant damage.

“It was so loud. You know the water was just like one big waterfall in the powder yard” said Jill MacKenzie Hagley’s executive director.

The powder yard is the area right along the Brandywine which used water-powered mills to grind gunpowder for the DuPont company more than 200 years ago. Company founder Éleuthère Irénée du Pont diverted part of the river to run through what are called “mill races” that turn the gears for grinding. Hagley offers tours of the mills and support buildings to demonstrate the history of the du Pont family and the company they founded at the site in 1802."

Here's What It's Like.,"This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Karen McNeill a 46-year-old family historian from Oakland California about her career path. It has been edited for length and clarity.

I'm the SVP and senior family historian at Ascent Private Capital Management of US Bank. Ascent works with ultra-high-net-worth clients with $75 million or more in assets.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

I have a bachelor's degree in history and French a master's in US history and a PhD in history all from the University of California Berkeley. I'd always planned to be a professor but when the recession hit in 2007 I began working in historic preservation. I nominated properties for the National Register of Historic Places surveyed properties for city-planning purposes and documented properties as development issues arose in the state of California. I also taught history and architectural history at universities in California.

I never thought I'd work for a bank but when I discovered an opportunity to create a program that applied business and family history to real-world situations I knew I'd found my ideal job. I began working with US Bank in 2013 helping families explore their pasts so they understand the present and can better plan for the future.

I have one of three 'typical' days

Research days : I fill out family trees comb through historical documents review Census records wills and other vital records read newspapers and look through photos to compile a family's history. I also do outside reading to better understand the people on the tree.

Education days: I attend family meetings and retreats and work with multiple generations on questions like ""Where do we come from?"" and ""What will we do with this material?"" We discuss themes from my research that are interesting or striking and the values that have stood out over time to help shape their future and determine the legacy they want to leave.



I was working with a man who was a fifth-generation American

He had long heard stories about his great-great grandfather's ""Wild West adventure"" an epic bear-hunting trip in Alaska and a river bearing his name.

I found that his great-great grandfather had indeed gone on a bear-hunting trip in the outer peninsula of Alaska. He'd learned to fish from indigenous people and lived among them. Guides on his trip were so impressed with his adaptability that they named a river after him and his diaries from the trip were so detailed that they helped inform National Geographic maps of the area.

The family was honored and humbled that their ancestor had played such an integral role in mapping the area but there was one negative side effect: The maps helped others discover the region and soon it was overrun with tourists. The family was so proud of the story that they decided to help preserve the region for the future.

I love when families have 'aha' moments where they make a connection to their pasts

For example a seventh-generation member of a family had long known there were mental-health issues in his family. When I researched the family's history back to the 19th century the family was shocked to see proof of a long history of mental illness but the discovery also brought to focus that this was something the family needed to talk about now.

Another family I worked with had a history of bootlegging during Prohibition and evading the authorities throughout the 1920s. That revelation first generated a bit of laughter but it also brought into focus the profound instability that the children of the bootleggers experienced as their parents kept the family on the run.

The wealth creator emerged from this chaos. He was liked and respected at home and at work but also known as rigid in his expectations and hot-tempered. His children barely knew their grandparents aunts and uncles or cousins.

By understanding the context in which the wealth creator grew up his descendants were able to let go of some resentment around his more difficult traits and impossible expectations. They better understood his drive to succeed and achieve stability for his family. And they found great inspiration in his journey from poverty to plenty.

I'm also increasingly involved in futurist technology including artificial intelligence and augmented reality

With AI historians record interviews with family members and upload those files into a program that allows someone to ask Alexa or Siri a question — ""When did you meet mom?"" — and the program plays relevant parts of the recording with dad.

With augmented reality a family member can put on a special pair of glasses and flip through family documents and history in a more tactile way. The one futurist in the bank is working with me the only historian on this and it melds perfectly.

Expertise is not enough to succeed in this role

An academic may find it difficult to engage in conversations writing or presentation styles that are not steeped in archives monographs and historiography or theory.

Passion isn't enough either. The amateur genealogist may have great research skills to fill out the family tree but lack the depth of knowledge to turn information into meaningful stories about risk reward resilience suffering creativity traditions generosity or sacrifice that will nourish generations who will be looking to understand who they are where they come from and how they want to engage in the world. It's essential to be curious about any topic and open-minded to others' world views.

Finally empathy humility and good listening skills create a safe space to engage in deep thorough and fun conversations.

It takes a lot of effort to document family and business histories but no one ever regrets doing it once it's done

If a family doesn't go through the history exercise and the business is sold there's often a vacuum around the family's identity.

I recently worked with a family who sold their timber business after nearly 100 years but forgot to gather pictures and other artifacts before closing on the deal. When they went to go get them from the headquarters the locks had been changed. All that history was gone.

To avoid situations like that they need to do the workaround on how the business was built where the family's wealth came from and the values that went into building it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZWJhdWVyLzIwMjEvMTAvMTYvaGVyZXMtd2h5LWFjdHVhbGx5LXRoZS1pcnMtNjAwLWJhbmstcmVwb3J0aW5nLXByb3Bvc2FsLWlzLWVudGlyZWx5LXJlYXNvbmFibGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's Why Actually The IRS $600 Bank Reporting Proposal Is Entirely Reasonable,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ebauer/2021/10/16/heres-why-actually-the-irs-600-bank-reporting-proposal-is-entirely-reasonable/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZWJhdWVyLzIwMjEvMTAvMTYvaGVyZXMtd2h5LWFjdHVhbGx5LXRoZS1pcnMtNjAwLWJhbmstcmVwb3J0aW5nLXByb3Bvc2FsLWlzLWVudGlyZWx5LXJlYXNvbmFibGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2UvZ29sZG1hbi1zYWNocy1nZXRzLXJlZ3VsYXRvci1ub2QtZnVsbC1vd25lcnNoaXAtY2hpbmEtc2VjdXJpdGllcy1qdi0yMDIxLTEwLTE4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goldman Sachs moves to full ownership of China securities JV,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/goldman-sachs-gets-regulator-nod-full-ownership-china-securities-jv-2021-10-18/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZpbmFuY2UvZ29sZG1hbi1zYWNocy1nZXRzLXJlZ3VsYXRvci1ub2QtZnVsbC1vd25lcnNoaXAtY2hpbmEtc2VjdXJpdGllcy1qdi0yMDIxLTEwLTE4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vZnV0dXJpc20uY29tL3RoZS1ieXRlL2Jhbmstcm9iYmVycy1kZWVwZmFraW5nLXZvaWNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank Robbers Steal $35 Million by Deepfaking Boss's Voice,"Dubai investigators say that “deep voice” tech was used in the heist.

Deep Voice

Deepfake technology has gotten incredibly sophisticated over the years allowing us to resurrect the voices of the dead and fool Justin Bieber into challenging famous Scientologists to fights. Some folks are even using it for more criminal purposes.

Such was the case for a United Arab Emirates bank that was fooled by criminals using AI voice cloning to steal $35 million. Court documents recently uncovered by Forbes revealed that fraudsters used a deepfaked voice of a company executive to fool a bank manager to transfer the millions to their possession in early 2020.

The supposed executive said his company was about to make an acquisition and needed the money to do so. The bank manager recognized the executive's voice from having worked with him before. So believing everything was copacetic he authorized the transfer — straight into the accounts of the criminals.

Wanted: AI Bank Robbers

The UAE has now requested the help of American investigators to trace roughly $400000 that went into US-based bank accounts according to the documents. Dubai investigators believe that the operation involved at least 17 people using “deep voice” tech and sent money to banks across the world.

While surprising this is actually the second known case of criminals using a deepfaked voice to try and rob a bank. In 2019 criminals used AI to try and impersonate an executive's voice to steal $243000 according to The Wall Street Journal.

Rest assured as the technology behind deepfakes become more and more refined we’ll see plenty more attempts at fraud emerge in the future.

Uber and Lyft promised ubiquitous self-driving cars as soon as this year. They promised an end to private car ownership. They promised to reduce congestion in the largest cities. They promised consistently affordable rides. They promised to boost public transit use. They promised profitable business models. They promised a surfeit of well-paying jobs. Heck they even promised flying cars.

Well none of that has gone as promised (but more about that later). Now a new study is punching a hole in another of Uber and Lyft’s promised benefits: curtailing pollution. The companies have long insisted their services are a boon to the environment in part because they reduce the need for short trips can pool riders heading in roughly the same direction and cut unnecessary miles by for instance eliminating the need to look for street parking.

It turns out that Uber rides do spare the air from the high amount of pollutants emitted from starting up a cold vehicle when it is operating less efficiently researchers from Carnegie Mellon University found. But that gain is wiped out by the need for drivers to circle around waiting for or fetching their next passenger known as deadheading. Deadheading Lyft and Uber estimated in 2019 is equal to about 40 percent of rideshare miles driven in six American cities. The researchers at Carnegie Mellon estimated that driving without a passenger leads to a roughly 20 percent overall increase in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions compared to trips made by personal vehicles.

The researchers also found that switching from a private car to on-demand rides like an Uber or Lyft increased the external costs of a typical trip by 30 to 35 percent or roughly 35 cents on average because of the added congestion collisions and noise from ridesharing services. “This burden is not carried by the individual user but rather impacts the surrounding community” reads a summary of the research conducted by Jacob Ward Jeremy Michalek and Constantine Samaras. “Society as a whole currently shoulders these external costs in the form of increased mortality risks damage to vehicles and infrastructure climate impacts and increased traffic congestion.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTEwLTE3L3ViZXItY2FyZWVtLXNhaWQtdG8tZmFjZS0xMDAtbWlsbGlvbi1iaWxsLWluLXNhdWRpLXRheC1zcXVlZXpl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber and its Dubai Subsidiary Hit With Massive Tax Bills in Saudi Arabia,"Why did this happen?

JLL is the professional services firm that manages the 1.4 million-square-foot Eden Prairie mall.

Ted Gonsior executive vice president of JLL stated that the mall is experiencing significant investment and a high level of inventiveness by its tenant stores.

According to Gonsior the long COVID-19 siege has stimulated a renewed desire in the consumer to have a brick-and-mortar life to go where goods can be seen and touched and to have a more social kind of shopping.

JLL reported the following news on Eden Prairie Center:

Von Maur solidified its 20-year presence at the mall by completing the purchase of the real estate pad for its mall location.

Scheels marked its first anniversary at the mall in July. The 250000-square-foot store covers nearly 22 acres or 25 percent of the entire Eden Prairie Center shopping complex.

Target completed a full-store remodel in early October. It includes an Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop concept.

JCPenney will remain open at the center. In 2020 JCPenney announced it would close several stores but decided to keep the Eden Prairie location open.

Hi-Five Sports Zone is a 20000-square-foot indoor sports facility that opened in the mall this past summer. It has basketball courts turf fields a multi-use court and a putting green. The facility offers sports programming in the form of camps classes birthday parties leagues and an after-school club.

Also JLL reports the signing of 30 tenant lease extensions within the last 12 months. Some of the shopping center’s recent lease extensions include Francesca’s Bath & Body Works Old Navy Eddie Bauer Potbelly and Wildfire.

Gonsior noted that each tenant has a strategy. Apparently he said Von Maur purchased its real estate pad for greater control while Scheels is ground leasing its large space.

With a high level of staffing pressure Gonsior predicts center tenants will make fuller use of technology especially the retail apps.

Because of supply chain shortages he said tenants focus on the timing of purchases ensuring consumers have the full range of product selections they traditionally expect.

In a recent video for Vogue’s “Beauty Secrets” series Macpherson shared her must-have products and the techniques she uses for her daily skincare routine—which is truly special.

“When I was younger I didn’t even have a skincare routine"" Macpherson said in the video. ""I would go to work and the makeup artist would prep my skin for me so I didn’t have to worry. People used to laugh at me and say you need to take more care and I probably should have listened.”

Lymphatic drainage is a key part of her skincare routine

“For me circulation is key lymphatic draining is really important...you got to move those toxins out of your body or it will show on your skin” said Macpherson. To remove the toxins she uses two different methods: A dry body brush or a gua sha body tool ( ).

“I have a steam most nights and while I’m in there my body is sweating so I’ll put oil on and then use this body guy sha the same way as I use the lymphatic drainage brush” Macpherson explains. She then uses the body gua sha in back and forth motions up her arms and all the way up to her shoulders giving herself a gentle massage as she goes.

When applied topically this humectant (hyaluronic acid) acts like a tiny sponge holding up to a thousand times its weight in water and pulling it to the skin’s surface to quench and plump said Joshua Zeichner M.D. director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City for a previous interview for Prevention.com. “It is commonly used as an ingredient in moisturizers because of its hydration benefits and can even help plump the skin to improve the appearance of fine lines” he explains.

Her facial moisturizer also targets mature skin concerns

“I love a rich moisturizer...so I use this one the . Crafted with a unique biomimetic formulation that mimics that skin’s natural barrier and strengthens the outside layer this advanced face cream works like magic.

Designed specifically for mature skin it also includes special plankton biopolymers that help to visibly plump and promote firmer skin.

She applies a small amount of foundation to even out her complexion

“Gucci Westman has some wonderful clean products” said Macpherson. She uses the and a small flat makeup brush to apply the product under her eyes around her nose and on any other spots that need coverage.



Made with nourishing ingredients like vegetable-derived squalene and berryflux vita this foundation helps to create a medium to full coverage finish that looks fresh and youthful. The formula also helps to combat redness and soothes the skin.

As part of the initiative each customer shipping a package at one of the UPS Expo 2020 counters will have a tree planted in their honor.

In addition UPS will mitigate any carbon dioxide (CO2) by purchasing carbon offsets for each package. These shipments will be acknowledged with a digital carbon neutral certificate including the specific details of the carbon footprint and the offset purchased.

The Forest of the Future initiative is part of The UPS Foundation’s global commitment to climate action and UPS’s wider role as the Official Logistics Partner of Expo 2020.

Customers will be able to select where they want to have their tree planted from countries in the Indian subcontinent Middle East Africa and Asia including the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Japan. Part of The UPS Foundation’s pledge to plant 10000 trees through the Forest of the Future will include 750 trees planted in the UAE by Oct. 16. Additionally 2025 trees will be planted in Japan where the next World Expo will be held in 2025.

“Through our partnership with Expo 2020 UPS is elevating our sustainability initiatives and ensuring we leave a positive lasting legacy in the communities we serve” said Laura Lane chief corporate affairs officer. “As part of that effort our Forest of the Future initiative will improve overall air quality by reducing carbon dioxide through our tree plantings.”

UPS recently released its Corporate Sustainability Report with a goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 including fueling 40% of ground operations with alternative fuels by 2025.

The joint effort seeks to create a pipeline of qualified aircraft maintenance technicians to answer the growing needs of the aviation industry. ST Engineering and UPS will work together on a skills progression program which will provide on-the-job training to prospective aviation technicians.

“With successful completion of all required training and skills progression these employees could be eligible to interview for a job with UPS” said Brian Beasley ST Engineering’s Director of Marketing and Sales for the Pensacola and Mobile operations.

“It allows a pipeline for individuals to come to ST Engineering” he added. “But it also creates a pipeline for UPS for trained mechanics that are trained in this hangar on UPS equipment for their manuals and their maintenance requirements.”

This is the first such initiative between an airline and MRO [Maintenance Repair and Overhaul] service provider which offers training and career opportunities to individuals seeking work in aircraft maintenance. Beasley concedes that this approach is a bit creative.

Dave Dunwoody WUWF Public Media

“In the labor market — as you all well know — has been a little bit touch-and-go for the past couple of years where we’ve had to struggle; but in spite of COVID by 2030 the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that AMT [aviation maintenance] jobs will grow by 11%” said Beasley. “And there will be 14000 new jobs added each year over the next 10 years.”

Participants recruited for the program will undergo three years of on-the-job accelerated trade and skills training dedicated to UPS aircraft work. It will feature levels of apprentices mechanics and technicians.

“I’ll just share some statistics on why we’re doing this and why is it important for us to go on this journey” said Stephen Lim President of ST Engineering Aerospace America. He shared with the audience some numbers behind the need.

“From the latest Boeing report in the next 20 years this industry will require 670000 mechanics worldwide” Lim said. “The U.S. alone will require 190000.”

And one of the main dilemmas the aviation maintenance industry is facing is that the workforce ain’t getting any younger.

“With the early retirement post-COVID the average age of an aviation professional in [the U.S.] is 51 years old; and in that group about 30% are 64 years old and older” Lim said. “We are going to get a tsunami coming at us if we do not do something by trying to get new entrants into the market.”

“So one of the benefits of hiring these new technicians from this program is it will shorten the initial learning curve when we bring them onto UPS; we can put ‘em on the ramp and they have a much better proficiency of what our requirements are and ready to go to work much faster” said Bill Moore Vice President for aircraft maintenance and engineering with UPS.

“Reliability is the core of our business; and our customers demand more and more from us every day” Moore said. “So we need a pipeline that these talented aircraft mechanics to help us serve our customers in the future. And UPS and ST Engineering have enjoyed a long and productive relationship and have developed a strong partnership that we’re very proud of.”

By the way the “International” part of the name Pensacola International Airport is derived from the cargo flights of UPS and other such carriers here who deliver globally.

“It’s groundbreaking it’s innovative; and obviously having that happen here in Pensacola is a real testament to our community and the companies that we have here” said Scott Luth President and CEO of Florida West the Panhandle’s economic development arm.

He adds that the success of aviation here is acknowledged by what he calls creative investments in the community.

“In seeing the growth from ST it always opens up those additional opportunities for growth” Luth said. “Whether in this particular sector or affiliated to aviation it just continues to tell everybody that Northwest Florida is a great place for aviation — no matter what size no matter what type — it really makes the difference.”

Ground was broken in July for a second hangar at ST in Pensacola with plans for two more hangars at the site adjacent to the airport.

She was 95.

Lynn was born in Kansas City Mo. and followed her mother into a musical career enrolling in the Kansas City Conservatory of Music when she was 5 years old. She had a long career in entertainment appearing in the United Service Organizations (USO) on Broadway and in films and television.

She was best known for her role as Thelma Lou Barney Fife’s sweetheart in “The Andy Griffith Show.” She appeared in 26 episodes of the series over a five-year span from 1961 to 1966 but only in a recurring role having still been under contract at the time to another series.

She continued acting after her stint on “Andy” with various movies and TV shows and reprised her role as Thelma Lou in the 1986 TV movie “Return to Mayberry” where Thelma Lou and Barney Fife finally tied the knot. She also appeared in several episodes of Andy Griffith’s later TV series “Matlock.”

She frequently visited Mount Airy taking part in the annual Mayberry Days celebration the latest of which was last month.

She retired from acting in 2006 and based on her fond memories of visits to Mount Airy and the small-town atmosphere decided to settle down there in 2007.

“It is so wonderful to have Betty one of the most important folks from ‘The Andy Griffith Show’ living here in Mount Airy where she can meet and greet fans regularly” Tanya Jones the executive director of the Surry Arts Council said back in 2016 as plans were underway for Lynn’s 90th birthday. “She’s been an enormous advocate for the arts and we wanted to show her how much she means to us.”

She was a frequent patron at The Loaded Goat a local restaurant named after a popular “Andy Griffith Show” episode where her birthday celebrations were often held. In addition to her Mayberry Days appearances she met with fans and signed autographs at the Andy Griffith Museum. She started that tradition back in 2010 and continued as her health permitted.

“Betty brought incalculable joy to the world not only through her many wonderful performances but also through her everyday kindness cheerfulness and friendliness. And make no mistake she also had true grit” said Jim Clark in a statement.

Clark has written several books about the show and is the head of the Andy Griffith Show Rerun Watchers Club the largest Andy Griffith show fan club.

“Thelma Lou was Barney Fife’s true love but Betty herself was a genuine sweetheart to all who knew her” Clark said. “She was exceptionally generous with the time she spent visiting with fans many of whom became good friends. She was devout in her faith and she was a genuine blessing to us all. What Barney said about Thelma Lou also applies to Betty: ‘She’s the cat’s!’ I’m really going miss her.”

Fans expressed their sympathies on social media after hearing of her passing with hundreds of comments posted on The Andy Griffith Show Rerun Watchers Club website.

“So thankful for the memories we were able to have with her” wrote Sandra Blain. “A dear lady for sure!”

“Rest in peace sweetie” wrote Danny Goodman. “You will never be forgotten. Now in Mayberry Heaven with the rest of them.”

Ted Williams who met her twice in person at the Andy Griffith Museum wrote that “She was a kind warm-hearted lady. She now will be able to join her friend from the show Don Knotts. Rest in Peace.”

An announcement of her death said that “she is survived by several cousins many cherished friends and countless adoring fans. Betty’s performances as Thelma Lou and in other roles will continue to entertain generations of appreciative audiences. More than that all who ever encountered Betty are forever grateful to have known such a truly beautiful soul.”

A private burial service is planned in Culver City Calif. and a memorial service will be announced at a later date.

In lieu of flowers donations in her memory can be made to the Betty Lynn Scholarship Endowment for students pursuing a career in dance or acting; to the Barbara and Emmett Forrest Endowment Fund for the Andy Griffith Museum and Mayberry Days both in care of Surry Arts Council P.O. Box 141 Mount Airy NC 27030; or to Holy Angels Roman Catholic Church 1208 N. Main St. Mount Airy NC 27030; or to a charity of the donor’s choice.

Delivering a keynote address during the Session on “Opportunities in Aerospace Defence and Space Sector of Karnataka” at Dubai Expo 2020 here on Sunday the Large and Medium Industries Minister Murugesh Nirani said the state has great potential in these sectors.

“Karnataka apart from being India’s largest Aerospace cluster is also the second-largest producer of Heavy Electrical machinery in India. Bengaluru alone produces around 60% of machine tools in India. Our State is also the second-largest chip design hub in the country. We have set up a Center of Excellence in partnership with Dassault Systems to provide industry-ready manpower” Nirani said.

Highlighting the thriving small-scale industries many of which are auxiliary to the aerospace and defence sector minister Nirani said the state is providing a support system to push these sectors. “Karnataka has a strong base of around 2000 SMEs that carry out niche sub-contracting work in the Aerospace & Defence sector. Therefore the well-developed support system for the sector has further facilitated the expansion of this industry while also attracting the global players to set up their base in our state” Nirani added.

The minister lauded the Dubai Expo 2020 for providing a forum for states business leaders and other stakeholders to meet interact and collaborate. “I am confident that the dialogues and exchange of ideas that started on this platform will continue and translate into wonderful results for us to witness. I am positive that the upcoming Indian start-ups will learn from the experiences of the seasoned players and use their journey as the guiding path for their decisions in the future” Nirani expressed.

The minister who is keen to make most of the event in his packed schedule wooed the business leaders to make investments in Karnataka by briefing about the business ecosystem and excellent opportunities in the state.

Thom Hart­mann author of The Hid­den His­to­ry of Amer­i­can Health­care was in a sim­i­lar mood when he wrote the pref­ace to his book estab­lish­ing that his pub­lish­er had said no changes could be made to it after Novem­ber 3rd 2020 despite being set to be released in Spring 2021.

“If Don­ald Trump was reelect­ed or some­how man­aged to remain pres­i­dent after Jan­u­ary 20 2021 then we must take to the streets. This is most like­ly democ­ra­cy’s last stand” Hart­mann wrote trapped as he was behind the shroud of the past await­ing an election.

Any­way we know what hap­pened instead. After four years of repeat­ed­ly sig­nal­ing that he would try to dis­re­gard the result of the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion if he lost in the fall of 2020 Trump did exact­ly as he had said.

Now with the pow­ers of pres­i­dent he pres­sured state offi­cials to get him the votes he need­ed to call him­self win­ner of the Elec­toral Col­lege includ­ing chang­ing the totals hav­ing Repub­li­can state leg­is­la­tors just dis­re­gard the pop­u­lar vote and suing every­thing every­where to fundraise and sow distrust.

When all that failed to effect the out­come he want­ed Trump called upon a pop­u­lar mob to come to the U.S. Capi­tol where he encour­aged them to lynch the vice pres­i­dent (then Mike Pence) and mem­bers of Con­gress that were in the process of affirm­ing Joe Biden’s pres­i­den­tial victory.

The flaws in asym­met­ric media polar­iza­tion have nev­er been stark­er than watch­ing how “the lib­er­al media” has failed to treat a vio­lent attempt­ed coup with the same lev­el of inter­est it did a Demo­c­ra­t­ic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date’s pri­vate email serv­er or the fruits of a Russ­ian email hack of a nation­al polit­i­cal organization.

Now that is a lot of intro­duc­tion for a book that is short­er than two hun­dred pages and short­er even than that giv­en that it’s a 5“x7” paperback.

Hart­mann moves quick­ly. He spends the first sec­tion of the book describ­ing how bad the U.S. health­care sys­tem is zero­ing in on the deci­sion by Joe Lieber­man to join with Sen­ate Repub­li­cans in killing the Patient Pro­tec­tion Act’s pub­lic option and what that result­ed in: a Rube Gold­berg machine that still kills and bank­rupts peo­ple so insur­ance com­pa­nies can make prof­its and pay­out bonuses.

After about forty pages Hart­mann piv­ots to go back to the ori­gins of Amer­i­ca’s sick­ness-for-prof­it sys­tem con­trast­ing the path of the Unit­ed States with that of Impe­r­i­al Germany.

And it’s here that the author’s warn­ing giv­en the ben­e­fit of hind­sight real­ly echoes loud­ly because Hart­mann describes the way Otto Von Bis­mar­ck the “Iron Chan­cel­lor” was the pri­ma­ry fig­ure in gov­ern­ment respon­si­ble for push­ing through Ger­many’s uni­ver­sal health­care sys­tem in the 1880s along with work­ers com­pen­sa­tion and old-age pensions.

This became the mod­el for the rest of Europe and lat­er East Asian lib­er­al democ­ra­cies. But the rea­son Bis­mar­ck arch-con­ser­v­a­tive Junker that he was pushed such mea­sures was because the prag­ma­tist had no oth­er choice.

Bis­mar­ck “did­n’t devel­op the pro­gram out of some enlight­ened sense of human dig­ni­ty or work­ers’ rights” Hart­mann writes.

“Work­ers in the streets pushed him to it.”

The Social Demo­c­ra­t­ic Par­ty of Ger­many was banned but they anar­chists and oth­er social­ists were still active and so threat­en­ing in their appeal to the peo­ple of Ger­many that a Pruss­ian min­is­ter in an auto­crat­ic regime felt com­pelled to mol­li­fy them and pre­vent revolution.

Although their explic­it rea­son­ing is much dif­fer­ent (e.g. “real Amer­i­ca”) reac­tionar­ies in the U.S. seem to have rec­og­nized this same dynam­ic much more than U.S. lib­er­als and the left. Decades of orga­niz­ing of week­ly polit­i­cal meet­ings (though they’d call it “church”) and yes also gobs of mon­ey have led to a moment where all sorts of unpop­u­lar ideas are able to dom­i­nate fed­er­al pol­i­tics. That was true even before politi­cians and mobs start­ed col­lud­ing to take over capi­tols and actu­al­ly this time I’m talk­ing about Ore­gon.

Because there is no “return to nor­mal” ever com­ing to us.

Of course unlike Ger­many the Unit­ed States had and has anti-Black­ness built in as a fun­da­men­tal struc­ture of soci­ety and government.

Hart­mann writes of how sci­en­tif­ic racists and one in par­tic­u­lar — Fred­er­ick Hoff­man — jus­ti­fied the con­di­tions of depri­va­tion and mis­treat­ment of Black Amer­i­cans at the end of the 19th cen­tu­ry by say­ing that with­out the “pro­tec­tion” of slav­ery Black Amer­i­cans would nat­u­ral­ly die out unless propped up by unnat­ur­al and ulti­mate­ly fruit­less health­care services.

When seg­re­ga­tion-in-the-law came to an end in the Unit­ed States in the 1960s and 1970s pub­lic ser­vices like swim­ming pools were sim­ply shut down or pri­va­tized rather than inte­grate. This spite­ful self-injur­ing hatred did and con­tin­ues to moti­vate many poor whites to work against their eco­nom­ic and bod­i­ly inter­ests. Because to them their “real inter­ests” are to main­tain their place in a racist hier­ar­chy and con­tin­ue receiv­ing the psy­cho­log­i­cal wages that pays out.

But for the rich who are also dis­pro­por­tion­ate­ly white there’s a lot of very real wages paid out to them too. And stock options. And bonuses.

You can make a lot of mon­ey off of ser­vices peo­ple need to stay alive and keep their fam­i­ly alive and you can use that mon­ey to “exer­cise your free speech rights” in influ­enc­ing politi­cians to think that the best thing for every­one is main­tain­ing a sys­tem where you keep mak­ing that mon­ey and they keep get­ting elect­ed. It is very hard to believe a sys­tem isn’t work­ing well when you see it work­ing well for you and those around you.

This is not an espe­cial­ly ambi­tious book I don’t think. Its pur­pose seems to be that it can be read in a sin­gle com­fort­able sit­ting and be under­stood while pro­vid­ing you with min­i­mal scaf­fold­ing nec­es­sary to make sense of health­care as an indus­try in the U.S. what’s wrong with it and how that could be fixed as oth­er nations have fixed some basic prob­lems. Hart­mann makes a com­pelling case for one sim­ple but counter-intu­itive solu­tion to U.S. health­care prob­lems: just have the gov­ern­ment buy the insur­ance companies.

At around $1 tril­lion it might sound prof­li­gate but is still just what the U.S. wastes in over­pay­ing for health­care every sin­gle year.

But this won’t come about by vot­ing and it won’t come about by sign­ing peti­tions or by per­mit­ted march­ing from here to there.

The days when those sig­ni­fied impres­sive orga­ni­za­tion­al acu­men imply­ing the abil­i­ty to accom­plish oth­er things has long since passed.

Instead we’ll have to start treat­ing our lives and health as valu­able as they actu­al­ly are and for whites start choos­ing that as a more impor­tant inter­est than racial sol­i­dar­i­ty that allows rel­a­tive priv­i­lege.

You want to believe we can man­age this after see­ing how dis­pos­ably our boss­es land­lords and gov­ern­ments have been will­ing to treat us and our health dur­ing COVID-19 but unfor­tu­nate­ly reac­tionar­ies in the Unit­ed States seem to be the ones with all the urgency and they’re cer­tain­ly under no mis­con­cep­tions that the tran­si­tions of pow­er in the future will be peaceful.

Like con­duct­ing a debate amid lin­ger­ing threats of polit­i­cal vio­lence or pub­lish­ing a book about health­care as you see signs of a coup hap­pen­ing out in the open it’s dif­fi­cult to talk about uni­ver­sal health­care as you’re watch­ing a fas­cist move­ment gain steam and be treat­ed as unse­ri­ous­ly as if no one learned any lessons since 2015.

But if we aren’t orga­niz­ing and mobi­liz­ing with suf­fi­cient seri­ous­ness to counter a vio­lent white nation­al­ist move­ment intent on seiz­ing con­trol of gov­ern­ment by force not only will we lose out on a chance to be bribed with uni­ver­sal health­care to mol­li­fy us we’re like­ly to lose a lot of oth­er things too.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC9wb3J0dWdhbC1jb3ZpZC0xOS12YWNjaW5hdGlvbi1yYXRlLXRydXN0LXB1YmxpYy1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1zeXN0ZW3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Portugal Is the World's Most Vaccinated Country Because Its Population Trusts Its Free Health Care System,"Last weekend Portugal placed first in the world for its COVID-19 vaccination rate with 85 percent of its population fully vaccinated. Its campaign has been a sensational success — and even more incredible given how poorly the country was dealing with the spread of the virus at the start of 2021. The Portuguese government currently led by Socialist Party prime minister António Costa has had a mercurial approach to the coronavirus. An early call for isolation and eventual lockdown in 2020 resulted in lower infection and mortality rates than many of its European neighbors. But following an easing of restrictions in the summer Costa found it hard to reimpose strict measures for the winter holidays. As the flux of people socializing and moving around the country increased so too did the case numbers. The situation was significantly worsened by the arrival of the delta variant at a time when health systems were particularly strained. By February 2021 Portugal had the highest COVID-19 infection and death rates in the world. As the crisis unfolded the Portuguese vaccination task force threatened to collapse after its leader — an executive at the Portuguese Red Cross — stepped down due to alleged “irregularities” with the system. In waltzed the program’s number two Vice Admiral Henrique Gouveia e Melo until then unknown to the wider public. As any cursory investigation into Portugal’s vaccination success will tell you Gouveia e Melo is the type of cool head needed in crisis situations. He swapped his vice admiral’s uniform for ordinary fatigues set deadlines got personally involved with distribution hiccups and was loudly critical of Portugal’s small but nonetheless disruptive anti-vaxxer movement. “Negationism and obscurantism are the true killers” Gouveia e Melo told journalists after a group of protesters accosted him outside a vaccination center in August. A few days later at another vaccination center he was received with a standing ovation by staff and patients. By the end of his “mission” in late September Gouveia e Melo was nothing short of a national hero. But for all his efforts Gouveia e Melo’s leadership alone can’t explain the stunning success of Portugal’s vaccination drive. Across the world similar efforts have been blighted by misinformation skepticism and infrastructural obstacles. England cradle of the first universal health care system the National Health Service started its vaccination campaign twenty days ahead of Portugal on December 7 2020. By May it had administered over 50 million doses among its 56 million inhabitants. At that point Portugal lagged far behind having provided 5 million jabs to a population of 10.3 million. But today the full vaccination rate in England only stands at around 68 percent while Portugal has raced ahead. And the discrepancy can’t just be blamed on Boris Johnson’s vacuous leadership.

Revolutionary Change To many the clearest explanation of the Portuguese success story is historical. Portugal has a publicly funded and universally accessible health care system born following the 1974 revolution that not only brought down the fascist dictatorship but also hurried in the creation of a welfare state. The establishment of the Serviço Nacional de Saúde (SNS) and the ills it was able to eradicate is still very present in Portugal’s collective and political memory. According to nurse Mário Macedo “a population that until the 1970s–1980s saw illnesses like cholera diphtheria and polio and subsequently trusts vaccinations” contributed to the success of the coronavirus immunization campaign. This trust expands to the entire health care system which has now operated for over forty years. The geographical and financial accessibility of the SNS has allowed the Portuguese people to be particularly health-conscious and see health care as a social prerogative rather than a commodity. “The success of the vaccination campaign was the result of good public health policies trust in vaccines and above all in health professionals” pharmacist Rita Miguel told me. “There is still a substantial part of the population that will not just Google out things but go to the doctor or the pharmacy to clarify doubts.” Fellow nurse André Beja echoed this sentiment adding that Portugal’s “high vaccination coverage” prior to COVID-19 contributed to the high engagement of the Portuguese population this time around too. The vaccination rate for once-devastating epidemics such as measles and rubella stands at 95 percent — one of the highest in Europe. The nurse who has been personally involved in the vaccination drive said that “over the four decades of history of the SNS primary care has implemented measures ensuring that either by raising awareness among parents when they take their children to a routine appointment or by regularly checking compliance with the vaccination schedule of adults on different occasions Portugal now has a high vaccination coverage.” As a result “adults and the elderly are especially aware of the evolution of health indicators in this period with a reduction in the incidence of certain diseases and of the morbidity and mortality episodes associated with them.” As a health professional Beja said the experience had been personally “very remarkable on many levels.” He has tweeted about his many conversations with patients on the vaccination chair.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzRhNmY1NjAzLTRmZmQtNGMzZi04ZmM3LTNjZDViYTg5ZmFhYtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How a public-private partnership helped Mexico fight Covid,"Print this page

It was one of the more unconventional ways to deliver healthcare. In just 23 days business leaders medical experts and public officials came together to transform a giant convention centre on the outskirts of Mexico City into a world-class 424-bed coronavirus field hospital. Together they gave the Mexican capital a crucial additional weapon in fighting the pandemic at its peak.

In 14 months of operation from April 2020 the Temporary Covid-19 Unit in the Citibanamex conference centre treated more than 9000 patients who were seriously ill with coronavirus including nearly 2600 in critical condition. All but 342 survived — a success rate which was the envy of many established Mexican hospitals.

Patients benefited from access to the latest drugs and treatments to fight coronavirus such as high-flow oxygen therapy and sophisticated diagnostics — the hospital had its own testing laboratory. Nobody paid for their stay: the $76m cost of setting up equipping and running the hospital was met by a private sector consortium. Two-thirds came from foundations created by Latin America’s wealthiest man Carlos Slim. Mexico City authorities provided the medical personnel.

What was most remarkable was the close teamwork between the public and private sectors in a region where healthcare is often sharply divided between underfunded state-provided services of uneven quality and expensive high-quality treatment offered to those with money.

“Something the private sector has is efficiency and autonomy in decision-making” says Rafael Valdez who led the Mexico City hospital’s medical team. “The public health sector can learn from the private sector’s experience and capacity to innovate. For the private sector this was an opportunity to draw closer to the city government with something of common benefit.”

Coronavirus has hit Latin America particularly hard. With only 8 per cent of the world’s population the region has suffered almost a third of all deaths. The reasons are complex including high levels of urban poverty and labour informality. But part of the explanation is to be found in the region’s weak healthcare systems.

“Most healthcare systems in the region are significantly underfunded” says Panos Kanavos associate professor of health policy at the London School of Economics and co-author of a study on Latin American healthcare. “Most claim to have universal health insurance . . . but services are fragmented or people don’t have access to them. The only countries which are relatively well-funded are Costa Rica and Uruguay.”

Spending on health was just $1025 per person in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2017 — a quarter of the average in OECD countries when adjusted for purchasing power according to a 2020 OECD report. Exacerbating the divide between rich and poor only 59 per cent of Latin American health spending came from governments and compulsory health insurance; the remainder was covered by private insurance or out-of-pocket payments.

Jeremy Veillard senior health specialist for Latin America at the World Bank says that as well as patchy coverage and limited access to healthcare quality is a significant issue. “The gaps in quality are so large that we’re going to need a mobilisation of all the actors — public and private sector — to bridge those gaps.”

The way healthcare providers are paid in Latin America exacerbates the problem because payment models are generally based on fees for services provided. “There are very few incentives to adjust payment for the achievement of better clinical outcomes” Veillard adds.

Nonetheless he believes that private sector healthcare companies have an important part to play. “There is space for the private and public sectors to find complementary roles in a way which is inclusive and does not turn the private sector into providing services only to the wealthy” he says.

The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) estimates that more than $150bn needs to be invested in hospitals health centres and medical equipment in Latin America to bring them up to international standards. “We strongly believe the private sector is key for financing these challenges” says Cristina Simón head of social infrastructure at the IDB’s private sector arm.

The IDB has been promoting public-private partnerships to help build hospitals and clinics: the private sector builds the facilities and runs them on a long-term contract which is supervised and funded by the public sector.

“According to a study done in Chile the facilities cost 22 per cent less . . . and are completed 35 per cent faster” Simón says.

Not everyone is convinced though. Maria José Romero a policy and advocacy manager at the European Network on Debt and Development has co-authored a paper criticising PPPs in Latin America.

“Universal access to healthcare can’t be guaranteed by market forces and dynamics” she says. “Even in cases where the private sector provides high quality services someone will have to pay for this and there is a high risk of excluding those who can’t pay.”

IDB Invest’s Simón says the key to ensuring successful PPPs lies in the public sector preparing the contracts properly and points out that they are now being used or about to be used in Chile Brazil Peru Mexico and Colombia.

Another way in which the private sector has helped during the pandemic is in innovating and spreading telemedicine using online consultations and diagnostics to benefit those on low incomes or in far-flung communities. “This has come to stay . . . it is huge” she says.

Valdez has now returned to the private sector after running the field hospital and works for Pfizer. One of the most important legacies of the Mexico City project he says was a detailed set of instructions explaining how to set up a field hospital at short notice.

“In future if there is a major earthquake or pandemic you can convert spaces like this easily” he says. “It’s a complete operations manual open to everyone”.

Of the pioneering facility that harnessed private and public resources to save lives at a critical moment Valdez says simply: “This has been the most important experience of my professional life.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlYWx0aC5vcmcudWsvZmVsbG93L2FubmUtbWFyaWUtYm94YWxs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Anne-Marie Boxall,"About me

El deportivo siempre ha sido uno de los modelos más vendidos pero la llegada de la berlina eléctrica lo ha puesto contra las cuerdas.

Si en primavera la distancia apenas era de 61 unidades entre uno y otro durante el primer trimestre del año -el Taycan había registrado 9.072 unidades frente a las 9.133 del 911- hoy se ha dado la vuelta la situación. Los informes internos de Porsche hechos públicos permiten apreciar que el Taycan la berlina deportiva ha registrado 28.640 unidades en lo que llevamos de año y durante el segundo año completo del modelo en el mercado frente a las 27.972 unidades del nuevo 992.

El Porsche 911 sucumbe en sus ventas ante el Taycan la berlina eléctrica

Los pedidos del Porsche Taycan crecen más que los 911

Unas cifras que suponen un aumento del 10% lo que demuestra el éxito del primero de los modelos eléctricos de la marca y del que Detlev von Platen director de marketing y ventas de Porsche ha señalado que «los libros de pedidos están bien llenos y llegamos finales de año llenos de optimismo y entusiasmo por la acción». El ranking lo completan el Cayenne siendo el más exitoso con 62.451 unidades entregadas y seguido del Macan con 61.944 unidades aumentando las cifras un 12% en el caso del SUV más grande.

Los 718 Boxster y 718 Cayman han sumado un total de 15.916 unidades tan solo un 1% más que el año anterior mientras que las de la berlina deportiva el Panamera se sitúan en 20.275 unidades. En suma las cuentas de Porsche culminan con 217.198 unidades fabricadas y entregadas en todo el mundo durante los tres trimestres de este año suponiendo un aumento del 13%. Por países el mayor éxito comercial se ha alcanzado en Estados Unidos con un 30% más.

La caja de Porsche está más llena que nunca y eso que la firma está acusando la crisis de los microprocesadores que está azotando a las marcas y a la que ha decidido enfrentarse seriamente para no aumentar los tiempos de entrega. Además la marca trabaja en una actualización de los principales productos de la gama con una gran novedad para 2022 y en la que se confía para seguir aumentando las cifras en positivo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlzdGFpbmZvcmV0YWlsLmNvbS9ub3RpY2lhZGV0L2xhcy12ZW50YXMtZGUtbnVldmEtcGVzY2Fub3ZhLWNyZWNlbi11bi0xMi85OGFjYTZhYjM2MWExYThlZWI1MWVkZDZkNmUxMjdiYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las ventas de Nueva Pescanova crecen un 12%,"1. ¿Qué son las cookies?

(Here are some of the best iPhone 13 deals around.) AT&T came out of the gate essentially giving away the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Mini for a starting price that can go as low as ""free"" to new and existing customers. Verizon later effectively matched that offer while AT&T bumped its deal to also allow for a free iPhone 13 (and will also offer $1000 off the iPhone 13 Pro Max with qualifying trade-ins too).

T-Mobile is similarly offering all three devices for free to both new and existing customers.

In all cases there are plenty of caveats. It all depends on the phone model you're trading in the wireless plan you have and the financing.

AT&T/Screenshot by CNET

The iPhone 13 models are now available (already backordered in some cases). To help you avoid having to comb through the fine print we've outlined the key details on the three carriers' respective trade-in offers.

Note: These deals don't include taxes in their prices which are often based on the full price of the phone. Some carriers may also charge a one-time activation or upgrade fee (usually around $30) as well.

Sarah Tew/CNET AT&T iPhone 13 offer Potentially a free iPhone 13 Pro 13 or 13 Mini on unlimited plans The deal only applies to those with an unlimited plan and a 36-month installment plan.

You also must have an eligible trade-in that's in good working condition. The iPhone 11 and 12 lines (and XS Max) as well as recent phones like the Samsung Galaxy S20 S21 Note 20 Google Pixel 5 and LG Wing are among the phones that can get the full discount on the iPhone 13 Pro.

Others like the iPhone X XS and XR Galaxy S10 line Pixel 4 line and OnePlus 8 line are among the phones able to get the iPhone 13 Mini for free. You can check how much your device is worth at AT&T's trade-in site.

As with other carrier deals you won't get the full value upfront with AT&T instead dishing the discount as a monthly bill credit for the next three years to keep you on its network. If you switch carriers or cancel service early you'll be responsible for the remaining balance on the phone. See at AT&T

Verizon/Screenshot by CNET Verizon iPhone 13 offer Potentially a free iPhone 13 Pro 13 or 13 Mini with certain plans Current and new Verizon customers can get an iPhone 13 Pro (128GB only) with select trade-in -- damaged phones included -- on a ""qualified"" unlimited plan.

Eligible plans include Play More Do More and Get More as well as the older Above Unlimited and Beyond Unlimited. Note: The line you are upgrading will need to be on one of these plans.

If you move your phone number to Verizon from another provider you can get up to $500 to ""help you switch carriers.""

Similar to AT&T's promo the trade-in credit (up to $1000) is applied in monthly installments over 24-30 months. The promotion credits will end if you leave Verizon or change your plan.

The exact value will adjust based on the phone you are buying and trading in. For the full $1000 on an iPhone 13 Pro you need to trade in an iPhone 11 Pro/11 Pro Max or iPhone 12 Pro/12 Pro Max.

The list is a bit wider if you want $800 off (for a free iPhone 13) or $700 off (for iPhone 13 Mini). Eligible phones here include the iPhone SE (2nd gen) iPhone X 11 12 Mini or 12. A large number of Android phones are also in this class including most Galaxy S phones (S9 or later) Note (Note 10 or later) Google Pixel (Pixel 4 or later including the 4A line) OnePlus 7 (or later) and LG and (V50 or later Velvet 5G UW and Wing 5G UW).

If you don't have a phone to trade-in you could in theory buy an iPhone SE (2nd gen) or Samsung Galaxy A42 5G. Both phones retail for $400 and Verizon will give you a trade-in value of up to $800 so long as you are buying a new iPhone and meet all the other listed requirements mentioned above.

Verizon will take broken phones including ones with busted screens but they can't have any battery damage. All trade-in devices will also need to have Find My features turned off.

More details are outlined in the release here. See at Verizon

Sarah Tew/CNET T-Mobile iPhone 13 Magenta Max offer Potentially a free iPhone 13 Pro 13 or 13 Mini if you have T-Mobile's top plan. T-Mobile is offering new and existing users up to $1000 on the iPhone 13 Pro $800 on the iPhone 13 and $700 on the iPhone 13 Mini with an eligible trade-in but you will need to have its top Magenta Max unlimited plan and buy directly from them.

Older top plans from T-Mobile or Sprint are also eligible. For older T-Mobile plans this includes Magenta Plus or One Plus. For Sprint this includes Sprint Max Plus or Premium Unlimited.

Credits from the trade-in will be distributed over the course of 30 months. If you leave T-Mobile before then you will forfeit whatever is left and need to pay off the balance owed on the phone.

For the $1000 off you will need to purchase an iPhone 13 Pro or Pro Max and trade in an iPhone 11 Pro or 11 Pro Max or an iPhone 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max.

The list is a bit broader for the ""up to $800 off"" list. Eligible phones here include the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini iPhone 11 and iPhone X/XR/XS/XS Max. You can also trade in a variety of Android phones including the Galaxy S20 and S21 lines Note 10/Note 20 lines Motorola Razr 5G and OnePlus 8 5G and 8T 5G.

Older devices can get up to $400 off a new iPhone. Full details can be found by clicking on Terms and conditions for the deal on T-Mobile's website. It is also worth noting that T-Mobile has added a new Magenta Max iPhone upgrade program it calls Forever Upgrade that will guarantee you ""up to $800"" back (up to $700 for the Mini or less if you're buying an iPhone 12 today) in future trade-in credits. The catch here: You will need to wait two years to trade in the iPhone 13 or iPhone 12 that you're buying today to get the credits and you will need to be on Magenta Max for the entire time. Those with other T-Mobile plans can get up to $500 off but you will need to trade in an iPhone 11 Pro or 11 Pro Max or an iPhone 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max to get that discount. Those with older devices can get up to $400 offer with full details available by clicking on the ""On us with Magenta Max with trade"" link on T-Mobile's product pages. See at T-Mobile

The foundation raised more than $215000 to support its work on behalf of the city’s 12 public libraries. The foundation’s 25th anniversary and the Long Beach Public Library’s 125th anniversary were also celebrated.

During the reception the 320 guests dined on gourmet foods donated by local wineries restaurants and caterers with wine pairings selected by Randy Kemner of The Wine Country. Following the reception guests were guided into MoLAA’s outdoor sculpture garden for dinner at sunset and live music by contemporary Bossa Nova singer Caro Pierotto.

Guests were greeted by Library Foundation Interim Executive Director Kathy McCarrell board President Lissette Flores and 2020 board President Sharon Weissman. Cordelia Howard the director of Library Services from 1983 to 1998 gave a heartwarming speech about founding board member Margaret Durnin. In 1996 Durnin and fellow founders Bob Kilpatrick Helena Belisle and Robert Campbell formed the Library Foundation.

Both Durnin and Howard were honored by a champagne toast and presented with proclamations from Rep. Alan Lowenthal state Sen. Lena Gonzalez Assemblyman Patrick O’Donnell Supervisor Janice Hahn Mayor Robert Garcia and Councilwoman Suzie Price.

Over the past 25 years the Library Foundation has raised more than $25 million to support technology programs and resources at the city’s public libraries.

The evening continued with a presentation of the 2021 Library Leadership Award to Vice Mayor Rex Richardson. Library Foundation Directors Emeriti Rick Alsagoff and Mary Hancock Hinds and Library Foundation and board President-elect Ryan Ballard congratulated Richardson on his award. Durnin and her husband Dr. Charles Durnin presented Joseph Prevratil with the 2021 Durnin Family Award for his dedication to libraries and literacy. As a director emeritus Prevratil has remained engaged in Library Foundation activities and serves on the Legacy Committee.

Since 2019 Sean Reilly has been the Special Events Committee chair.

Reilly acknowledged his brother film producer Dan Reilly for donating his time and resources to produce a short and inspirational film that was shown during the event. Following this guests excitedly raised their paddles to contribute more than $60000 during the live auction and live ask.

Event sponsors included the Port of Long Beach Tamara Achauer and Terry Hodel the Durnins and Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Brad Levi announced the Marathon Los Angeles Refinery company’s recent $60000 grant to the Library’s Mobile Studio STEAM education resources.

Paul Kaminski executive director of the foundation then made an appeal for their $20 million dollar comprehensive campaign “Funding Our Future” to support students now and in years to come.

“You in the audience are the difference makers for our students” he said “and they need your help!”

Each guest left with an envelope of information on how to participate in the campaign. Although the evening is not traditionally a fundraiser $12000 was generated for the Alumni Endowed Scholarship which will help support current students.

LBCC’s Interim Superintendent/President Mike Munoz and Board of Trustees President Uduak-Joe Ntuk conducted the induction ceremonies. Honorees gave testimonials to the value of the education they received at LBCC. Each story told of a struggle from humble beginnings to the Hall of Fame.

How to avoid and report the latest schemes,"If you're getting random messages from ""AT&T"" to claim a free perk or ""FedEx"" with alerts for an incomplete delivery you may be tempted to click the link for more information. Don't do it. These messages may seem real especially if you have service with the provider that seems to be messaging you.

But before you get excited about your ""reward"" there are a few red flags to watch out for. Paying attention to these warning signs can protect your personal data and lower your risk of fraud from scam texts. Scammers are using trusted company names links and urgency to steal your information after you click the link in a text message. The messages are expected to continue even though wireless carriers submitted plans to stop robocalls. But that doesn't include the workaround for spammers to send texts. In fact Robokiller's August report predicts 86 billion spam texts to be sent this year.

It's scary to think about accidentally clicking the link or responding ""STOP"" (which you should be careful doing). One wrong move can be what criminals need to steal your data. But don't worry. We'll tell you what you can do now to help keep your personal data secure. Here's the latest on the Federal Communications Commission's plans to stop robocalls and how to use Apple's Hide My Email feature to keep your email free of spam. This story was recently updated.

First never open the link

Scammers are tricky. They'll send messages that appear to be from a legitimate company such as your wireless carrier bank or medical facility and include a link asking you to verify your account information. The link then takes you to a site that may look real but is actually fake. The object is to collect your username password and other personal information for future use.

If you receive an unexpected message that includes a link do not open it. If you happen to open it do not enter any account details or personal information.

Look at this fake Verizon site that was being used in phishing attempts as covered by How To Geek. The site looks real and even redirects to the official Verizon site after the nefarious actors have taken your account credentials. Scary stuff.

Don't click on links in spam messages and do some research before replying 'stop.' Jason Cipriani/CNET

Do research before replying with STOP

One common method of opting out of receiving non-nefarious spam texts (like that restaurant offering the free milkshake) is to reply to the message with ""STOP."" It can be a quick and easy way to end messages from everything from a political campaign to your internet service provider.

But scammers use this same tool to trick you into replying to their messages in turn letting them know that your phone number is valid and one they can target with more messages or robocalls.

Instead of quickly replying STOP to an unsolicited message take a few seconds to look up the number online to see if a recognized organization or business uses it for text messages.

I verified Comcast's number for example by searching for ""text from 266278"" after receiving a message a few weeks ago asking if I wanted updates about an outage in my area. Indeed the number I received the message from matched a number Comcast lists on its support page.

If you verify that a number is valid reply with STOP to remove yourself from their distribution list.

Report scam messages to your carrier. Jason Cipriani/CNET

Report a bad message to your carrier

If you can't verify who sent a message or it's clearly a scam you can forward the message to 7726 (it spells ""spam"" on a phone's keypad).

AT&T Sprint  T-Mobile and Verizon all accept spam reports through this number. You may receive a follow-up message after reporting a message asking for more information or to confirm the number the original message was sent from.

Some carriers such as Sprint will even block the number from messaging you after you've reported it.

Use your phone's built-in blocking tool

Another option is to block the number yourself. Both iOS and Android have built-in tools to block messages and calls from specific numbers.

You can always block the number. Screenshots by Jason Cipriani/CNET

iPhone users

On an iPhone open the message in the Messages app and tap on the profile photo at the top then tap on the Info button. On the next screen tap on the phone number followed by Block this Caller at the bottom of the next screen.

Following those steps will block the number from both messaging and calling you.

Google Messages will take extra steps to analyze and identify spam. Screenshots by Jason Cipriani/CNET

iOS users can also filter out unknown senders to automatically sort through unknown numbers by toggling on the Filter Unknown Senders in your settings for Messages.

Android users

As is usually the case with Android phones  the process to block a number will vary depending on who makes your phone and which message app you're using.

If you're using Google's Messages app start by opening the spam message then tapping on the menu button in the top-right corner and selecting Details from the list of options. On the following screen select Block & report spam followed by OK. The Messages app will send the number and the 10 previous messages from it to Google for analysis to improve future spam detection. Your replies to the number are not sent to Google. If you'd rather just block the number uncheck the box next to ""Report spam"" before tapping OK.

Samsung Messages users will need to open the conversation tap on the three-dot menu in the top-right corner and select Block number > Block.

If you are routinely annoyed file a report with the FCC. Angela Lang/CNET

Download an app block spam messages

There are a few apps that can limit spam text messages. TextKiller is an app powered by Robokiller to automatically filter out messages that would be considered spam using Smart Blocking. The app now also works with Apple Watches to help filter spam messages. You can also add phone numbers and keywords that you want to block.

File an FCC complaint to help stop spam texts

If you want to help combat current and future spam messages and you're in the US you can file a complaint with the FCC whenever you receive a message that falls into one of these categories:

An unsolicited commercial text message

An automated message sent to your phone without your prior consent

Selective focus. Macro. Concept.

The buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) industry is booming but keeping abreast of all the players in the industry is far from easy.

And it’s not getting any easier. Thanks to Covid-19 online shopping has grown in popularity and as a result so has the BNPL space.

The BNPL industry is expected to keep growing to be worth $166bn by 2023 according to GlobalData’s thematic research. Looking further ahead it could even reach a valuation of $3.98tn by 2030 according to Allied Market Research. In other words: it’s time to start taking BNPL businesses more seriously.

“This increase in usage of BNPL payment methods has put providers in a prime position to be considered as much more than a feature but a business model that the financial ecosystem needs to take seriously and consider how they implement or work cohesively alongside” Al Lukies founder and CEO of banking software company Pollinate tells Verdict.

Despite most of the companies in this sector not making a profit it’s clear that instalments services is a multi-billion industry. No wonder then that the sector is growing crowded.

Not only are BNPL companies like Swedish quadradecacorn Klarna making headlines but bigger players like PayPal Block and as rumour has it even Apple are muscling into the sector as well.

So keeping track of all the different companies in the sector is no mean feat. But don’t worry we’ve got you covered.

Addi

Addi is one of Latin America’s newest BNPL providers. Launched in 2018 the Bogota-based business secured $75m in a Series B funding round in September 2021. Greycroft led the round. While Addi didn’t reveal its valuation it will use the money to fuel expansion plans in Brazil Colombia and Mexico. It will face stiff competition from other BNPL industry companies such as Mexican rival Nelo and other fintech companies peddling their own instalment solutions in the region.

Affirm

Affirm is a San Francisco-headquartered company. This early entrant into the BNPL industry was founded in 2012 by PayPal’s first CTO and founder Max Levchin together with a small group of fellow co-founders. Affirm is available in the US and all US territories with a few exceptions. The company went through an initial public offering (IPO) in January 2021. Having inked a partnership with Amazon in August Affirm delivered a strong fourth quarter for the financial year. Despite announcing a jump in quarterly revenues to $261.8m Affirm said it was not expecting to make a profit in 2022. Nevertheless the quarterly result saw Affirm’s shares skyrocket and at the time of writing it is trading on the Nasdaq with a $28.9bn market cap.

Afterpay

If there is one big rivalry of note in the BNPL space it’s that between Klarna and Afterpay. Soon after Klarna entered Australia Afterpay’s home market in 2020 the two companies’ CEOs engaged in a very public spat. They essentially accused each other of taking advantage of merchants. There have been few signs that the rivalry has improved since.

Launched in 2014 Afterpay has since expanded to offer instalment services in the United States New Zealand and the United Kingdom where it trades under the ClearPay brand. In August payment processing company Block announced that it had reached a deal to buy Afterpay for $29bn seemingly pushing the sector towards further consolidation.

In early January 2022 the Bank of Spain approved the deal meaning the deal is now fully unconditional. Afterpay estimates that the deal is now likely to close on February 1.

Apple

Apple may make most of its profits from smartphones but the iPhone maker has also established Apple Pay as a solid revenue stream over the years. Now it seems as if the iPhone maker may add BNPL services to its fintech solution. In July several media reports suggested that the Cupertino-headquartered tech giant could soon launch its own instalment solution. It had reportedly explored the idea together with Goldman Sachs. While there hasn’t been much movement on its own solution since in August Apple announced a new deal with Affirm. The partnership would see them bring a joint BNPL solution to Canada.

To be fair though Apple had already created a BNPL solution of sorts at least for its own products. It has long offered customers to divide the price of their purchases into monthly instalments.

Behalf

New York and Ra’anana-based Behalf was founded in 2011. Unlike the majority of companies on this list Behalf isn’t focused on consumers and online shoppers. Instead it’s carved out a niche for itself in the market by providing instalment solutions for businesses in the States. The B2B BNPL business has so far raised a total of $462m from investors like Visa. Its most recent round saw it cash in $19m in venture capital and $100m in debt financing according to GlobalData.

Biller

Biller is one of the newest entries into the BNPL space. The startup was launched in 2021 by former Mollie and Klarna executives. Just like Behalf Biller is a B2B BNPL provider. Its solution is designed to help smaller firms solve purchasing issues around risk and to boost their cash flow. The Biller solution is built in partnership with Slimmer AI a European B2B venture studio. The company is headquartered in Amsterdam.

Billie

German Billie was founded in 2016 after the founders split from UK-based B2B-financing startup Funding Circle with Billie founder Matthias Knecht citing “fundamental differences” as the reason behind their exodus. Like Billier Billie is making a name for itself by providing businesses with the smooth financing options consumers can expect from the likes of Klarna.

What gives Billie an edge is that it has not only launched a service similar to that of the Swedish fintech giant it has also actively partnered with it. Klarna was one of the investors behind Billie’s $100m Series C round round back in October 2021. The Scandi quadradecorn has also inked a partnership with Billie to integrate its services for its customers. “It’s a game-changer for us” Knecht recently told Verdict.

Since the launch in 2016 Billie has grown at a steady pace. Picking up a $11.79m Series A round in December 2017 and a $33.79m Series B round in July 2019 according to GlobaData‘s intelligence centre. With the $100m Series C round from October the company has raised close to $150m in total.

Bumper

Bumper claims to be something as unique as a profitable BNPL startup. In December 2021 Bumper raised a $12m Series A round and claimed that it had been profitable for the 18 months leading up to the cash injection.

The company provides a way for drivers to finance car repairs and maintenance. Focusing on this segment means Bumper customers normally do big one-off purchases and not repeat shopping solutions like the ones offered by other BNPL businesses like Klarna. Bumper CEO James Jackson told Verdict at the time that this leads to lower default rates.

Following the raise Bumper is now gearing up to expand outside of the UK and Ireland.

“Already a dominant player in the UK and Ireland we’re currently rolling out our product in Germany plan to launch in Spain and the Netherlands in the next three months and have ambitions to be in every major European market by the end of 2022” Jackson said.

Commonwealth Bank of Australia

Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) is one of Oz’s biggest banks. So when it announced in August that it would enter the BNPL market the news turned a few heads. The lender’s new BNPL platform is dubbed StepPay. It will offer eligible customers to split payments into four fortnightly instalments for transactions higher than A$100 ($71.1). As of the announcement 86000 customers had preregistered for the service.

Curve

UK-based Curve was founded in 2016. The self-described “financial super app” added a BNPL feature to its services in September 2021 – Curve Flex.

The service empowers Curve’s customers to pay later for almost any purchase made at any merchant from any card up to a year ago. Curve Flex was announced on the same day as neobank Monzo announced its BNPL service which was also called Flex. Curve made a point out of saying that it had tested the technology since September 2020 and that it had been accredited by the Financial Services Authority in September 2021.

Curve’s founder and CEO Shachar Bialick said: “Why settle for a rigid copy when you can have the real thing? Curve Flex is almost certainly the most flexible credit solution in the market. With no limitations on merchants and the ability to accommodate all Mastercard Visa and Discover cards Curve Flex will provide customers with access to easy and affordable credit.”

ePayLater

Mumbai-headquartered ePayLater was founded in 2015. It is part of India’s emerging fintech ecosystem. It offers zero-cost instant credit. The payments provider secured a $10m funding round in September 2021 from Zurich-based Responsability Investments AG Blue Ashva Capital Pravega Ventures and others.

humm by Flexifi

humm by Flexifi is a subsidiary of Australia-listed consumer finance company Hummgroup which was founded in 1988. Since its launch humm has grown popular in Australia where it claims to be the third biggest BNPL provider after Afterpay and Klarna. It has also launched its services in New Zealand Ireland and the UK. It targets customers making larger expenditures of up to A$30000 enabling customers up to 24 months to pay off the purchase.

Kissht

Founded in 2015 Kissht claims to be “India’s fastest credit lending app” despite GlobalData pointing out in recent funding round that it requires a fairly extensive customer information in order to open an account. It also offers BNPL online and in-store for 0% financing on purchases of INR5000 ($66.6 to INR500000. Terms range from one month up to 15 months although longer terms attract interest.

Klarna

Founded in 2005 by a group of Stockholm School of Economics students Klarna has clawed its way to the top of the BNPL industry. Klarna raised a $639m SoftBank-led investment round in June to strengthen its position in the market. The raise saw it achieve a $45.6bn valuation making it Europe’s most highly valued private tech company.

To date Klarna is available in several European countries North America Asia and Australia. While rumours about an IPO have been circulating for years the Swedish BNPL powerhouse hasn’t made any plans public.

The company is also increasingly marketing itself as an alternative to traditional credit cards. David Sandström Klarna’s chief marketing officer told Verdict in a recent interview that one reason for the BNLP sector’s huge expansion over recent years is customers simply having had enough of the raw deal offered by traditional credit card providers.

“Credit card companies have made an astounding amount of money by essentially cheating and taking advantage of people with bad terms and conditions high rates and extremely disadvantageous interests” he said “What we’re seeing now is a whole generation abandoning credit cards. Roughly 70% of American millennials don’t have a credit card because they fear them more than they dread death according to some reports.”

Kredivo

Indonesian BNPL player Kredivo was founded in 2016. It has raised $310m in total over the years most recently through a $100m debt facility from Victory Park Capital in June. Boasting that it has almost four million customers Kredivo is now seemingly on the path to become the next BNPL company to go public.

Contrary to several other players on this list that floated via IPOs Kredivo announced in August that it planned to debut via a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings II. The SPAC is sponsored by Victory Park Capital. Kredivo also has plans to expand into Vietnam via a joint venture with family investment office Phoenix Holding.

Kueski

Kueski is a Mexican startup that provides microloan services to clients. Founded in 2012 Kueski Pay the startups BNPL service has gained more traction highlighting the growth of the industry. Today it has almost 1000 retail partners.

Laybuy

Laybuy was founded by husband-and-wife team Gary and Robyn Rohloff in 2016. The New Zealand-headquartered company has since expanded to the UK and Australia where it listed on the stock market in September 2020. It is currently trading at a A$127m market cap.

While the Rohloffs started with global domination plans Laybuy is yet to fully conquer the UK market. In May the company raised $27m to that end.

“There will be growth beyond the UK but for now all the focus is the UK” Gary Rohloff recently told RBI.

A big part of its strategy is the recent launch of its virtual card that enables customers to skirt the cumbersome tick-a-BNPL-solution-at-the-checkout routine and immediately get the full benefit of Laybuy’s pay-in-six instalments.

Limepay

Limepay is another Australian BNPL company to be aware of. Founded in 2016 Limepay offers what it describes as the nation’s only white label BNPL solution. What means is that it allows merchants to slap their own branding on the solution in their shops. So far it has raised $27m in total. While it was planning to go public in 2021 The Age reported in May that those plans could’ve been delayed due to the departure of one of the co-founders and investors growing weary of BNPL providers trying to replicate the success of Afterpay.

Lunar Bank

Lunar Bank is a Danish neobank. Just like other digital lenders like Chime Revolut and N26 it has so far made its winnings by providing traditional banking services via its app. However on the back of its $47.2m Series C funding round in October 2020 Lunar announced plans to launch a BNPL solution of its own. It stayed true to that promise by launching the feature Pay Later in December. While Lunar is certainly not one of the biggest players in the sector its foray into the BNPL space highlights how many companies recognise the lucrative opportunities of the market.

Mastercard

Payments goliath Mastercard launched its highly anticipated bnpl feature that gives fintechs the opportunity to include instalments in their offering in September.

Mastercard would initially roll out the new service in three markets: the US Australia and the UK. Mastercard Instalments as the BNPL service is called will enable banks lenders fintechs and digital wallet companies to offer various BNPL benefits including zero-percent interest and the common pay-in-four-goes model.

“Mastercard is definitely a serious threat for smaller BNPL companies” Theodore Delimaris research analyst at GlobalData told Verdict at the time. “Due to its size and global network of issuers and merchants it has a clear operational and cost competitive advantage.”

Monzo

2020 was not a great year for Monzo. The London-headquartered challenger bank struggled during the pandemic. In June it raised a £60m down round that cut its valuation from £2bn to £1.24bn. Some even speculated that fintech may go bust. The neobank later added new fees and announced a new premium offering to cover its losses. And then on 15 September Monzo announced that it would target the BNPL sector with its Monzo Flex product offering.

Monzo Flex can be used for online and in-person transactions of more than £30 in value. Specifically Monzo Flex will allow users to repay what they owe in three instalments. In addition customers can opt to repay in six and 12 instalments with interest levied at 19% APR.

Of course not everyone is optimistic about Monzo’s chances to steal market shares from bigger and more established players in the sector.

“It will be difficult for the bank to take a significant slice of business from the likes of Klarna or PayPal” Payl8r’s managing director Samantha Palmer said.

Mox

Hong Kong-based neobank Mox launched its own BNPL service this summer for its Mox Credit customers. Just like with similar offers Mox’s “Spilt purchase” feature would enable users to pay off payments in smaller instalments.

Nelo

Nelo was founded in 2019. The Mexico City-headquartered startup is the latest company muscling itself into the booming Latin American fintech scene. But unlike Brazilian digital lender Nubank or Uruguayan payments processing provider dLocal Nelo is doing it by joining the BNPL brigade. It is hoping to get the jump on rival firms by being a first-mover in the region. The startup secured a $3m seed funding round to that end in April 2021. Nelo has already signed deals with 45 merchants and has over 150000 users on its books.

OpenPay

OpenPay is yet another Australian BNPL company. The Melbourne-headquartered startup was founded in 2013. It has carved out a niche for itself by focusing on cash flow management of larger purchases between A$40 and A$20000 with plans ranging from two to 24 months. It other words; the service is similarly to that offered by humm by Flexifi. Following an abysmal IPO in 2019 OpenPay recovered some of its earnings along the online shopping boom of 2020. It’s currently trading at a $142m market cap.

Payl8r

Founded in 2014 Manchester-headquartered Payl8r is arguably the oldest BNPL provider in the UK. Despite its age it has yet to become a unicorn. That may change soon. Payl8r raised a £40m debt facility from Conister Bank this summer with the aim to pass the important $1bn mark within the next five years. It’s going to do so by tapping into younger customers’ cravings for new lines lines of credits.

“We are the opposite of banks we want to help millennials and we do so ethically and responsibly” Palmer said. “In effect we’re spearheading the death of the credit card and are proud to provide loans that can pay for the likes of educational courses that can lead to new job opportunities.”

PayPal

PayPal is another company that has realised the opportunities in the BNPL space. The San Jose-headquartered payment processing provider has spent the past year cutting out a slice for itself in the BNPL market. In August 2020 it launched its own instalments service in the States. It has since rolled out the offering across the pond. In September 2021 PayPal turned up the heat by announcing plans to acquire Japanese Paidy for $2.7bn. The acquisition would see the $338bn company signal just like Block’s Afterpay deal that market leaders are now hungry for bigger chunks of a market that has previously been dominated by pure BNPL providers.

Revolut

Like PayPal Monzo and Lunar Revolut is not a traditional BNPL player. The UK challenger bank was founded 2015. In July 2021 it became the UK’s most valued privately owned tech company after raising a $800m funding round at a $33bn valuation. Over the years it has been busy expanding its offering with premium cards cryptocurrency features and foreign transactions. Now it seems like it might be eying the BNPL space as well according to CEO Nikolay Storonsky who spoke with the Evening Standard. The features are expected to hit the market next year.

Santander

Following the turbocharged growth of the BNPL market European bank Santander seemingly feared it would miss out. So in late January 2022 Santander announced that it would launch its own BNPL app named Zinia. Like many other apps on this list Zinia will enable shoppers to split their purchases over monthly instalments interest-free. It plans to rollout its services across its different markets this year.

Ezequiel Szafir CEO of Santander’s Openbank online banking division bullishly claimed that by “the security and trust provided by a large financial group” would be the distinguishing factor that would enable Santander to “become a leader in the buy now pay later market.”

Scalapay

Italian Scalapay may be a new player in the BNPL space but it’s already making waves. The Milan-based venture was launched in 2019. It is operating in Italy France Germany Spain Portugal Austria Belgium the Netherlands and Finland. Despite its tender age Scalapay raised a $155m Series A round in September at a $700m valuation. It is backed by investors like Tiger Global Baleen Capital and Woodson Capital.

Sezzle

Sezzle was founded in 2016. Since then the Minneapolis-based company has listed in Australia and is reportedly planning to follow suit in the US. Despite having the same profitability problems as almost every other company in the sector investors have taken a shine to Sezzle. Having already expanded to the EU Oz and Canada the company also plans on tipping its toes into the Indian and Brazilian market.

“My aim is to go for big opportunities: low cost low risk opportunities” Sezzle CEO and executive chairman Charlie Youakim recently told RBI.

Simpl

Another Indian BNPL provider Simpl was founded in 2015. Its online checkout provides online stores to offer customers one-click checkouts and BNPL services. It has raised $26.7m to date.

Slice

Fintech startup Slice was founded in 2016 but has since become one of India’s youngest fintech unicorn. It claimed the its spot in the coveted $1bn+ valuation club in November 2021 after securing $220m Series B funding round. Tiger Global and Insight Partners co-led Slice’s funding round with Sunley House Capital Moore Strategic Ventures Anfa Gunosy Blume Ventures and 8i also participating in the raise.

tabby

Founded in late 2019 tabby may be a reasonably new face to the BNPL market. However as one of the early entries into the Middle East the Dubai-headquartered company could still make a mark. In August this year it secured a $50m cash injection from investors like Global Founders Capital and STV. On the back of the raise it achieved a $300m valuation. In September tabby was Sharia-approved in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The company claims to have secured partnerships with over 3000 global companies and SMEs.

Tamara

In April 2021 Checkout.com led a $110m investment into Saudi Arabian BNPL startup Tamara. The Series A round came on the back of a $6m seed funding cash injection from January. Like the other companies on this list Tamara gives users access to options like “pay in 30 days” or to “pay in three”. Today it is active in Saudi Arabia and in the United Arab Emirates.

Temenos

In January banking software company Temenos announced the launch of its own BNPL banking service. This offering will open up new revenue opportunities for banks and fintechs help them reach new markets and cement their relationships with both consumers and merchants through alternative credit products.

“In an extremely competitive market financial services providers need to evaluate new business models to drive revenue” said Max Chuard CEO of Temenos. “As the strategic technology provider for over 3000 banks worldwide we are committed to empowering our clients to pioneer and adopt those new profitable business models. Buy-now-pay-later has shown the industry that we can come up with new solutions to old problems. It has challenged the way we think about customer engagement acquisition and retention. We are very excited to launch this new solution to enable our clients to offer alternative financing that is fast seamless and scalable.”

Splitit

Splitit was founded in 2012 and has established itself as a BNPL venture separate from the pack.

While companies like Klarna and Afterpay lend the customers the full amount of a purchase at the checkout and then allow that purchase to be paid off in instalments Splitit lets users pay with an existing credit card holding the full amount on their card and taking an instalment each month. In other words: it uses existing cards to enable shoppers to split payments. The approach enabled it to grow by 307% in 2020 to $11.6m. The company followed up its success by inking a deal for a financing facility from Goldman Sachs in January. The lender committed a investment of up to $150m for a three-year term.

Having grown in the States thanks to its partnerships with Visa Mastercard and Stripe Splitit now has eyes on the horizon. It plans to expand further around the globe. In June it teamed up with Middle Eastern BNPL provider tabby. The partnership will help both companies grow in the region. Splitit is headquartered in New York and it listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2019. The company has an R&D centre in Israel and offices in London and Australia.

ZestMoney

ZestMoney is another Indian fintech that – much like many other BNPL providers on this list – first saw the light in 2015. ZestMoney claims to be “the largest and fastest growing consumer lending fintech company in India” and that its platform “can meaningfully improve the lives of more than 300 million households in the country who currently have no access to credit cards or any other formal financing options because of insufficient credit history.” ZestMoney raised $50m from Australian provider Zip in September 2021.

Zilch

Zilch is a BNPL startup straight out of London. Founded in 2018 the company exited out of stealth in August 2020. It differentiates itself from the likes of Klarna and Afterpay by not being reliant on signing partnerships with merchants before users can tap into its services.

“We bring the buy-now-pay-later experience directly to a client anywhere they like – online offline Amazon eBay Etsy Not On The High Street – rather than where we’ve gone and done deals and integrations because that for me is not the customers’ problem. That’s our problem” Philip Belamant founder and CEO of Zilch recently told Verdict.

It seems like a lot of pressure for high school athletes but the Bears call it a privilege.

“This is the most fun I’ve ever had playing sports” said Berkley senior Zackary Vigliotti. “I can’t imagine having a better season than we’re having right now.”

Berkley boys soccer is the best they’ve ever been and have broken several school records. They rode an 18-game win streak this season and in early October they were ranked first in the state and 21st in the nation.

“It’s not about me me me with any of these kids” said Berkley head coach Steve Wloszek. He’s in his 12th year as head coach and said this is one of the most fun seasons he has been a part of. “It’s about the team the team the team. They just want to win.”

The team has a simple mantra this season: Pressure is a privilege. The players echoed the sentiment laid out by Wloszek and say it’s a big reason why they’ve been able to find success this year.

“Pressure is a privilege” said Vigliotti. “Being high up in the rankings everyone wants to come after you but that means you have to go out there and perform. I like having the target on our back.”

“If you have the pressure that means you’re good enough to have it” said Jackson Swaninger. “Other teams are going to want to come out and beat you but we just hold our own and win.”

The Bears have 12 seniors this season 11 of which have played together since they were four-years-old. One of this team’s strengths is that they’re powered by their back line. Three of the team’s captains all of which are seniors are comprised of their goalie and two center defensemen. The Bears agree that perspective of the field from the back line supports a strong team leadership.

“We have strength throughout our team. There’s no weak link on our team” said Vigliotti. “The leadership comes from the back but that’s just because we’re seniors.”

The Bears want to continue their record-breaking season with a deep run in the playoffs. The team heads into the postseason with a 17-2-2 record. Those two losses suffered did snap their win streak but it also served as a lesson for this team.

“Everything that we’ve done so far it’s been crazy” said Berkley senior Ryan Serwa. “I don’t think anyone thought this would be the case but it’s not over yet. We still have the postseason.”

“I would’ve loved to stay undefeated but I think it’s important that we lost because we experienced that feeling and we don’t want to feel that again” said Vigliotti.

The Bears open the district tournament Tuesday in the semifinals against Detroit U-D Jesuit. Wloszek said it’s a tough district to get out of. Of all 468 teams in the state three of the top ten are all in Berkley’s district. Wloszek said a run this year would be extra special.

“I don’t think we want to be complacent and accept what we have done so far as the zenith of our season” said Wloszek. “These kids want more.

If so you can own a copy of the 1984 book The Dune Encyclopedia edited by Dr. Willis E. McNelly and containing all manner of Dune details you won’t find anywhere else.

This ultra-rare book long out of print is not only the source of arcane Dune knowledge but also Dune apocrypha.

Fans debate whether the book written as an in-universe reference text outlines the entire Dune canon. Here’s why the book is so rare and why it’s still controversial 37 years after it was first published. Mild spoilers for the Dune novels ahead.‌‌

The book that created the biggest Dune stir ever. Reddit/Berkley Books

The Dune Encyclopedia - explained

The Dune Encyclopedia is a “fictional non-fiction” reference book that claims to be edited by a character named Hadi Benotto in the year 15540 AG. (AG stands for “After Guild” meaning the time after the spacing guild was formed.)

In real life the book was compiled by an academic — and Dune fan – named Willis E. McNelly. Along with other vaguely credited contributors (there’s a cryptic bibliography in the back of the book) Willis’ The Dune Encyclopedia is what fanfiction would look like as a textbook.

Other sci-fi franchises — like Star Trek Star Wars and Doctor Who — tend to have reference books at least nominally approved by the creators of those franchises. But in 1984 Frank Herbert didn’t have much to do with creating The Dune Encyclopedia other than allowing it to be printed approving the text and writing a brief forward.

The cover promises “The Complete Authorized Guide and Companion To Frank Herbert’s Masterpiece of the Imagination.” But because the book was published in 1984 — one year before Chapterhouse: Dune came out — it doesn’t include any information from that Dune novel the last Herbert ever wrote.

Though he put his name on it Herbert damns the book with faint praise. In his very brief preface about three paragraphs long Herbert writes “As the first ‘Dune fan’ I give this encyclopedia my delighted approval although I hold my own counsel on some of the issues still be explored as the Chronicles unfold.”

Is The Dune Encyclopedia canon?

Although Herbert was fine with The Dune Encyclopedia while he was alive his estate was decidedly against it after his death in 1986. By 2000 the book was out of print; reprinting it was considered a not-for-profit pursuit. McNelly himself openly claimed he didn’t seek to profit from reprinting the book but was prevented from doing so anyway by Frank Herbert’s estate.

Why? In 1999 Herbert’s son Brian Herbert and co-author Kevin J. Anderson began publishing “official” prequels to the Dune saga starting with the novel Dune: House Atreides. Many of the details in these novels and other prequels — like The Butlerian Jihad — directly contradicted “historical” information in The Dune Encyclopedia. For this reason even fan wikis will list information from The Dune Encyclopedia as beyond the scope of the core book canon (the six original novels) or the “Expanded Canon” of the prequels.

Essentially The Dune Encyclopedia is the third canon for Dune separate from the classic books or what the estate deems “official.”

Physical copies of the Encyclopedia are hard to find

In 1984 The Dune Encyclopedia was published by Berkley Books in both hardcover and paperback. It was never reprinted though you can sometimes find full PDFs circulating online. Buying used copies on eBay ABE or other shopping apps is your only way to go. These range from $1000 on the high end to $499.99 for more worn-out copies. (The author of this article snagged a dog-eared copy for $130 back in early 2020 but the prices have spiked since then.)

As rare science fiction books go The Dune Encyclopedia is one of the strangest if only because it’s more valuable and harder to find than most versions of books written by Herbert. For example if you wanted to find a copy of the 1963 issue of Analog which published “Dune World” Herbert’s serialized early version of Dune you’re looking at $250. A non-canon book about Dune — not written by Frank Herbert — is the most valuable Dune book of them all.

The book includes one outrageous fan theory

Because The Dune Encyclopedia presents itself as a work of scholarly research compiled by historians looking back at the galaxy's history intentional contradictions exist between some of the entries.

Enter an off-the-wall fan theory which masquerades as a fictional academic trying to reframe the story of Dune. In one of the entries on Paul Atreides one “historian” suggests there’s no way that Paul could have been from Caladan. Instead the writer argues he was a Fremen and his biographers have inflated the legends of Paul coming from another planet to Arrakis.

Confused? You should be. Within the framing of the first Dune novel you’re lead to believe that most of the history of what Paul did was recorded by his wife Princess Irulan. Even the novel version of Dune isn’t an objective story but instead loosely framed as a retelling.

The Dune Encyclopedia asks if those biographers are covering things up. Everyone knows that Paul Atreides came from the planet Caladan and later became part of the Fremen but what The Dune Encyclopedia presupposes is — what if he didn’t? This detail alone (though presented as speculation) is one reason Frank Herbert’s estate may not have loved this book.

Denis Villeneuve couldn’t reference this book in Dune: Part One

Speaking with Inverse an anonymous (though previously reliable) source stated that Denis Villeneuve is a big fan of The Dune Encyclopedia. But when he tried to plant references to the book in the new film his “hand was slapped by the estate.” Within Dune: Part One as a result any apocryphal events or elements that contradict the original novel come from the screenplay not from any other source.

Still The Dune Encyclopedia is a fantastic resource and the vast majority of the information contained within it is accurate.

It’s a super-helpful book if you’re interested in reading quick character biographies or getting questions answered about the Dune universe's technology places and cultures. The fact that the estate of Frank Herbert disapproves also makes reading it feel transgressive.

Universal Images Group via Getty Images



Paul Constant is a writer at Civic Ventures and cohost of the ""Pitchfork Economics"" podcast.

A recent episode dove into how big retailers like Walmart and Amazon dominate retail business in the US.

Antitrust laws could level the playing field and give local businesses a chance to serve their communities.

For Americans who were born in the 1970s 80s and 90s corporate market consolidation might feel like the natural order of things. We grew up in a country where Walmarts and other big box stores dotted rural and suburban landscapes and the surge in Amazon's prominence over the last two decades has felt in some ways like the organic continuation of that trend – an even-larger fish eating the smaller fish in the pond as nature intended.

But there's nothing natural about that progression. In fact the consolidated market power of corporations in the retail banking and food and farming sectors over the past four decades is the end result of policy choices our leaders made in the 80s and 90s. Those choices have systematically driven down worker wages and wiped out small businesses from coast to coast while enriching a handful of CEOs shareholders and executives.

Through most of the 20th century a robust suite of antitrust laws ensured that there were many competitors in industries and regions around the country. Stacy Mitchell the co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance joined David Goldstein on this week's ""Pitchfork Economics"" podcast to explain how the American landscape has changed for the worse and what can be done to revive it.

Mitchell blames corporate consolidation on ""a series of policy decisions that undermined our antitrust laws and helped consolidate the banking system."" These trickle-down laws ""were embraced by both Republicans and Democrats"" under the philosophy that efficiency and low prices not competitiveness were the most important benchmark for a business's success.

""Walmart came along and took advantage of those changes in antitrust policy by engaging in rampant predatory pricing"" Mitchell said. The retailer would sell items below cost to drive smaller retailers out of business and then they would raise prices even higher (and keep worker pay artificially low) after their competitors closed.

""Walmart won not by being better necessarily or even being more efficient but simply using its raw financial and market muscle to get its way at the expense of competing businesses particularly independent retailers"" Mitchell said. Amazon has basically followed the same game plan as Walmart only in about half the time by opening warehouses in rural areas that pay a fraction of what local factories used to pay 50 years ago.

As Walmart and other companies gained economic power they began to flex their political power influencing lawmakers in state houses and Congress to further ""rewrite regulation to favor their own interests."" Soon their already unfair competitive advantage became enshrined in law.

Now ""there are fewer and fewer companies that control more and more of our industries"" Mitchell explained which means ""those companies are putting their higher-wage jobs and their facilities in relatively few places.""

As a result ""lots of smaller and mid-size companies have simply disappeared"" particularly in the vast swaths of America that aren't wealthy coastal cities like New York and San Francisco.

""The advertising company that was a regional company in St. Louis Missouri is now gone"" Mitchells said. ""The mid-size manufacturer that had its base of operations in rural North Carolina has now been swallowed up and that facility has been closed.""

As those independent small businesses have shuttered good-paying jobs dried up and rural areas and second-tier cities have been economically hollowed out. ""We have a lot of regions that are really hurting and being left behind where people can't find good jobs"" Mitchell explained. ""They can't succeed in starting businesses. There's no way to get into the middle class.""

If Walmart had to compete on even ground with small businesses from day one America's highways and downtowns would likely look very different right now. Mitchell says our leaders need to reform antitrust laws to place competitiveness at the center of the equation again and to give small businesses a decent opportunity to serve their communities.







""I think that we need to split Amazon up into several companies"" Mitchell continued. If Amazon's shipping online shopping platform online infrastructure provider logistics network and generic products manufacturer services were divided into separate corporations that had to compete with similar businesses all five organizations would likely thrive. But consumers would thrive too as they comparison-shopped between multiple providers offering different prices quality and services.

The 50-year-old billionaire developed his appetite for taking risks from his father Peter and it's that foundation in childhood that's propelling him to now focus on a spellbindingly ambitious endeavor that many experts and pundits are deeming near impossible.

Lore the former president of Walmart e-commerce and co-founder of Jet.com and Diapers.com is attempting to spearhead the conceptual and financial building blocks for Telosa a Utopian city in the middle of the desert announced last month.

Telosa's location is being targeted in the American West desert or Appalachia with plans to shepherd in a reformed version of capitalism with a focus on societal inclusion over division. Lore envisions Telosa having equal access health care excellent schooling and safe environments for families regardless of income. Even further he aims for Telosa to be a diverse place housing various races genders sexual orientations religions and political affiliations.

But exactly how the ""city of the future"" is built is both risky and complicated. Experts and researchers have long maintained that too many financial hurdles can stand in the way with one 2014 study arguing that ""the ability of eco-cities to achieve their utopian ambitions may be limited by the realities of operating within a profit-driven entrepreneurial planning environment.""

Yet that's where Lore feels like Telosa can be different and understanding the colossal ""how"" of the project means understanding the ""why"" for Lore.

Marc Lore:Former Walmart president reveals plan for $400-billion Utopian city in the US desert

Telosa's name derives from the Ancient Greek word telos – meaning ""higher purpose."" The conceptual art of Telosa looks like it's pulled from a science fiction movie. Nearly everything appears fueled by solar power energy autonomous electric cars and high-speed public transportation. Designs from architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group the same company that created Google's headquarters shows 150000 acres of eco-friendly architecture including a beacon-esque skyscraper known as the ""Equitism Tower.""

The headlines of Telosa last month honed in on the $400 billion objective that will take massive buy-in from key investors to even get the project off the ground. Factor in Lore's lofty goals that start with the first phase of 50000 living residents to be welcomed into the city by 2030 and the public skepticism is hardly hidden.

That's not lost on Lore who sees the attempt – similar to those of his father growing up – just as important as the end goal.

""I'm not pursuing this to make money"" said Lore a co-owner of the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves. ""I'm doing this because of what it can mean for others and the future. If this entire attempt doesn't work then hopefully there are things to learn from itand it will inspire others to take their shot.""

A 'global standard for living'

Lore is cognizant of the optics that can come from attaching his name – and value system – to a city starting from the ground up.

But the entrepreneur said his role is mostly to provide a placeholder for the people to create the city's culture themselves. Telosa's official website promotes future residents always being connected to community and nature while setting a ""global standard for living"" with the goal of expanding ""human potential.""

""I don't want to be the ruler of the city; this is more of a public service"" Lore said. ""I'm wanting to give it a place to grow and flourish. It's not meant to be a private city; it's meant to be a city for everyone – with an innovative way we live.""

Lore calls his model ""equitism"" and it would allow any Telosa citizen to build their home and sell it while the city would retain ownership of the land that's underneath. By that setup in a dream scenario Lore believes Telosa's desert land would eventually balloon in value to be worth $1 trillion. Lore said that land value which could come out to $50 billion from investments and endowments would go directly toward the city's funding to ensure that every family has equal access to health care good schooling and a safe environment regardless of income.

Top-down economic models present complications but they've been achieved elsewhere. The concept of community-owned land on a large scale is on display in Singapore where the government owns 90% of the country's land and then the proceeds are reinvested in the country. While there's skepticism Lore's hope is to provide a blueprint for other future cities noting that so many U.S. cities today have become ingrained in politics where bridges of trust have been fractured over time.

""The sole purpose of creating a city in the desert would be so it's owned by the community basically take all the appreciation of the land and give it back to the citizens"" Lore said. ""Taxes paid will go back to the city for infrastructure – roads tunnels and bridges – so everyone would know exactly where their money is going.

How does someone become a resident of Telosa?

The selection process for the first 50000 in Telosa is yet to be determined but will likely be done by application. One thing Lore can promise is that inclusion of varying races genders sexual orientations and religions will be a top priority.

Still selection could be one of the tallest hurdles for Telosa from a public perception standpoint. Simply naming qualifications for citizens can have a discriminatory connotation. One lure to draw people to Telosa will be a Lore-created venture capital fund that could house startups that relocate to the city. But what will the other careers of first citizens be?

""We can't create a city without some early nudging to move to the city"" Lore said. ""We'll have to kick-start in an unconventional way but the hope is we'll position the people to grow a culture.""

Lore said much of the framework for the first ""settlers"" will be sorted out with aid from his team of 50 volunteers and full-timers made up of architects historians researchers economists creatives designers engineers and climate experts.

Once the first phase begins in 2030 Lore said the hope of the equitism model is to let the people drive the creation of the city's culture and then accentuate the diversity through respect and an equal value system.

""How does a city have a soul?"" Lore said. ""It's not about buildings and roads it's about the values and the city standing for something. We don't know what that is yet but we want to find out.""

Concerns of division belief in inclusion

Lore said Telosa will be intentionally apolitical with its creation and potential launch.

""We want to involve Democrats and Republicans people with differing opinions"" he said. ""How do we bring people together? It's always in the how. We intend to be transparent as one team with one vision.""

One approach to zero in on an inclusive culture Lore said is by looking at future citizens from more of a psychological lens versus a sociological lens – focusing on the nuances of what makes individuals tick versus the semantics of the whole.

""One of the things I discovered working with (companies) was how much trust builds relationships and trust impacts culture"" Lore said. ""Something magical happens when people trust that you're living by a set of values and being honest about it. When I was at Jet the directors made the same salary and that was known. The transparency and fairness mean something.""

In conjunction with financial buy-in there will be practical challenges to address. But Lore said he sees Telosa as an opportunity to test highly researched theories in a way that's not possible otherwise.

One of those concerns will be a sufficient water system in the desert. ""It will require us to use technology in ways we're not today so that we can have a city live off of 80% less water per person. That can set up a future we're prepared for where water is more scarce.""

This isn't the first time that a Utopian city has been attempted by a wealthy person. Bill Gates announced in 2017 plans to build a smart city outside of Phoenix on 2800 acres. Millionaire Jeffrey Berns also bought 67000 acres in Nevada for a smart city.

But Lore sees his vision as different.

""I'm very open to others' opinions and I want (Telosa) to be based on the collective thinking of people in the world"" Lore said.

Lore has plans to step aside more if and when Telosa is off the ground. In the meantime that childhood dream of creating something out of nothing is closer to coming to its fruition.

""I don't have all the answers"" Lore said. ""But each day I'm learning.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3Mtd2FsbWFydC1zaG9wcGVycy1yYXZpbmctaXRlbXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart Shoppers Are Raving About These 6 Fall Items,"If this morning's news about the new snickerdoodle cupcake at Costco wasn't enough to get your next grocery list going this roundup of goodies should do it.

DIS,Walt Disney,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL21pYW1pL25ld3Mvd2FsdC1kaXNuZXktZmxvcmlkYS1oaXN0b3J5L9IBQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9taWFtaS9uZXdzL3dhbHQtZGlzbmV5LWZsb3JpZGEtaGlzdG9yeS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walt Disney's Ties To Florida Reach Back To The 1800s,"ORLANDO (CBSMiami/AP) - As Walt Disney World celebrates its 50th anniversary many would be surprised to learn Walt Disney himself had strong ties to Central Florida before the park even opened.

Disney's parents Flora Call and Elias Disney were married in Lake County where his grandparents and other relatives are buried. His oldest brother Herbert was born in Florida.

Fleeing Harsh Winters

After several harsh Kansas winters Disney's maternal grandparents Charles and Henrietta Call heard the call of Florida and in 1884 became Lake County pioneers settling about a mile north of the Paisley settlement (then in Orange County).

The Calls' Kansas neighbor Kepple Disney and his son Elias also made the journey south and settled in the Paisley area. Kepple Disney returned to Kansas in 1887 but Elias stayed in Florida and on Jan. 1 he and the Calls' daughter Flora were wed in a little church in Kismet (a vanished settlement).

The couple may have lived for a time in Daytona Beach. In an October 1965 interview with Walt Disney the Sentinel's Emily Bavar wrote that he had mentioned a ""sentimental interest in Daytona Beach where his parents lived early in their marriage."" His oldest brother Herbert was born Dec. 8 1888 in Florida.

Walt Disney biographer Neal Gabler notes that the death of Flora's father Charles Call in January 1890 ""loosened the couple's bond to Florida."" Call had an accident while clearing pines from his land near Paisley and never fully recovered. One family member cited a Disney family tendency toward wanderlust to explain Elia and Flora's spring 1890 move from Florida to Chicago with young Herbert in tow.

The couple's second son Raymond was born in Chicago in late 1890 followed by Roy in 1893 and Walter Elias Disney in 1901. The boys' lone sister Ruth joined them in 1902 and in 1906 the family moved to a 48-acre farm near Marceline Missouri on the mainline of the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad about 100 miles northeast of Kansas City. (Marceline is said to be the inspiration for the Main Street areas at the Disney parks.) In a few years the family moved to Kansas City.

Aunt Jessie and Uncle Albert

Back in Florida Walt Disney's uncle Albert Perkins became the postmaster of Paisley in 1902 and served until 1935. (Perkins had married Flora's sister Jessie in 1887.)

Jessie Call Perkins taught in several Lake County schools and eventually served as principal of Eustis High School. When her husband died she succeeded him as postmaster and served until 1946. She was also the secretary and treasurer of the association that cared for the Ponceannah Cemetery in Paisley where her parents had been buried. She outlived her husband Albert by almost 20 years and died in 1956 not too long after she posed for a picture with her famous nephew with whom she corresponded.

The story goes that the young Walt and Roy Disney visited Jessie and Albert in Florida during their summer vacations from school. If that's true it must have been one of the bright lights for Walt in a boyhood shaped by hard work and harsh discipline.

When Walt was 9 he got out of bed each day at 3:30 a.m. to help his father deliver newspapers in Kansas City whatever the weather. It's likely the boy did find enjoyment in drawing even at an early age. One story has it that his first brushwork involved tar which was used on the family farm for patching roofs and fixing drains.

Eventually he enrolled in one of those correspondence-school cartooning courses — the kind you used to see advertised on matchbook covers — and when he was 14 he joined a Saturday morning class at the Kansas City Art Institute.

More than 130 years after his Grandfather Call's death and after his parents left Florida people leave mementos by the graves of his grandparents in the small rural Ponceannah Cemetery in Lake County. Recently small figures of Mickey Mouse sat near faded silk roses and a small American flag.

""I believe the canny artist who rode to fame and fortune on an animated mouse named Mickey is capable of building anything from a park to an entire city in a Central Florida pasture"" Bavar wrote at the end of her October 1965 interview with Disney. Amen to that.

But the version of Epcot visitors encounter at Disney World — currently in the midst of its 50th anniversary celebrations – is hardly what Walt Disney imagined.

In 1966 Disney announced his intention to build Epcot an acronym for ""Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow."" It was to be no mere theme park but as Disney put it ""the creation of a living blueprint for the future"" unlike ""anyplace else in the world"" — an entire new city built from scratch.

Disney died later that year; his vision was scaled down and then scrapped altogether. But when I was writing my book on urban idealism in America I was drawn to this planned community.

Since the arrival of the first colonists Americans have experimented with new patterns of settlement. Imagining new kinds of places to live is an American tradition and Disney was an eager participant.

A city of the future

A captivating 25-minute film produced by Walt Disney Enterprises remains the best window into Walt's vision.

In it Disney — speaking kindly and slowly as if to a group of children — detailed what would become of the 27400 acres or 43 square miles of central Florida that he had acquired.

Echoing the rhetoric of American pioneers he noted how the abundance of land was the key. Here he would achieve all that could not be done at Disneyland his first theme park in Anaheim California that opened in 1955 and had since been encroached upon by rapid suburban development. He proudly pointed out that the land on which Disney World would be built was twice the size of the island of Manhattan and five times larger than Disneyland's Magic Kingdom.

Among the remarkable components of Disney's Epcot would be a community of 20000 residents living in neighborhoods that would double as a showcase of industrial and civic ingenuity — a running experiment in planning building design management and governance. There would be a 1000-acre office park for developing new technologies and when say an innovation in refrigerator design would be developed every household in Epcot would be the first to receive and test the product before it was released for the rest of the world.

An airport would enable anyone to fly directly to Disney World while a ""vacation land"" would provide resort accommodations for visitors. A central arrival complex included a 30-story hotel and convention center with the downtown featuring a weather-protected zone of themed shops.

Epcot's more modest wage-earners would be able to live nearby in a ring of high-rise apartment buildings. And there would be a park belt and recreational zone surrounding this downtown area separating the low-density cul-de-sac neighborhoods beyond that would house the majority of residents. There would be no unemployment and it was not to be a retirement community.

""I don't believe there is a challenge anywhere in the world that's more important to people everywhere than finding solutions to the problems of our cities"" Disney said.

'New Towns' abound

During the 1960s the aspiration of building anew was much in the air.

Americans were becoming increasingly concerned about the well-being of the nation's cities. And they were unsatisfied with the effort — and especially the consequences — of urban renewal.

They felt insecure in the face of growing urban poverty unrest and crime and frustrated about increasing traffic congestion. Families continued to move to the suburbs but planners opinion leaders and even ordinary citizens raised concerns about consuming so much land for low-density development.

Sprawl as a pejorative term for poorly planned development was gaining currency as a fledgling environmental movement emerged. In his popular 1960s ballad ""Little Boxes"" Pete Seeger sang of ""Little boxes on the hillside / Little boxes made of ticky tacky"" to criticize the uniform suburban and exurban tracts of housing rippling out from America's cities.

A hope emerged that building new towns might be an alternative for unlovely and unloved city neighborhoods and for soulless peripheral subdivisions.

Self-described ""town founders"" most of them wealthy businesspeople with ideals dependent on real estate success led America's New Towns movement. As Disney was preparing for his Epcot presentation the Irvine Company was already deep into the process of developing the holdings of the old Irvine Ranch into the model town of Irvine California. Today Irvine boasts nearly 300000 residents.

Meanwhile real estate entrepreneur Robert E. Simon sold New York's Carnegie Hall and with his earnings bought 6700 acres of farmland outside of Washington so he could create Reston Virginia. Fifty miles away shopping center developer James Rouse started planning Columbia Maryland. And oil industry investor George P. Mitchell keeping an eye on the successes and setbacks of Rouse and Simon would soon take advantage of a new federal funding program and embark on establishing The Woodlands near Houston which today has a population of over 100000 people.

These new towns hoped to incorporate the liveliness and diversity of cities while retaining the intimacy of neighborhoods and other charms associated with small towns.

Disney's dream today

Disney however didn't want to simply spruce up existing suburbs.

He wanted to upend preexisting notions of how a city could be built and run. And for all of its utopian promise the genius of Disney's Epcot was that it all seemed doable an agglomeration of elements commonly found in any modern metropolitan area but fused into a singular vision and managed by a single authority.

An important innovation was the banishing of the automobile. A vast underground system was designed to enable cars to arrive park or buzz under the city without being seen. A separate underground layer would accommodate trucks and service functions. Residents and visitors would traverse the entire 12-mile length of Disney World and all of its attractions on a high-speed monorail far more extensive than anything achieved at Disneyland.

In the car-crazed America of the 1960s this was a truly radical idea.

Given Walt Disney's legendary tenacity it would have been fascinating to witness how far his vision would have advanced. After his death some sought to fulfill his plans. But when urged by a Disney designer to carry through on Walt's broader civic-minded vision Walt's brother Roy who had taken the reins of the company answered ""Walt is dead.""

Today Disney's utopian spirit is alive and well. You see it in former Walmart executive Marc Lore's ambitions to build a 5-million-person city called ""Telosa"" in a U.S. desert and Blockchains LLC's proposal for a self-governing ""smart city"" in Nevada.

But more often you'll see efforts that tap into the nostalgia of a bucolic past. The Disney Corporation did in fact develop a town during the 1990s on one of its Florida landholdings.

Dubbed ""Celebration"" it was initially heralded as an exemplar of the turn-of-the century movement called New Urbanism which sought to design suburbs in ways that conjured up the small American town: walkable neighborhoods a town center a range of housing choices and less dependence on cars.

However Celebration has no monorail or underground transport networks no hubs of technological innovation or policies like universal employment.

That sort of city of tomorrow it seems will have to wait.

But there are even cooler spots that have shaped Disney’s history.

While we all dream about spending a night in coveted spots like the Cinderella Castle Suite we may have found your dream location to visit!

The OC Register has shared a look inside “Walt Disney’s Storybook Mansion” which is where Walt moved his family after the success of Mickey Mouse. The house is located on a hilltop on Waking Way in the Los Feliz district near Griffith Park in Los Angeles which is now owned by Russian film director Timur Bekmambetov.

When the house was built in 1932 it only cost $50000 to build in two months during the Great Depression. The designs were made by architect Frank Crowhurst with 6400 square feet of property that included “five bedrooms a projection room library pool pavilion with dressing rooms and a pool house” along with other features. Crowhurst would go on to help make the Walt Disney Company headquarters in Burbank California.

According to OC Register a Snow White inspired cottage playhouse was even built for Walt’s daughters at one point which is still featured on property. One of the biggest reasons that the Disney family put so much focus on their home is that they valued family time together over big outings elsewhere. There weren’t too many parties hosted there and Walt even frequented his home office so he could be around his family members.

In later years Disney would move to Holmby Hills in 1950 with a bigger house that had a garden for Lillian. Although Bekmambetov still owns the Storybook Mansion special events like filming weddings occasional tours and more still take place for a hefty price tag.

Since its construction the house hasn’t seen too many changes. Remodeling has helped maintain the house’s original look even though the original furnishings are no longer inside. While Lillian’s rose gardens aren’t at Woking Way Imagineer Tania Norris has noted that she is designing Snow White themed rose gardens to complement the Snow White cottage.

We only wish that we could spend the night in Walt’s literal fairytale home! Of course we will give you a look at all the other exciting Disney entertainment and news coming soon! Stay tuned with All Ears for the latest!

Magic Kingdom has certainly changed a lot in 50 years but despite everything that has changed there are actually a lot of attractions that are still there even decades later.

If you’re planning to visit Walt Disney World for its 50th birthday then consider checking out these 14 attractions that were there on day one and are still there today:

Country Bear Jamboree

Originally conceived for a Disney-themed ski resort in the 1960s (a story for another time) The Country Bear Jamboree held its first performance when Disney World opened on October 1 1971. The attraction was so popular that it was quickly replicated for Disneyland. While the west coast version closed down in 2001 the original Jamboree has continued going strong despite the occasional rumor to the contrary.

Dumbo The Flying Elephant

Dumbo the Flying Elephant very nearly counts as an attraction that was an opening day experience at both Disneyland and Magic Kingdom. Unfortunately it wasn’t quite ready in time at Disneyland it opened to guests about a month after the park did. It was ready for opening day at Magic Kingdom. However you won’t find it in the same place it was on that day. When Fantasyland underwent major changes in 2011 Dumbo was moved to the new Storybook Circus area also a second set of flying elephants was added.

A simple attraction that's often overlooked the Frontierland Shootin’ Arcade’s biggest change since opening day is probably the fact that along with the 50th anniversary the attraction is now free of charge. Also rumors that this day one attraction would be going away have been greatly exaggerated .

The Hall of Presidents

The Hall of Presidents was an idea that Walt Disney had wanted to see realized years previously. While he had to settle for just one animatronic President when Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln debuted at the 1964-65 World’s Fair by the time Disney World was being dreamed up it became possible to make animatronic figures of all the Presidents. Since the attraction's opening each new head of state has been added in turn. The show only recently reopened with the new animatronic for President Joe Biden having been added.

The Haunted Mansion

Disney was so sure that the Haunted Mansion was going to be a hit when it opened in Disneyland’s New Orleans Square in the mid-1960s that when the elements of the attraction were being constructed they made double of everything one for Disneyland and one for the (nearly) identical version when Magic Kingdom opened in 1971. This made the second version of the attraction a little cheaper to build.

It’s a Small World

One of the most beloved attractions from the 1964-65 World’s Fair that was later transplanted at Disneyland It's a Small World made its debut inside Fantasyland when the Magic Kingdom opened as well. It even has a (much smaller) version of the Disneyland façade although that wasn’t there on day one and was added later.

Jungle Cruise

The Jungle Cruise was an E-ticket attraction on day one at Disneyland likely the most popular ride when that park opened so it made all the sense in the world to build one at Magic Kingdom as well. As with many of the attractions that were built for a second time the Disney World version is bigger and largely better . In this specific case thanks to a ruined temple the boats travel through that can’t be found at Disneyland.

Mad Tea Party

The classic ride that makes you dizzy has been an opening day attraction at nearly every Disney Park around the world where it has opened. The only real difference between the ride today and on opening day at Disney World is that it now includes a canopy because it rains in Florida.

Peter Pan’s Flight

Many of Magic Kingdom’s original Fantasyland dark rides like Snow White's Scary Adventures and Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride have disappeared over the years to make way for newer attractions. But Peter Pan’s Flight has always been the most popular classic dark ride and it’s still going strong boasting one of the longer wait times you'll tend to find in the entire park.

Prince Charming Regal Carousel

The carousel is an amusement park classic and even at a place that tries to “plus” everything you kind of need to have one. Magic Kingdom’s carousel outdoes nearly all the others out there by simply being massive with an entire additional row of horses compared to its Disneyland counterpart.

Swiss Family Treehouse

It’s been more than 60 years since Disney released its version of Swiss Family Robinson  but the Swiss Family Treehouse still stands in Magic Kingdom’s Adventureland. The Disneyland version of the treehouse was rethemed to Disney’s Tarzan in the 90s but the Magic Kingdom version has thus far avoided such a fate.

Tomorrowland Speedway

When Magic Kingdom opened there was no attraction called the Tomorrowland Speedway. Instead it was called the Grand Prix Raceway. In addition to the name the attraction itself has changed over the years with the track undergoing multiple adjustments including being shortened to make way for other park changes. It’s not the exact same day one experience but the experience is still there to be had.

Walt Disney’s Enchanted Tiki Room

While the show that’s today called Walt Disney’s Enchanted Tiki Room was originally called Tropical Serenade at Magic Kingdom the show itself is the same experience today that it was back in 1971. That’s not to say the attraction hasn’t been through changes. It spent more than 10 years as The Enchanted Tiki Room (Under New Management) which was a very different show. However following a fire (that some called a blessing) the show was reverted back to its former self though with a brand new name.

Walt Disney World Railroad

We’ll call this one an “honorable mention” because while the Walt Disney World Railroad was there on opening day and it will be available to guests again in the future it actually isn’t right now. The construction of the Tron Light Cycle: Power Run roller coaster forced a “temporary” shutdown of the railroad which due to various delays (including the pandemic) has now lasted much longer than anticipated. It's still there to see you just can't go for a ride yet.

If you find yourself at Walt Disney World during the 50th anniversary perhaps consider spending your time at Magic Kingdom experiencing these great day one rides and shows. It would be a fitting way to celebrate the last five decades and those attractions that have withstood the test of time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL3dhbHQtZGlzbmV5LWFuaW1hdGlvbi1zdHVkaW9zLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LXZpZGVvLWVuY2FudG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walt Disney Animation Studios Celebrates 98 Years and 60 Animated Movies,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL3dhbHQtZGlzbmV5LWFuaW1hdGlvbi1zdHVkaW9zLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LXZpZGVvLWVuY2FudG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Warner Bros. Discovery has moved the DC superhero movie up to June 16 2023 replacing the previously set date of June 23.

Variety reported the release date shift for The Flash. The Ezra Miller-starring vehicle has faced all sorts of delays over the years. At one point the DC film was scheduled to arrive in March 2018 before being pushed back. The COVID-19 pandemic then led to more setbacks for the movie.

In August 2022 Warner Bros. Discovery reportedly weighed shelving The Flash because of Ezra Miller's legal issues. They have been at the center of multiple incidents of disorderly conduct and harassment. For instance Miller was charged in Vermont for felony burglary. They were also arrested for second-degree assault to a 26-year-old woman in Hawaii.

Shortly thereafter Miller announced they were seeking treatment for ""complex mental health issues."" The actor added: ""I want to apologize to everyone that I have alarmed and upset with my past behavior.""

The DC film universe has recently seen a big shakeup as Guardians of the Galaxy and The Suicide Squad director James Gunn is now co-leading DC Studios. He and producer Peter Safran took over from former DC Film president Walter Hamada.

One of the changes Warner Bros. Discovery hopes to implement is cutting down on the number of people portraying Batman which is actually a plot point for The Flash. The movie sees the return of Michael Keaton's Caped Crusader as well as Ben Affleck's.

Along with Miller Keaton and Affleck The Flash will star Sasha Calle as Supergirl Kiersey Clemons as Iris West Maribel Verdú as Nora Allen and Ron Livingston as Henry Allen. It and It Chapter 2 director Andy Muschietti is helming the DC film which will reportedly adapt the classic Flashpoint comic storyline.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHA6Ly9hd2FyZHNyYWRhci5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8xNi9kYy1mYW5kb21lLXN0YXRpYy1zaG9jay1tb3ZpZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DC FanDome: 'Static Shock' Movie Confirmed To Be In The Works,"During a panel with Milestone’s Reginald Hudlin and Denys Cowan it was confirmed that a Static Shock movie is indeed in the works with Michael B.

No release date or casting announcements have been confirmed but it was rumored that a Static Shock movie was in the works and now it is official. We do know however that Randy McKinnon will be writing the script.

In addition Hudlin and Cowan have confirmed that another feature film based on a Milestone property is in the works and it will be animated. However no further details have been announced as to whether or not it will be theatrical HBO Max or a direct-to-VOD film like most DC animated films have been but you can look at its first-look art below:

WM,Waste Management,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdGljb3RpbWVzLm5ldC8yMDIxLzEwLzE2L3JlY3ljbGluZy1pbi1jb3N0YS1yaWNhLWNvbWJhdHRpbmctcmVuZXdhYmxlLXdhc3RlLWlzc3Vlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recycling in Costa Rica: Combating Renewable Waste Issues :,"Costa Rica often considered one of the eco-friendliest countries in the world has one nagging thorn in their side that they aim to address as the country progresses.

While major strides have been made in the renewable energy and carbon neutrality sectors Costa Rica has admittedly struggled in their recycling efforts particularly in the plastics industry. According to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) as of 2018 Costa Rica’s plastic industry was the third largest respective industry within the country. In the same year the UNDP also reported that Costa Rica was the biggest importer of plastics in Central America.

The challenge to recovering this valuable waste has been a multi-faceted problem a problem that the Government and institutional agencies of Costa Rica have vowed to address and improve.

The Challenge of Recycling in Costa Rica

In total as of a 2018 report it was estimated by the Costa Rican Ministry of Health that Costa Rica dumped nearly 550 tons of plastic daily. 80% of this total waste was found to be dumped in the ocean 11% in dump sites and landfills and a meager 9% of all renewable waste actually making it to a recycling facility.

These numbers are troubling enough alone for a country that prides itself on being one of the greenest in the world not to mention the worry that the tourism sector of Costa Rica may be affected if these numbers are not kept in check.

The challenge to recycling in Costa Rica can ultimately be attributed to the pure vast amount of land and terrain that any recycled material must travel to be collected and processed. Collection trucks for recyclable materials must travel far and wide making their availability to citizens who do look to recycle their reusable goods rather sparse. For agencies looking to find a sustainable renewable waste management model this can be a financial and logistic nightmare with no easy solutions.

Still many strides have been made in Costa Rica by individuals and agencies alike to help combat the renewable waste program problem in the otherwise eco-friendly country.

Costa Rica’s Recycling Efforts

While there is still a long way to go for Costa Rica in combating this renewable waste problem there is a light at the end of the tunnel and steady progress has been reported.

In 2017 the Ministry of Health reported a 469% increase in the amount of recyclable waste that the country received from 2015 totaling a whopping 100200 tons of waste. This is an encouraging feat for Costa Rica but what factors can be attributed for the rise in environmental consciousness?

For starters officials at the Department of Environment and Health believe that an overall rise in environmental consciousness may have something to do with it. Costa Ricans in general want to keep their pristine land the way it is. Although it may be tough at the moment Costa Ricans seem to be finding creative ways and alternatives to get their recyclables to their proper final destination.

In addition several other major incentives and laws have been enacted to help curb the appeal of overusing non-recyclable material and aid in their proper disposal.

Single-Use Plastic Laws

One such deterrent is Law No. 9786 or “Law to Combat Plastic Pollution and Protect the Environment”.

Law No 9786 enacted on November 26th of 2019 “bans the sale or distribution of plastic bags by supermarkets and other retail establishments and allows for the use of biodegradable bags and reusable bags certified as having a low environmental impact and meeting certain design standards including at least 50% recycled content.”

This law also has several other eco- friendly bi-laws which prohibit the sale and distribution of plastic straws as well as require single-use plastic bottle producers distributors and retailers to establish a program for the recovery and recycling of such products.

The law has also since been expanded upon to help Costa Rica’s National Parks as part of the Comprehensive Waste Management Plan as a February 25 2020 declaration by the National System of Conversation areas announced a ban on single-use plastics from entering Costa Rica’s National Parks and Protected Wildlife Areas. Some items include plastic water bottles non-reusable plastic bags disposable cutlery disposable cups fast- food containers and straws.

Other Recycling Incentives in Costa Rica

Besides laws and statues there are other programs and incentives being introduced to eco-minded Costa Ricans as well.

One such program “ECOLONES” provides an interesting incentive for Costa Ricans to round up their reusable waste and take it to their nearest solid waste management facility to be recycled.

Announced in April 2018 ECOLONES is an e-coin based reward system which allows individuals to profit off of the recyclable materials that they bring to a solid waste management facility. Individuals must simply register for the program bring in their recyclable goods and be rewarded via discounts on certain goods and services. Not only can you feel good about helping to save Costa Rica’s environment but now you can essentially get paid for it.

In response to the success of the program PepsiCo Latin America Also recently launched an initiative with ECOLONES to help bolster the already growing incentive program.

Final Word

Although Costa Rica certainly has a long way to go in their quest for a sustainable renewable waste management model the strides that they have mad in such a relatively short amount of time are admirable.

As new laws and initiatives are put in place expect Costa Rica to respond as they always have to any ecosystem-related issue with intense passion and respect for their beautiful land.

Congress the U.S. Government Accountability Office says. And Congress must fix it.

In a dispassionate but merciless examination of the string of follies that has put the federal government nearly a quarter-century behind accepting waste from commercial reactors like the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station — where 3.6 million pounds of waste must sit for years or possibly decades — the GAO chronicled the weeds that have choked the effort then hacked through them to clear a path forward.

“Commercial spent nuclear fuel is extremely dangerous if not managed properly” the report said. “About 86000 metric tons of this fuel is stored on-site at 75 operating or shutdown nuclear power plants in 33 states an amount that grows by about 2000 metric tons each year.”

The radioisotopes produced in a reactor can remain hazardous from a few days to many thousands of years the GAO said.

“The longer it takes the federal government to resolve the current impasse and develop a solution for the permanent disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel the greater the potential risk to the environment and public health or of security incidents associated with temporary on-site storage” the report said. “(T)he safety of long-term dry cask storage is unknown and the risks such as environmental and health risks of on-site storage increase the longer the fuel is stored there.”

Attempted sabotage and theft of radioactive material are also potential security risks the report said.

How we got here

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 made the management and permanent disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel a federal responsibility the GAO explained.

It directed the secretary of energy to investigate locations for permanent geologic repositories and established a Nuclear Waste Fund to collect money from utility customers for disposal.

At first officials envisioned two permanent sites — one for eastern states and one for western states.

But in 1987 Congress amended the act telling the Department of Energy to focus its efforts on a permanent repository at just one site: Yucca Mountain some 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. Nevada which has no nuclear plants said hell no.

No matter. The 1987 amendments forbade the DOE from pursuing temporary storage until the secretary of energy recommended a permanent site to the president.

“This effectively tied the development of such a facility to Yucca Mountain” the GAO noted.

Political winds blew.

In 2008 under President George W. Bush the DOE formally submitted a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain.

In 2009 under President Barack Obama the DOE said Yucca was not a viable option. The license application was terminated in 2010.

Congress hasn’t funded anything related to a repository at Yucca Mountain since then nor has it authorized the Department of Energy to explore other possible solutions.

“As a result under current law Yucca Mountain is the only location authorized for a permanent repository for the disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel” the GAO explained. “The development of the Yucca Mountain site remains unresolved with significant short-term as well as potential long-term financial consequences for the federal government.”

Hence the DOE failed to meet the January 1998 deadline to start accepting spent fuel from commercial reactors stipulated by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Reactor operators stuck with the stuff even as their customers paid for timely disposal sued. And won.

As of last year the federal government has forked over almost $9 billion to reactor operators to pay for the temporary storage they’ve had to build to house waste while the feds dicker. These costs will continue to grow the GAO said: The DOE estimates the outstanding bill at some $30.6 billion but others say it may be closer to $50 billion.

How to fix

Obama assembled a Blue Ribbon Commission that laid out a path forward in 2012 and it’s largely the path that the GAO urges lawmakers to embrace now. It recommends that Congress:

Amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to allow the DOE to implement a new consent-based process for siting temporary storage and permanent geologic disposal facilities.

Restructure the Nuclear Waste Fund which has about $43 billion in it to ensure reliable and sufficient funding.

Create an independent board or similar mechanism to provide political insulation for a nuclear waste disposal program as well as continuity of leadership.

Direct DOE to develop a temporary waste management strategy that includes plans for the transportation interim storage and permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel.

It’s not as if officials don’t know what to do with nuclear waste. In 1957 the National Academy of Sciences concluded that disposal in a geologic formation was the safest way to isolate nuclear waste. Myriad studies in the decades since have reached the same conclusion.

“Congress needs to take action to break the impasse over a permanent solution for commercial spent nuclear fuel” the GAO said. “(I)t would be unethical to leave future generations responsible for addressing the problem … the generation that benefited from nuclear energy and created the waste has the responsibility to find a safe solution for disposing of (it).”

Canada Finland and Sweden have all made progress after similar impasses — Finland’s repository is slated to start operating in 2023 and Sweden’s in 2028. Canada spent almost 20 years Finland about 17 and Sweden more than 30 engaging with the public before selecting sites for permanent repositories.

Try try again

Some lawmakers say it’s not for lack of trying.

U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein teamed up with Sen. Lamar Alexander R-Tennessee to introduce the Nuclear Waste Administration Act in 2013 which would do much of what the GAO and others say needs to be done.

“This bipartisan bill — years in the making — will finally begin to address the dangerous expensive absence of a comprehensive nuclear waste policy” Feinstein said in the statement at the time. “In addition to creating an independent Nuclear Waste Administration to manage nuclear waste the bill authorizes the construction of interim storage facilities and permanent waste repositories sited through a consent-based process and funded by fees currently collected from nuclear power ratepayers.”

The bill didn’t get far. Alexander is no longer a senator. And officials in Feinstein’s office are working on the next move.

Over in the House of Representatives U.S. Rep. Mike Levin D-San Juan Capistrano has introduced legislation that would prioritize the removal of nuclear waste from places with high population and high seismic activity — that is San Onofre — and also pushed for $25 million for temporary storage.

He has formed a task force on San Onofre and Southern California Edison San Onofre’s operator has assembled a panel of local governments and businesses to push Congress for a solution as well.

“A federal solution to spent nuclear fuel management or at least one which encompasses a significant degree of federal support offers the surest and most achievable path to relocating the SONGS spent fuel” said Edison spokesman John Dobson by email.

Edison is encouraged by appropriations bills passed by the House and Senate that not only provide funding to restart the federal spent fuel management program but also authorize DOE to begin work on federal interim storage he said.

David Victor a professor at UC San Diego and chair of San Onofre’s volunteer Community Engagement Panel was one of the experts the GAO consulted for its report.

“This problem is first and foremost a failure of congressional action made possible in part by the fact that the nuclear waste problem has been easy for most communities to ignore” he said by email. “Only a relatively small number of communities are like ours — highly focused on this long-term challenge — but that is changing as more communities realize the need for action.”

‘We don’t have our act together’

Washington is difficult these days because of political polarization he said but there are ways to move the ball forward: Appropriate funds to the DOE for interim storage which is in progress with support from Feinstein Levin Rep. Scott Peters D-San Diego and others. The next level involves actual legislation which has proved difficult.

“That’s why the coalition here locally is so important because we need to find ways to support the relevant congressional delegations and to build support within other communities that also face problems of stranded spent fuel” Victor said. “That coalition needs as well to help give voice to communities that want to serve as interim storage sites — in Texas for example a community that is volunteering for this role is eclipsed now by statewide policies set far from the community.”

The NRC has granted one license for private interim storage in Texas but the state opposes it and the law right now doesn’t allow the DOE to tap the Nuclear Waste Fund to pay for private storage.

A looming challenge however is convincing communities that may want to host interim storage that interim is not forever.

“We need as well a longer-term repository for the nation” Victor said. “If Yucca Mountain is dead which seems to be the case then that means a different location (or locations) or a different technology. I am very concerned by the lack of much progress on that front — partly because the ghost of Yucca still stalks the policy debate and partly because there hasn’t been enough sustained pressure to find solutions.

“This is in sharp contrast to what has happened in Finland or Canada. We really don’t have our act together as a nation on this topic. Without a longer term plan interim may fail.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFicWpvdXJuYWwuY29tLzI0MzgxODAvd2hhdC13aGVuLWFuZC13aGVyZS10by10b3NzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What when and where to toss | Columns | abqjournal.com,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

The department further said that they had formed two groups. The first group -- engaged in digital marketing and campaign management -- carried search operations at 7 premises located in Bengaluru Surat Chandigarh and Mohali. While the second group was engaged in solid waste management which looked into comprising solid waste collection transportation processing and disposal services primarily catering to Indian municipalities.

The talent of course has always been there but the pathways and the encouragement too often have been missing. And it’s taken a special commitment and confidence from writers and filmmakers like Toa Fraser to ensure Māori and Pasifika storytellers take their place in reflecting and exploring brown lives. Here’s Toa chatting to Dale.

Bula vinaka! Thanks for all the neat work you’ve done over the years Toa. It’s a privilege to have a kōrero with you about life. To start can you tell us about your names and your village connections?

My name Toa is a word common across the Pacific. In Māori Sāmoan and Tongan it means the same thing: warrior. But given my dad Eugene Fraser was born in Fiji whenever I go back they say: “What? Chicken Fraser?” Because “toa” means chicken in Fijian.

But I was named after a guy named Toa Hutchinson who was the next-door neighbour of my uncle. He was a cheeky Sāmoan kid who my parents really loved. He’s a builder now and his sister Lonnie is an artist.

My middle name is Anthony which is my Uncle Tony’s name on my dad’s side. Dad had 12 brothers and sisters. They were an immigrant family from Fiji in the late 1940s or early ‘50s — quite early for Pacific Island families. They lived in Ponsonby originally but then they moved quite quickly to Mt Roskill. That’s where so much of my imagination has been for most of my life.

You were born in England right? How did that come about?

My dad had an incredible journey. He came here when he was seven and his family lived in a four-bedroom Housing Corp house in Mt Roskill. The legend is that he used to hide under the house reading books because he didn’t want anybody to see him reading. He’d also sneak off to the ballet and concerts. He had high-culture aspirations in that old school Eurocentric way.

Having only lived in Mt Roskill he learned to speak English in that old school received pronunciation way and he became a broadcaster in his late teens working for NZBC (New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation) in New Plymouth.

Then he met an English guy who was also a broadcaster and they became friends. Dad followed him to London. And he met my mum Linda Jennings through the glass window of the broadcasting studio. She was a sound technician from Essex.

So that’s how I came to be born in London.

I grew up in a very middle-class environment in an English country village with ducklings waddling across the road and a medieval church. I always felt a kind of displacement and it was a joy to me when we eventually came back as a family to Auckland in the 1980s.

Having worked for 25 years as a broadcaster for the BBC Dad ended up working at TVNZ with Tainui Stephens Whai Ngata Kingi Ihaka — some of the greats of Māori and Pasifika broadcasting. So it was my privilege as a teenager to be exposed to the mana of those men.

Did he have one of those rich Fijian voices? I had the luxury of doing stuff with Fiji Radio once and all the broadcasters had a rich deep voice.

Yes definitely. I have a recording of him reading the news during the SAS storming of the Iranian embassy in 1980 and yes he has one of those rich voices. He trained as an opera singer in Auckland as well with the woman who trained Dame Kiri Te Kanawa.

That would’ve been Sister Mary Leo.

That’s right. He grew up in a Catholic environment at Sacred Heart College.

Which is where you went?

True. It was a joy for me to go to that school because when I was a teenager there was a small but burgeoning group of Māori and Pacific boys at Sacred Heart and we all were pretty tight and would play touch every lunchtime.

That was a real freedom for me having grown up in England which felt so stifled. I always say the difference between school in England and here is shorts. Here we were encouraged to run around in bare feet and kick the ball around.

Sacred Heart also had a reputation for artistic endeavour didn’t it?

That’s right. The Finn brothers and Dave Dobbyn went through Sacred Heart but they were older than me. I wasn’t there at the time. But since then I’ve connected with them all and I’ve been grateful for that connection.

One of my mates at the time was Steve Tofa an incredible musician and storyteller. On weekends we’d hang out at his place in GI. We were both big movie fans — and we’d make up futuristic stories about a Sāmoan cop called Niko Thunderbolt.

I always wanted to work in movies. I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark when I was six years old with my grandmother and I was always drawn to that medium. But my dad was a storyteller too. Used to tell me stories of growing up in Fiji and Mt Roskill in ways that made those stories seem epic.

Part of the honour that I have doing what I do is knowing that I’ve come from a tradition of storytellers that goes back through the generations.

Was there a break between school and your first play which set you on a path to success?

My mother father sister Aisa and brother Ben and I all moved back to England after my high school years but I didn’t much like it. I played rugby which was awesome because I had learned well at Sacred Heart and enjoyed showing what I’d learned to the locals over there.

I worked for a while in a hotel in Scotland near Loch Ness. I’d applied for the job just randomly and then found that the place was on this Fraser tūrangawaewae.

But I didn’t last long in Britain. I wanted to come back to New Zealand. So I enrolled at Auckland University in the film studies department. It was in its infancy then. I was in the second year. I’d grown up with big blockbusters such as Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark but at university I got exposed to movies like Do the Right Thing which has been a key inspiration for me.

At the same time I was working at Village 8 on Broadway in Newmarket. I held down that job for four years and it was the most social and wonderful experience. The staff were Māori and Pacific Island people from all over Auckland and we had a great time rolling ice creams and watching movies.

Films like Casino and Heat and Braveheart and Apollo 13. For a film student there was no better education. Working in that environment I was inspired by a lot of the voices around that place and that’s where I began writing the play Bare which was an incredible success for me as a 23-year-old.

It was a fringe show very bare bones which is why we called it “Bare”. All we had was a stage and two actors: Madeleine Sami and Ian Hughes. Madeleine was very young at that time but just blew everyone away.

It was an interesting script looking at Fiji and matriarchy and it was lovely that you were able to weave something close to you into your first piece. How did you handle the acclaim because it took you around the world didn’t it?

Yeah it was crazy. It was real rock’n’roll times back in those days. I can remember sitting in the noodle shop that I used to always go to on Durham Lane with my $4.50 barbeque pork on rice the day after it opened.

And I overheard people at the next table saying: “I saw this great show Bare last night and we’re going to go again tonight.” And I knew at that moment that this would change my life. So I phoned Village 8 and handed in my resignation.

Bare went to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival then to the Sydney Opera House then all around the world. I was enjoying my collaboration with Madeleine so I quickly followed it up with my play No. 2 in which Madeleine played all the characters in a Fiji family in Mt Roskill. So that was even more personal than Bare.

That was probably the most rock’n’roll time of my life. We went from Edinburgh one day to Jamaica the next where we did workshops in Kingston with young people there.

That’s just one example of the crazy things we were able to do around that time.

What would you say about the global appeal of theatre like No. 2 and how people from other countries can warm to an idea that’s been generated far away?

No. 2 is exuberant. It was a celebration of family in the way that my family in Mt Roskill would celebrate. I think exuberance was a big part of the thing that audiences connected with. Madeleine took it to the extra level. It was incredible for such a young person to be commanding the stage in Edinburgh on the other side of the world.

Almost by default you’ve become mentors to others. What sense do you have of the wave of talent that is emerging?

The people who are coming through now are so clued-up compared to what I was when I was starting out. I’m thinking of people such as Hanelle Harris and Matasila Freshwater. They’re so on to it.

I think social media has a big part to play. Back in my day there was no social media when we were doing these things. The next generation is having these conversations political and creative — all of these storytelling conversations every day. This next generation is moving fast.

What role do film television and the creative sectors have in the overall empowerment of Pasifika people?

It’s vital. Someone was talking about Mai Time yesterday. I remember seeing that on TV when I was at university. We’d turn it on religiously every weekend. For our flat six of us at the time it was just wonderful to feel we were seeing ourselves on the screen.

But that was just once a week. It’s incredible to see how that has grown. There’s still a lot of growing to do but in terms of representation it’s vital that we have the opportunities to tell our stories.

I think the next step is to own our stories. Even though we’ve made great progress the power structure behind the production is still often not Māori or Pasifika practitioners or producers. That’s the work for our next generation.

You’ve been able to capture the down-home style of Pasifika communities. You also touch on unexpected areas such as ballet. How important is artistic diversity to you?

That’s a great question. I always quote that Walt Whitman poem: “I am large I contain multitudes.”

I feel like that was something my dad gave me too. He always used to say: “Be the fish that swims in different waters.” Don’t be content to be defined by boundaries within a box. I feel like that’s been a part of my career to say: “I may be from a particular background but I can tell stories all around the world.”

I remember Ranginui Walker coming up to me after he’d seen Dean Spanley at an awards ceremony at the University of Auckland and saying: “Kia ora Toa! Good on you for making that movie Dean Spanley.” I didn’t quite know why he was congratulating me. So I asked him and he said: “It’s because it’s English.”

Europeans had been coming to the Pacific for generations and telling our stories and maybe this was a version of somebody going there and telling their stories although it’s more complicated than that. But that’s always been part of my desire — to not get pigeonholed.

It’s important to me to feel that we’re as good as anyone else. You see Taika doing his great storytelling with the Marvel world and one of the ones that I always remember is Lee Tamahori’s name on the credits of The Sopranos. Can you imagine that? The Sopranos was such a groundbreaking show — and seeing Lee’s name there was mind-blowing at the time.

As it was to see yours on Penny Dreadful bro!

Haha thank you!

Can we touch on The Dead Lands for a moment? This programme broke new ground: action slow-mos and totally in te reo Māori. What made you move in that direction?

Matthew Metcalfe the producer I’d worked with on Dean Spanley. He had a script and worked on it with Glenn Standring. At the time I was looking to do something more athletic than I’d done before in movies. We talked about it and one of the things I suggested was that this should be done in te reo.

To his credit Matthew agreed. I was inspired by Rawiri Paratene (and others including my mate Xavier Horan) taking Troilus and Cressida in te reo to London’s Globe Theatre — and for me that was a real example of how a production like ours could be told in te reo. I also felt like if you were gonna tell this story it was important to tell it in the language appropriate to the story.

We were fortunate that Scotty Morrison came on board and not only did an incredible translation but he also supported the whole martial arts mau rākau aspect in terms of style — all the slow motion and blood spatter and Bruce Lee and that sort of stuff.

That was one of the most profound and meaningful projects that I’ve been involved in. It was not only profound in an intellectual and political way but also on a spiritual level.

There was a healthy wairua on the project that had little to do with me. It was largely from people like Tainui Stephens Jamus Webster and Te Kohe Tuhaka who brought everybody together and made the movie in such a healthy way.

Would you reflect briefly on the decision to go public about having early onset Parkinson’s disease and what challenges that has thrown up for you in your life?

A symptom of Parkinson’s that I’m affected by is my voice the softness of voice — and it’s ironic given that my dad had such a rich powerful voice.

One of the things that I’ve recently learned is that when you get diagnosed with Parkinson’s potentially you’ve been affected by it for 20 years. And I was self-conscious about my voice for a long time. What I’ve been able to do in my life is to use my more metaphorical voice in the way that I write and direct. I feel privileged that I’ve found myself in this sort of vocation. They both swim together these two elements Parkinson’s and director.

Getting the diagnosis has been a great thing in a way because I knew something was wrong but until that point I didn’t know what it was.

That Penny Dreadful episode that you mentioned was my first episode of TV and that happened at the peak of my undiagnosed Parkinson’s symptoms. Only a couple of months after I did that I got diagnosed and since then I’ve had the most productive and fulfilling few years as a director wandering around the world working on some incredible projects.

There’s nothing like an incurable brain disease to give you focus. I feel lucky that I’ve been able to continue to work in the way that I have.

That comes back to the production I’ve been involved in for the last year Sweet Tooth which is the thing that brought me back home. I feel very grateful for that because I’m able to be here and take care of my kids and learn to live with the Parkinson’s more — and also to do more work with the younger generation.

There’ve been many accolades directed your way and justifiably but maybe there’s something else you’d like to share — a moment where it all came together telling you how good it is to be alive.

I have great memories of the summer of 2005 when we made No.2 in the backyard in Mt Roskill. It was a real community whānau experience.

We had the feast with the pig in the backyard in the movie which we shot over five days. We needed a new pig each day and my aunty was in charge of distributing the pork to the neighbours — and we were very popular because we were feeding people.

That time when we were a young group of brown people telling a story that was personal had so much meaning for each of us.

Also there was the honour of having Ruby Dee come from New York with her incredible history and experience. One of the most memorable days of my career would have to be the day she arrived in Auckland. I’d been dreaming of making movies for a long time and when she arrived that was a day that I felt I could rip out one of the happy vouchers in the limited book of happy vouchers that you get in a career. We were going to work together on a movie.

Then the next day I got a call from the producer Tim White saying: “We’re gonna have to fold the movie. Ossie Davis died last night and Ms Dee has to go back to New York and be with her family.”

I went to see Ms Dee as she was leaving. At the time we had no idea if she would be back. But she said: “I’m looking forward to coming back and celebrating life with you.”

She was 85 at the time and she’d never been away from Ossie her husband for as long as she would’ve been had the movie gone ahead. But she returned to New York and attended the funeral — and they dimmed the lights on Broadway.

Then she came back two weeks later to Mt Roskill and we held a feast for her in the backyard of my aunty and uncle’s place.

One of the things she said is this: ”You have to use your voice or somebody else will use it for you.” That’s been something that I’ve adhered to since then and I always offer it to other practitioners as well.

Is there anything else you’d like to share with us? We know you as a filmmaker but you also have other roles and commitments. What do you do to keep your zest for life Toa?

Well the film industry can be stressful especially when you’re freelance. So I’ve done yoga for a long time. And I’m enjoying the vegetable garden and working on my basketball jump shot.

I’ve also enjoyed taking photos this winter particularly around Sandringham and Mt Roskill where I’m living. Lots of other stuff: poetry music eating. I’m a pretty good cook and I do make a good corned beef curry.

Jaideep Sebastian a driver with the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation drove a bus through a flooded area near the St Mary’s Church Poonjar on way to Erattupetta on Saturday.

While navigating the waters the bus came to a stop and passengers had to be evacuated by local residents as waters reached up to the passenger window sides of the bus.

Sebastian was suspended later on Saturday by the KSRTC officials on instructions from the state transport minister Antony Raju.

Sebastian however chose to hit back in public against his bosses saying he was suspended for actually trying to save the passengers and that he cared two hoots for being suspended.

He wrote on social media: “The superhit news now in newspapers too The guys who were reluctant to grant me leave when I asked for it can now get someone else to drive. Or let him drive himself. Let me look after my household and get some rest.”

Sebastian added more colour to his post with a video showing himself playing the tabla.

Betty Lynn the actress who portrayed Thelma Lou the wholesome girlfriend of Don Knotts’ Barney Fife on The Andy Griffith Show has died. She was 95.

Lynn died Saturday after a short illness in Mount Airy North Carolina where she lived in a retirement home. She had moved to the birthplace of Andy Griffith — now home to the Andy Griffith Museum where she regularly signed autographs and delighted fans — in 2006. The museum announced her death.

Before her most famous role the red-haired Lynn appeared in such films as June Bride (1948) and Cheaper by the Dozen (1950) as a contract player at 20th Century Fox. Lynn was starring as the wife of Tom Tryon’s title character on Texas John Slaughter part of ABC’s The Wonderful World of Disney when she auditioned to play the girlfriend of the neurotic deputy.

She joined the comedy near the end of its first season in 1961 and went on to appear on 26 episodes getting $500 per show (she never had a contract). When Knotts exited the sitcom to focus on his movie career — Barney was written out having left Mayberry to join the police department in Raleigh North Carolina — Lynn departed too.

The pair returned at a Mayberry High School reunion (class of ’48) for the January 1966 episode “The Return of Barney Fife” in which Barney hopes to rekindle his love affair with Thelma Lou but is crushed to be introduced to her husband. It would mark her final appearance on the series.

However on the 1986 NBC telefilm Return to Mayberry Thelma Lou (now divorced) and Barney finally do get married.

Lynn reunited with Griffith one more time to play his secretary on a handful of first-season episodes of NBC’s Matlock in 1986.

Betty Lynn was born on Aug. 29 1926 in Kansas City Missouri. Her mother Elizabeth was a singer who performed with the Chicago opera. Her mom enrolled her in the Kansas City Conservatory of Music at age 5 and she sang on the radio and in supper clubs as a teenager.

When she turned 18 Lynn was hired by the USO and sent to New York and then to China Burma and India to perform in a variety show for the troops “as the girl next door” where she would “sing in the hospitals and talk to the fellas and visit with them” she said.

After eight months with the USO she appeared in the Broadway-bound comedy Park Avenue where she was spotted by a Fox talent scout and signed by the studio. She came to Los Angeles with her mom and made her big-screen bow in the family comedy Sitting Pretty (1948) starring Robert Young Maureen O’Hara and Clifton Webb.

She then played the youngster sister of Barbara Bates’ character in June Bride starring Bette Davis and Robert Montgomery and the daughters of Loretta Young in Mother Is a Freshman (1949) and Fred MacMurray and O’Hara in Father Was a Fullback (1949).

After working again with Webb in Cheaper by the Dozen and with Davis in Payment on Demand (1951) Lynn returned to New York and performed frequently on live TV which she said derailed her movie career.

“The studios hated television” she noted. “When they asked me what I had been doing I said ‘I’ve been doing live television it’s absolutely wonderful it’s like doing a play!’ They’d all just freeze. I didn’t understand that they were having great difficulty because people were staying home instead of going to the movies. I was making a complete fool of myself.”

She played Ray Bolger’s sister-in-law in 1953-54 on the ABC show Where’s Raymond? had small parts in such films as Gun for a Coward (1956) and Meet Me in Las Vegas (1956) and guest-starred on series including Wagon Train Lawman and Tales of Wells Fargo before her gig on Texas John Slaughter.

Lynn also had recurring roles on Family Affair and My Three Sons and showed up on episodes of The Farmer’s Daughter Mod Squad Little House on the Prairie Police Story and Barnaby Jones.

She said she moved to Mount Airy after her longtime home in Los Angeles was twice burglarized.

A private burial service is planned in Culver City the Andy Griffith Museum said and a memorial service will be announced later.

Donations in her memory may be made to the Betty Lynn Scholarship Endowment (for students pursuing a career in dance or acting) or the Barbara and Emmett Forrest Endowment Fund (for the Andy Griffith Museum and Mayberry Days) both in care of Surry Arts Council P.O.

Credit Suisse suffered losses of close to US$5.5 billion from the default of Archegos Capital Management. In the latest in a series of articles Bob Currie reports on the role played by a lack of effective risk technology and failure to learn lessons from past defaults

The market value of Archegos Capital Management’s investment holdings fell sharply during the week of 22 March 2021 driven by a slide in the price of a number of single-name tech stocks particularly ViacomCBS in which Archegos had a large and heavily leveraged position. This triggered a chain reaction that resulted ultimately in the hedge fund’s default.



A 170-page report by a Credit Suisse Group special committee makes detailed and critical observations about the engagements of the investment bank and specifically its prime services division with Archegos in the lead up to the fund’s closure.



The report analysed in a series of articles in Securities Finance Times presents the findings of a Credit Suisse Group Special Committee on behalf of its board of directors into the circumstances that led to the Archegos’s collapse and the large financial losses and reputational damage sustained by the investment bank (subsequently referred to as the ‘Special Committee report’).



This event resulted in combined losses of more than US$10 billion for the prime services divisions of global investment banks including Credit Suisse (CS) Morgan Stanley Nomura and UBS.



Learning lessons



Among the major conclusions to emerge from this report covered in the first part of this article published in SFT Issue 284 on 17 August 2021 the investigation found that CS had failed to learn from past risk situations.



For example in March 2020 CS sustained a US$214 million loss following the default of Malachite Capital Management another hedge fund which was a client of CS’ equity derivatives business. Like Archegos Malachite’s transactions were statically margined (for further discussion see SFT Issue 284). Both buy-side firms had losses substantially exceeding their potential exposure (PE) and stress scenario limits.



Although circumstances leading to the Malachite default in March 2020 differed in significant ways from those that precipitated Archegos’s collapse there were also commonalities (see box opposite). Some remedial action had been implemented after Malachite but other fundamental issues that CS had failed to tackle also re-emerged with Archegos.At the heart of this failure the Special Committee finds that “CS failed to address a culture that encouraged excessive risk-taking and injudicious cost cutting as well as a complex and siloed organisational structure that impeded the swift identification understanding and escalation of risk” (p 30).



This culture prevailed even though Malachite apparently generated relatively modest revenue — US$6.9 million over the term of the relationship — relative to the risk borne by CS (p 15). The Special Committee drew a similar conclusion with regard to the Archegos default 12 months later.



Following the investigation led by its Internal Audit team CS took steps to ensure that its equity derivatives division did not service other clients with profiles similar to Malachite. This process also triggered a programme known internally as Project Copper intended to improve the bank’s ability to identify early warning of a default event and to reinforce controls and escalation procedures with a primary focus on OTC derivatives transactions.



Among other changes Project Copper created a new committee the Investment Bank (IB) Counterparty Oversight Committee (CPOC) co-chaired by the IB chief risk officer and its chief operating officer along with senior IB executives including the global head of equities.



At the instruction of the CRM team (see box below) Archegos was one of a small number of counterparties that were discussed at the initial CPOC meeting held in September 2020. Significantly neither of the co-heads of the prime services division — the division within CS containing prime brokerage and prime financing sub-units which had the largest exposure to Archegos — were CPOC members and neither was asked to attend the meeting.



The committee report notes that in practice CPOC did not discuss Archegos again for a further six months not until 8 March 2021 and by this time the client’s risk exposure had surged dramatically (for a more detailed analysis see SFT 284).



In the meantime during the autumn of 2020 Archegos’s swap business was migrated from one UK-based CS entity Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd (CSSEL) to another Credit Suisse International (CSi) with the transfer completing in December 2020. This the report notes was partly an attempt to wind down CSSEL. However in so doing it also transferred the client’s activity to an entity (CSi) that had a “higher stress scenario appetite” — a tolerance for larger risk exposure to the hedge fund counterparty (p 17).



The CRM reportedly backed a case for an accommodative approach indicating that Archegos was a “significant relationship” for the prime services division and given that Archegos was also doing business with other prime brokers across the Street a sudden margin increase could potentially result in “irreversible damage to the client relationship” (ibid).



Mixed messages



Following an annual credit review of Archegos at the end of 2020 CRM took the decision to downgrade Archegos’s credit rating from BB- to B+ thereby placing the hedge fund in the bottom third of CS’ hedge fund counterparties by credit rating (p 18).



But even while downgrading Archegos’s credit rating CRM recommended raising Archegos’s potential exposure limit from US$20 million to US$50 million — advice that was a departure from the bank’s standard position that a B+ rated hedge fund should typically have maximum PE of no more than US$10 million.



In February 2021 the business began taking steps to move Archegos to dynamic margining. However internal calculations (provided by the software engineering team responsible for transitioning clients to dynamic margining platforms) estimated that under CS’s existing prime brokerage dynamic margining framework this would require the fund manager to post an additional US$3 billion in margin raising the total margin for its swaps portfolio to US$4 billion.



Fearing the impact this would have on the business relationship the head of Prime Services Risk (PSR) proposed applying a more forgiving dynamic margining framework for Archegos — one that would create an average margin of 16.3 per cent requiring the client to post an additional US$1.3 billion on implementation. A written proposal was sent to Archegos on 24 February but it was ignored by the hedge fund the report says despite repeated follow up from CS (p 20).



Archegos default



The value of Archegos’s concentrated positions dropped rapidly in the week of 22 March 2021 reversing the upwards momentum that these positions had experienced for several months leading up to its default. The price of its largest position ViacomCBS fell 6.7 per cent on 22 March and further in the days that followed. US$600 million in excess margin that the fund manager had with CS on 23 March was eliminated by these movements in the market and CS requested a further US$175 million in variation margin (VM) which Archegos paid (p 22).



With the valuation of another significant long position Tencent Music Entertainment Group falling 20 per cent on 24 March CS took a decision to issue a US$2.7 billion VM call the following day. Responding to this request Archegos’s COO told CS’ co-heads of prime services and its head of equities that evening that the buy-side firm did not have sufficient liquidity to meet margin calls the following day to CS or its other prime brokers.



In the course of 25 March CS’s legal department prepared Event of Default notifications setting into play CS’s contractual right to demand full return of all outstanding balances in case of a default including any failure to pay margin when it was required (p 125).



By the evening on the 25th March Archegos informed its prime brokers on a group call that although it had US$9 to $10 billion in equity it had US$120 billion in gross exposure (US$70 billion long US$50 billion short). It asked its prime brokers to enter into a standstill agreement whereby these PBs would not push Archegos into default while it took steps to wind down its positions. The hedge fund indicated that it was committed to making all PB and swap counterparties whole by liquidating assets to cover the shortfall owed to each dealer. However it said that it needed to liquidate assets carefully so as to “not tip the market”.



In the face of this request CS indicated that it remained firm in its commitment to issue a termination notice which it sent by email the same evening and by hand delivery on 26 March specifying 26 March as the termination date.



On the morning of 26 March CS was approached by Archegos and told that Goldman Sachs was executing block sales of some ADR positions and invited CS to be involved. CS subsequently participated in three Goldman Sachs-led block trades selling stock in Baidu Tencent and Vipshop Holdings (p 127).



Alongside this CS indicates it executed algorithmic trading on that day designed to stay within 2-3 per cent of average daily volume. It ultimately sold slightly more than US$3 billion notional on 26 March approximately US$1.25 billion being sold through Goldman Sachs block sales.



Archegos and its PBs held another call on 27 March including CS Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs Nomura UBS Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank. The fund manager again asked for a forbearance agreement.



Without Archegos in attendance these PBs discussed the potential for a managed liquidation where PBs would send positions for review to an independent counsel or other trusted third party and lenders would be offered a percentage range within which they would be allowed to liquidate their overlapping positions.



CS Nomura and UBS indicated their interest in moving ahead with this managed liquidation. Several other banks including Deutsche Bank Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to be involved (p 128).



The Special Committee report indicates that on 28 March CS stepped into a managed liquidation agreement with UBS and Nomura. Following this agreement CS liquidated approximately US$3 billion through block sales of overlapping positions on 5 April and US$2.2 billion on 14 April 2021. It liquidated other Archegos positions through open-market algo trading — and by 22 April 2021 it had liquidated 97 per cent of its Archegos exposure (p 128).



CS indicates in line with its public reporting that it lost US$5.5 billion as a direct outcome of the Archegos default and the subsequent unwind. Drawing on public information it indicates that Nomura lost close to US$2.5 billion Morgan Stanley approximately US$1 billion and UBS lost US$774 million.



Deutsche Bank Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo are reported to have suffered “immaterial losses” (p 129)



Plain sight



As reported in the preceding section of this article Credit Suisse’s internal investigation into the Archegos failure arrived at the following damning conclusion: “no one at CS — not the traders not the in-business risk managers not the senior business executives not the credit risk analysts and not the senior risk officers — appeared to fully appreciate the serious risks that Archegos’s portfolio posed to CS (p 129).



These risks it notes were not hidden. They were in plain sight from at least September 2020 when CPOC first met and CS senior leaders discussed Archegos’s concentrated long-biased volatile equity swap positions. “Yet no one at the bank acted swiftly and decisively to try to mitigate the risks posed by Archegos. And when CS finally took steps to mitigate the risks the actions it took were ineffective too little and too late”.



It concludes that the business should never have put on such large concentrated positions with Archegos particularly without securing adequate margin. It indicates that the prime services business was aware that Archegos’s portfolio was highly concentrated and also that its portfolio holdings with CS were severely undermargined (p 131).



For example at a CPOC meeting on 8 March 2021 a representative from the bank’s client risk management (CRM) team indicated that Archegos was an outlier in the prime financing swap book with gross market value (GMV) exposures of US$20 billion when compared to the next largest client of US$5 billion. CRM also noted that Archegos had a net-long bias at this time of more than US$7 billion compared to the next-largest long-biased client at US$1.5 billion (p 20).



The CPOC also flagged up Archegos’s single issuer concentration including a US$3.3 billion position which represented more than 8 per cent of the outstanding free float. At this meeting CPOC discussed potential difficulties in liquidating Archegos’s portfolio should this become necessary given the size and concentration of these positions.



Additionally the business missed multiple opportunities to “right-size” Archegos risk. Prime services saw its relationship with the fund manager as “significant” contributing revenue of US$16 million in 2020 and this was expected to rise to US$40 million in 2021 on the basis of appreciation in Archegos’s positions. The business was intent on growing its relationship with the hedge fund recognising that it was competing for this business with multiple other prime brokers (p 133). Consequently the business pushed for an “accommodative approach” to risk refusing to take forceful steps and remaining reluctant to have difficult conversations with and about Archegos.



Risk employees failed to appreciate Archegos’s true risk despite a series of red flags says the Special Committee report. (p 138) CRM learned from Archegos that other prime brokers were charging higher margins and were dynamically margining Archegos’s swaps portfolio. CRM also had access to non-public information confirming that Archegos had concentrated exposure to the same single-name positions with other prime brokers as it held with Credit Suisse (p 27).



“This information — that Archegos maintained similar positions across the Street that CS was the only PB using static margining and that CS’s margin rates were lower than those of other PBs — should have sounded alarm bells” says the report (p 138).” The CRM employees that were privy to this information did not appear to appreciate its importance and failed to escalate the information to more senior risk or business managers.



A similar myopia applies to Archegos’s limit breaches. Rather than viewing the breaches as symptomatic of a much larger problem CRM and the prime services business were focused on eliminating the breaches without considering the larger significance.



Consequently the CRM did not insist that the business take immediate steps to reduce Archegos’s exposure — by having Archegos sell down its concentrated positions and reduce its portfolio — and instead resorted to “superficial fixes” such as raising Archegos’s PE limit from US$20 million to US$50 million and raising Archegos’s scenario limit from US$250 million to US$500 million (p 139).



Technology and data failures



The Special Committee finds that the prime services business did not prioritise investment in technology that would have assisted in managing risk more effectively. The PSR had identified a relatively inexpensive fix for bullet swaps that subject to the client’s consent would have automatically recalculated IM based on the current mark-to-market value of the portfolio. This fix would have cost approximately US$150000 — a relatively small investment given the size of Credit Suisse’s subsequent losses against its Archegos exposure — but the business did not prioritise or fund this (p 146).



It was also slow to adopt automated technology that would have enabled it to dynamically margin swaps. Despite the systems limitation the Special Committee says that dynamic margining could have been agreed with Archegos at any time and implemented manually — even though this would have been cumbersome and time consuming for CS to operate.



CS already had an automated means to margin swaps dynamically (through cross-margining with prime brokerage) when these were conducted in the same legal entity. However the systems for dynamically margining were inadequate within CS for clients such as Archegos whose swaps and PB accounts were held with different legal entities (see SFT Issue 284 for further discussion).



Notwithstanding by September 2020 CS had developed the capacity to dynamically margin swaps regardless of whether the client had a PB account or in which legal entity this account was held. However the Special Committee finds that Archegos was not on the list of clients that the business had prioritised for transition to dynamic margining despite the increasing risks presented by this client (p 147).



More generally the report finds that risk divisions had struggled with “fragmented ineffective technology” during the year leading up to the Archegos default along with data quality issues that impaired its ability to assess counterparty and portfolio credit risk in a timely manner. “These issues were well known but not sufficiently addressed before the Archegos default” says the report.



For example the systems employed by the CRM team only displayed a counterparty’s aggregate portfolio and not individual position data. This impeded CRM’s ability to see full details of the risks presented by a client. Further CRM only received verified data for scenario limit breaches on a monthly basis — although it could access “rough” scenario data twice per week. “This posed ‘undue risks’ given that Prime Services had a number of hedge fund clients with volatile positions that could change significantly intra-monthly” concludes the report (p 147-8).





In managing its relationships with buy-side clients CS indicates that it operates multiple lines of risk defence. The business unit in this case the prime services division provides the first layer of defence with each business employee directly responsible for protecting the bank against losses. Prime services maintains an in-house risk management unit named Prime Services Risk (PSR) that among other duties sets margin rates and manages other risk controls in dialogue with traders and clients.A bank-level risk division Credit Risk Management (CRM) provides a second line of defence responsible for evaluating credit risk across all of the investment bank’s business lines while acting independently of any individual business unit. This includes conducting annual counterparty risk reviews assigning an internal credit rating to the counterparty and setting counterparty trading limits for the prime services division and other business units."

Kyrsten Sinema strung out on Big Pharma's money?,"Every politician to one degree or another is an addict.

They get hooked on power. The euphoria. The rush.

And once they’ve had it once they’ve felt it they develop a need to keep it to maintain it to increase it. The dependence can become overwhelming. Captivating. Irresistible.

But power does not come cheap.

And the drug of choice for anyone strung out on political prestige is … money.

Last week with the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package stalled in Congress Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema went on a fundraising trip to Europe.

Nice gig right?

But when the need for campaign cash appears to supersede the wearisome duties of public office is it time for an intervention?

Sinema has the power to reduce drug prices

Sinema is one of two Democrats (with Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia) holding up passage of the reconciliation bill which includes things like increasing taxes on the wealthiest Americans and allowing Medicare using its bulk purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices.

Prior to her election to the Senate Sinema tweeted:

“We need to make health care more affordable lower prescription drug prices and fix the problems in the system – not go back to letting insurance companies call all the shots.”

Since then however Sinema has been the recipient of huge amounts of campaign cash from those connected to the pharmaceutical industry.

The Kaiser Health News even called her a “pharma favorite in Congress.”

Some reports have her receiving as much as $750000 in drug company related contributions which has left many wondering if that’s why she’s not supporting the reconciliation bill.

Sen. Bernie Sanders indirectly called her out saying “Take a hard look at those people who are opposed to strong legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs and take a look at their campaign-finance reports. See where they get their money how many of them get their money from the pharmaceutical industry and the executives there. And I think there will be a direct correlation.”

Another colleague California Democratic Rep. Scott Peters said “Senator Sinema is not yet for any proposal to deal with prescription drugs.”

Both Sinema and her staff remain cagey on the issue however.

She told The Arizona Republic recently “I believe that my colleagues and I should be focused on policies that ensure prescription drugs are available at the lowest cost possible.”

OK then define exactly what that means.

It's time to assert that famous independence

Does she support Medicare negotiating drug prices?

Does she support making $2000 the maximum Medicare recipients should pay for drugs in a year? (That’s also in the bill.)

Throughout her career Sinema has touted her sense of independence from outside influences.

If that’s true then assert it.

Go cold turkey on the campaign cash addiction. Support the reconciliation package and squelch all the innuendo about Big Pharma’s influence.

That would be a good start – although this being politics the temptation the cravings will persist. It’s like the writer Anne Lamott once said about addiction “You can get the monkey off your back but the circus never leaves town.”

Western Digital tubes its loyal customers for profit

Big tech companies either exist to develop great technology or to just profit off of their unreliable profits. Western Digital has made its priority profits pulling the rug out from hundreds of millions of dollars of MyCloud hard drives sold to consumers over the years in an effort to force you to spend more money and buy a bigger more expensive replacement. Rather than fix their OS they would rather profiteer

By Ray Hanania

Western Digital has made fortune selling unreliable hard drives to the public for years. I’ve tried them and have always been disappointed.

I purchased one to manage my home files (over $200) because Western Digital bragged that you could access it from anywhere. But it became clear pretty quickly that was a lie.

At first you could access the files remotely like a drive on your computer. Then last year that stopped working. They forced you to visit their website in order to access your files.

Now they want you to purchase a new hard drive for your 100 TB of data and photos you have been saving believing you had a good and secure system to base your family’s data.

Not true obviously.

Western Digital sent out this email this week explaining how their systems will no longer work. They did cash your checks and payments though. To add insult to injury they are offering a 20 percent discount if you would go out and spend another rofrutne for another updated hard drive that I am sure in a few years will stop working too.

Support for your My Cloud device is changing

Western Digital continuously evaluates and improves our hardware software and services as security standards evolve. As a result we’ve determined that it’s necessary to end support for prior generations of My Cloud OS including My Cloud OS 3. You should act now to protect your content.

On April 15 2022 support for prior generations of My Cloud OS including My Cloud OS 3 will end. Your device isn’t compatible with critical security updates that are only available for My Cloud OS 5-compatible devices. As a result you’ll only be able to access it locally. After April 15 2022 your device will no longer receive remote access security updates or technical support. To help protect your content we recommend that you back up your device disconnect it from the internet and protect it with a strong unique password. Check out our recent My Cloud updates to learn more.

Thank you for being a long-time Western Digital customer. We understand that your content is important to you and we appreciate that you trust us to help you preserve it.

To show our appreciation we’re sending you a 20% discount coupon in January 2022 that you can use toward an eligible device. Keep your eye out for another email from us with information about that discount.

Sincerely

My Cloud Team

It’s not “changing.” The correct word is “collapsing.” Make sure not to get sucked into either their MyCLoud hard drives or their My Book” hard drives. You will get screwed in the end.

BofA Securities Citigroup Global Markets and VTB Capital (VTBC) will act as joint lead book-running managers while Banco Santander Renaissance Securities and Sberbank CIB will be joint bookrunners the company said cited by Reuters.

A pioneer of the Russian car-sharing market since 2015 Delimobil now operates in Russia as well as Czechia Kazakhstan and Belarus under the brands Delimobil Anytime and Anytime Prime. Last year Delimobil’s Russian car-sharing business generated RUB5.3bn with a net loss of RUB2.4bn (around $73mn and $33mn respectively at the average exchange rate of the year) according to Spark.Interfax data cited by the Russian media.

Delimobil has just become the car-sharing leader in Moscow city – ahead of traditional leader Yandex.Drive – with a market share estimated at 41.5% this month according to city government data cited by Bank of America. Other companies operating in Moscow include BelkaCar and Citidrive (formerly YouDrive which Mail.ru Group took control of in 2019).

In July this year VTB Capital (VTBC) a division of the state bank VTB paid $75mn to acquire a 15% stake in Delimobil valuing the company at $500mn. Delimobil said it would use the fresh funding for further developments and a stronger position on the Russian market.

VTB Group had been a partner of Delimobil since 2019 providing leasing financing for the expansion of its vehicle fleet. Car-sharing (also spelt ‘carsharing’) consists in renting cars for short periods often by the hour. The owner of the cars may be an operator or private individuals renting their own vehicle. Car-sharing should not be confused with ride-hailing (e.g. Uber) or car-pooling (e.g. BlaBlaCar).

As ESPN PR’s Mike Soltys shared in the first link there (an Aug. 2 Bristol Press piece on the Disney mandate which was set to kick in this month) ESPN actually put in an earlier mandate of Aug. 1 for the people working live events for them. That included sideline reporters like Allison Williams.

Williams shared on Twitter last month that she wasn’t on the sidelines for ESPN’s college football coverage due to that mandate for live events staffers. With the wider corporate mandate now kicking in unvaccinated employees have now had to make a further choice. Some like Sage Steele have grudgingly gotten a vaccine after previously bashing it. Others like Williams are choosing to leave the company instead. Williams revealed that decision in a five-minute video posted to her Instagram page Friday:

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Allison Williams (@allisonw_espn)

A full transcription of Williams’ comments follows. End notes reflect unsourced statements Williams makes that do not align with current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on COVID-19 vaccines with those guidelines based on peer-reviewed scientific research. Links to specific information on those claims are available after the transcription. For now though here’s a transcription of what Williams said:

“So I know I’ve been a bit mum since releasing the statement I put out a few months ago on my decision to not receive the COVID-19 vaccine. I just want to give everyone an update on my situation with ESPN. A great producer once told me ‘Don’t bury the lede.’ So I have been denied my request for accommodation by ESPN and the Walt Disney Company and effective next week I will be separated from the company.”

“First of all thank you everyone who reached out texted emailed called messaged me. I can’t tell you how much light it brought in a really dark and difficult time. And I’ve also had a lot of people and women in particular reach out and share their stories in regards to fertility and getting the injection. And to the women who got it and are having successful pregnancies and have babies in their arms I am beyond thrilled for you. Congratulations; that’s amazing and terrific and I believe you. To the women who have reached out and shared their experiences of getting the injection and subsequent miscarriages and menstrual irregularities periods after menopause I am so sorry that that is your experience and I pray for you and I believe you.”

“Belief is a word I’ve been thinking about a lot lately because in addition to the medical apprehensions regarding my desire to have another child in regards to receiving this injection¹ I am also so morally and ethically not aligned with this. And I’ve had to really dig deep and analyze my values and my morals and ultimately I need to put them first. And the irony in all this is that a lot of these same values and morals that I hold dear are what made me a really good employee what helped with the success that I’m able to have in my career.”

“And it wasn’t that long ago that those values were aligned with the Walt Disney Company. In April they sent out an email to all cast members as they call employees saying that they believed the vaccine was the best way forward but ultimately it was a personal decision. Their values have clearly changed.”

“I understand that. I don’t know what it’s like to run a multimillion-dollar company and have shareholders and board members and financial quotas to answer to not to mention societal and political pressure. So I respect that their values have changed. I had hoped that they would respect that mine did not.”

“Ultimately I cannot put a paycheck over principle. And I will not sacrifice something that I believe and hold so strongly to maintain a career.”

“A lot of people have brought up the moral obligation receiving the vaccine is to being a good citizen. And I weighed that and I thought about the implications. We all want to be good neighbors. We all want to end this pandemic. But ultimately an injection that does not stop transmission and spread² for me does not weigh in morally.”

“So I want to just say to that I know I’m not the only one walking away from a career they love a profession that is a passion. And so many people that are in the same situation as me serving society and benefiting this country in ways I could never do they are nurses they are teachers they are doctors they are police officers and first responders and they are most importantly our military and pilots. And they too are choosing to put their beliefs first. And I just want you all to know I stand with you.”

“But I also want people to know who support these mandates that I will fight for you. Because if this is the direction we take our country there will come a time when the government or corporations mandate you to get something that does not align with your values. Power given is seldom returned. And when that day comes I want you to at least know that we fought and we tried.”

“I don’t know what the future holds obviously for any of us. I’m trying to wrap my head around the thought that the largest game I’ve worked in my career the national championship game might be the last game I work. But I’m going to focus on what I have to be thankful for. I’m going to hold on to my faith. I’m going to pray that things get better and that I can see you on the television set in some capacity in some stadium covering some game soon. Until then God bless and I’m going to go hug my baby.”

Notes: 1: Williams discusses “medical apprehensions regarding my desire to have another child in regards to receiving this injection.” From the CDC:

COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all people 12 years and older including people who are pregnant breastfeeding trying to get pregnant now or might become pregnant in the future.

Evidence about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy has been growing. These data suggest that the benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any known or potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy.

There is currently no evidence that any vaccines including COVID-19 vaccines cause fertility problems in women or men.

Pregnant and recently pregnant people are more likely to get severely ill with COVID-19 compared with non-pregnant people.

Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can protect you from severe illness from COVID-19.

2: Williams discusses “an injection that does not stop transmission and spread.” From a more general part of a CDC Delta variant page:

The COVID-19 vaccines approved or authorized in the United States are highly effective at preventing severe disease and death including against the Delta variant. But they are not 100% effective and some fully vaccinated people will become infected (called a breakthrough infection) and experience illness. For all people the vaccine provides the best protection against serious illness and death. Vaccines are playing a crucial role in limiting spread of the virus and minimizing severe disease. Although vaccines are highly effective they are not perfect and there will be vaccine breakthrough infections. Millions of Americans are vaccinated and that number is growing. This means that even though the risk of breakthrough infections is low there will be thousands of fully vaccinated people who become infected and able to infect others especially with the surging spread of the Delta variant. Low vaccination coverage in many communities is driving the current rapid surge in cases involving the Delta variant which also increases the chances that even more concerning variants could emerge. Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself your family and your community. High vaccination coverage will reduce spread of the virus and help prevent new variants from emerging. CDC recommends that everyone aged 12 years and older get vaccinated as soon as possible.

Beyond that yes of course like most vaccines the approved COVID-19 vaccines do not stop all transmission and spread. Fully-vaccinated people can still be infected (in a breakthrough case). And there is some research suggesting that infected fully-vaccinated people can still spread the disease as much as infected unvaccinated people based on viral-load data; the CDC discussed this in July as part of a revision to their masking policies. But that does not override the effectiveness of vaccines; a fully-vaccinated person is less likely to have the disease transmitted to them in the first place so they’re less likely to transmit it on to anyone else. And a fully-vaccinated person is less likely to get a severe case requiring hospitalization which reduces strain on the healthcare system.

In the end Williams can absolutely choose not to get vaccinated. But that’s a choice that’s in direct conflict with the Disney and ESPN vaccine policy so her departure isn’t surprising. And as for her being in some stadium covering some game soon current federal requirements are that all companies with more than 100 workers either require vaccinations or test unvaccinated employees for COVID-19 weekly. That would be much of the broadcasting world.

Companies can go beyond that weekly level of testing too. For example Fox Sports parent company 21st Century Fox (where 90-plus percent of the employees were vaccinated by September) tests unvaccinated employees daily. And there are many further requirements for people working at events both from broadcasters and from teams or leagues. So it may not be easy to find an outlet that will let Williams do sideline reporting without getting vaccinated or teams and leagues that will allow an unvaccinated sideline reporter on the field.

The college football and basketball sideline reporter who announced last month she was opting out of the season because she had not received the vaccine as she and her husband tried for a second child said Friday night that her “request for accommodation” had been denied.

Effective next week Williams said she will be “separated from the company.”

“And the irony in all this is that a lot of those same values and principals I hold so dear are what made me a really good employee and probably helped with the success that I’ve been able to have in my career.”

Williams 37 has been at ESPN since 2011. She said she was trying to wrap her head around the idea that the national championship in January might have been the last college football game she will work.

According to the CDC there is no evidence that shows any COVID-19 vaccines cause fertility problems.

Disney’s vaccine mandate — which also drew criticism from “SportsCenter” host Sage Steele who eventually got vaccinated — is set go into effect on Friday.

After years of hope future of north Strip still in flux

The north edge of the Strip for years a sleepy stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard got a big boost of momentum this year.

Resorts World Las Vegas debuted in June to an estimated crowd of 20000 visitors and 5000 VIPs. Huge crowds waited outside to get in on opening night and the 3500-room casino resort generated nearly $15 million in revenue during its first six days developer Genting Group reported.

Locals have long predicted better days ahead for the north Strip in large part because of Resorts World. But as a burst of news showed this week the area’s future is still in flux.

Marriott International confirmed Thursday that it reached an “amicable settlement” with the owner of the unfinished former Fontainebleau that resulted in the hotel chain exiting the long-stalled casino project which got started during the mid-2000s bubble and has yet to open.

Florida developer Jeffrey Soffer’s firm Fontainebleau Development which acquired the property in February said in a statement that as it “moves forward with the project in Las Vegas we feel it is important to make clear that upon opening the hotel will be managed and operated by Fontainebleau Development.”

It also noted the agreement with Marriott announced in 2018 “was made with the building’s previous owner.”

“Having come full circle and taken ownership of the site in Las Vegas we intend to fulfill our original vision and deliver the same extraordinary hospitality experience that our guests have come to expect from Fontainebleau Development” the statement said.

Soffer was the project’s original developer. His group hasn’t announced when the 60-plus-story resort would open or what it would be called.

Meanwhile Majestic Las Vegas developer Lorenzo Doumani said Wednesday that he plans to start construction on his 720-room nongaming hotel in the first quarter of 2022 after stating in January that he expected to break ground in late summer or early fall this year.

However Doumani says he is “still on track” to complete the roughly $850 million project in late 2024.

Also the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority board of directors on Tuesday approved selling 10 acres of the former Riviera site to a Chilean developer for $120 million — a lucrative deal that may not result in a new project anytime soon.

Under the terms of the sale the buyer must start construction by Jan. 1 2031 — more than nine years from now — or the LVCVA can buy back the land.

After the real estate frenzy of 15 years ago flamed out the north Strip was saddled with huge tracts of land where projects never materialized and a few unfinished megaresorts that were left to collect dust. Since then the area has seen other big plans but they have largely stalled or fizzled. Even Resorts World debuted five years after the developers initially planned to open.

Ex-NBA player Jackie Robinson’s proposed arena and hotel project which he announced in late 2013 still hasn’t materialized and casino operator Wynn Resorts hasn’t said when it plans to develop its 38 acres of land between Resorts World and Fashion Show mall.

Wynn reached a $336 million deal in late 2017 to acquire the plot — former home of the imploded New Frontier and the proposed-but-never-built Alon Las Vegas — and company founder Steve Wynn said in early 2018 that he wanted to move quickly on a project.

Days later The Wall Street Journal reported that Wynn had a decadeslong pattern of sexual misconduct. Wynn who called the allegations “preposterous” soon resigned as chairman and CEO of his company citing “an avalanche of negative publicity.”

On top of all this there’s no telling when the pandemic will be a thing of the past or when Las Vegas will fully recover from the severe economic fallout.

People have been saying for years that the north Strip’s recovery is just around the corner and the area has indeed shown signs of life. But given the state of some plots and projects along that end of the boulevard don’t be surprised to keep hearing about that elusive corner for years to come.
