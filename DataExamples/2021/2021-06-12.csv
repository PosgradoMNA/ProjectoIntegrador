Kyle Walker’s stunning £3m home featuring a giant fish tank and a swimming pool with its own waterfall comes with an eye-watering energy bill to boot it has been revealed.

The Sheffield-born defender pays an estimated £16200 a year to power the six-bedroom property according to the comparison site Uswitch which is more than any of his fellow Three Lions who are preparing for action in Euro 2020.

The Manchester City and England right-back’s estimated energy bills are around 15 times higher than the average household’s £1125 annual charges but his £110000 weekly salary means they won’t be causing him too many sleepless nights.

He’s not the only big-spender when it comes to energy supplies with his Manchester City and England teammate John Stones reportedly splashing out an estimated £15900 to power his £3m pad complete with a home cinema games centre and sauna and France and Manchester United star Paul Pogba paying £14300 a year in energy bills.

Sarah Broomfield energy expert at Uswitch said: ""If you've ever opened your energy bill in horror then spare a thought for those who made this list.""

""But famous footballer or not there's always a benefit to keeping down the amount of energy you use at home. Sometimes it can be as simple as closing windows turning off lights when you leave the roo and turning down the thermostat.""

The Republican governor of the US state of Texas has announced plans to build a wall along the border with Mexico drawing criticism from human rights organisations and advocacy groups.

Greg Abbott has however offered no details on his plans to construct the new barrier. He has also launched an aggressive campaign to arrest immigrants and asylum seekers. The moves may result in another clash with the administration of US President Joe Biden over immigration.

Abbott did not say how much new barrier Texas would erect where it would be installed along the state’s 1930km (1200 miles) of border or what it would look like when he made the announcement on Thursday in a room full of sheriffs in the border city of Del Rio. He promised more would be revealed next week.

A top official in one of Texas’s largest border counties Hidalgo County Judge Richard Cortez said on Friday that he sees the goal as putting in place new barriers that would give state troopers grounds to arrest migrants who go around or damage it – and then put them in jail for six months.

“I understand why he wants to do it. It’s a tool that gets him to a Class B misdemeanour” Cortez said. He was sceptical of whether jail would deter immigrants who travel hundreds of miles and risk death to get to the United States.

Abbott spokeswoman Renae Eze on Friday did not provide more details about the barrier plan and referred questions about arrests to a letter that Abbott and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey sent to other governors on Thursday asking them to send their own law enforcement ranks to the border. The letter tells governors their officers would arrive with the “power to arrest migrants who illegally cross the border into our territory”.

Legal experts said the US Supreme Court has made clear that the power to enforce immigration law is in the hands of the federal government including striking down efforts by Arizona Republicans a decade ago.

US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas declined to comment on the Texas governor’s plans while visiting a city cybersecurity centre in Los Angeles shortly after Abbott’s announcement.

Biden suspended construction of a border wall upon taking office and on Friday his administration announced a plan to divert funding from what was former President Donald Trump’s signature project.

Abbott who is up for re-election next year and has not ruled out a White House run in 2024 has made immigration a central issue since Biden took office and taken increasing action over what he says is the new administration’s failure to slow the flow of crossings.

“Long term only Congress and the president can fix our broken border” Abbott said in Del Rio. “But in the meantime Texas is going to do everything possible including beginning to make arrests to keep our community safe to keep the cartels and smugglers out and to keep your community safe.”

While easing since March large numbers showing up at the border have severely challenged the Biden administration. Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a message to those thinking of making the journey during a visit this week to Guatemala City: “Do not come.”

Abbott earlier this month moved to shutter more than 50 shelters in Texas that house about 4000 migrant children arguing that the federal government cannot force the state to keep issuing licences in response to a federal problem. The Biden administration has threatened to sue unless that order is rescinded.

The Trump administration built more than 725km (450 miles) of border wall almost all of it replacing smaller designs or dilapidated sections.

Cortez said he would support Abbott’s help to build more jail capacity but would want the county kept in charge of the extra space. Farther down the border in rural Starr County Judge Eloy Vera said his 270-bed jail is near capacity but still has room and said Abbott’s description of the border is not what he sees in his area.

Stephen Yale-Loehr who teaches immigration law at Cornell Law School said the federal government likely would challenge whether the state has authority to construct barriers along the border.

“While states can do certain things under state law regarding immigration erecting barriers along the border or arresting migrants is beyond the pale in my view” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbG9jYWxuZXdzLmNvbS90eC9zb3V0aC10ZXhhcy1lbC1wYXNvL25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9nb3YtLWFiYm90dC1zLWJvcmRlci1pbml0aWF0aXZlcy1kcmF3LWNvbmNlcm4tZnJvbS1kZWwtcmlvLW5hdGl2ZS3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gov. Abbott's border initiatives draw concern,"DEL RIO Texas — Lupita De La Paz is a Del Rio Texas girl at heart.

“I’m going to be 37 years old. Born and raised I’m first-generation American” De La Paz said. “My parents are from Little Ranchitos in Acuña Coahuila. They would probably hate that I said that but if you blink your eye you passed the town already.”

De La Paz is the director of an arts program called Casa De La Cultura and she says everything is different growing up in a border town.

“The culture itself the language you get a lot of people that speak Spanish you go deeper into Texas and Spanish [is] probably not as common as in a border city” she said.

Another very common thing in the border town is a lot of migration and lots of folks seeking asylum. De La Paz offers a helping hand by volunteering with a coalition in Del Rio that helps asylum seekers who have just been released by immigration.

“We actually help them purchase their tickets by purchasing their tickets so by purchasing their tickets they have their money they have their funds if they contact their relative to get the funds” De La Paz says. “We set them up with a bus ticket or a plane ticket so they can go to their final destination.”

If the migrants aren’t able to get the funds on time the coalition has tents with double doors set up but De La Paz says that is the last resort.

Gov. Greg Abbott was recently in Del Rio where he discussed a lot of border initiatives one of which involves reallocating $1 billion in funds for border security. Abbott also announced that Texas will build its own border wall with Mexico.

Abbott said there used to be a commitment to secure the border.

“Now the commitment is everybody that wants to come in is going to be allowed to come in and change is needed” Abbott said.

De La Paz says that’s not a solution to a deeper issue.

“Let me put a fence let me put a wall here and this is not going to fix all of our problems.

Knoxville - Lorraine Yvonne Swift Abbott (age 94) departed this earthly life and went to her eternal reward on June 11 2021. She left behind her husband William Paul Abbott her son Richard Neil Abbott and her brother Virgil Neil Swift – along with numerous nieces nephews grand nieces and nephews cousins in-law relatives and friends – all of whom she loved very dearly. She also left behind former co-workers in the business she founded – Katie Ingersoll Mary Bryant and Amy Reed – as well as long-time neighbors Sue and Carolyn Wilson. She was preceded in death by her parents Virgil Swift and Edith Isabelle Jackson Swift and by her brothers Aubrey Earl Swift and his twin Kenneth Merle Swift.

Lorraine was born on November 8 1926 in the town of Owasso Oklahoma. In the fall of 1944 she boarded a train and travelled to Maryville College in East Tennessee where in 1946 she met her husband Paul a World War II Navy veteran who had enrolled in Maryville College on the G.I. Bill. Lorraine graduated from Maryville College and married Paul in May of 1948 and they remained married for the next 73 years. Beginning in 1948 Lorraine embarked on a long career as a technical writer and editor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory focusing most of her efforts on publications related to reactor shielding. In 1986 she retired from ORNL and began a second career as the founder and leader of a technical communications company that focused primarily on the oil and gas industry. She retired from that second career in 2016 at the age of 90.

Lorraine joined Inskip Methodist Church (now Cedar Lane UMC) with her husband in 1952 and she remained an active part of that congregation until her death. For many years she was also a member of the board of directors of Partners for Children a nonprofit child development center currently located at Cedar Lane. One of the last things Lorraine said to her family was ""take care of the little children."" Accordingly the family asks that in lieu of flowers gifts be given in Lorraine's memory to Partners for Children Inc. 714 Cedar Lane Knoxville TN 37912. A graveside service will be held at Grandview Cemetery in Maryville TN at 11:00 AM on Tuesday June 15. A celebration of life service will be held at Cedar Lane UMC at a later date.

Abbott Has Lifted Almost All Texas Pandemic Restrictions. But Not The One Limiting Jail Releases.,"Gov. Greg Abbott has been saying for months that Texas is no longer restricted by the coronavirus pandemic. Face mask mandates are gone and people are crowding back into businesses and public places.

“Texas is open 100% without any restrictions or limitations or requirements” he said on Twitter Monday.

But there is one crucial government function the Republican governor has kept limited since he declared a public health disaster last March: the release of people from Texas county jails.

Abbott’s controversial order aims to stop the release of any criminal defendant accused or previously convicted of a violent crime on a no-cost bond meaning such defendants would only get out of jail in the pandemic if they could afford money bail. It also disallowed those serving short misdemeanor sentences from being released early for good behavior a common practice in county jails. The order’s legality has long been questioned and at least several local courts have found it unconstitutional — leading to a patchwork implementation.

Still at least in parts of the state the order continues to keep people in jail who may have otherwise been released before the coronavirus ravaged Texas. It is the governor’s only emergency order aside from requiring collection of medical data on the coronavirus that he has kept in place for more than a year.

Abbott issued his emergency order last March as Texas counties sought to combat the pandemic by lowering their jail populations — where the risk of the coronavirus was particularly high given poor sanitary conditions and close quarters. At the time Abbott said the order was to prevent mass releases from jails.

“Releasing dangerous criminals makes the state even less safe ... and slows our ability to respond to the disaster caused by COVID-19” he said last March.

A spokesperson did not answer repeated questions in the last month asking why the governor has continued the order.

Some bail reform advocates and opponents of the order argue it’s a political play. Even before his order suspended a large swath of Texas bail law during the pandemic the governor for years has asked lawmakers to change state bail practices to keep more criminal suspects deemed dangerous behind bars before their trial. This year he made it an emergency for the Texas Legislature to pass such a law. When they failed to do so last month he vowed to bring lawmakers back soon for a special session in part to again work on bail legislation.

“It always seemed more political than directly related to the disaster response” Brian Klosterboer an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas said of the order. “But particularly now when every other emergency order has ended apart from the data collection I think it highlights even more that it is a political position that is not tied to responding to the disaster and to an emergency.”

An uneven system

At the start of the pandemic some judges across Texas began releasing hundreds of inmates on reduced cash bonds or personal bonds — which don’t require money — because of COVID-19. Release on personal bonds often still requires conditions like regular check-ins and drug testing.

But some jail releases prompted concern including the low-cost release of a murder suspect in Harris County. Abbott stepped in shortly afterward with his order. Similar to most of the country Texas jails have since largely returned to pre-pandemic population levels.

Abbott’s restrictions for personal bonds apply to arrestees who have been accused or ever previously convicted of a crime that “involves physical violence or the threat of physical violence.” Prohibitions of early jail release for good behavior or release on a GPS ankle monitor applies to those currently serving or ever convicted of such a crime.

That included Preston Chaney who was one of dozens who died from COVID-19 in Texas county jails. The 64-year-old man was accused of stealing lawn equipment and meat out of someone’s garage and kept in the Harris County jail for months because he’d been unable to pay $100 for bail. A court document stated he was denied cashless release because of Abbott’s order. He’d previously been convicted of low-level assault.

The order’s limitation on personal bonds but not money bail has continuously spurred legal fights from bail reform advocates and judges who have argued it discriminates against poor people and goes beyond the governor’s power. In recent years federal courts have found bail practices in Harris and Dallas counties unconstitutional for discriminating against poor defendants.

“No person should be kept in jail simply because they’re too poor to afford bail and that’s what [Abbott’s order] does” Klosterboer said. “People can still pay their way out of the system.”

In legal battles lawyers for Abbott and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argued that the order is constitutional because it allows no-cost release to still be considered for health or safety reasons after a chance for a hearing is given though some attorneys said that sometimes took weeks.

“The executive order reasonably safeguards the public by taking actions — as permitted by the Texas Disaster Act — to ensure that violent people are not released en masse without a judge first making an individualized assessment” wrote former Solicitor General Kyle Hawkins in a court filing last April.

Still at least several courts and jails began to disregard Abbott’s order during the last year after local judges found it unconstitutional and an overreach of gubernatorial power. After such a ruling in Harris County last year the sheriff’s department quickly restarted its good-conduct release program where inmates can end up serving only a third of their jail sentence. Only misdemeanor defendants are sentenced to county jail instead of the state prison system in Texas with a maximum jail sentence of one year.

“Under the Texas Constitution only the Legislature may suspend the laws and that power is non-delegable” state district Judge Chris Morton said in an order last May.

Following two similar judicial rulings in Travis County and questions from The Texas Tribune a spokesperson for the Travis County Sheriff’s Office said Tuesday the department resumed crediting good-conduct time to inmates last week. The Dallas County Sheriff’s Office said this week it did not change its good-conduct practices because of Abbott’s order.

But a lack of direct action from statewide courts has resulted in a nonuniform system where the order’s influence on jail decisions varies not only from county to county but courtroom to courtroom.

In the civil courts the Texas Supreme Court ruled in favor of Abbott’s order in April but it didn’t weigh in on the questions of constitutionality or gubernatorial overreach. Instead the all-Republican court said the county judges who brought the lawsuit were the wrong ones to challenge the order though the justices did indicate judges couldn’t easily be prosecuted for overriding the order on their judicial discretion.

On the criminal side the Court of Criminal Appeals has so far avoided a ruling on the order according to several defense attorneys and bail reform advocates though some cases have made it to its doorstep.

“If a judge wants to get around this stuff they can do it in most instances” said Grant Scheiner president of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association. “What I’m concerned about is there may be some judges in far flung areas across the state who are unaware of the constitutional issues or perhaps not moved by them.”

Harris County misdemeanor judges who are all Democrats have long ignored the order instead following the local rule to release most low-level defendants on personal bonds that was cemented as part of their federal court settlement to change unconstitutional bail practices. Scheiner says many judges in large counties have also knocked down or sidestepped the order.

But in Nueces County state district Judge Inna Klein said she abides by the order because she believes in the governor’s power to issue it though she struggles with wanting to keep judges independent from the executive branch. She said her local colleagues follow the order as well. The Nueces County Jail was 98% full last weekend she said.

“The idea [for the order] was good and it carried good measures for the safety of the community however I think when you put the across-the-board requirements for everybody it creates issues” the Republican judge said.

For example Klein said under the order someone charged with a minor nonviolent misdemeanor would be ineligible to be let out of jail on a personal bond if they had been convicted of a low-level assault 30 years ago.

Balancing power

Aside from arguments that the governor’s jail order inserts too much power over the judicial branch there have also been concerns it plays too much of a legislative role as well.

This year the Texas House unanimously approved a bill to explicitly state the governor could not suspend Texas criminal laws during a disaster as he did under the jail order. State Rep. Joe Moody an El Paso Democrat and speaker pro tempore said the order suspended civil rights.

“Under the idea that our criminal laws were simple regulatory statutes that our government code allows the governor to suspend an executive order locked people up and threw away the key” he said on the House floor last month.

“Whatever we think about bonds or time credits or anything else this was a bad precedent” he added. “One person was never meant to have the power to discard the criminal laws and procedures we create here in the Legislature. Our state and our nation doesn’t and has never worked that way.”

The bill never got a hearing in the Senate Jurisprudence Committee. State Sen. Joan Huffman the Houston Republican who chairs the committee said Wednesday it was because no senator asked for the bill to be heard. Huffman carried bail legislation approved by Abbott that in part would have enshrined similar restrictions on bail releases into law but it didn’t pass.

“Some people viewed [Abbott’s order] as a stop gap measure until the Legislature could enact some type of statute” Scheiner said. “Bail reform was supposed to be used as a means to make sure bail wasn’t being used as a means of oppression ... but that’s not what we’re doing.”

Abbott and Rival Try to Out-Trump Each Other With Vow to Build Wall in Texas But Give No Details How,"During the same week that the Biden administration continued its effort to put a halt to the wasteful government spending on former president Trump’s useless and mostly nonexistent border wall Texas Governor Greg Abbott vowed to match Trump’s stupidity in his state.

Abbott’s announcement to build a wall in Texas came during a Thursday border security summit he hosted in Del Rio saying “Texas will not sit idly by as this crisis grows.”

The governor’s pledge matches that of his Republican primary challenger Don Huffines who promised in May if elected “We will build our own wall without the federal government and we’re not going to ask their permission to do it. It will be a Texas wall.”

But like Abbott Huffines gave few details on how he’d actually accomplish that feat since the state has little authority to do so given the fact that much of the land is privately or federally owned.

“States don’t have authority over immigration and our borders that’s a federal authority” said Domingo Garcia national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens. “It’s not constitutional and we’re planning to challenge it in court once we see the final order.”

None of that likely matters to Abbott or Huffines both of whom are well aware of how Trump used xenophobic lies to help capture the White House in 2016 and know that Trump didn’t give reasonable details about how his wall would be built or paid for even going so far as to promise that Mexico was going to fund his pet project (but it never did).

Instead Trump re-routed funds for military construction to go toward his precious border wall. But on Friday the Biden administration announced that it’s returning more than $2 billion that Trump had redirected from the Department of Defense to fund the wall. The White House had made it clear earlier this year what it thought of Trump’s wall releasing a proclamation on the matter only weeks after Biden’s inauguration.

“Building a massive wall that spans the entire southern border is not a serious policy solution. It is a waste of money that diverts attention from genuine threats to our homeland security” the proclamation said."

AbbVie J&J tee up FDA filing for Imbruvica Venclexta fixed-duration combo,"AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson already boast three FDA-approved regimens for Imbruvica in newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Now the pair aims to add another to the drug’s label one that could shorten the time patients need to stay on treatment.

A combination of Imbruvica and AbbVie and Roche’s Venclexta slashed the risk of cancer progression or death by 78.4% compared with a cocktail of Roche’s Gazyva and the chemotherapy chlorambucil in previously untreated CLL. The data from the phase 3 GLOW trial were shared at the European Hematology Association (EHA) annual meeting.

Compared with existing Imbruvica therapies where patients take the BTK inhibitor daily—potentially for years—until their disease progresses the new Venclexta combo caps treatment at about 14 months. That could offer a new option for “probably younger patients with CLL that prefer more flexible treatment-free intervals” said Craig Tendler M.D. vice president of oncology clinical development and global medical affairs at J&J’s Janssen unit during an interview.

Same as Imbruvica’s original monotherapy use the Venclexta combo offers a convenient oral treatment while the drug’s two other approved cocktails—with Gazyva or Roche’s Rituxan—involve infusions.

RELATED: ASCO: AbbVie J&J pad Imbruvica's CLL case with Venclexta fixed-duration combo data

One key question for the fixed-duration combo is whether it can sustain remission after treatment has stopped. In the preliminary analysis of the GLOW trial at three months after treatment ended 51.9% of the Imbruvica-Venclexta patients had undetectable measurable residual disease (uMRD)—a stringent marker reflecting no signs of cancer—in bone marrow versus 17.1% for the control group. The rates for peripheral blood were 54.7% and 39% for the two groups respectively.

From the three-month point onward 84.5% of uMRD patients maintained that deep remission in the blood to the 12-month assessment. These data show the new combo can deliver “very durable remissions” for the vast majority of patients Tendler said.

To persuade doctors to stop treatment for a traditionally continuous therapy AbbVie and J&J likely also need to show that doing so won’t hurt patients’ chance at successful retreatment if their cancer does rebound early.

The GLOW trial doesn’t yet have the answer to that question but Tendler pointed to encouraging early evidence from the regimen’s phase 2 trial dubbed CAPTIVATE. Among eight patients who progressed after stopping the fixed-duration combo six responded to subsequent Imbruvica monotherapy while the other two didn’t have a response report according to data presented at the recent American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting.

While they are early data “it’s also very reassuring that those patients who have progressed can be rather easily reinduced into remission” Tendler said. J&J and AbbVie are now taking the same approach for the GLOW study he added.

RELATED: EHA: Watch out Imbruvica. BeiGene's touting Brukinsa efficacy safety wins in a key leukemia battleground

As the first-to-market BTK inhibitor Imbruvica has been treating front-line CLL patients since its monotherapy go-ahead in early 2016. But it’s now facing competition from AstraZeneca’s Calquence which just detailed a head-to-head safety advantage over Imbruvica in previously treated CLL.

What’s more also at the EHA meeting BeiGene’s Brukinsa showed it could outperform Imbruvica at triggering tumor responses while causing fewer cases of atrial fibrillation a potentially dangerous heart side effect in its own head-to-head phase 3 study in previously treated CLL.

The third-to-market BTK inhibitor is also looking to report top-line results from a front-line trial later this year. Imbruvica could feel more pressure if that study also turns out successful.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Her plan to become a professional boxer has hit a lull now that the coronavirus pandemic has halted all competitions.

The schools are closed due to a surge in COVID cases but she is still training usually three hours a day.

Flores adopted the nickname “Hand of Stone” because she says “I like to hit hard”.

She says she has never lost any of the two-minute bouts to which children are limited.

“I keep training so I don’t forget the techniques for my next fight which I hope will be when [pandemic restrictions] are lifted” she said.

Flores has been trained for the past six years by her father Alberto Flores.

The 54-year-old former amateur boxer raises rabbits alongside the family’s blue-painted kitchen-dining room-bedroom in one. She helps tend the rabbits after her training and her online homework.

“My dream is to reach the big leagues and turn 18 so I can fight with Jennifer Salinas my favourite Bolivian boxer” she said though the former world super bantamweight champ known as “The Bolivian Queen” may be past fighting age by that time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vc3R1ZHlmaW5kcy5vcmcvcGVvcGxlLWZlYXItY292aWQtbW9yZS1qdWRnbWVudGFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,People who fear COVID-19 are also more judgmental towards others: 'It's an emotional link' -,"CAMBRIDGE England — People who are more afraid of catching Covid-19 are also more judgmental according to a new study by scientists at the University of Cambridge.

Researchers studying how we make moral judgments found that people more concerned about the disease were more disapproving when it came to the wrongdoings of others — regardless of what they were doing wrong.

The findings are evidence that our morality is shaped by emotions and intuitions and concerns about health and safety are big factors. This the authors say means that our judgments of wrongdoing are not completely rational.

The study published in the journal Evolutionary Psychology did not focus on behaviors relating to the pandemic itself like social distancing but a varied range of moral transgressions.

“There is no rational reason to be more judgmental of others because you are worrying about getting sick during the pandemic” in a statement. “These influences on judgments happen outside of our conscious awareness. If we feel that our wellbeing is threatened by the coronavirus we are also likely to feel more threatened by other people’s wrongdoing — it’s an emotional link.”

Between March and May 2020 over 900 study participants in the U.S. were presented with a series of scenarios and asked to rate them on a scale from ‘”not at all wrong” to “extremely wrong.” This allowed researchers to measure participants’ responses across five key moral principles: harm fairness in-group loyalty deference to authority and purity.

Example scenarios include one of loyalty: “You see a man leaving his family business to go work for their main competitor”; and one of fairness: “You see a tenant bribing a landlord to be the first to get their apartment repainted.”

People who were more worried about catching Covid-19 judged the behaviors in these scenarios to be more wrong than those who were less worried. The findings contribute to a growing body of evidence of a link between physical disgust — an emotion designed to keep us from harm — and moral condemnation.

“Disgust is an emotion we think evolved to protect us from harm – avoiding a filthy toilet that might contaminate us with disease for example” says Robert Henderson a PhD student in the university’s Department of Psychology and first author of the report. “But now we apply it to social situations too and can feel physically jeopardized by other people’s behavior.

“The link between being concerned about Covid-19 and moral condemnation is about risks to wellbeing” he continues. “If you’re more conscious of health risks you’re also more conscious of social risks — people whose behavior could inflict harm upon you.”

The research was funded by the Gates Foundation Cambridge and the Bennett Institute for Public Policy.

A decorated Pekingese named Wasabi has added the ultimate title to his trophy case: Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.

The extremely fluffy Wasabi whose registered name is GCHG CH Pequest Wasabi took home the top honors Sunday night emerging from the final ring about a year and a half after winning the 2019 American Kennel (AKC) Club National Championship.

""He's just a wonderful dog and he's made correctly. He has showmanship; he fits the breed standard"" handler and owner David Fitzpatrick said on the FOX broadcast Sunday. ""He has that little extra something that little sparkle that sets a dog apart.""

Speaking of a little extra something how's this for a celebration? ""He can have a filet mignon and I'll have champagne"" Fitzpatrick said.

After winning the toy group Saturday 3-year-old Wasabi beat out whippet Bourbon (hound) French bulldog Mathew (non-sporting) Old English sheepdog Connor (herding) German shorthaired pointer Jade (sporting) Samoyed Striker (working) and West Highland white terrier Boy (terrier) for Best in Show honors Sunday night.

It was a competitive group full of championship pedigree. Striker is the No. 1-ranked dog in the country while Jade is the daughter of the 2016 Best in Show winner and Connor is the son of the 2013 Westminster runner-up.

Plus Bourbon edged out Wasabi at last year's AKC's National Championship but the Pekingese from East Berlin Pa. earned the nod this time around. Bourbon was named Reserve Best in Show (runner-up) for the second year in a row.

The 145th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show was a departure from the previous 144. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic the club moved the show from February to June and from Madison Square Garden in Manhattan to the Lyndhurst Mansion in Tarrytown N.Y. The judging was held in a big fancy tent on the grounds.

Westminster is a conformation show meaning the dogs are judged on how well they adhere to their breed's set of written standards. (The dogs don't compete to see who's the best-looking or cutest.)

Wasabi is the fifth Pekingese to win at Westminster since 1907 which is as far back as the club's records go. He's owned by Sandra Middlebrooks Peggy Steinman Iris Love and Fitzpatrick.

Short and stocky Pekingese originally lived as the well-pampered pets of Chinese royalty. The lap dogs' long lion-esque coats require plenty of grooming and if Wasabi is any indication they don't get around too fast.

But hey it's pretty hard to move fast when you're lugging around a big ol' trophy. Congrats to Wasabi!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL2Jpei9hcmNoaXZlcy8yMDIxLzA2LzEzLzIwMDM3NTkwNTjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Japan’s chip future lies in a Taiwanese science park,"Japan’s chip future lies in a Taiwanese science park

Japan is opening up its semiconductor sector to cooperation with outside firms chiefly TSMC after losing its global leadership position

By Tim Culpan / Bloomberg Opinion





As much as the US pines for the good old days of global semiconductor supremacy Japan feels its loss of glory even more.

Once a dominant name in electronic components the nation has been overtaken by Taiwan South Korea and more recently China. Yet Tokyo might have a viable plan to revitalize its domestic sector.

“Unlike the purely domestic independent way it was done in the past I think we need to cooperate with overseas counterparts” Akira Amari a former economy minister and senior member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party told Bloomberg News’ Isabel Reynolds and Emi Nobuhiro this week.

That is remarkable pragmatism for a country whose industrial policy has largely revolved around protecting and isolating its companies to preserve national identity. Yet three decades of decline show that past policies are just not cutting it.

In 1988 Japan commanded 50 percent of the global semiconductor industry according to a presentation this month from the Japanese Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry that cited data from research firm Omdia.

Back then names such as NEC Corp Toshiba Corp Hitachi Ltd and Fujitsu Semiconductor Ltd occupied six of the top 10 places in market share alongside US giants Intel Corp and Motorola Solutions Inc.

By 2019 Japan accounted for 10 percent. The US had climbed to 50 percent due to the ascent of chip designers like Qualcomm Inc Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

These US firms rose thanks to a bifurcated business model aided by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC 台積電) an anchor tenant in Taiwan’s noted science parks. The arrangement reflects complementary skill sets. Rather than both design and manufacture a chip as was once the case most US companies now just outsource to foundries like TSMC.

Amari said that TSMC is exactly the type of foreign partner that Japanese companies should work with since it is the world’s largest maker of non-memory semiconductors.

His words carry weight given that he is heading a party working group on chip strategy as part of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s policy to incorporate industry plans into the government’s growth plans.

Japan remains a global leader in the equipment and materials used for production. As chips get increasingly more difficult to make tighter integration across the supply chain is inevitable.

Taiwanese companies including TSMC and United Microelectronics Corp (聯電) have a lot to offer.

The Taiwan-Japan relationship is also becoming one of the closest in East Asia. Tokyo last week donated 1.24 million doses of much-needed COVID-19 vaccine as Taipei struggles to contain an outbreak. They share close trade cultural and tourism ties and feel increasing economic and military tensions from Beijing.

The idea of semiconductor cooperation is not without precedent. More than a decade ago Yukio Sakamoto president of Japan’s then-largest memory chipmaker Elpida Memory Inc tried to rally together a consortium of local and Taiwanese companies to battle against industry giants Samsung Electronics Co and Micron Corp.

Japan’s semiconductor sector was already on the slide. Elpida was formed by the merger of memory divisions from NEC and Hitachi in 1999 a time when the nation’s share had already fallen below 30 percent.

Sakamoto did not think that either the Japanese or Taiwanese firms could survive on their own.

“We don’t have the scale” he said in 2010.

Sakamoto’s proposal fell through amid opposition from Taiwanese companies and political pressure in Taipei. Within two years his company had filed for bankruptcy and Taiwanese rivals largely exited the computer memory industry.

The mood is vastly different now. TSMC in February said it plans to set up a Japan research center primarily centered on materials development so that it can tap into the nation’s deep pool of chemical engineers.

The ministry hopes to take it further and expects to offer strong incentives to lure a foreign chip foundry to Japan Kazumi Nishikawa of the ministry’s IT Industry Division told Bloomberg News.

Politically both governments are crucially aware of the need to cooperate and jointly work with the US to hold off China’s rising strength.

Chinese companies have increased their share of Apple Inc’s orders a benchmark for the global electronics supply chain and Beijing is willing to spend as much as it takes to ensure its chip industry gains traction.

Not content with being the king of chip design the US now sees lack of manufacturing capacity as a threat to national security. Washington is looking to spend more than US$30 billion to get back in the game increasing the urgency for other nations to cement their own plans.

With semiconductors becoming a key weapon in the technology cold war Taipei and Tokyo would be smart to team up.

Despite your skin type once the weather reaches warmer temperatures in the summer months most people will experience a shift in their skin — from extensive dehydration or dry patches to excessive amount of oils caused by sweat. There are countless reasons for this ranging from the added humidity in the air to spending a little more time in the sun — with an SPF of course. All of these different factors may leave you wondering ‘what should I be doing with my skin right now?’

For certain add a quality SPF to your routine if you haven’t already but falling in a very close second is exfoliation aka the removal of dead skin cells via a chemical or physical agent. Your skin is constantly shedding and they can get trapped (which means clogged pores and dullness among other things for you). Exfoliation helps to speed up this process — and in the summer with all of these extra skin issues it can prove especially useful.

While the jury is still out regarding exactly what and how often one should exfoliate their skin no matter the time of year (dermatologists and experts will most often suggest a regime according to your skin type and its needs) during the warmer months it can be highly beneficial — in moderation — as part of your summer skin care routine.

Like with anything in the beauty world there are common guidelines for exfoliation that you should stick to in order to achieve your skin care goals but the most important is to really listen to your skin — how it’s feeling looking and reacting to new products (either a physical or chemical method — more on that later) so that you can reap all the benefits (like a smoother less congested and brighter complexion) without disrupting your skin barrier. Below you’ll find all the experts tips you need to know regarding how to exfoliate your skin this summer — and achieve that otherworldly glow as well.

Why You Should Exfoliate In The Summer

There are a number of reasons as to why your skin changes during the summer but the most obvious is an increased amount of sun exposure. As lifestyles change and the day-to-day becomes centered around outdoor activities such as hiking or swimming in salt or chlorine water the various environment and climate shifts could potentially wreak havoc on your skin. “Those conditions can lead to skin dehydration and higher levels of exposure to UV radiation from the sun” explains CEO & co-founder of Furtuna Skin Kim Walls. “Your skin needs ample nutrients and moisture as it works overtime to repair DNA damage and thus prevent skin cancer hyperpigmentation collagen breakdown and rough patches.”

Next to feeling drier thanks to the elements many people might experience a more oily complexion in the summer as well. Sounds like a catch 22 huh? Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Loretta Ciraldo MD FAAD founder of Dr. Loretta Skincare mentions that during this season as the temperatures rise so does your sebum production. This is often caused by the added amount of sweat one tends to produce when the heat rises; plus with the extra humidity in the air said sweat doesn’t evaporate from your face causing extra oils. “For every increase in skin temperature of one degree we produce about 10% more sebum” she says — something worth noting for your next sunny outdoor outing.

Together this extra oil and/or drier skin means that your complexion will look especially lackluster congested irritated and generally sapped of any glow. Speeding up that natural process of shedding dead skin cells can help alleviate those issues and help you get that dewy skin back.

While the answer is no exfoliating alone won’t be the answer to all of your skin care woes doing it as often as your skin needs (and can tolerate) is particularly beneficial when faced with those summer issues. “In the summer dead skin cells can build up clogging the pores and leading to even drier skin” says board-certified dermatologist and Assistant Clinical Professor of Dermatology Dr. Jeannette Graf. “Exfoliating can help turnover new cells and allow moisturizing products to deeper penetrate the skin for extra summer hydration.” That means your hydrating serums and moisturizer will be able to do their job that much better.

In addition to unclogging pores and regenerating skin cells Dr. Ciraldo stresses how exfoliating during the summer can do wonders for those with oily-prone skin by releasing some of the sebum and trapped bacteria and debris from the surface of the skin. She also mentions that if combating hyperpigmentation is a skin concern for you removing those dead skin cells can aid in evening out your complexion and allow fresh new cells to come to the surface thereby fading dark spots.

Exfoliation Dos & Don’ts

Now if you think you’re ready to add exfoliation to your summertime skin care routine then there are a couple of do’s and don’ts to be mindful of before you start. While exfoliation is great for giving your skin that smooth glow if you’re new to the step in general it might cause irritation especially now during the warmer months. Your skin will get used to the extra skin cell turnover but when in doubt less is more.

1. Do

For starters it should be a priority to find the right exfoliating ingredient for your skin type. There are physical and mechanical exfoliants such as scrubbing cleansers and polishes to tools like skin spatulas. These can be a great option for beginners as long as you’re using a product with small gentle physical particle or granules — things like ground up walnut shells can cause micro-tears in your skin and do much more harm than good. Rice bran is a great option if you’d like to try a physical product to start (just be mindful of how hard you press and massage your skin).

Then there are chemical exfoliants; these are your ‘HAs’ acid ingredients that you see in toners or peels like AHA BHA and PHA. Chemical exfoliants have become extremely popular in the beauty world as a potent and highly effective ingredient. Both doctors recommend all-star alpha-hydroxy acids such as glycolic and lactic acid for their brightening properties and reduction of wrinkles and fine lines. BHAs like salicylic acid are particularly ideal for acne-prone skin as it can penetrate deeper into your pore and dissolve trapped sebum. However if you have sensitive skin it’s best to spot test these ingredients before diving into regular use.

Both dermatologists recommend exfoliating just once a week during this season to help your skin adjust to exfoliation as well as to help keep your skins barrier intact. Chemical exfoliants can also increase sun sensitivity so to keep sun damage at a minimum Dr. Graf suggests exfoliating anywhere between two to three days a week in the evening (this both minimizes sun exposure and is the time when your skin is most able to repair itself).

So all in all go slow patch test exfoliate at night apply plenty of SPF and use your product a few times a week.

2. Don’t

The absolute No.1 thing you can’t do is skip out on sunscreen in the summer but especially if you’ve added an exfoliating product to your routine. Without a good SPF exfoliating your skin will leave it vulnerable to more sun damage and cause additional irritation.

Using an exfoliator too often is another one of the biggest skin care mistakes that dermatologists see and with the added sun sensitivity in the summer it can be particularly damaging for your skin. Dr. Graf cannot stress this enough saying “Over-exfoliating can cause dryness damage and irritation” she mentions. “It can also weaken the skin’s barrier which leaves it susceptible to damage and irritation.” It can also lead to dry patches an imbalance in your skin’s microbiome as well as heightened sensitivity leading to redness and over irritation.

As tempting as it may be to use your new scrub or exfoliating toner every day or even every other day exfoliation is definitely a less is more situation. Work your way up to more regular usage after starting with the expert-recommended once a week application. Take note of how your skin reacts and adjust your routine as needed — that will be your best practice in order to achieve that smooth glowing complexion all summer long.

And finally don’t use your new exfoliating product on the same days/nights that you use retinol — vitamin A is also an exfoliator encouraging skin cell turnover — and the one-two punch of both ingredients is way too much for anyone’s skin to handle.

But she said their short stay soon turned into a nightmare including visits from the city’s building and housing department and no help from the company.

“This was the most uncomfortable situation that I've ever been put in” Amanda Gilliss said.

Last Saturday Gilliss her husband and their two sons arrived at a home on West 11th Street in Cleveland from Houston Texas.

Gilliss said she booked a one-month stay there back in April for $1880 so she and her husband could take their 6-year-old son Jose to Cleveland Clinic for treatment for what they believe is autism.

But when they went inside she said what they saw wasn’t in the photos online and wasn’t communicated to her by the Airbnb host.

“We see the stairs that she shows on Airbnb. But she does not indicate the danger of the stairs” Gilliss said.

Gilliss was concerned that Jose and her other young son could fall down the stairs and hurt themselves so she contacted the host for an explanation and a refund.

“Her response was ‘You know the cancellation policy. If you want to leave you're free to leave but you don't get a refund’” Gilliss said.

Gilliss said she contacted Airbnb too but they said because the host notified her of the stairs there was nothing they could do. She said as the days went on and she continued to fight things at the house got even worse.

“There’s nails sticking out of the floor my son stepped on it and cut his foot” Gilliss said. “The bathtub there’s sewage coming out of the pipes the bathtub has issues.”

Gilliss said when she got nowhere with Airbnb she contacted the City of Cleveland’s Department of Building and Housing.

Friday they issued a citation to the homeowner -- who is not the same person listed as the host of the property on Airbnb -- listing three violations including the nails sticking out of the floor and a defective bathtub drain stopper.

News 5 tried to reach the homeowner for comment at his home Saturday but didn’t get an answer. We also reached out to Airbnb about Gilliss's situation. The company sent us a statement:

“Our 24/7 Community Support teams work diligently to support hosts and guests when reservations don’t go as planned. In this case we offered to rebook Ms. Gilliss into an alternative accommodation when she reported her concerns to us though to this point she has declined the offer. We will continue to offer her rebooking options and support her as best we can. Airbnb spokesperson

“After you all reached out to her there was an associate from the safety department that did call but it's too little too late” Gilliss said.

Gilliss said that the offer was $300 to book a hotel room which would not cover the month stay that her family needs.

Instead they found another rental on Craigslist where they moved Saturday just after an eviction notice was posted on the door of the home on 11th Street.

Gilliss said for now she’s letting it go.

“You can try to evict me. That's okay I'm already gone. What are you gonna do? You're just being petty” Gilliss said.

Gilliss and her husband are currently looking for a permanent home in Cleveland. But once her family gets settled she plans to get her lawyers involved.

“Airbnb needs to be held extremely accountable” Gilliss said. “They need to be heavily regulated and they're not. Tech companies it's like the Wild West there's absolutely no structure to anything that they do.”

1 of 5

SALISBURY — Walking up a rickety staircase in the darkness Whitney Peckman had to hug the wall beside her for fear of falling.

It was Labor Day weekend in 2004 and Peckman and her husband Syed Ahmad were quite literally blindly following Randy Hemann upwards. They were ascending the only pair of stairs in the 20000 square foot building that once was home to Flowers Bakery in downtown Salisbury.

“There was only one door coming in and it was dark — pitch black” Ahmad said.

The two professional artists — Peckman primarily works in paint and Ahmad in glass — were being shown the property by Hemann then the president of Downtown Salisbury Inc.

At the top of the stairs the trio entered a spacious room that was falling apart. The wooden floor was dotted with holes. Sprinkler pipes hung down like metal vines. Wooden two-by-fours propped up a sagging ceiling.

Looking at the decrepit space with the eyes of artists Peckman and Ahmad saw more than just a fixer-upper. They saw possibility.

“We’re artists and we looked at it and said ‘Wow. Amazing’” Peckman said. “This is every artist’s dream to live and have a studio space in a warehouse or an old factory or a giant open space.”

The two purchased half of the building and moved to downtown Salisbury from their home in northern California. They’ve since transformed the debilitated space into an expressive and eclectic home and art studio. Since 2018 the couple has listed space in the loft on Airbnb giving explorative travelers more than just a place to rest their head for the night.

“It’s someone looking for an adventure looking for a cool place to stay” Ahmad said. “It’s not somebody just staying for the night who wants their privacy. This is somebody looking for something different.”

Peckman and Ahmad’s decision to open up the doors of their loft to practical strangers wasn’t made overnight. The couple dipped their toes in the water by first offering space in the loft on couchsurfing.com which connects thrifty travelers with people who are willing to host them for free.

“I decided to do the couchsurfing first to see the concept and then I started to host” Ahmad said. “It was a good experience doing that. We came to see the idea of having strangers in your home is not that bad.”

Besides as artists having a second source of income isn’t bad either.

“Doing what we do in the art field it’s not a very secure kind of work” Ahmad said. “It’s a feast or famine situation. Some years are good some are bad so we try to do different things. We have the space so we want to make income out of it and also maintain a lifestyle.”

The couple’s first Airbnb guest was an engineer from Berkeley California who was in town on work. She reserved the space for 10 days but her visit ended up lasting an entire month. After her stay she recommended the place to a colleague in Raleigh who became a regular visitor at the loft as well.

Peckman and Ahmad said they’ve developed a group of several loyal customers who always spend the night at the loft when they’re traveling through town. Most of the loft’s guests are people in their 20s or 30s. Guests who stay during weekdays are typically there for work but weekend visitors are almost always tourists. No matter the reason a guest is there Peckman and Ahmad are quick to welcome them in with open arms.

“They become like family” Ahmad said.

Peckman and Ahmad are friendly and interactive hosts partly because of who they are but also because the space demands it. The loft is essentially one cavernous room which was a choice the couple made when renovating the old building.

“We didn’t build anything too much in terms of partitioning the space” Ahmad said. “We wanted to keep it wide open because that’s what the space wants to be and you don’t want to interrupt that. Basically you had to be in the space working in the space to see that it would’ve been a crime to cut it up.”

The Airbnb listing gives guests multiple options. In the corner of the main living space is a bed that can be partitioned off with hanging curtains. Up a flight of stairs overlooking the bright studio where Peckman works is another bed. There’s also a “hideabed” sofa in the living room that can be turned into a comfortable place for a guest to lay their head if extra room is needed.

Even though most guests enjoy getting to know Peckman and Ahmad others are less interested in talking. That’s fine too.

“If they don’t want to interact with us it’s no problem” Peckman said. “We give them the tour show them where everything is and give them our phone numbers. We are here in this space but we are in our own quarters and the only time you’ll see us unless you want to see us is I usually come out in the morning and make coffee and I’m happy to make you breakfast.”

The two have been given the coveted title of “superhosts” on the Airbnb site.

The cast and crew of the feature film “Goodbye Butterfly” would likely agree with that assessment. Four members of the film’s crew stayed in the loft for a month while shooting the psychological thriller in Salisbury in 2019.

“We were trying to figure out how much their place would cost in Manhattan because it was one of the most beautiful apartment spaces we’d ever seen” Tyler Wayne the film’s writer and director said in a past interview with The Post.

The loft’s master bedroom was even a filming location but you might not know it. Peckman said the movie crew removed almost every item from the bedroom to give it a look that fit with the film.

The artist loft was temporarily off the market due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since listing the space again Ahmad said it’s been a little slower. But recently travelers have started to return. The couple hosted guests at the loft this weekend and has a few upcoming reservations on the books.

Although it’s been about 15 years since the couple first bought the space there’s still some work to be done. In the smaller room that serves as an unfinished foyer to the loft Peckman and Ahmad have plans to install a “funky art gallery.”

“It can also be a space where we can offer a quote ‘Airbnb experience’” Peckman said. “For instance I might teach a class in linoleum block cutting or I might teach a class in abstract painting. Syed can offer a class in infused glass so they stay here and they do this art experience.”

At this point the future home of the gallery and work space is dark the wooden floors have a few shallow craters there’s plenty of work to be done. Once again the two artists can see the possibility.

“It’s a great idea and it’s so flexible for people” Peckham said. “When we get the upstairs gallery open we could have other local people come in and teach something. They could teach people stay here. It’s going to be a really symbiotic opportunity.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xsYW5kc2VudGluZWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9ncmFuZC1oYXZlbi1wdXNoaW5nLWJhY2stYWdhaW5zdC1zdGF0ZS1zaG9ydC10ZXJtLXJlbnRhbC1iaWxscy83NjUyMDAwMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grand Haven pushing back against state short-term rental bills,"WOOD-TV 8

GRAND HAVEN — The city of Grand Haven is pushing back against a set of bills moving through the legislature that would remove restrictions on short-term vacation rentals.

Currently homeowners can only set up an Airbnb VRBO or weekly rental in certain parts of the city. The city says they put specific zoning laws in place to cut down on the number of disturbances to surrounding neighbors.

House Bill 4722 sponsored by Republican state Rep. Sarah Lightner and Senate Bill 446 sponsored by Republican state Sen. Aric Nesbitt would prevent local governments from outright banning short-term rentals through zoning laws.

This means homeowners could set up shop in any neighborhood where they own a home across the state.

“This bill does not eliminate local oversight it eliminates local prohibition through zoning and clarifies that rentals short or long term are a residential use” Nesbitt said.

Nesbitt said local governments would still be able to regulate noise traffic and other factors that may impact people living close to the short-term rentals.

This is a property rights issue and homeowners should be able to use their property how they want he added.

“These short-term rentals are being vilified when you could use the same vilification for long-term rentals or second homes” said Nesbitt.

The city of Grand Haven currently has about 300 vacation rentals. Most are concentrated near the waterfront and downtown area where zoning allows anyone to use their property as a short-term rental.

The number of short-term rentals are restricted to a certain percentage in neighborhoods like Old Town and South Side.

“If you’re close to the water you’re going to have people who want to be there” said Carol Schuitman who lives right across the street from a short-term rental.

“There has never ever been an issue. It’s been quiet. It’s been reasonable. People come people go you see a different car.”

In other parts of the city like the East Side short-term rentals are not allowed.

“It’s nice for the supplemental income but we also like to share the city and where to go eat where to shop and what walks you can do” said Brett Heppler who lives in a zone where short-term rentals are not allowed.

Heppler says two summers ago he listed his home on Airbnb.

“We listed the home and it sold out for the entire summer in three days” Hepler told WOOD-TV 8. “We rented our house for 60 days and then paid the mortgage for two years.”

At the end of the summer Heppler said the city sent a letter notifying him the home was not properly zoned for short-term rentals and he would receive a fine if he continued. He says he moved the rental from his home to a renovated bus.

While they weren’t willing to go on camera at least two homeowners told WOOD-TV 8 they agree with the city. One neighbor said the renters near their South Side home are disruptive to the community that lives there.

Grand Haven city officials say this issue should be handled at the city level.

“In our quieter residential districts people didn’t buy there to be in a vacation district. They bought there to live in a residential district” City Manager Patrick McGinnis said.

“So we just like to balance these things locally and try to make the best decisions we can based on the feedback we get from the people who live here.”

McGinnis says from 2007-16 the number of short-term vacation rentals in the city limits doubled. There's now a process in place to regulate short-term rentals and where they are located.

There’s also concern that allowing short-term rentals in any area would bring more out-of-town buyers and make it even more difficult for long-term residents to find affordable housing.

“We’re afraid that we’ll begin to lose our traditional residential neighborhoods which is where the people who work here like to live” McGinnis said.

“There’s already a crisis in available houses in Michigan. We don’t have enough housing to house all of our people and so we have to find new housing available and this is taking away from that stock.”

HB 4772 and SB 446 have made it out of their respective committees. Nesbitt said there’s not a specific timeline for next steps but they’re hoping sooner rather than later."

With summertime almost here you may be making plans to head out on or in the water to beat the heat. But it's important to have all the safety tips and appropriate equipment before you do.

Water Safety Week to coincide with the swimming and boating season takes place June 4-11. It is an annual campaign to educate Canadians on how to stay safe around water and prevent drownings.

And according to The Lifesaving Society (LSC) 77 per cent of all drownings occur between May and September.

Wendy Schultenkamper director of operations for The Lifesaving Society Canada told The Weather Network in 2021 that there is a correlation among the timing of the drownings vacations and the weather.

“Some of our best weather happens between May and September particularly after the May long weekend right through until the September Labour Day long weekend"" said Schultenkamper. “A lot of people are on vacation in July and August and that’s why we see the largest number of drowning statistics during that time.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3Jlc3RsaW5nbmV3cy5jby93d2UtbmV3cy9hZXdzLWxpdmUtZXZlbnQtdGlja2V0cy1hcmUtc2VsbGluZy1mYXN0ZXItdGhhbi13d2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AEW's live event tickets are selling faster than WWE,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/aews-live-event-tickets-are-selling-faster-than-wwe on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3Jlc3RsaW5nbmV3cy5jby93d2UtbmV3cy9hZXdzLWxpdmUtZXZlbnQtdGlja2V0cy1hcmUtc2VsbGluZy1mYXN0ZXItdGhhbi13d2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd2hhdGN1bHR1cmUuY29tL3d3ZS8xMC1mb3Jnb3R0ZW4td3dlLW54dC10YWtlb3Zlci1jbGFzc2ljcz9wYWdlPTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Forgotten WWE NXT TakeOver Classics – Page 4,"Another prime example of WWE getting tag team wrestling correct Danny Burch and Oney Lorcan's challenge for Roderick Strong and Kyle O'Reilly's NXT Tag Team Championships went down a treat at the second TakeOver: Chicago.

This is the match where Burch and Lorcan won over the NXT audience having previously been a fodder tandem for the likes of the AOP Pete Dunne and Roderick Strong and even f**king Riddick Moss and Tino Sabbatelli. They came into this being booed by the Chicago audience. By the end? Those same fans were chanting for the future Kings of NXT.

It was vital that this bout be cut in half; starting off slow it was a certified banger by the end that saw Oney Lorcan revert to indie darling Biff Busick. The guy that had once torn down the American Legion Post #308 in Reseda was doing the same thing in Rosemont's Allstate Arena executing his once-patented half and half suplex and running uppercut.

This all went down without a hitch. Strong and O'Reilly were hardly going to drop the straps but Danny and Oney had to get over here. That they did so in such an exceptional contest is a testament to how tremendously well-booked NXT was at the time.",,,,,,

The bipartisan proposals put forward on Friday are the culmination of a 15-month investigation by the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee led by Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island.

It concluded that the four tech giants have abused their market power by charging excessive fees imposing tough contract terms and extracting valuable data from individuals and businesses that rely on them.

""Right now unregulated tech monopolies have too much power over our economy"" Cicilline said in a statement.

""They are in a unique position to pick winners and losers destroy small businesses raise prices on consumers and put folks out of work. Our agenda will level the playing field and ensure the wealthiest most powerful tech monopolies play by the same rules as the rest of us.""



The proposed legislation targets the structure of the companies and could break them up a radical step for Congress to take toward a powerful industry. The tech giants for decades have enjoyed light-touch regulation and star status in Washington but have come under intensifying scrutiny and derision over issues of competition consumer privacy and hate speech.

As a candidate President Joe Biden said breaking up big tech companies should be considered though he hasn't spoken on the issue as president. If such steps were mandated they could bring the biggest changes to the industry since the federal government's landmark case against Microsoft almost 20 years ago.

Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado the senior Republican on the anti-trust panel is pushing the legislation with Cicilline. Many Republican lawmakers denounce the market dominance of Big Tech but don't support a wholesale revamp of the antitrust laws.

Advancing the legislation through Congress could be a tough slog. Democrats control the House but they would need to garner Republican votes in the Senate which is split 50-50 with the Democrats' one-vote margin depending on Vice President Kamala Harris being the tiebreaker.

The proposals also would prohibit big tech companies from favouring their own products and services over competitors on their platforms.

The House anti-trust investigation found for example that Google has monopoly power in the market for search while Facebook has monopoly power in the social networking market.

The subcommittee said Amazon and Apple have ""significant and durable market power"" in the US online retail market and in mobile operating systems and mobile app stores respectively.

The proposed legislation also would make it more difficult for the giant tech companies to snap up competitors in mergers which they have completed by scores in recent years. And it asks Congress to boost the enforcement powers of antitrust regulators such as the Federal Trade Commission.

The four companies have rejected lawmakers' accusations of abusing their dominant market position and have asserted that improper intervention in the market through legislation would hurt small businesses and consumers.

While the introduction of robots to the workplace often raises questions about whether human jobs will be replaced Amazon argues they simply allow workers to focus on tasks that most need their attention while minimizing their potential for injury. Amazon said it's added over a million jobs around the world since it began using robotics in its facilities in 2012.

In May Amazon announced a goal of reducing recordable incident rates by 50% by 2025. It plans to invest over $300 million into safety projects this year.

Amazon described in a blog post Sunday four robots it's testing to move items across its fulfillment centers and closer to workers.

Ernie helps remove items from a robotic shelf so employees don't have to. The process doesn't save time Amazon said in the post but testing has so far indicated it could make work safer for employees.

Bert is one of Amazon's first Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) made to navigate facilities independently even while workers are moving around. Unlike other robots Bert would not need to remain in a restricted space meaning workers could ask it to take items across a facility. Amazon said Bert could eventually move heavier items.

Scooter and Kermit are two other AMRs under development that transport carts. Amazon said these types of robots could take over workers' tasks of moving empty packages across facilities so they can focus on activities requiring critical thinking skills and reduce physically strenuous work.

Kermit which follows magnetic tape to move empty totes is further along in development Amazon said and will be introduced in at least a dozen North American sites this year. Amazon said it plans to deploy Scooter in at least one facility this year.

This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines examining the ways that robots artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

Bert and Ernie Scooter and Kermit may have started out as warm and fuzzy Muppet characters but now they’re part of Amazon’s team of warehouse robots as well.

Amazon showed off the latest members of its mechanical menagerie today in a blog post that focuses on how it’s using robotic research to improve workplace safety for its human employees.

For example a type of robot nicknamed Ernie is designed to take boxy product containers known as totes off shelves at different heights and then use its robotic arm to deliver the totes to warehouse employees at a standard height. The goal is to reduce the amount of reaching up or bending down that workers have to do.

“We’re known for being passionate about innovating for customers but being able to innovate with robotics for our employees is something that gives me an extra kick of motivation each day” Kevin Keck worldwide director of advanced technology at Amazon said in the blog posting. “The innovation with a robot like Ernie is interesting because while it doesn’t make the process go any faster we’re optimistic based on our testing it can make our facilities safer for employees.”

Today’s inside look at the research being done at labs in the Seattle area the Boston area and northern Italy comes in the wake of a couple of reports criticizing Amazon’s workplace safety record.

One study published by a coalition of labor unions said the rate of serious injuries among Amazon’s warehouse workers was nearly 80% higher than the equivalent rates at non-Amazon warehouses. Similar findings were reported by The Washington Post based on an analysis of records from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. (The Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.)

In his latest annual letter to shareholders Bezos acknowledged that Amazon needs to “do a better job for our employees” and said that more than $300 million will be invested in workplace safety projects this year. “We are going to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work” he vowed.

Last week Amazon announced that it would contribute $12 million to support a five-year partnership with the National Safety Council aimed at reducing musculoskeletal disorders which account for about 40% of the injuries at Amazon’s warehouses.

A significant part of Amazon’s investment in workplace safety involves research development and training. At the Seattle research and innovation lab Amazon’s team is using motion-capture technology to assess the movement of volunteer employees in a lab setting. The studies could point to new strategies for reducing stress injuries.

“We are looking to identify relatively simple changes that can make a big impact” Keck explained. “Something as simple as changing the position of handles on totes may help lower the risk of injuries to our employees at a massive scale.”

It would be impossible to discuss Amazon’s warehouse operations without mentioning Amazon’s robots: In today’s posting the company says about 350000 mobile drive unit robots currently work alongside the hundreds of thousands of humans employed at its fulfillment centers around the globe. That robotic headcount is 75% higher than the estimate that Amazon shared two years ago.

“The role robotics and advanced technology can play in not only innovating for customers but helping make our facilities safer is a massive motivation for me and my team” Keck said.

On Sesame Street Ernie’s closest friend is a tall Muppet named Bert — and there’s a robotic Bert to go with Ernie on Amazon’s warehouse floor as well.

Bert is being tested as one of Amazon’s first autonomous mobile robots or AMRs. It’s designed to find its way safely through the company’s facilities on its own.

In the future a worker could summon a robot like Bert to carry heavy loads from one end of the warehouse to the other cutting down on human wear-and-tear.

Other robots are designed to transport the standardized carts that carry packages and empty totes through Amazon’s facilities. A robot nicknamed Scooter in honor of the nerdy backstage manager on “The Muppet Show” is being tested to pull carts through Amazon’s fulfillment centers autonomously.

Amazon says it plans to deploy Scooter to at least one of its facilities this year.

Yet another breed of autonomously guided cart is nicknamed Kermit. The robot named after the frog who’s the star of “The Muppet Show” is specifically designed to move empty totes from locations in Amazon’s warehouse back to the starting line.

Kermit follows strategically placed magnetic tape to guide its location and uses tags placed along the way to determine whether it should speed up slow down or modify its course. When Kermit is on the move along its preordained track it flashes an array of signal lights in a light shade of froggy green.

Amazon says the robotic Kermits are being tested in several sites across the U.S. and will be introduced in at least a dozen more sites in North America this year.

In today’s posting Amazon acknowledges concerns that the rise of the robots will have a “potentially negative impact on jobs.”

One study suggests that automation could displace as many as 375 million workers worldwide by 2030. But others claim that robotic systems could improve the workplace experience or fill logistical gaps created by supply-chain disruptions like the coronavirus pandemic.

Amazon notes that human employment has risen much faster than its robotic headcount since 2012 reaching a total of nearly 1.3 million people worldwide.

To help its own employees get in on the robotic revolution Amazon has rolled out a $700 million training initiative called Upskilling 2025 and a robotics apprenticeship program. Back in 2016 Amazon employee Andre Grass took advantage of an on-the-job training program known as A2Tech to switch from a job readying customer orders to a role as an IT technician at a fulfillment center in Phoenix.

“It was probably one of the biggest deals that happened in my life knowing that Amazon would put even more effort into developing me” Grass said in a company profile. “I just needed somebody to give me a chance.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMjUyOTg5MS9hbWF6b24tZWNoby1zaG93LTUtMm5kLWdlbi1hbGV4YS1zbWFydC1kaXNwbGF5LXJldmlld9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Echo Show 5 (second gen) review: small screen small updates,"Amazon recently updated a couple of its Alexa-based Echo Show smart displays. The new Echo Show 8 (second gen) saw a couple of enhancements over its predecessor but the smaller Echo Show 5 has received an even smaller refresh.

There are only three basic changes in the new $84.99 Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen): it has a 2-megapixel camera instead of the 1-megapixel sensor of the first model; it comes in blue as well as the black and white color options; and the 3.5mm output jack on the back is gone. Unlike the larger Echo Show 8 the new 5 didn’t get a new processor and its camera doesn’t feature the automatic panning and cropping that the Echo Show 8 and 10 offer.

7.5 Verge Score Amazon Echo Show 5 (2nd Gen) $ 84.99 The Good Loud full sound for its size

Compact enough to put on a nightstand

Does everything an Echo speaker can do The Bad Not any faster than the prior model

Upgraded camera is still not great

Limited video calling and video streaming options $85 at Amazon$85 at Best Buy$85 at Target How we rate and review products

That means that this new model provides effectively the same experience as the prior generation. It’s a compact smart display that’s best used as a smart alarm clock or a desk companion in a home office. The 5.5-inch 960 x 480-pixel touchscreen is bright and colorful but not as easy to read from across the room as Amazon’s larger smart displays. It works as a monitor for a security camera or video doorbell but I wouldn’t want to watch much video on it — your phone is a better device for that. If you insist the Echo Show 5 supports Amazon Prime Video Netflix and YouTube via its browser but not as many video services as the larger models.

The new Echo Show 5 is available in blue in addition to white or black. The 5’s camera has been upgraded to 2 megapixels but it’s still not great. Fortunately you can block it with the built-in privacy shutter.

The single speaker inside the wedge design gets surprisingly loud and puts out more bass than expected for its size but it won’t as easily fill a room with sound. It works great for a morning alarm or listening to a podcast at a desk. The Echo Show 5 also has a handy feature that lets you tap the top of the device to snooze an alarm which is easier than trying to say “Alexa snooze” when you’re half awake. (The Google Nest Hub’s ability to just stop the alarm with a single word or to snooze when you wave your hand in front of it is still better though.)

Though the camera in the new model is 2 megapixels instead of 1 that’s not a huge upgrade. The Echo Show 5 doesn’t support Zoom so you can’t use it for work calls but it’s fine for calling from one Alexa smart display to another or to the Alexa app on a phone. Perhaps a more useful feature is the ability to view the camera’s feed through the Alexa app so you can see what’s going on at home when you’re gone. If you don’t want to use the camera at all you can block its view with the built-in privacy shutter.

Since the second-gen Echo Show 5 has the same processor as the last model it’s not any faster. Of Amazon’s smart display lineup it’s certainly the pokiest taking the most time to load a video feed from a security camera and taking an extra beat or two to pull up different screens or menus when you interact with it. Most people will probably not find that to be a problem but if you were hoping for a speed increase this time around sadly there isn’t one.

The Kids Edition Echo Show 5 comes in a unique chameleon color. The Kids Plus service that comes with the Kids Edition limits what can be played on the device.

Along with the standard Echo Show 5 Amazon is also now selling a Kids Edition model for $10 more. That gets you a custom blue-green-yellow chameleon color a year’s subscription to the Kids Plus service and a two-year warranty against accidental breakage. (A two-year damage warranty for a device that is supposed to stay put on a shelf or dresser doesn’t seem very valuable to me but I’m sure some kid out there will find a way to break the thing.)

The Kids Plus service on the Echo Show is similar to what’s available on Amazon’s Fire HD Kids Edition tablets. It allows parents to customize which content and features are available on the devices and tailor them to their child’s age. It will play music from Amazon Music and won’t allow explicit tracks. It also removes certain features like smart home controls from the Show’s touch interface.

On the tablets it’s possible to have multiple profiles that can be switched between different kids but the Echo Show doesn’t support that. If you’re planning to have more than one kid share it you have to set the limitations to the age range of just one.

The new Echo Show 5 is effectively the same as the prior model﻿.

In all the new Echo Show 5 (and its Kids Edition derivative) is basically the same as the prior model. It’s still a handy compact smart display for a nightstand or desk but it’s not as capable or fast as the larger Echo models in Amazon’s lineup. Given the limitations with the camera I would be more interested in a model without a camera at all similar to Google’s Nest Hub as the bedroom alarm clock is the ideal use case here.

At $84.99 the new model is $5 less expensive than its predecessor at launch but Amazon frequently discounts its Echo devices and you’ll likely be able to find it for less than its retail price quite often.

The person who posted the video to TikTok said it stemmed from an argument over face masks.

He said a flight attendant was called a ""fat gorilla"" for asking a passenger to wear a face mask.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Video shows the moment a flight attendant threatened to turn a plane around after a heated confrontation with a man who hurled vulgarities when asked to put on his mask.

TikTok user Brent Underwood posted multiple videos of his American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Charlotte on June 7 that was diverted to Raleigh North Carolina for three hours due to bad weather.

In the videos Underwood explains that a 22-year-old male passenger sitting behind him on the flight called a female flight attendant a ""fat gorilla"" and told her to ""suck my d—"" when she asked him to put on his face mask which is currently mandated under federal law.

Soon after a male flight attendant spoke to the passengers on the personal address system saying that if his coworkers continued to be disrespected he would make the plane go back to the gate.

@brentunderwood Part 1. @officialamericanairways on 6/7flight from LAX-NC was diverted to Raleigh because of bad weather. We refueled and we’re waiting to take off. ♬ original sound – Brent Underwood

""I understand the delays are frustrating this is not something we can control"" he said. ""But one of the things I will not tolerate is disrespect to any of my flight attendants. We will go back to the gate and you will get arrested if you disrespect any of my flight attendants on board.

""So when we tell you to put your mask on … which is a federal mask mandate you need to comply"" he continued.

""Once again I will not tolerate any disrespect to my flight attendants. It's a 30 minute flight down to Charlotte but I will be happy to go back to the gate and leave you with the cops right here in Raleigh.""

Some time later another passenger called the flight attendant who spoke a ""drama queen"" at which point the flight attendant said that the plane was being turned around.

But the flight attendant spoke again and said that they would continue on to Charlotte but chastised the passengers for their misbehavior.

""We've been in this delay with you guys just like you. We have not eaten also we've been delayed here we've catered to you the entire flight. We do it because we love this job. But the fact that we get insulted and mistreated by passengers over a thing we cannot control it is disgusting.

""We're just going to go to Charlotte because we don't want to escalate this but shame on the passengers who have made this flight a living hell for the flight attendants"" the flight attendant said.

The flight attendant's speech was met with a round of applause.

The man who filmed the videos Brent Underwood praised the professionalism of the flight attendants in an interview with The Charlotte Observer on Thursday.

""The flight crew did absolutely nothing wrong"" Underwood said. ""They were more professional than I would have been.""

American Airlines confirmed to the Charlotte Observer that the tension on the flight was in response to a mask compliance issue.

They issued a statement to the newspaper saying: ""We take the health and safety of our customers seriously and our crew members work hard to uphold the federal mask mandate that remains in effect on aircraft and in airports.

""We value the trust our customers place in our team to care for them throughout their journey and we expect those who choose to fly with us to treat each other – and our team members – with respect.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNzcG9ydHNmYW5hdGljLmNvbS90ZW4teWVhcnMtbGF0ZXItbWF2ZXJpY2tzLWxvbmUtdGl0bGUtc3RhbmRzLWFzLWEtcmVtaW5kZXItdGhhdC10aGUtam91cm5leS10by1hLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC1pcy1sb25nLWFuZC11bmNlcnRhaW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ten years later Mavericks lone title stands as a reminder that the journey to a championship is long and uncertain,"It really is so crazy that ten years have officially passed since Dirk Nowitzki Jason Terry Rick Carlisle and the rest of the 2010-2011 Dallas Mavericks took turns raising the Larry O’Brien trophy inside American Airlines Arena in Miami on June 12th 2011.

I stood inside the American Airlines Center back in Dallas and cheered with another 19000 or so other Mavs fans as we watched everything unfold on the jumbo-tron at the watching party hosted by the team. Confetti dropped down from the ceiling as the final buzzer sounded and Queen’s “We Are the Champions” rang throughout the arena.

I had just graduated high school a week before and this was the start to my adulthood. A little misleading on the “awesome things happen weekly once you’re an adult” idea but I can’t complain too much. I’d been a Mavs fan since I was in third grade roughly nine years up to that point. The evolution of becoming a die-hard fan when you’re so young is interesting. You start out just simply watching the games then take an interest in sports talk radio to hear people discuss the games you watch and then as the years went on and the internet became more plush with NBA content you start to dissect the league as a whole and begin consuming rumors about the team. An addiction that still plagues me to this day.

There was definitely a tough journey to get to that point. It was tough for me to accept as a fan I can’t even imagine what it was like for the one constant player through it all in Dirk Nowitzki.

Up to that point in his career (his 13th season) he had gone through 11 postseason exits after missing the playoffs in his first two seasons. Those seasons included making it to the Western Conference Finals in 2003 where Dirk missed most of the series due to a knee injury and then of course the team’s collapse in the 2006 NBA Finals against the Miami Heat. Sandwiched in there were four series losses in both the first and seconds rounds as well.

You know that feeling we as Mavs fans are going through after the team lost to the Clippers in game seven last Sunday? That’s really the norm. Loss. Failure. 29 out of 30 teams feel that same feeling at the end of their season each and every year.

This journey to the top is not an easy one.

There are few exceptions to this. Elite talents like LeBron James and Anthony Davis choosing to make their way to Los Angeles to bring the Lakers a title last year. LeBron James and Chris Bosh joining Dwyane Wade to form a super team that won two titles in four years in Miami. Kawhi Leonard being all-worldly in 2019 to lift an already strong Raptors team to new heights for a single championship and then darting for Los Angeles.

Even the Warriors’ recent dynasty required some work and disappointment. Steph Curry was in his sixth season and Klay Thompson in his fourth when the Warriors won their first title back in 2015. Considering Luka Doncic just finished his third season we have to understand that the formation of a championship team takes some time unless your team is located near a beach like in Miami or Los Angeles. Or perhaps we’re about to see that one can just form on a dirty subway platform in Brooklyn.

Whether or not you have faith that the Mavericks currently have the brass smart enough to put together a championship caliber squad is a different discussion. The truth is if there’s going to be another championship banner raised to the rafters of the American Airlines Center it will take some more time. No matter how amazing Luka Doncic is. Doncic won’t give the Mavs 13 years to figure out the equation like Dirk did but I highly doubt he’s planning his exit anytime soon. The team made the playoffs in two of his first three seasons. For comparison:

LeBron’s Cavs didn’t make the playoffs until his third year. Kevin Durant and the Thunder didn’t make the playoffs until his third season. Steph Curry didn’t taste the playoffs until his fourth season.

Again basically 99% of the time this takes work and time. The Mavericks are in a good spot on their growth chart. The NBA pediatrician would not be concerned at their yearly check up where they get a sticker and a lollipop at the end.

It is true that the Mavs don’t have all the time in the world to build a championship team around Luka Doncic but the 2011 Mavs and basically the rest of NBA history proves that it does take some time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzEyL2ludGVydmlldy1zb3V0aGVybi1haXJ3YXlzLWV4cHJlc3MtYW5ub3VuY2VzLW5ldy1pbnRlcmxpbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Interview: Southern Airways Express Announces New Interline,"[ Exclusive ] By Joey Gerardi

Pompano Beach Florida-based Southern Airways Express is one of the largest commuter airlines in the United States and operates over 30 aircraft all over the country from Nantucket in Massachusetts to the Hawaiian Islands. And many of their destinations include Essential Air Service (EAS) cities.

The carrier which is also comprised of Hawaii-based Mokulele operates 200 daily departures on aircraft ranging from Piper PA-31 Navajos to Cessna 208s.

This update has a lot to cover and has news of the airline from basically all corners of the country.

AirlineGeeks had the opportunity to speak with Stan Little the Chairman CEO and founder of the of the carrier and ask him some questions about each of the exciting changes coming to the airline.

New Partnership

What is perhaps the biggest piece of news is that Southern Airways Express is introducing a new interline partner United Airlines who will join the likes of American Airlines and Alaska Airlines.

This was just released by the airline only Thursday so we will be getting a first look at just how it will work.

AirlineGeeks (AG): What type of partnership will this be with United?

Stan Little (SL): It will be an interline ticket and baggage with through check-in

(AG): Can United MileagePlus members earn miles on Southern Airways Express flights?

(SL): No

(AG): Will the agreement be for just your new destinations or will it include currently operating ones?

(SL): Everywhere where we share common airports including HNL (Honolulu) OGG (Kahului) and KOA (Kona) in Hawaii.

(AG): You and United share a few airports as hubs. How will this affect your passengers at your hubs?

(SL): We will have great connectivity at Dulles as well as our existing hubs at LAX HNL (Honolulu) OGG (Kahului) and our newest hub in Denver

(AG): How will this effect your current codeshare/interline agreements?

(SL): We anticipate no effect. American is out biggest interline partner and has been for many years. DFW is one of our largest hubs for interline ticketing and AA (American Airlines) is by far our most significant partner in Pittsburgh. We look forward to continuing that relationship.

(AG): Can passengers ticket to their final destination from an SAE destination?

(SL): Absolutely those tickets will be able to be purchased on iFlySouthern.com or on United.com. We have a full bilateral agreement with United American and Alaska unlike most commuter carriers which cannot ticket worldwide itineraries from their own websites.

(AG): When will this partnership go into effect?

(SL): It has been excecated and is in the tech/testing stage now. We anticipate implementation within the next 30 days.

New Aircraft Coming to Molokai and Lanai

At the end of May 2021 Hawaiian Airlines announced it would be terminating its ‘Ohana By Hawaiian’ service. This meant there would be a considerable hole in the passenger network in the state of Hawaii specifically on the islands of Molokai and Lanai but Southern Airways Express is stepping in to pick up the slack. The Cessna 208 only features 8 or 9 seats which is much smaller than the 42-seat ATR that Hawaiian used so the answer was to purchase a new aircraft type.

The carrier will be bringing on the Beech-1900D aircraft and will be the largest aircraft they operate.

(AG): Is the B1900 new to the fleet or has SAE operated it before?

(SL): It is new to our fleet though many leading members of our Ops team in Florida have vast experience with them from their days at GulfStream Airlines where the B1900 was their primary aircraft type.

(AG): Where will SAE be acquiring the aircraft from?

(SL): They are coming from one of our lessors.

(AG): How many B1900’s will SAE have in their fleet and do you plan on increasing it in the future?

(SL): We will have only two and we don’t plan on this growing in the future. We are dedicated to providing this service to the people of Molokai and Lanai on a limited basis. The (Cessna 208) Caravan will continue to be the workhorse of our fleet.

(AG): Will the B1900’s be in the SAE livery or the Mokulele livery?

(SL): They will be in the Southern livery the first time this livery has been introduced to Hawaii. We’re doing this to differentiate the 1900’s from our primary Caravan service

(AG): How many seats will they feature?

(SL): We will fly it with 18-seats omitting the middle seat in the back row for passenger comfort.

(AG): Will you fly them only in Hawaii or will it be featured on some of your routes on the mainland?

(SL): These aircraft will be solely dedicated to Molokai and Lanai along with on-demand charters such as high school sports teams and other civic groups.

(AG): When will this aircraft be introduced to the fleet and begin flights?

(SL): We expect to have the first one on the certificate by early fall with passenger flights beginning 30-45 days later.

(AG): The B1900 has more than twice the capacity of the Cessna 208 will you bid for future EAS contracts with this aircraft?

(SL): No. The past has proven that airlines can no longer be built on 19 or even 34-seat aircraft. We understand that there’s a reason why these planes are no longer being widely flown. We are only adding two of them to our 35-aircraft fleet for a very specific and limited reason.

Shifting the Hub

We’re back to the other side of the country for the next update where the airline is moving an entire hub to a different airport. Currently they operate flights from four EAS airports in the northeast to their Baltimore-Washington hub. These cities include Lancaster DuBois and Bradford all of which are in Pennsylvania and Morgantown W.V..

But come end of June Southern Air Express will be picking up shop and moving to Washington-Dulles a major hub for United Airlines.

(AG): Why pick up and move your entire hub to a different airport?

(SL): As we began looking for better ways to provide better connectivity to our passengers in the mid-Atlantic the first idea that came to mind was connecting to a true hub operation. Pittsburgh provides numerous flights to several cities primarily in the Eastern U.S. but Dulles connects to the world.

(AG): Will the switch from Baltimore-Washington Dulles be gradual or overnight?

(SL): Overnight. The last flight out of BWI (Baltimore-Washington) will be at 10:00pm on June 27th and the first flight into Dulles will be at 8am on June 28th.

(AG): How will this affect flight times and the cost of tickets from the EAS cities connected to Washington D.C.?

(SL): Fares will remain substantially the same as they have been to BWI. The flight times will be aligned with United’s banks. This generally means earlier departures and later returns to the (EAS) hometowns in order to facilitate same-day trips when desired.

(AG): What terminal will you fly to in Dulles?

(SL): Since we have four aircraft landing and roughly the same time three times a day we’ll be parking at a remote stand and providing a shuttle to and from the ‘H Gates’. This will be especially convenient to out “local” traffic as it is close to the ticket counter and ground transportation.

(AG): How will passengers be dealt with if they have already booked flights to BWI after the switch?

(SL): We’re dealing with this on a case-by-case basis working to accommodate passenger connections when possible or refunding when necessary.

A Cessna Flight Going the Distance

Sticking with news from the Northeast the carrier will be implementing a new route from one of their EAS cities to a small island: Lancaster Penn. to Nantucket Mass.. This route will take almost two hours using one of the carrier’s seven or eight Cessna 208 Caravans that are based in the carriers Mid-Atlantic and New England networks.

(AG): When does the route start and how often will it operate?

(SL): The route will operate on Saturdays from June 5th to October 9th.

(AG): This route is between an EAS city and will connect your Mid-Atlantic and New England networks. Do you plan on starting other flights like this?

(SL): No most markets can’t support this kind of service. Lancaster is out largest EAS market and it’s also our primary maintenance base. So creating an aircraft flow into and out of maintenance is an added benefit.

(AG): What made the airline decide to begin this route?

(SL): We needed to flow aircraft to and from a maintenance base and Lancaster (plus Harrisburg and the not-too-distant Philadelphia suburbs) have considerably more people than most EAS communities.

(AG): Where will you operate out of Nantucket Airport?

(SL): For the past two years we’ve operated from the main terminal on the commuter side

(AG): LNS is also connected to Washington D.C. and Pittsburgh. Do you plan on offering flights from these cities to Nantucket with the LNS connection?

(SL): We don’t inhibit any possible connections in our network so we’d love to have connecting passengers though it might not be the most efficient routing to get there. Morgantown to Dulles to Lancaster to Nantucket might not be the most efficient way to connect the two points but it might very well be the cheapest!

The Deep South

Moving halfway across the country to the deep south specifically the state of Arkansas the carrier flies from three EAS communities in the state to both Memphis and Dallas and now plans on operating flights between the small communities. EAS communities in the state that they operate to include Harrison Hot Springs an El Dorado

(AG): Why is SAE beginning service between these small cities in Arkansas?

(SL): It’s one of the most regular requests that we get. Lots of people remember the days many years ago when Arkansas had intra-state flights. We also needed to dedicate more of our 18-weekly EAS departures to DFW because demand has been so strong. By consolidating Friday & Sunday Memphis flights over Hot Springs it allowed us to allocate more DFW capacity.

(AG): When do flights begin?

(SL): They began on June 4th and operate once a day on Fridays and Sundays.

(AG): Will residents of these small communities get extra discounts to incentivize them to fly rather than drive to neighboring towns?

(SL): Our everyday low fares easy boarding process and short flight times are three great incentives not to tackle the Arkansas back-roads!

Not only will this be the carrier’s only intra-Arkansas flights but they will also be the only airline to offer flights within the state’s borders as no other carrier currently does so.

Rocky Mountain Route

Now we head over to the Rocky Mountains for the final piece of news. Southern Airways Express is taking over the EAS contract in Chadron Nebraska from Boutique Air. The contract details can be viewed on the most recent version of ‘EAS Round Up.’ This will be the carrier’s first time flying to both Denver and Chadron meaning that they will be opening the newest hub of theirs in this update.

(AG): Is the King Air a new aircraft to the fleet?

(SL): We’ve had these in our fleet before so we have experience with them. Chadron will be serviced using King Air 200s four of which are being added to our fleet over the next six months.

(AG): Will the King Air be put into the SAE livery?

(SL): Yes it will be in Southern livery. All 35 aircraft are currently going through the paint shop to unify the livery across the system (though the Mokulele livery is being kept on the Hawaiian Caravans of course.)

(AG): How many passenger seats will the aircraft feature?

(SL): Nine just like our Caravans.

(AG): Where will you be getting the KingAirs from?

(SL): We have secured the KingAirs from existing lessors

(AG): How many KingAirs will you have in total?

(SL): Four KingAir 200s though only two are dedicated to Chadron. (One goes to Hawaii one to South Florida)

(AG): Will Chadron be the only nonstop from DEN or does the airline plan on launching others from this city?

(SL): We are looking for other opportunities from Denver to increase our aircraft utilization there but no decisions have been made.

(AG): Boutique operated Chadron-Rapid City. Will SAE look into doing this?

(SL): No. We viewed this as an effort to sway local opinion in favor of the incumbent carrier at decision time. CDR to RAP is a 90-minute drive with little traffic and RAP doesn’t offer a fraction of the connections as DEN. Unless you’re going to fly it with a lot of frequency (5-7x daily) for local traffic only it really makes little sense.

(AG): Where will you operate out of in Denver?

(SL): The ticket counter will be in Terminal East near Frontier and the Gate will be A62 near American and Frontier.

The carrier’s route map is pretty extensive and they currently operate a comprehensive network of seven different route structures around the country.

Author Joey Gerardi Joe has always been interested in planes for as long as he can remember. He grew up in Central New York during the early 2000s when US Airways Express turboprops ruled the skies. Being from a non-aviation family made it harder for him to be around planes and would only spend about three hours a month at the airport. He was so excited when he could drive by himself and the first thing he did with the license was get ice cream and go plane spotting for the entire day. When he has the time (and money) he likes to take spotting trips to any location worth a visit. He’s currently enrolled at Western Michigan University earning a degree in Aviation Management and Operations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvdmVydGljYWxzLWV2dG9sLWF2b2xvbi1hbWVyaWNhbi12aXJnaW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vertical's eVTOL aircraft attracts Avolon American Virgin -,"Zero-emissions aircraft that could potentially transport customers quickly around urban city centers and to airports are having a serious moment right now.

Irish lessor Avolon has made a massive commitment to take up to 500 Vertical Aerospace VA-X4 electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft subject to certain conditions. The arrangement inclusive of options is valued at $2 billion. American Airlines has also inked a pre-order for up to 250 of the type. And Virgin Atlantic expects to take up to 150 VA-X4 aircraft.

“Avolon will join Microsoft Rolls-Royce Honeywell and American Airlines as equity investors in Vertical” said Vertical in a statement last week.

Virgin Atlantic which will be a VA-X4 launch airline customer in Europe said: “The goal is to enable sustainable price competitive regional connectivity across the first and last 100 miles of the customer journey. For example reducing the 56-mile journey from Cambridge to London Heathrow to just 22 minutes in comparison to a 1 hour 30 drive by road.

“With 37 towns and cities with populations over 100000 within 100 miles of London Heathrow Airport the VA-X4 offers huge potential to support zero emissions short haul transfers for 7.7 million customers outside of London for flights to and from the UK’s main hub airport.”

The VA-X4 is expected to travel over 200mph with a range of over 100 miles and capacity for four passengers and a pilot.

With billions of dollars in potential commitments the eVTOL aircraft could be certified as early as 2024. Deliveries to Avolon are slated to commence in late 2024.

“Our order with Vertical will also accelerate the inevitable commercial roll out of zero emissions aircraft. Before the end of this decade we expect zero emission urban air mobility enabled by eVTOLs to play an increasingly important role in the global commercial aviation market” said Avolon CEO Dómhnal Slattery.

Derek Kerr CFO at American said: “For years American has led the industry in investing in newer more fuel-efficient aircraft. Today’s partnership is another example of that commitment and an investment in the future of air mobility. We are excited about the prospect of what this could mean for our customers and our company.”

Minnesota manufacturers of consumer products and industrial vehicles are converting them to electric power away from gas and oil. And they're encountering the same tradeoffs seen for cars and trucks.

Battery-powered devices don't emit polluting gases. But they have to be recharged and that adds a time consideration that influences the usefulness of some products.

For the recreational vehicles of Winnebago Industries based in Eden Prairie the amount of battery power needed for a cross-country trip is not yet economical. But the company is developing a market for battery-run RVs with medical clinics libraries and other businesses that can use them for relatively short distances.

For the yard equipment at Bloomington-based Toro the demand and recharge equation makes greater sense and the conversion to battery power is well underway.

Beyond products the transition to electric power gives companies a chance to move forward on broader sustainability goals including those tied to climate change.

Polaris has a partnership with Boston-based Optimus Ride to develop fully autonomous electric GEM vehicles.

""Our carbon footprint the vast majority is the usage of our equipment by our customers"" said David Strohsack vice president of global marketing at Tennant. ""So for us to reduce our carbon footprint one of the single biggest levers is to make our equipment more efficient.""

Some critics of the gasoline-to-electric power conversion argue that consumers are substituting one form of polluting energy for another because much of the nation's electricity is generated by coal or natural gas.

Even so manufacturers focus on what they can control such as making devices that charge efficiently and hold battery charges as long as they can. Here's a rundown of what's happening at five large Minnesota manufacturers.

Tennant

Eden Prairie-based Tennant Co. has electric options across its lineup of industrial and commercial cleaning equipment from small vacuums to ride-on sweepers.

""The power density and runtime of battery continues to expand which allows us to continue to expand our portfolio where we offer a full battery option"" Strohsack said.

Tennant is making some of its equipment autonomous. It has several autonomous industrial robotic floor scrubbers which are used in commercial settings like grocery stores.

Those scrubbers do need some human interaction but Tennant aims to limit that to save the time and costs of its customers.

Traditionally Tennant built bigger scubbers to get the job done faster so the person on top who is running it can have more time. But with machines that run on their own smaller is in because small machines don't need as much supervision.

Polaris

Polaris Inc. based in Medina has a history of producing electric vehicles. In 2011 it acquired Global Electric Motorcars LLC (GEM) a manufacturer of premium electric-powered vehicles for the low-speed vehicle market and Goupil a maker of on-road light-duty commercial electric vehicles.

Last September executives said they were going to amp up the electric strategy which they called rEV'd up. They formed a 10-year exclusive partnership with Santa Cruz Calif.-based Zero Motorcycles to develop electric off-road vehicles and snowmobiles using Zero's powertrain technology hardware and software.

Polaris more recently said its first product under the partnership with Zero would be an all-new 2022 electric utility side-by-side that may be available in late December. ""This will be one of the most technically advanced off-road vehicles on the market"" Mike Donoughe the company's chief technical officer said when it was announced.

In March Polaris announced another partnership teaming up with Boston-based Optimus Ride to develop fully-autonomous electric-powered vehicles that are aimed at corporate and academic campuses.

Toro

Toro’s eTriFlex greens mower is one of a growing line of lithium ion rechargeable battery-powered products from handheld devices to large riding mowers and utility vehicles.

Toro is much further ahead than some other manufacturers on the proliferation of electric power in its mix of lawn mowers and other products. It also has examined a mix of hybrid bio-fuels and other technologies.

""We are committed to developing electric products that offer both power and durability with no compromise on performance"" Toro's chief executive Rick Olson told analysts on its most recent quarterly earnings call.

In addition to the lower-emission and clean-air benefits associated with battery-powered devices they are also quieter to operate. That's beneficial for golf course and turf managers who like to get out and mow early in the morning or operate close to homes and businesses during the day.

Toro has electric fairway and greens mowers Greensmaster e1021 walk greensmower a 60V commercial walk behind mower and an e-Dingo compact utility loader for indoor construction work. Its Workman GTX series of golf utility vehicles comes in gas lead-acid battery powered and a just released lithium-Ion battery powered version.

St. Andrews Golf Club in Scotland recently purchased more of Toro's electric offerings including two new electric green mowers and six 3360 eTriFlex hybrid green mowers.

The rise of electric and hybrid options means Toro had to supplement its mechanical engineering talent with more electrical and software engineers.

Toro also has an increasingly popular line of residential products that rely on a 60-volt rechargeable lithium-ion battery that can be swapped between devices. The Flex-Force interchangeable battery can be used in string-trimmer hedge clipper chainsaw and even a 22 inch lawn mower. Toro this winter will roll out a two-stage snowblower that uses the same battery.

In its latest quarterly results Olson said the Flex-Force battery-powered products helped drive a 20% sales increase for its residential business segment.

Winnebago Industries’ all-electric RV platform is suited for commercial applications such as mobile clinics operating in mostly short-range urban and semi-urban settings.

Donaldson

Bloomington-based Donaldson is known for air filters for trucks and heavy equipment. But one of its business units is increasingly developing new products for electric vehicles.

One of the latest helps the large sealed electric vehicle battery packs have a longer life. The Donaldson product reduces pressure differences within the battery as it goes through various operating conditions and environments. It allows pressure to equalize without letting in outside contaminants.

""Our presence within the automotive market is growing with the EV products. In addition to the battery vents we also have a line of powertrain vents on e-motors and e-axels"" a Donaldson spokesperson said.

Winnebago Industries

The power tradeoff doesn't work as well for recreational vehicles as it does for sedans and SUVs. But Winnebago Industries does have an all-electric platform that since 2018 has been aimed at customers with short-range commercial needs.

The vehicles hold enough charge for eight hours of use and a range of up to 125 miles. Some have been used for mobile medical clinics bloodmobiles bookmobiles and mobile classrooms.

Winnebago continues to improve the off-grid capabilities of its RVs through the use of lithium ion batteries to run various subsystems mostly on its Class B motorhomes.

""This type of capability will be vital moving forward because we continue to see that normal RVs are starting to go to a lot of places where even gas stations don't exist let alone electric charging infrastructure"" said Winnebago spokesman Sam Jefson.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzEyLzMtc3RvY2tzLWJ1aWxkaW5nLXRoZS1uZXh0LWdlbmVyYXRpb24tZW5lcmd5LWdyaWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Stocks Building the Next-Generation Energy Grid,"These companies are making the electric grid more reliable.

The electric grid is one of the most important pieces of infrastructure in the country. It currently connects more than 9200 power-generating units over 600000 miles of transmission lines. These lines are essential in getting electricity transported to our homes and businesses. Because of the importance of electricity to our daily lives grid failures can have catastrophic consequences. That's why companies are investing heavily in upgrading this critical infrastructure.

Three companies working hard to build the next-generation grid are Brookfield Renewable (BEP 2.05%) (BEPC 1.22%) NextEra Energy (NEE 1.25%) and Xcel Energy (XEL -0.16%). Here's why those investments could pay big dividends for their investors over the coming years.

Providing support to both ends of the grid

Brookfield Renewable doesn't operate the power transmission lines that make up the electrical grid. Instead it focuses on investing in two other types of assets that will enhance the grid's reliability. First it's a leader in owning operating and developing distributed generation (DG) projects. These are off-grid power-producing assets like rooftop solar and battery storage. Thus it enables end-users to generate power closer to the source reducing the load on the power grid.

Brookfield also operates large-scale energy storage assets like pumped storage. These facilities provide critical grid-stabilizing services by supplying power when other facilities are offline. For example it delivers backup capacity to address the intermittency of greener electricity grids handling energy produced by wind- and solar-generating facilities.

The company's investments to expand those two business lines will help give Brookfield Renewable the power to grow its earnings at a double-digit annual rate in the coming years. That should support its plan to increase its dividend by around 5% to 9% per year.

Building a leading grid operator

NextEra Energy is one of the largest utilities in the country. It operates two electric utilities in Florida an electricity-generating business that happens to be the world's largest wind and solar power producer and a leading transmission business. NextEra Energy Transmission integrates renewable energy and strengthens the electricity grid.

It built this leading business via acquisition and development projects. For example earlier this year it acquired GridLiance for $660 million adding 700 miles of high-voltage transmission lines across six states. Meanwhile in 2019 it bought the Trans Bay Cable a 53-mile underwater transmission system that supplies more than 40% of the power used in San Francisco. It also won approval last year to build a new transmission line in Western New York to ease grid congestion and maximize the delivery of renewable energy in the region. Overall NextEra is becoming a leader in building the next-generation grid designed to handle increased loads from renewable energy.

Those investments will help power NextEra's growth plan to expand its earnings per share at a 6% to 8% annual rate through 2023. That could support dividend growth of around 10% through next year.

Rapidly expanding its grid

Xcel Energy operates one of the fastest-growing investor-owned transmission systems. It has more than 20000 miles of transmission lines across 10 states.

The utility is investing heavily to expand its transmission business to help support increased renewable energy deployment. Overall the company is investing $24.3 billion through 2025 to expand its operations with 25% of that spending earmarked for electric transmission projects. One notable project is the proposed Colorado Pathway Transmission expansion. Xcel could invest up to $1.7 billion to build 560 miles of transmission lines that could support roughly 5.5 gigawatts of new renewable power generation.

Those transmission-related investments will help power Xcel's plan to grow its earnings per share at a 5% to 7% annual rate over the coming years. That should support similar yearly increases in its 2.6%-yielding dividend.

Building the future of energy

The global economy is switching power sources from fossil fuels to renewable energy. That will require a significant investment to upgrade the power grid. While many companies stand to benefit from this megatrend Brookfield Renewable NextEra Energy and Xcel Energy are great options for investors. That's because their investments should pay immediate benefits to shareholders via steadily rising dividends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMTMvb3Bpbmlvbi9zdGltdWx1cy11bmVtcGxveW1lbnQtcmVwdWJsaWNhbnMtcG92ZXJ0eS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | What the Rich Don't Want to Admit About the Poor (Published 2021),"I’m not going to pretend that I know how to interpret the jobs and inflation data of the past few months. My view is that this is still an economy warped by the pandemic and that the dynamics are so strange and so unstable that it will be some time before we know its true state. But the reaction to the early numbers and anecdotes has revealed something deeper and more constant in our politics.

The American economy runs on poverty or at least the constant threat of it. Americans like their goods cheap and their services plentiful and the two of them together require a sprawling labor force willing to work tough jobs at crummy wages. On the right the barest glimmer of worker power is treated as a policy emergency and the whip of poverty not the lure of higher wages is the appropriate response.

[Hear more from Ezra Klein by following his New York Times Opinion podcast “The Ezra Klein Show.”]

Reports that low-wage employers were having trouble filling open jobs sent Republican policymakers into a tizzy and led at least 25 Republican governors — and one Democratic governor — to announce plans to cut off expanded unemployment benefits early. Chipotle said that it would increase prices by about 4 percent to cover the cost of higher wages prompting the National Republican Congressional Committee to issue a blistering response: “Democrats’ socialist stimulus bill caused a labor shortage and now burrito lovers everywhere are footing the bill.” The Trumpist outlet The Federalist complained “Restaurants have had to bribe current and prospective workers with fatter paychecks to lure them off their backsides and back to work.”

But it’s not just the right. The financial press the cable news squawkers and even many on the center-left greet news of labor shortages and price increases with an alarm they rarely bring to the ongoing agonies of poverty or low-wage toil.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVudGlmaWNhbWVyaWNhbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zZWFyY2hpbmctZm9yLWNpdHktbGlnaHRzLW9uLW90aGVyLXBsYW5ldHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Searching for City Lights on Other Planets,"About a decade ago I attended a conference inaugurating the campus of New York University in Abu Dhabi along with a colleague from Princeton University Ed Turner. The conference included a tour through the neighborhood during which the local guide bragged that their city lights can be seen all the way from the moon. Ed and I looked at each other and wondered: from how far away could the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) detect city lights?

During the following day we calculated that the Hubble Deep Field could notice a city like Tokyo on objects in the Kuiper belt at 30–50 times the Earth-sun separation. But can we distinguish artificial lights from natural reflection of sunlight if they have a similar color?

In answering this question Ed and I stumbled across a key insight concerning the dependence of the observed flux on the distance of the light source. The flux of reflected sunlight declines inversely with the square of the reflector’s distance from the sun (regarding the sunlight intercepted by it) times the square of its distance from us (for the light we receive). For sources very far away the product of these factors implies dimming inversely with distance to the fourth power. On the other hand an artificial source that produces its own light acts like a light bulb and dims only inversely with the square of its distance from us. By checking whether a Kuiper belt object dims inversely with distance to the second or fourth power as it recedes away along its orbit one can infer whether it emits its own light.

Coincidentally one of the leading observers of the Kuiper belt objects visited my office afterwards. I did not miss the opportunity to ask him: “Did you ever check how the brightness of Kuiper belt objects changes with distance along their orbits?” He replied without hesitation: “Why would I check? It must follow the dependence expected from reflected sunlight.” To which I could only say: “If you are not willing to discover wonderful things you will never find them.”

But I am patient. Education takes time especially when dealing with scientists. When I was asked recently how long humans can stay ignorant about nature I answered that people can refuse to consider evidence that contradicts their convictions for millennia. This was the case regarding the notions that we are located at the center of the universe or that the outcomes of wars are dictated by planets and stars in the sky. The extent of our ignorance is unlimited. We could choose to stay uninformed forever just like animals.

Admittedly it is unlikely for a light source as bright as the city of Tokyo to exist in the outskirts of the solar system unless it is associated with a giant spaceship passing by. But we could potentially search for artificial lights from habitable planets around other stars.

The closest is Proxima b a planet in the habitable zone of our nearest neighbor the dwarf star Proxima Centauri which is located 4.25 light years away. Since the planet is 20 times closer to its faint star than the Earth is from the bright sun Proxima b is thought to be tidally locked with permanent dayside and nightside (just as the moon faces Earth with the same side at all times). A technological civilization on Proxima b might opt to transfer heat and electricity from the warm illuminated day side to the cold dark night side. This could be accomplished for example by coating the dayside with photovoltaic cells that generate electricity out of starlight. In a paper with my former postdoc Manasvi Lingam we showed that substantial coverage of the dayside by solar panels could be detected with future telescopes based on the spectral edge that they exhibit in their reflectance of starlight.

This raises an interesting hypothetical question. If the nightside of Proxima b is illuminated by artificial light could we detect it with HST’s successor the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) scheduled for launch this year? Since JWST is bigger and more sensitive than HST it would allow us to peer farther into space and extend the search for artificial lights from the Kuiper belt to habitable exoplanets like Proxima b. I explored this question in a new paper with an undergraduate student from Stanford University Elisa Tabor.

We computed the light curve expected from a partially lit Proxima b as it orbits its star. Our calculations showed that JWST will be able to detect light emitting diode (LED) lamps on the nightside making up 5 percent of the stellar illumination of its dayside. But even if the artificial illumination is as faint as our civilization currently utilizes (0.01 percent) on the nightside of Earth JWST could detect it as long as it was limited to a frequency band that is a thousand times narrower than the stellar light. Future observatories like the proposed Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) space telescope will be able to detect even fainter levels of artificial illumination on the nightside of Proxima b.

The search for city lights on habitable planets may sound speculative but it is worth pursuing as a potential technosignature with planned instruments. Proxima b orbits its star every 11.2 days providing 32.6 more opportunities for its possible inhabitants to celebrate their birthdays than we have on Earth once per 365.2 days. The high demand for bright lights during birthday parties on the nightside of Proxima b would be a reason for us to celebrate as well if the signal was noticed by future telescopes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB1bXBzYW5kc3lzdGVtcy5jb20vbGF0ZXN0LWV1LWVmZmljaWVuY3ktbGVnaXNsYXRpb24taW1wYWN0cy1ub3J0aC1hbWVyaWNhbi1wdW1wLW9lbXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Latest EU Efficiency Legislation Impacts North American Pump OEMs,"North American pump OEMs that ship products to the European Union (EU) may want to check their product motor nameplates before they leave the warehouse.

Beginning July 1 new product design requirements take effect across the EU establishing new energy efficiency standards that could significantly impact many North American-made pumps.



IMAGE 1: Regulation from Jan. 1 2017 to June 30 2021 (Images courtesy of Nidec Motor Corporation via CAPIEL/CEMEP 2019 report)

First introduced in 2009 and updated twice since the European Commission’s Ecodesign Directive aims to reduce energy consumption throughout a product’s life cycle. But its regulations for electric motors and variable speed drives have historically lagged behind those in North American energy efficiency legislation.

That is about to change. With the latest updates the EU has joined and in some cases leapfrogged past North American efficiency requirements. Products that do not meet these energy standards will be prohibited from entering the EU market after July 1.

Get Ready

Here is what is changing—and what users need to do to be ready for shipments coming up this summer.

For the past 30 years pump OEMs have been able to choose a single motor or motor-drive combination for each product they manufacture and export identical products around the globe. The change in EU efficiency regulations however may require OEMs to install different motors in products exported to the EU or sold in North America but that may eventually end up somewhere else.

It is important to understand and act on these changes now so noncompliant products do not get stuck at the port if they are discovered to be below standards.

Changing premium efficiency qualifications

Since 2017 EU rules said products requiring premium efficiency (known in the EU as IE3) motors could as an alternative use high efficiency (known in the EU as IE2) motors operated with a variable frequency drive (VFD). A large percentage of the EU market chose the IE2 motor/drive option.



IMAGE 2: Regulations beginning July 1 2021. Information from CAPIEL/CEMEP 2019

With the revised regulations products with these motor/drive combinations will no longer meet EU Ecodesign Directive requirements. Beginning July 1 most induction motors between 50 volts (V) and 1000 V will require premium efficiency (IE3) motors whether used with a drive or not.

The 60/50 hertz (Hz) complication

In North America many premium efficiency (IE3) motors are labeled 60/50 Hz. That is because they are built to perform at the 60 Hz standard and meet premium efficiency while used in North America. They are also able to run at the 50 Hz system standard used in the EU but at an IE2 efficiency.

With the latest changes the EU efficiency standards now limit the ability to use a 60/50 Hz motor for EU applications. The new Ecodesign Directive regulations say that a 60/50 Hz premium efficiency (IE3) motor that meets IE3 at 60 Hz must also meet IE3 at 50 Hz. Typically a motor that meets IE3 at 60 Hz will only meet IE2 and not IE3 at 50 Hz.

Come July 1 in other words a 60/50 Hz premium efficiency motor will no longer meet EU IE3 efficiency standards—only a “pure” 50 Hz premium efficiency motor will.

What OEMs Can Do

To address these changes pump OEMs have two primary options. The first simpler option is to switch to a dedicated 50 Hz premium efficiency (IE3) motor for both OEM and general-purpose use globally.



IMAGE 3: Regulations starting July 1 2023. Information from CAPIEL / CEMEP 2019

A 50 Hz premium efficiency (IE3) motor will meet EU efficiency standards and exceed North American 60 Hz efficiency standards. While certainly possible this option is not very practical for many OEMs since it will increase motor costs by as much as 25%.

A second more economical alternative is to stock two versions of premium efficiency motors—one rated for 60 Hz for use in North America and one rated 50 Hz for use in the EU. The current 60/50 Hz designs could continue to be used for other geographic regions that only require IE2 efficiency at 50 Hz.

Small Motor Implications

The EU’s latest Ecodesign Directive also seeks to fill other energy efficiency regulation gaps. For example a small motor rule is going into place. Beginning July 1 fractional motors between 0.12 kilowatts (kW) and 0.75 kW must now meet IE2 efficiency requirements. Previously the EU Ecodesign Directive did not include regulations governing fractional motors.

The new small motor regulations are more expansive than the ones governing motor efficiency regulations in the U.S. where only small open motors are regulated. Definite purpose and totally enclosed fractional horsepower motors currently remain unregulated in the North American regulations.

Because they are unregulated in North America fractional motors of less than 0.75 kW have historically not listed their efficiency on their nameplates. With the new EU regulations OEMs must upgrade the nameplates to not only meet the new efficiency standards but also to address all labeling requirements. For example the standard used for testing and labeling procedures must now be noted.

Act Now

For North American pump OEMs that have relied on a single motor or motor and drive pumping solution for their products there is no time to waste. It is time to contact the motor manufacturer confirm the type of motors and confirm that they comply with the updated EU efficiency standards.

Every situation is different. While this article provides an overview of the new standards it will take a careful product review to determine what if anything must be done to prevent products from being held at EU Customs.

Now is the time to look ahead to July 1 2023 when the next set of new EU efficiency regulations take effect. That is the date when large 75 kW to 250 kW motors will be required to meet IE4 efficiency standards in the EU.

I'm a big fan of Qatar Airways' Qsuite named the Best International Business-Class Product at the TPG Awards. Award availability can be plentiful from time to time but you'll still need to redeem at least 70000 American AAdvantage miles each way for an international business-class flight from the U.S.

At the moment however there's another fantastic opportunity to book. As reported by One Mile at a Time Qatar Airways is currently offering $550 off a round-trip flight or $275 off a one-way flight booked in business class.

Flights need to be booked directly through the airline's website by July 11 2021 using the code MPMEMBERS for travel through July 11 2022. That means you won't be able to redeem points to book through a travel portal unfortunately.

Flights from all U.S. gateways are eligible including Atlanta (ATL) Boston (BOS) Chicago (ORD) Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW) Houston (IAH) Los Angeles (LAX) Miami (MIA) New York (JFK) Philadelphia (PHL) San Francisco (SFO) Seattle (SEA) and Washington D.C. (IAD).

In theory you can book discounted flights to all 100+ Qatar Airways international destinations but I wasn't able to trigger the discount on some of the airline's lowest ""classic"" fares.

Meme stocks aside there's arguably been no investment hotter in 2021 than joke-based cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE -0.83%). At one point in early May it had delivered a trailing-six-month return of 27000%. For context that's higher than the benchmark S&P 500 including dividends over the past 56 years.

While there are a number of reasons retail investors are sold on Dogecoin as the future currency of the world one of the most-commonly cited catalysts are its lower transaction fees relative to the Big Two in crypto Bitcoin (BTC -2.09%) and Ethereum. After all a new medium for transactions should be more efficient than the existing infrastructure it's trying to replace.

However the reality is that Dogecoin's transaction fees are markedly higher ($0.74 as of June 8) than a number of other popular digital currencies. According to BitInfoCharts.com and various white-paper data the following seven popular cryptocurrencies (listed in no particular order) all offer significantly cheaper transaction fees. And they happen to be more efficient at validating and settling transactions too.

1. Stellar

Under-the-radar cryptocurrency Stellar (XLM -0.70%) which I've chosen as one of my digital currency survivors can easily undercut and outperform Dogecoin. Payments made on Stellar's blockchain can be verified and settled in mere seconds -- Dogecoin takes closer to 20 minutes -- and the average transaction costs 0.00001 of a Lumen Stellar's token. Based on the Lumen's price of $0.36 on June 9 the average fee is about $0.000004 per transaction.

What's more Stellar's developers have claimed it can handle up to 3000 transactions per second which would give it a real chance to become a medium for payments in the future.

2. Ripple

Another payments-focused cryptocurrency with exceptionally low fees is Ripple (XRP -1.36%). The average transaction on Ripple's open-source decentralized blockchain takes approximately 3 to 5 seconds to validate and settle which would substantially expedite the up to one week it can take some cross-border payments to complete. Ripple can do all of this for a fee of approximately $0.00265 according to BitInfoCharts.

It's also noteworthy that Ripple has partnered with a number of financial institutions to test its RippleNet cross-border payments network. These include Bank of America American Express and Royal Bank of Canada.

3. Ethereum Classic

Even though it's known more for its smart contracts than its payment prowess Ethereum Classic (ETC 2.07%) can also run circles around Dogecoin. Ethereum Classic is capable of handling in the neighborhood of 15 transactions per second and according to BitInfoCharts has a transaction fee of less than a penny ($0.00749 as of June 8). It's completing most transactions in 5 to 7 1/2 minutes which is considerably quicker than Dogecoin as well.

More than likely Ethereum Classic's future will depend on its ability to upgrade its smart contracts -- i.e. the protocols that help to verify facilitate and enforce the negotiation of a contract.

4. Monero

While it might not be the most obvious payment choice next to Ripple and Stellar privacy coin Monero (XMR 1.74%) also offers substantially lower transaction fees relative to Dogecoin. As of this past week the average transaction on Monero's blockchain cost $0.059. That's 92% lower than Dogecoin's typical transaction fee.

What makes Monero so intriguing is its open-source protocol known as CryptoNote which creates ring signatures that obfuscate the name of the sender of payments made in XMR (Monero's coin). Or in English it makes it impossible for an outside observer to know who sent a payment. Once a transmittance has been made only the recipient will be able to see the stealth address making the transaction anonymous and secure.

5. Nano

Nano (NANO -6.23%) is unique among the cryptocurrencies in this discussion because it has no transaction fees. That's right folks: It doesn't get any cheaper than free! Transactions are also validated and completed in under a second in most cases. This suggests over 1000 transactions can be completed with Nano before a single Dogecoin transaction is confirmed by miners.

Rather than relying on a single blockchain where people are competing to add blocks every user operates a blockchain that they can add to. This Block Lattice as Nano refers to it is transparent immutable and ensures that expansion can be limitless without compromising network performance.

6. Cardano

Ultra-popular cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA 2.34%) can also run circles around Dogecoin from an efficiency standpoint. It's verifying and settling transactions considerably faster and its average transaction fee equates to roughly 0.16 to 0.17 ADA (Cardano's token) or about $0.27 at the midpoint.

Most eyes are on the rapid multi-point development of Cardano's blockchain. An upgrade last summer known as Shelley increased the number of nodes that network participants can run which ultimately boosted average daily transactions well over tenfold. There's also the Goguen development which incorporates smart contacts onto Cardano's blockchain. The launch of smart contracts in the coming months should really ramp up interest in Cardano.

7. Litecoin

Even though Litecoin (LTC 2.06%) and Dogecoin share some history (Dogecoin is a fork of LuckyCoin which was itself forked from Litecoin) Litecoin is the far superior of the two in terms of efficiency. The typical Litecoin transaction settles in 2 1/2 minutes which is one-quarter of the time for Bitcoin and one-eighth the time for Dogecoin on average. Its transaction fee of $0.0075 is also microscopic next to Dogecoin's.

Although acceptance for cryptocurrencies remains minimal worldwide it's also worth pointing out that roughly twice as many businesses accept Litecoin compared to Dogecoin according to online business directory Cryptwerk.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzEyL2ludGVydmlldy1zb3V0aGVybi1haXJ3YXlzLWV4cHJlc3MtYW5ub3VuY2VzLW5ldy1pbnRlcmxpbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Interview: Southern Airways Express Announces New Interline,"[ Exclusive ] By Joey Gerardi

Pompano Beach Florida-based Southern Airways Express is one of the largest commuter airlines in the United States and operates over 30 aircraft all over the country from Nantucket in Massachusetts to the Hawaiian Islands. And many of their destinations include Essential Air Service (EAS) cities.

The carrier which is also comprised of Hawaii-based Mokulele operates 200 daily departures on aircraft ranging from Piper PA-31 Navajos to Cessna 208s.

This update has a lot to cover and has news of the airline from basically all corners of the country.

AirlineGeeks had the opportunity to speak with Stan Little the Chairman CEO and founder of the of the carrier and ask him some questions about each of the exciting changes coming to the airline.

New Partnership

What is perhaps the biggest piece of news is that Southern Airways Express is introducing a new interline partner United Airlines who will join the likes of American Airlines and Alaska Airlines.

This was just released by the airline only Thursday so we will be getting a first look at just how it will work.

AirlineGeeks (AG): What type of partnership will this be with United?

Stan Little (SL): It will be an interline ticket and baggage with through check-in

(AG): Can United MileagePlus members earn miles on Southern Airways Express flights?

(SL): No

(AG): Will the agreement be for just your new destinations or will it include currently operating ones?

(SL): Everywhere where we share common airports including HNL (Honolulu) OGG (Kahului) and KOA (Kona) in Hawaii.

(AG): You and United share a few airports as hubs. How will this affect your passengers at your hubs?

(SL): We will have great connectivity at Dulles as well as our existing hubs at LAX HNL (Honolulu) OGG (Kahului) and our newest hub in Denver

(AG): How will this effect your current codeshare/interline agreements?

(SL): We anticipate no effect. American is out biggest interline partner and has been for many years. DFW is one of our largest hubs for interline ticketing and AA (American Airlines) is by far our most significant partner in Pittsburgh. We look forward to continuing that relationship.

(AG): Can passengers ticket to their final destination from an SAE destination?

(SL): Absolutely those tickets will be able to be purchased on iFlySouthern.com or on United.com. We have a full bilateral agreement with United American and Alaska unlike most commuter carriers which cannot ticket worldwide itineraries from their own websites.

(AG): When will this partnership go into effect?

(SL): It has been excecated and is in the tech/testing stage now. We anticipate implementation within the next 30 days.

New Aircraft Coming to Molokai and Lanai

At the end of May 2021 Hawaiian Airlines announced it would be terminating its ‘Ohana By Hawaiian’ service. This meant there would be a considerable hole in the passenger network in the state of Hawaii specifically on the islands of Molokai and Lanai but Southern Airways Express is stepping in to pick up the slack. The Cessna 208 only features 8 or 9 seats which is much smaller than the 42-seat ATR that Hawaiian used so the answer was to purchase a new aircraft type.

The carrier will be bringing on the Beech-1900D aircraft and will be the largest aircraft they operate.

(AG): Is the B1900 new to the fleet or has SAE operated it before?

(SL): It is new to our fleet though many leading members of our Ops team in Florida have vast experience with them from their days at GulfStream Airlines where the B1900 was their primary aircraft type.

(AG): Where will SAE be acquiring the aircraft from?

(SL): They are coming from one of our lessors.

(AG): How many B1900’s will SAE have in their fleet and do you plan on increasing it in the future?

(SL): We will have only two and we don’t plan on this growing in the future. We are dedicated to providing this service to the people of Molokai and Lanai on a limited basis. The (Cessna 208) Caravan will continue to be the workhorse of our fleet.

(AG): Will the B1900’s be in the SAE livery or the Mokulele livery?

(SL): They will be in the Southern livery the first time this livery has been introduced to Hawaii. We’re doing this to differentiate the 1900’s from our primary Caravan service

(AG): How many seats will they feature?

(SL): We will fly it with 18-seats omitting the middle seat in the back row for passenger comfort.

(AG): Will you fly them only in Hawaii or will it be featured on some of your routes on the mainland?

(SL): These aircraft will be solely dedicated to Molokai and Lanai along with on-demand charters such as high school sports teams and other civic groups.

(AG): When will this aircraft be introduced to the fleet and begin flights?

(SL): We expect to have the first one on the certificate by early fall with passenger flights beginning 30-45 days later.

(AG): The B1900 has more than twice the capacity of the Cessna 208 will you bid for future EAS contracts with this aircraft?

(SL): No. The past has proven that airlines can no longer be built on 19 or even 34-seat aircraft. We understand that there’s a reason why these planes are no longer being widely flown. We are only adding two of them to our 35-aircraft fleet for a very specific and limited reason.

Shifting the Hub

We’re back to the other side of the country for the next update where the airline is moving an entire hub to a different airport. Currently they operate flights from four EAS airports in the northeast to their Baltimore-Washington hub. These cities include Lancaster DuBois and Bradford all of which are in Pennsylvania and Morgantown W.V..

But come end of June Southern Air Express will be picking up shop and moving to Washington-Dulles a major hub for United Airlines.

(AG): Why pick up and move your entire hub to a different airport?

(SL): As we began looking for better ways to provide better connectivity to our passengers in the mid-Atlantic the first idea that came to mind was connecting to a true hub operation. Pittsburgh provides numerous flights to several cities primarily in the Eastern U.S. but Dulles connects to the world.

(AG): Will the switch from Baltimore-Washington Dulles be gradual or overnight?

(SL): Overnight. The last flight out of BWI (Baltimore-Washington) will be at 10:00pm on June 27th and the first flight into Dulles will be at 8am on June 28th.

(AG): How will this affect flight times and the cost of tickets from the EAS cities connected to Washington D.C.?

(SL): Fares will remain substantially the same as they have been to BWI. The flight times will be aligned with United’s banks. This generally means earlier departures and later returns to the (EAS) hometowns in order to facilitate same-day trips when desired.

(AG): What terminal will you fly to in Dulles?

(SL): Since we have four aircraft landing and roughly the same time three times a day we’ll be parking at a remote stand and providing a shuttle to and from the ‘H Gates’. This will be especially convenient to out “local” traffic as it is close to the ticket counter and ground transportation.

(AG): How will passengers be dealt with if they have already booked flights to BWI after the switch?

(SL): We’re dealing with this on a case-by-case basis working to accommodate passenger connections when possible or refunding when necessary.

A Cessna Flight Going the Distance

Sticking with news from the Northeast the carrier will be implementing a new route from one of their EAS cities to a small island: Lancaster Penn. to Nantucket Mass.. This route will take almost two hours using one of the carrier’s seven or eight Cessna 208 Caravans that are based in the carriers Mid-Atlantic and New England networks.

(AG): When does the route start and how often will it operate?

(SL): The route will operate on Saturdays from June 5th to October 9th.

(AG): This route is between an EAS city and will connect your Mid-Atlantic and New England networks. Do you plan on starting other flights like this?

(SL): No most markets can’t support this kind of service. Lancaster is out largest EAS market and it’s also our primary maintenance base. So creating an aircraft flow into and out of maintenance is an added benefit.

(AG): What made the airline decide to begin this route?

(SL): We needed to flow aircraft to and from a maintenance base and Lancaster (plus Harrisburg and the not-too-distant Philadelphia suburbs) have considerably more people than most EAS communities.

(AG): Where will you operate out of Nantucket Airport?

(SL): For the past two years we’ve operated from the main terminal on the commuter side

(AG): LNS is also connected to Washington D.C. and Pittsburgh. Do you plan on offering flights from these cities to Nantucket with the LNS connection?

(SL): We don’t inhibit any possible connections in our network so we’d love to have connecting passengers though it might not be the most efficient routing to get there. Morgantown to Dulles to Lancaster to Nantucket might not be the most efficient way to connect the two points but it might very well be the cheapest!

The Deep South

Moving halfway across the country to the deep south specifically the state of Arkansas the carrier flies from three EAS communities in the state to both Memphis and Dallas and now plans on operating flights between the small communities. EAS communities in the state that they operate to include Harrison Hot Springs an El Dorado

(AG): Why is SAE beginning service between these small cities in Arkansas?

(SL): It’s one of the most regular requests that we get. Lots of people remember the days many years ago when Arkansas had intra-state flights. We also needed to dedicate more of our 18-weekly EAS departures to DFW because demand has been so strong. By consolidating Friday & Sunday Memphis flights over Hot Springs it allowed us to allocate more DFW capacity.

(AG): When do flights begin?

(SL): They began on June 4th and operate once a day on Fridays and Sundays.

(AG): Will residents of these small communities get extra discounts to incentivize them to fly rather than drive to neighboring towns?

(SL): Our everyday low fares easy boarding process and short flight times are three great incentives not to tackle the Arkansas back-roads!

Not only will this be the carrier’s only intra-Arkansas flights but they will also be the only airline to offer flights within the state’s borders as no other carrier currently does so.

Rocky Mountain Route

Now we head over to the Rocky Mountains for the final piece of news. Southern Airways Express is taking over the EAS contract in Chadron Nebraska from Boutique Air. The contract details can be viewed on the most recent version of ‘EAS Round Up.’ This will be the carrier’s first time flying to both Denver and Chadron meaning that they will be opening the newest hub of theirs in this update.

(AG): Is the King Air a new aircraft to the fleet?

(SL): We’ve had these in our fleet before so we have experience with them. Chadron will be serviced using King Air 200s four of which are being added to our fleet over the next six months.

(AG): Will the King Air be put into the SAE livery?

(SL): Yes it will be in Southern livery. All 35 aircraft are currently going through the paint shop to unify the livery across the system (though the Mokulele livery is being kept on the Hawaiian Caravans of course.)

(AG): How many passenger seats will the aircraft feature?

(SL): Nine just like our Caravans.

(AG): Where will you be getting the KingAirs from?

(SL): We have secured the KingAirs from existing lessors

(AG): How many KingAirs will you have in total?

(SL): Four KingAir 200s though only two are dedicated to Chadron. (One goes to Hawaii one to South Florida)

(AG): Will Chadron be the only nonstop from DEN or does the airline plan on launching others from this city?

(SL): We are looking for other opportunities from Denver to increase our aircraft utilization there but no decisions have been made.

(AG): Boutique operated Chadron-Rapid City. Will SAE look into doing this?

(SL): No. We viewed this as an effort to sway local opinion in favor of the incumbent carrier at decision time. CDR to RAP is a 90-minute drive with little traffic and RAP doesn’t offer a fraction of the connections as DEN. Unless you’re going to fly it with a lot of frequency (5-7x daily) for local traffic only it really makes little sense.

(AG): Where will you operate out of in Denver?

(SL): The ticket counter will be in Terminal East near Frontier and the Gate will be A62 near American and Frontier.

The carrier’s route map is pretty extensive and they currently operate a comprehensive network of seven different route structures around the country.

Author Joey Gerardi Joe has always been interested in planes for as long as he can remember. He grew up in Central New York during the early 2000s when US Airways Express turboprops ruled the skies. Being from a non-aviation family made it harder for him to be around planes and would only spend about three hours a month at the airport. He was so excited when he could drive by himself and the first thing he did with the license was get ice cream and go plane spotting for the entire day. When he has the time (and money) he likes to take spotting trips to any location worth a visit. He’s currently enrolled at Western Michigan University earning a degree in Aviation Management and Operations."

Now that they’re committed they're favourites to win it.

Brazil's football team celebrates after winning the previous Copa America against Peru on July 7 2019 in Rio de Janeiro Brazil.

Argentina still looms as a threat to Brazil's title defence but now as a visiting team.

Argentina and Colombia were dropped as tournament co-hosts before Brazil contentiously stepped in late to stage the continental championship.

Being away from home takes some pressure off Lionel Messi and his Argentina team.

The Copa America will kick off Sunday with defending champion Brazil against Venezuela at the Mané Garrincha stadium in Brasilia. The final will be on July 10 at the Maracanã stadium in Rio de Janeiro one of the Covid-19 epicentres in Brazil where more than 480000 have died from the coronavirus.

Eleven players have already tested positive for Covid-19 upon arriving in Brazil. Eight are Venezuelans and three Bolivians football bodies of the two countries said on Saturday.

Bolivia's first match in the tournament will be on Monday against Paraguay.

South American football body CONMEBOL stressed in a statement that “the matches will be played as scheduled”.

Brazil health minister Marcelo Queiroga said Venezuela players who have the virus will return only after they test negative. He said there’s no reason for the Brazil match not to take place on Sunday.

No spectators will be allowed to attend any Copa America matches because of restrictions in place for the pandemic which has already delayed the tournament by a year.

No boycott

Brazil players ended speculation about a potential boycott by issuing a unified statement on Wednesday saying they are “unsatisfied” with the decision to move the tournament to their country but it wouldn't stop them representing their national team.

And if South American World Cup qualifiers are anything to go by the Copa America title is Brazil's to lose. Brazil has won all six of its games and is six points clear of second place Argentina. With the likes of Neymar on board coach Tite expects not only to defend the title lifted in 2019 but also use the next 30 days to prepare for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Many tests are expected. Alisson is no longer the team's unchallenged goalkeeper with Ederson getting more chances to start.

Captain Casemiro is yet to find out whether he will play as defensive midfielder next to Douglas Luiz Fred or Lucas Paqueta. And four options appear up front to work with Neymar: Gabriel Jesus Roberto Firmino Richarlison and Gabriel Barbosa.

Argentina placed third in the 2019 Copa America but the team has improved under coach Lionel Scaloni.

Defender Cristian Romero and midfielders Leandro Paredes and Giovani Lo Celso are now trusted to break the opponents' lines. Up front Lautaro Martínez and Sergio Agüero bring the same respect.

And that means Messi who turns 34 later this month doesn't need to be part of every play for Argentina to win.

“Argentina always dominates sometimes in a very vertical way"" Scaloni said. “If you look at all our matches in qualifiers we deserved to win. But at soccer deserving doesn't count.”

Argentina hasn't won a major title since the 1993 Copa America.

An improved Colombia

Colombia has improved since the return of coach Reinaldo Rueda. It trashed Peru 3-0 in Lima and got a late equaliser to force a 2-2 draw after being two goals down against Argentina. Copa America could further enhance the team which will not have midfielder James Rodríguez because of fitness problems.

Uruguay has struggled despite counting on Luis Suárez and Edison Cavani who will return to the team after a two-match suspension in World Cup qualifiers. Uruguay hasn't won any of its three latest matches on the road to Qatar.

“We have to be aware there's things to improve as always and get ready for something that gives us a lot of aspiration"" Uruguay coach Oscar Tabárez said after Tuesday's 0-0 draw with Venezuela.

Peru the 2019 Copa America runner-up is struggling in World Cup qualifying but hoping a 2-1 win at Ecuador earlier this week might spark a change in momentum. Coach Ricardo Garca decided not to bring in striker Paolo Guerrero who is returning from injury. He will be relying instead on Santiago Ormeño who plays at Mexico's León.

Chile coach Martín Lasarte has decided to use an inexperienced squad in Copa America making it more of a priority to qualify for the next World Cup.

“We will use it as a tool to strengthen younger players” he said. Chile is currently in sixth place in qualifying.

The 12-player roster announced Saturday by the National Wheelchair Basketball Association (NWBA) governing body for the sport in the United States features eight athletes who were on the gold medal-winning team at the Paralympic Games Rio 2016.

“We were very pleased with how competitive this year's selection was. Without having the chance to train together in over a year and a half we picked up where we left off” said U.S. head coach Ron Lykins in an NWBA news release. “The twelve athletes selected give us plenty of veteran leadership that should help us have success in Tokyo.

Unmotivated. No self-discipline. No willpower. These are just a few of the widespread stereotypes ingrained in American society about people who have a higher body weight or larger body size. Known as weight stigma these attitudes result in many Americans being blamed teased bullied mistreated and discriminated against. There is nowhere to hide from societal weight stigma. Decades of research confirm the presence of weight stigma in workplaces schools health-care settings public accommodations and the mass media as well as in close interpersonal relationships with friends and families. It’s everywhere.

I’m a psychologist and researcher at the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut. For 20 years my team has studied weight stigma. We’ve examined the origins and prevalence of weight stigma its presence across different societal settings the harm it causes for people’s health and strategies to tackle this problem.

We conducted a recent international study that clearly shows that weight stigma is widespread damaging and difficult to eradicate. This societal devaluation is a real and legitimate experience for people across different countries languages and cultures.

Among U.S. adults weight stigma is a common experience with as many as 40 percent reporting past experiences of weight-based teasing unfair treatment and discrimination. These experiences are most prevalent for people with high body mass indexes or those with obesity and for women. For youth body weight is one of the most prevalent reasons for teasing and bullying.

That more than 40 percent of Americans have obesity has not softened public attitudes toward people in this group. Although societal attitudes toward other stigmatized groups have become less prejudiced in recent decades there has been little change in weight bias. In some cases it’s worsening.

Prevailing views that people are personally responsible for their weight despite ample scientific evidence of the complex and multifactorial causes of obesity are one reason weight stigma persists. This mind-set is difficult to change given American culture’s celebration of thinness negative media portrayals of people with larger bodies and a thriving diet industry. These factors reinforce the faulty premise that body weight is infinitely malleable as does a lack of legislation to protect people from weight discrimination.

Contrary to public perceptions weight stigma does not motivate people to lose weight. Instead it worsens health and reduces quality of life. The harmful impacts of weight stigma can be real and long-lasting. They range from emotional distress — depressive symptoms anxiety low self-esteem — to disordered eating unhealthy eating behaviors lower physical activity weight gain increased physiological stress and avoiding health care.

Weight stigma is not unique to America. It exists around the world. But few studies have directly compared people’s experiences of weight stigma in different countries.

In our recent study we compared experiences of weight stigma in six nations: Australia Canada France Germany the United Kingdom and the United States. These countries share similar societal values that reinforce personal blame for body weight and do little to challenge weight-based shaming and mistreatment. The participants were 13996 adults (about 2000 people per country) who were actively trying to manage their weight.

The biases people encountered because of their higher weight or larger body size turned out to be remarkably consistent across the six countries with more than half of study participants — 58 percent on average — experiencing weight stigma. The most common interpersonal sources of weight stigma were family members (76-87 percent) classmates (72-76 percent) and doctors (58-73 percent). These experiences were most frequent and distressing during childhood and adolescence.

Many incorporated these stigmatizing experiences into how they felt about themselves. In this process of “weight bias internalization” people apply negative societal stereotypes to themselves. They blame themselves for their weight and judge themselves as inferior and deserving of societal stigma.

We knew from our earlier research that weight bias internalization has harmful health implications and this was true here as well. Across the six countries the more that people internalized weight bias the more they gained weight in the prior year used food to cope with stress avoided going to the gym had an unhealthy body image and reported higher stress. These findings persisted regardless of people’s body size or their previous experiences of stigma.

Moreover in all six countries people with greater internalized weight bias reported worse health-related quality of life and health-care experiences. They avoided getting health care had less frequent checkups and reported more substandard health care compared to people who had less internalization.

The unique multinational perspective of our study reveals that weight stigma is commonly experienced often internalized and related to poor health and health care among people who are trying to manage their weight. In this sense confronting weight stigma appears to be a collective struggle but it is one that people are probably grappling with on their own.

While there is a long road ahead to eliminate weight stigma shifts in societal attitudes are taking place.

In recent years the harms of “fat shaming” have received increased public attention and so has the body positivity movement. Both are helping to elevate calls for efforts to stop unfair treatment based on weight.

There is also growing recognition in the medical community that action is needed.

In 2020 more than 100 medical and scientific organizations across nine countries signed a joint international consensus statement and pledge to bring attention to weight stigma and its harmful effect. These medical experts aim to shift the narrative of blame and help address weight stigma in media public attitudes and health care.

Our research shows broad and substantial public support for policies to tackle weight discrimination. In national studies we found that more than 70 percent of Americans support adding body weight as a protected category alongside categories such as race and age to existing state civil rights laws. They also support new legislation to make it illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on weight.

This would legitimize weight stigma as both a social injustice and a public health issue.

I believe broad and collective action is needed to address this problem both in and outside the United States. While this may sound challenging fundamentally it is actually quite simple: It is about respect dignity and equal treatment for people of all body weights and sizes."

But in the face of a historic drought it's important to understand what we can as we think about how we use water in our homes businesses farms ranches and public spaces.

READ: Water restrictions long-term solutions contemplated in Utah drought emergency

First thing to understand: if you live in any of the American Southwest's big metropolitan areas including Utah's Wasatch Front you rely on the Colorado River.

That's not obvious at first blush.

Wasatch Fronters look to the magnificent mountains rising above their homes and it's understandable to assume the water comes from there.

Some of it does.

But more of it comes from the Uinta Mountains — far from any big city.

Those of us old enough to have been in Utah when some reservoirs like Strawberry and Jordanelle were completed have a sense of what the Central Utah Project (CUP) is but even we might not think too much about its relation to the Colorado River.

So here are the basics: the Wasatch Mountains contribute crucial water to the Wasatch Front but the current population of nearly three million people from North Ogden to Spanish Fork could not be sustained on water from the Wasatch Mountains.

WATCH: Students work to save water during Utah drought

The Central Utah Project created the dams tunnels and aqueducts that run water from the Uintas to Salt Lake and Utah counties — UNDER the Wasatch Mountains.

Still it's not so obvious we're talking about Colorado River water because the Colorado enters Utah far south of any portion of the CUP.

Here's the thing: a river isn't one thing. It's a merger.

Like corporations when two rivers join they take the bigger river's name. A lot of Sprint cell phone customers are slowly learning they are now T-Mobile customers after a merger.

The Green River is Sprint to the Colorado River's T-Mobile.

The snowmelt from the Uintas joins with snowmelt from the Wind Rivers in Idaho and to make the Green the second biggest waterway in the Southwest. Then the Green meets the Colorado in Canyonlands National Park a handshake and a stock swap and the Colorado becomes its fully united corporate titan self.

Of course like T-Mobile the Colorado is still a scrappy stream compared to the Mississippi and Columbia Rivers (think AT&T and Verizon) of the world.

OK let's leave that tortured metaphor and mention that Utah's 2nd biggest concentration of population is in Washington County quenched by the water of the Virgin River. And that's a Colorado River tributary too!

So two for two so far Utahns rely on the Colorado.

But it won't be three for three because Cache Valley has a river that actually runs through it (sorry to the Jordan and Provo but we all know those are creeks in any non-arid place right?).

Cache Valley has the Bear River which carves its own path through its corner of the world from the north slopes of the Uintas saying hi to Wyoming and Idaho up north before turning south in a slow slog through northern Utah to the Great Salt Lake. It's the longest river in America that doesn't end up in an ocean and the Great Salt Lake relies on it for about two thirds of its water.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYXBhdmFsbGV5cmVnaXN0ZXIvbmFtZS9jaGFybGVzLWhvbG1lcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xMDM4NzM0OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Charles Holmes Obituary (2021) - Napa CA - Napa Valley Register,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/napavalleyregister/name/charles-holmes-obituary?id=10387349 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYXBhdmFsbGV5cmVnaXN0ZXIvbmFtZS9jaGFybGVzLWhvbG1lcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0xMDM4NzM0OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxmb3JkZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzA2LzEzL2JyaWVmcy1sb2NhbC1idXNpbmVzc3Blb3BsZS1pbmNsdWRpbmctdGhvbWFzLWhhcm1vbi1kci1kYXJyb2x5bi1tY2NhcnJvbGwtYW5kLWtldmluLXNjaG5laWRlci83NjA0NjA2MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Briefs on local businesspeople including Thomas Harmon Dr. Darrolyn McCarroll and Kevin Schneider.,"The Milford Daily News

Designers can look at the energy density and battery storage to monitor and prevent overvoltage or over-temperature phenomena. An increase in battery size can directly affect the weight cost and safety of the EV making a well-equipped battery management system (BMS) one of the best methods of shrinking the size of the battery.

A general overview of a standard BMS. Image used courtesy of Toradex

Over time Analog Devices (ADI) has showcased an extensive portfolio of BMS products through 5-generations of consistent updates. Keeping up with its trend ADI recently introduced two multicell battery monitors. These monitors are Automotive Safety Integrity Level-D (ASIL-D) certified with new low-power features to enable continuous battery monitoring even after the car has been turned off.

This article aims to explore ADI's monitors and how it looks compared to a few competitors like Texas Instruments and NXP.

ADI’s New Multicell Battery Monitor

Since 2008 ADI has designed and manufactured BMS solutions to meet the growing demand for effective EV technology and keeping safety in mind enough to achieve an ASIL-D rating. ADI's latest addition to its BMS portfolio claims to handle 6-18 cell modules with low-power consumption.

Utilizing ADI's 8 or 12 channel monitors in a BMS allows for continuous verification of each battery cell's charge even after the EV is turned off. It takes roughly 304 μs to measure all cells in a system.

ADI's ADBMS6815 multicell battery stack monitor is optimized for 12 series-connected battery cells with data accumulated under high noise mitigation. Meanwhile the second product announced the ADBMS6817 is identical in characteristics only differing in handling 8 series-connected battery cells.

Wiring diagram of ADI’s 12-Channel Multicell Battery Monitor which is designed for use in ISO 26262 applications for ASIL-D compliance. Image used courtesy of Analog Devices

ADI has improved battery cell monitor technology by having the daisy-chained cells be bidirectional. This ability can help diagnostics locate faults that could occur on the communication line that connects each cell. Each cell has a dedicated pulse-width modulation (PWM) duty cycle control that adds passive cell balancing to the equation.



With its past innovations ADI certainly has the attention of EV manufacturers in addition to its latest stackable battery monitors; however there may be some competition that holds advantages and disadvantages over them.

Texas Instruments’ BMS Features Wireless Communication

Texas Instruments (TI) is a distinguished manufacturer in the vast world of electronics known for creating affordable semiconductors for various applications. For decades TI has been designing hybrid and EV powertrain systems that include BMS technology. TI was also the first BMS manufacturer to receive an ASIL-D rating.

TI’s 16 in series cell monitoring IC is coupled with a battery balancer that is fully autonomous with auto-pause and resumes abilities for robust cell balancing. Screenshot used courtesy of Texas Instruments

As for some specifications TI's battery management integrated circuit (BMIC) offers 128 μs accurate cell voltage measurements across all 16 channels. The option for 12 14 and 16 series-connected cells offering more design flexibility than ADI's latest battery monitor.

Since the ability to extend EV's driving range comes from having a more prominent battery source TI holds a slight advantage compared to ADI by having 12-16 cell options.

Both BMS solutions offer daisy chain communication for optimal monitoring and share a similar balancing current. Also they can both filter for unwanted distortions and have a passive balancing architecture.

One increasing benefit is how TI states it has implemented a wireless data transfer that removes several connectors and cabling from the BMS.

With TI being at the forefront of that specific technology ADI has yet to announce a wireless BMS product that can compare to TI; however it does have a line of wireless power transfer products including receiver/chargers and transmitters.

Keeping that in mind it might be possible for EV manufacturers to see ADI developing a wireless BMS product in the foreseeable future.

Removing the wireless aspect to the BMS another comparison is with NXP's latest BMS.

NXP’S 14-Channel Battery Cell IC

NXP's 14-channel battery cell controller (BCC) IC can monitor between 7 to 14 in series cells through daisy-chained communication or capacitor isolation. What stands out about NXP is the scalability expectations; NXP's BCC could be on the cusp of becoming a game-changer for future battery design with potentially 800 cells per daisy chain.

Compared to ADI and TI's battery monitors NXP's BCC MC33771C has an isolated communication speed of 4 Mbps double the speed and offers a two-wire twisted pair versus a single use for Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication. This SPI is advantageous since a faster SPI can boost the short-distance comms for the BMS.

This battery monitor component can be easily integrated into energy storage systems (ESS) and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for EVs and industrial applications. In addition NXP's BCC is equipped with passive balancing and can operate in sleep mode just as ADI's solution.

Through looking at the different options for BMS it becomes prevalent to see how vital this system is and how so many top companies are approaching it in similar yet drastically different ways.

The Importance of BMS

An EV is only as good as its battery system. The aesthetically pleasing features within the cabin can draw customers in but what gets people to invest in the transition to renewable energy-based transportation is the driving range and price.

To drive longer on a single charge requires an extensive enough battery and storage system. No one wants a trunk-filled battery supply which is why designers and engineers are addressing the battery setup. The fundamentals of a robust and efficient EV powertrain is a well-equipped BMS.

ADI TI and NXP all share the concept of stackable battery cells with daisy-chained communication to save on space and bring design flexibility into the equation. Temperature control becomes essential when the heat begins to dissipate from the multicell configurations.

Each manufacturer offers a product that can easily monitor temperature and run diagnostics for potential faults from cell to cell. In addition NXP and TI have discussed ways of going wireless or cloud-based to free up more space for potentially more battery cells.

The global focus on EVs can bring more and more technology like BMS further into the future. As a result newer and more innovative systems are sure to be on the horizon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWxvZ2ZvcmV2ZXJtYWdhemluZS5jb20vb25saW5lLWV4aGliaXRpb25zL3JlbGF4LWp1bmUtMjAyMdIBU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWxvZ2ZvcmV2ZXJtYWdhemluZS5jb20vb25saW5lLWV4aGliaXRpb25zL3JlbGF4LWp1bmUtMjAyMT9mb3JtYXQ9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Online Group Exhibition - ""Relax” June 2021","Analog Forever Magazine is pleased to showcase 32 images in this month’s online exhibition entitled “Relax” and curated by photographic artist independent curator and juror and our Editor in Chief Michael Kirchoff! The selected photographs explore both thematically and literally the themes of relaxation. They will help you step back take a breath and notice how precious the quiet in-between moments of our life can be.

The curator Michael Kirchoff had this to say:

I was looking for a reminder of why I need to get away from the daily grind (though I love what I do) and take time for some much-needed rest and relaxation. This theme comes at a perfect time the start of Summer and will undoubtedly be my jumping-off point for when I set out for some time off. No longer will others think I suffer from narcolepsy! So I'm taking this tutorial of photographs and putting it to good use.

The devices and activities for recharging one's batteries are many and varied. Many of them appear here in this exhibition and rekindle my love for sleeping in the sun a hot bath floating in the water and hanging out with friends and loved ones. I know that I'm not alone in my desire to step back now and again and it was my intention with this exhibition to help out others as well. The days and nights of constant toil and work and worry need to be corrected at times. Burnout is very real - I know this first hand. Perhaps that's what prompted me to present this theme in the first place. I suggest everyone take a moment pause breathe and do what they need to do to put their mind and body at ease. Sometimes the solution to be overworked is as simple as a cup of tea – sometimes it's a walk through nature. Whatever the case you all need to be good to yourself as much as possible – I know you deserve it.

A recurring image that I constantly gravitate to is that of the ubiquitous hammock. I'm quite fond of them and felt that that might well be my ultimate relaxation device. So much so in fact that my favorite image from the submissions was “Hammock” by photographer Dennis Stein. This photograph puts me in my happy place to be sure. I want nothing more than to be there right now. My gratitude to everyone that submitted their photographs for this exhibition whether you are represented here or not as you've done a great service for me and others with your art. Now get out there in the warmth of the sun and remind yourself of how it feels so good to be alive. Cheers my friends!

Few bands have had a bigger impact on electronic music than Kraftwerk. Even almost 50 years later “Autobahn” “Trans Europa Express” and “Computerwelt” are considered musical milestones and continue to inspire musicians across the world. Which synthesizers and other gear did Kraftwerk use and which alternatives are there today? We’ve compiled a list.

Moog Minimoog

Analog synthesizers dominated the band’s early records. Did the Moog Minimoog become the most famous synth of all times because it was used by Kraftwerk? We can only guess but it probably didn’t hurt. The Minimoog was a fixed staple in the band’s arsenal throughout their career and is even pictured on the back of the album “Ralf und Florian” – the first one on which Kraftwerk used synths.

Because the Minimoog is such an icon there are now quite a few hardware and software emulations available. Moog used to make its own replica but discontinued it four years ago. A much cheaper option is the Behringer Model D or its polyphonic cousin Poly D.

Over the years Kraftwerk replaced the Minimoog with a variety of other hardware and software synths especially on stage. The band has used the Creamware Minimax ASB and the Studio Electronics SE-1 which came out in the early 1990s. The updated version SE-1X is being sold again and Studio Electronics has just announced the SE-3X which adds a 3-voice paraphonic mode and additional filters among other things. And of course there’s the Roland SE-02 which was developed in cooperation with Studio Electronics and also draws inspiration from the Minimoog.

In terms of Software there are also many great emulations available with the Moog Model D iOS app Arturia Mini V2 Softube Model 72 Native Instruments Monark and GForce Minimonsta being among the most popular.

ARP Odyssey

The second era-defining mono synth of the 1970s the ARP Odyssey was used by Kraftwerk on the album “Autobahn”. Like the Minimoog it helped to create a new generation of compact instruments which brought synthesizers within reach of a much wider spectrum of musicians. And just like for the Minimoog you now have several options if you want an Odyssey in your studio.

First and foremost there’s the official reissue developed by Korg which was and is available in a variety of sizes and colors. In addition to the slim-keyed version Korg produced a limited full-size edition which is now sold out. In addition the Korg ARP Odyssey is available as a desktop module and even as an iOS app. And needless to say Behringer has made its own version too.

EMS Synthi-A

Another analog synth of the 70s that has been used by Kraftwerk is the EMS Synthi-A. With its pin matrix the Synthi is an ultra-compact modular system in a convenient carrying case which allows you to patch up its components as you wish. As of today there’s no modern clone of the Synthi-A readily available but chances are that Behringer will have something along those lines soon.

Sequential Circuits Prophet-5

Moving on to polyphonic synths the legendary Prophet-5 was used by Kraftwerk during the “Computer World” tour in 1981. After a long list of other synths named Prophet which included the Prophet 08 Prophet 12 Prophet-6 Prophet REV2 and Prophet X its inventor Dave Smith was finally able to bring back the Prophet in its original form last year. The new Prophet-5 and Prophet-10 are both available as desktop and keyboard versions.

Electronic drums

When it came to drums Kraftwerk were incredibly inventive right from the start. The band used a variety of modified rhythm generators for home organs like the Farfisa Rhythm Unit 10. The band also constructed its own electronic drum set which was played with metal sticks which closed the electrical circuit. This was used to trigger the sounds of a Maestro Rhythm King – another analog accompaniment machine from the home organ era.

While you cannot buy these one-off instruments anywhere luckily there’s now a big selection of analog and digital drum machines again. For example the analog MFB 501 Pro has roots that go way back to the 1970s. But it too goes with the times: The latest version even lets you load samples.

There’s also a big selection of drum pads and electronic drums. Even Simmons is back! We know that Kraftwerk used the Simmons SDS-V drum pads at one point. But the new electronic drums sold by Simmons only share a name with those classics.

Sequencers

While the first Kraftwerk records were played by hand the band began to use sequencers on “Trans Europa Express” after some initial reluctance. Their famous Synthanorma Sequencer was custom-made by Synthesizerstudio Bonn Matten & Wiechers and pioneered quantized control voltages (Intervallomat). Later Kraftwerk used various sequencers by Doepfer including Regelwerk Schaltwerk and the MAQ 16/3.

After a period during which the days of hardware sequencers appeared to be numbered the selection is now larger than ever largely due to the unprecedented popularity of modular synths. For example the Doepfer Dark Time offers a workflow that’s very similar to what an early sequencer looked like.

Vocoders

What comes to your mind first when you hear the name “Kraftwerk”? There’s a good chance that you instantly hear the band’s characteristic robot voices in your head. Over the years Kraftwerk used a variety of vocoders including the EMS Vocoder Roland SVC-350 and Roland VP-330.

Just like analog synthesizers the vocoder has recently seen a new surge in popularity – partly due to the fact that Korg built one into the inexpensive Microkorg which in itself has become a modern classic. There are many interesting options now including the Arturia MicroFreak with the microphone accessory and the Behringer VC340 a clone of the aforementioned VP-330. And if you have the cash there’s also the spectacular reissue of the Moog Vocoder.

Or you could invest in a special vocal effects unit for mangling your voice. The Roland VT-4 Voice Transformer or the TC Helicon VoiceLive series are popular options. These units give you many other effects in addition to the vocoder. And if you can’t be bothered to record your own there’s always samples like the Robot Voices sample library.

Toys calculators odds and ends

Nobody was talking about circuit bending at the time but Kraftwerk were masters at it. For its entire career the band has been known for using all sorts of devices that weren’t designed to be musical instruments. One noteworthy example is the voice in “Computerwelt” which came from a Texas Instruments electronic translator. And “Musikant mit Taschenrechner in der Hand” isn’t just a rhyme as the Casio FX-501b calculator was actually used as an instrument.

Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang-Studio was also home to all sorts of musical “toys” like the “Bee Gees Rhythm Machine” by Mattel and the Dübreq Stylophone. The unique stylus synth went on to become a cultural icon and is now available again.

Kraftwerk’s long cooperation with Dieter Doepfer which resulted in the MAQ 16/3 among other things also gave life to MOGLI another spectacular creation. The unique controller glove which was based on the Nintendo Powerglove gesture controller from 1989 was years ahead of current products like the Neova MIDI ring or Genki Instruments Wave. Controlling MIDI devices with gestures? What some start-ups are still pitching as a revolutionary idea was already being done by Kraftwerk decades ago.

Since then hundreds of companies across the world have to varying degrees of success produced everything from 35mm to 127 to an assortment of medium format sizes and finally to digital.



Most of these endeavors are lost to history or never advanced beyond the prototype stage. Some of them were created for government and military use. Some were produced as limited or commemorative editions. I would estimate we have only a small fraction of photographic history available to us even with the internet.

Because of this it is virtually impossible to compile a truly accurate list of the “rarest cameras.” Realistically however such a list would just be a bunch of cameras that never made it to the market.

So what we have tried to do — just as we did in our 9 of the Rarest Lenses You Can Actually Buy article — is write about some of history’s lesser-known and very unique cameras. By all definitions all these cameras are extremely rare despite several of them being quite accessible to prospective buyers.

With that said we have selected nine of history’s rarest cameras:

Alpa Reflex I

The Alpa name is one of the most storied in the history of photography. It all started with Yakov Bogopolsky a Jewish Russian born in Kiev. In his youth he relocated to Switzerland and changed his name to Jacques Bolsky. Bolsky studied mechanical engineering with a particular interest in motion picture film. Eventually making his foray into designing cameras Bolsky created one of the most famous cinema cameras of all time — the 16mm Bolex H16.

In 1930 Bolsky sold his assets and patents to Paillard — who would continue producing Bolex cameras under the name Paillard-Bolex — and in 1935 he found himself under the employ of Pignons S.A. a Swiss watchmaking company. There he designed one of the first 35mm SLR cameras in history — a camera which would eventually become the Alpa-Reflex.

In 1939 Bolsky fled to the United States to escape the threat of neighboring Nazi Germany. Pignons however continued to persist with the Alpa-Reflex though development was difficult — not only were they not a camera company but Europe was at war. Finally however at the Swiss Trade Fair in 1944 Pignons unveiled the Alpa-Reflex I.

The Alpa Reflex Model I followed closely to the traditional and values of Swiss watchmaking — it was a precision device with the highest level of craftsmanship. Like the Ihagee Exakta cameras of the 1930s the Alpa sported a waist-level viewfinder. But unlike any other camera it also featured a rangefinder positioned on the left-hand side of the body like all other rangefinders. This makes it one of the only SLR cameras with a rangefinder ever made.

Most of the Alpa Reflex Model I bodies were sold with collapsible Angenuinex lenses — either a 50mm f/1.8 or a 50mm f/2.9. Eventually Alpa cameras would be paired with the phenomenal (and highly collectible) Kern-Switar lenses.

Later models in the Alpa line would implement a 45 degree angled pentaprism viewfinder — along with the Rectaflex and Zeiss Ikon Contax S these cameras finally allowed photographers to view a corrected image as the eye sees it. Prior to that SLR designs would display a reversed image.

Only 571 Alpa Reflex Model I cameras were ever produced. The camera like most of the Alpa line is one of the most desired and collectible cameras in history.

Kodak DCS 100

It’s rather well known that Kodak’s late history was fraught with issues stemming from the digital revolution with many ascribing Kodak’s lack of initiative in the digital arena to their downfall. While this was certainly true in the 2000s Kodak was actually one of the pioneers in consumer digital camera technology. In 1991 they released the first commercially available DSLR — the Kodak DCS 100.

The DCS 100 was a Nikon F3 body fitted with a 1.3-megapixel Kodak DC3 digital back. While that was the extent of the actual imaging system the power and storage were a wholly different story. Given the state of digital storage technology in 1991 the DCS 100 had to store its images on an external unit. Kodak integrated the camera’s battery and a 3.5” SCSI hard drive into a tethered Digital Storage Unit (DSU). It had a 200MB capacity which was capable of storing 156 uncompressed images or 600 JPEG files. The DSU was so large and heavy it was designed to be worn around the photographer’s shoulders.

Available with either a standard color DC3 back or a monochrome back the DCS 100 system retailed for $20000 — equivalent to over $39000 in 2021.

While the Kodak DCS system continued to evolve — ending with the 14MP Kodak DCS PRO SLR/n and SLR/c cameras in 2004 — only 987 units of the DCS 100 were ever produced.

Leica S1

If you’ve heard of the Leica S medium format cameras have you ever wondered why there was a Leica S2 followed by the very recently released Leica S3 but they did not seem to have a Leica S1? The answer is: they did. But most people have never heard about it both because it is extremely rare but also because it was released in 1996 — basically at the genesis of the digital uprising. The Leica S2 was not released until twelve years later at which point digital photography was not only mature but the industry standard.

There have been a lot of strange cameras with bizarre approaches to how they function and many with a design that is best described as no-holds-barred unique. The Leica S1 may take the crown for such a description. In fact I don’t even know how to describe the appearance of this camera — even the single photo above does not do it justice because you need to see it from every angle to really appreciate it. I highly recommend a Google image search especially because in my opinion the design is both functional and strange enough to be charming.

Leica has always (and to this day) taken flack for being behind in the digital imaging arena. That is not a claim without justification but people who make that assertion ought to read up about the Leica S1.

Unveiled at Photokina in 1996 and available to the public near the end of 1997 the Leica S1 made headlines for two primary reasons: its 26.4-megapixel resolution and its medium format sensor. To put that in perspective it was not until the 31.6-megapixel Phase One P30 back was released in 2004 that the S1’s resolution was surpassed. There were medium format backs with higher resolution prior to the S1 but they were only for 4×5 large format bodies. Even after the Phase One P30 was released the Leica S1 still had the distinction of being the highest resolution fully integrated camera ever made — until the Leica S2 was released.

The S1’s medium format sensor was an odd 36×36 size — meaning it was 50% larger than full-frame spatially but with only a 17.7% longer diagonal. Both would produce the same horizontal field of view. Since it was a scanning camera it took over three minutes to read out the entire sensor. Suffice to say you weren’t using this to shoot the Superbowl.

Its image quality was absolutely stunning for its time. It housed a triple-linear CCD sensor with a base ISO of 50 and was highly regarded for its excellent color reproduction. Since it used a scanning sensor — and thus required no interpolation — it could capture full RGB color information at every photosite. The resulting 48-bit files clocked in at an enormous 150MB. Not only is that a hefty file in 2021 but it is also worth noting that the average home computer in 1996 only had a hard drive capacity of around 1000MB (1GB).

With its low 50 base ISO true RGB 48-bit files massive 26.4MP resolution large sensor and about 11 stops of dynamic range it was capable of results completely unheard of in 1996.

To top off the list of unique specifications the camera had a user interchangeable lens mount. Options included Leica R and M Canon FD Contax C/Y Minolta MD Nikon F Olympus OM and Pentax K — basically every mainstream 35mm lens mount ever made. Because the sensor’s horizontal measurement was identical to 35mm film the image circle of full-frame lenses could cover its 36x36mm sensor without any caveats or disadvantages.

Only 1500 were ever produced but according to most accounts a mere 150 of those were sold.

Leica Digital Modul R (DMR)

While Leica cemented its name in the history books with its rangefinder cameras they did produce two SLR systems: the 35mm Leica R line which started with the Leicaflex in 1964 and the Leica S2 and S3 medium format digital cameras. The R line of cameras moved from the Leicaflex family to the Leica R3 and ended with the Leica R9 in 2002.

In 2003 Leica announced the Digital Modul R (DMR) a module containing a 10-megapixel Kodak CCD sensor developed in concert with Imacon. The module clipped onto the back of either the Leica R8 or R9 — which were designed from the beginning to function with future digital solutions — and a power unit was attached to the base of the camera.

Because the Kodak-designed sensor had to be positioned precisely at the film gate it had to have a smaller area than the 36x24mm dimensions of film (or full-frame sensors). Thus it had a 1.37x crop factor — slightly more than APS-H — with a sensitivity ranging from ISO 100 to ISO 800. An anti-aliasing filter was omitted from the sensor to increase resolving power.

The resulting digital camera was surprisingly smooth in its function and ergonomics. A small LCD on the rear was used for menu playback and all the typical settings we’re used to today. A smaller screen below the main LCD would display basic information — ISO setting exposure compensation battery level white balance etc. Exposure mode shutter speeds and exposure compensation were all set via the regular controls on the top of the body — just as they were when using the camera with film.

Naturally the camera utilized Leica R lenses — compatibility was limited to 3-Cam ROM or earlier lenses that have been modified with the proper cams (or converted to ROM).

One fascinating feature that as far as I know is exclusive to this camera is its “audio histogram.” While there is a standard histogram on the rear screen the camera could be set to emit an acoustic sound to alert the photographer of over or underexposure. This would allow the photographer to adjust accordingly without taking their eye away from the viewfinder.

The DMR was discontinued in 2007 after selling only 2200 units. Leica planned to produce an all-digital Leica R10 but such plans never came to fruition. The Leica R8 and R9 with DMR remain the only hybrid film/digital 35mm cameras ever to be made.

Minox 35 GT-X

History gave us a plethora of 35mm compacts ranging from bargain-basement consumer models to elegantly designed bodies fitted with preeminent optics. The Minox 35 line — despite its affordability and relative lack of popularity — is one of the true jewels of compact film photography.

Best known at the time — and to this day — as the smallest 35mm camera ever made the Minox 35 bodies were barely thicker than a film canister and a mere four inches in length. This of course varied from model to model in minor ways but its diminutive size and trademark hinged door remained consistent until the end.

First introduced in 1974 with the Minox 35 EL there would be twenty more models over the years culminating with the Minox 35 GT-S in 1998 which marked the end of the Minox 35 line. The early models were fitted with a 35mm f/2.8 Color-Minotar lens with a Tessar design and four-bladed aperture — the final models moved to a newly designed MC Minoxar lens. The cameras were zone focus-only and a majority were limited strictly to aperture-priority exposure.

The Minox 35 GT-X is one of the last models produced. It featured the 35/2.8 MC Minoxar lens aperture-priority DX coding from ASA 25-3200 and is one of only several models with a “snapshot” setting on the lens — a green mark that quick-sets the camera into a hyperfocal f/8 mode.

Only 371 GT-X cameras were sold making it the rarest of the entire Minox 35 line. Unlike every other rare camera here you can easily find one of these on eBay for around $300-400. Perhaps not the GT-X model but I highly recommend seeking out a Minox 35 camera — if not for their diminutive presence then for the contrasty beautiful rendering of the lenses. The Minox 35 GT or GL are readily available for under $100.

Nikon F2/T (F2 Titan)

The Nikon F2 followed on the heels of the widely popular and highly influential Nikon F which was first released in 1959. The F2 improved on the F in several very valuable ways: a faster 1/2000th shutter speed a hinged swing-open back an optional motor drive a wide array of detachable finders (including metered heads) and general ergonomic improvements. The standard finder was the Nikon DE-1 which today is worth a pretty penny compared to other finders like the metered DP-1 finder.

In 1976 five years after the introduction of the F2 Nikon released one of the most dependable rugged and now collectible cameras in their history: the Nikon F2/T. Constructed with a titanium shutter titanium-covered top and bottom plates titanium-covered door and prism the camera was built to withstand a level of abuse that no camera deserves. Even the lens mount was made of solid titanium.

Unlike the standard F2 or any other Nikons the F2/T featured a tough-as-nails mottled-black paint with an attractive stylish texture. There were a few models produced in a chrome finish but I have never come across one in the wild nor on eBay.

There are three versions of the F2/T — the “regular” version with F2/T engraved on the top plate but without any other lettering an identical version with “Titan” engraved on the front and a modified high-speed version with a pellicle mirror and high-speed battery pack. The latter was capable of 10 frames per second.

The version with the “Titan” script on the front is generally more desirable than the one without the Titan nameplate but both are equally rare. The high-speed model is not nearly as collectible or desirable as either of the others.

The exact total production of all versions is unknown but estimated to be 2000 at most — those with the “Titan” nameplate numbering somewhere in the three digits. Easily one of my top three most desired cameras you can pick one up fairly affordably — at least compared to most of the other cameras on this list.

Plaubel Makina W67

The Plaubel Makina 67 is one of the most valued and desirable medium format bodies ever made. Unlike the more well-known Hasselblads and Mamiyas and Bronicas of the era the Makina 67 was a rangefinder design fitted with a Nikkor 80mm f/2.8 lens integrated light meter and a bellows extension which kept the camera’s size to a minimum when not in use. The rangefinder approach allowed the camera to remain extremely small and lightweight despite its large 6×7 capture area.

Introduced in 1978 at Photokina the Makina 67 was manufactured by Konica/Copal in Japan though the bellows were made in Germany. This created issues with the production because any pinholes in the bellows would result in light leakage and any misalignment of tolerances would result in the bellows being unusable.

In stepped Mamiya who suggested that the parts should not be produced separately — the production of the Makina 67 was then moved to Mamiya in 1981 after which the construction and assembly were significantly more streamlined and effective.

That same year the Plaubel Makina W67 debuted. It was essentially an identical design as the Makina 67 but with a Nikkor 55mm f/4.5 lens (equivalent to about 28mm in the 35mm format).

The Makina W67 became notable particularly for that lens — it was and still is considered one of the sharpest and best lenses ever produced for a medium format camera.

While there were over 15000 Makina 67 bodies produced only 3500 units of the W67 ever saw the light of day. Today both cameras remain among the most expensive and desirable mass-production medium format cameras ever made — especially the Makina W67.

Rolleiflex 2.8GX Royal Urushi Gold

The Rolleiflex medium format 6×6 TLR (Twin Lens Reflex) cameras are easily the most revered and desirable TLR cameras ever made. Developed to be Rollei’s premier line of medium format cameras the Rolleiflex line was launched in 1929 with the aptly named Original Rolleiflex. The next model the Standard Rolleiflex moved from the very unpopular 117 film used in the Original to 120 film which of course is still produced today.

There were dozens of models released over nearly nine decades ending with the Rolleiflex 2.8 FX-N in 2015. In 1981 Rollei became Rollei Fototechnic GmbH after going bankrupt. From then onward they produced fewer cameras and one of those was the 2.8GX Royal Urushi Gold in 1989. This is not a special edition camera — though it absolutely looks like one — but rather a successor to the Rolleiflex 2.8F with a new Seiko shutter and redesigned light meter.

The most notable thing about the camera is its absolutely gorgeous appearance. Brown African Lizard Skin leather hand-coated with Urushi lacquer adorned its exterior while most of the metal is coated with 24 karat gold.

Only 130 units were ever made making it the rarest non-special edition Rolleiflex camera ever produced.

Rollei SL 2000F/3001/3003

Throughout history Rollei experienced wild successes — their Rolleiflex and Rolleicord medium format cameras and the Rollei 35 compact cameras. They also experienced significant failures like their Rolleiflex 35 series of 35mm SLRs which were fraught with reliability issues.

In 1981 Rollei Fototechnic GmbH & Co. KG released the Rolleiflex SL2000F onto the market igniting a line of incredibly unique and fascinating cameras. If you knew nothing about the cameras a simple glance would make you confident that you were looking at a medium format camera. All aspects of the design are standard features of many medium format systems: a waist-level viewfinder a detachable film back with removable insert a dark slide a removable battery pack an optional pistol grip and a cube-like form factor. Frankly the only way you would realize it wasn’t a medium format camera is when you would try to load it up with 120 film and fail.

Among its many innovative and unique features perhaps the most unique is its integration of both a waist-level finder and eye-level finder into the body — the 3001 model is an exception here as it was a stripped-down version of the 3003 and did not have the waist level finder. Ironically it is the rarest of the three models.

Rollei’s lengthy history and collaboration with Zeiss came in quite handy with the cameras — the glass is considered some of the finest ever produced by Zeiss ranging from a 15/3.5 Distagon to a 1000mm f/8 Tele-Tessar. Rollei also produced their own less expensive line of Rolleinars from a 14mm f/3.5 to a 500mm f/8 Mirror. Rollei even produced an M42 adapter for Pentax screw mount lenses with full auto-diaphragm capability which allowed users to adapt the significantly cheaper and highly popular Pentax Takumars.

Unfortunately the cameras never caught on. There were several reasons for this — size and weight price and the emergence and popularity of autofocus in the 1980s which these lacked. The SL2000F sold 4800 units with the 3003 and 3001 selling only 2800 and 1600 units respectively. Today these cameras are considered valuable collector’s items and are uncommon to see — especially since most people have no idea they exist.

Digital output simply means that the audio devices connected to your computer don’t use analog cables.

When using digital output your audio devices require the correct feature to be enabled on your computer. So if your computer doesn’t have audio don’t start with the assumption that there’s something wrong with your hardware. Although that might be the case sometimes most of these problems disappear in just a couple of clicks.

This article will help you understand and use these features so that you can address audio problems when using Realtek digital output.

Possible Solutions for Fixing Your Audio Problems

Changing the Default Audio Device

In some cases enabling the Realtek Digital Output feature isn’t necessary at all. If you have regular speakers plugged into your computer you can simply switch to the speakers to fix your audio problems.

To do solve this change your default audio device in just a couple of steps. Here’s what you need to do:

Click on Start type “Control Panel“ and click on it. Now click on Hardware and Sound – this option might be harder to find in the default Control Panel menu. If your menu is set to Small Icons simply click on the option next to View By in the upper right corner and select Category. This will make your search much easier. Now click on Sound. After you have clicked on the Sound option a small sound configuration popup window will appear. Now navigate to the Playback tab in this window. From there you will be able to see all of the devices that are connected to your computer and that you can configure for yourself. Simply right-click on Speakers and then select Set as Default Option. If you can’t see this option that means that your Speakers are already set as the default. In that case just select Enable from the same menu.

When you want to change back to high definition digital audio simply enable the Realtek Digital Output option in the same way.

Shortcut Tip

If you want to avoid going into Control Panel and searching for the correct features and options there is a shortcut that can help you.

All that you need to do is right-click on the speaker icon which is found on your taskbar (usually the bottom-right side of the screen) and then select Sounds. This will open the same sound configuration popup window as before.

From there everything is the same.

Updating Your Computer’s Audio Drivers

If something as essential as audio doesn’t work on your computer there’s a chance that something is wrong with your drivers.

Drivers are programs made specifically for your operating system and computer hardware components. Each laptop or computer model has its own type of drivers installed.

What usually happens is that people delete some of their drivers by mistake or their drivers need updating. When that occurs your computer most definitely won’t work the way it should.

So if you are still having problems with your computer’s audio even after changing the default audio device you should install or update the correct sound drivers. This isn’t as complicated as it sounds.

Here is how you can do that:

Press Windows + R simultaneously to open the Run program type “devmgmt.msc” in the displayed dialogue box and hit Enter. Every device that is connected to your computer will be shown on your screen. Now you need to choose the correct category so choose Audio Inputs and Outputs or Sound video and game controllers (based on your operating system’s version).



The further steps depend on whether or not you have audio drivers at all.

Updating Drivers

You can update your drivers manually by right-clicking on them one by one and selecting Update. If you want to fix your Realtek digital output issues start by updating the Realtek driver.

Uninstalling and Reinstalling Drivers

You can also delete all your drivers by right-clicking on every item below the Audio Inputs and Outputs or Sound video and game controllers and selecting Uninstall. Once you’ve uninstalled everything under this option right-click on the parent tab (Audio Inputs and Outputs / Sound video and game controllers) and select Scan for Hardware Changes. Your computer will then search for Windows updates and install the correct drivers including the Realtek driver. This might take a while so be patient. Once your device has finished installing your new drivers you should restart your computer.

Everything should be ready to go when your system has rebooted.

Know Your Way Around

The iPad lineup especially the larger iPad Pro has kept up an impressively frantic pace of hardware innovation over the past few years. In that same time frame the software of the iPad especially its ability to allow users to use multiple apps at once and in its onramps for professional software makers has come under scrutiny for an apparently slower pace.

This year’s announcements about iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 seemed designed to counter that narrative with the introduction of a broad number of quality of life improvements to multitasking as well as a suite of system-wide features that nearly all come complete with their own developer-facing APIs to build on. I had the chance to speak to Bob Borchers Apple’s VP of Worldwide Product Marketing and Sebastien (Seb) Marineau-Mes VP Intelligent System Experience at Apple about the release of iPadOS 15 to discuss a variety of these improvements.

Marineau-Mes works on the team of Apple software SVP Craig Federighi and was pivotal in the development of this new version.

iPad has a bunch of new core features including SharePlay Live Text Focuses Universal Control on-device Siri processing and a new edition of Swift Playgrounds designed to be a prototyping tool. Among the most hotly anticipated for iPad Pro users however are improvements to Apple’s multitasking system.

If you’ve been following along you’ll know that the gesture-focused multitasking interface of iPadOS has had its share of critics including me. Though it can be useful in the right circumstances the un-discoverable gesture system and confusing hierarchy of the different kinds of combinations of apps made it a sort of floppy affair to utilize correctly for an apt user much less a beginner.

Since the iPad stands alone as pretty much the only successful tablet device on the market Apple has a unique position in the industry to determine what kinds of paradigms are established as standard. It’s a very unique opportunity to say hey this is what working on a device like this feels like; looks like; should be.

So I ask Borchers and Marineau-Mes to talk a little bit about multitasking. Specifically Apple’s philosophy in the design of multitasking on iPadOS 15 and the update from the old version which required a lot of acrobatics of the finger and a strong sense of spatial awareness of objects hovering out off the edges of the screen.

“I think you’ve got it” Borchers says when I mention the spatial gymnastics “but the way that we think about this is that the step forward and multitasking makes it easier discover easier to use even more powerful. And while pros I think were the ones who were using multitasking in the past we really want to take it more broadly because we think there’s applicability to many many folks. And that’s why the the discovery and the ease of use I think were critical.”

“You had a great point there when you talked about the spatial model and one of our goals was to actually make the spatial model more explicit in the experience” says Marineau-Mes “where for example if you’ve got a split view and you’re replacing one of the windows we kind of open the curtain and tuck the other app to the side you can see it — it’s not a hidden hidden mental model it’s one that’s very explicit.

Another great example of it is when you go into the app switcher to reconfigure your windows you’re actually doing drag and drop as you rearrange your new split views or you dismiss apps and so on. So it’s not a hidden model it’s one where we really try to reinforce a spatial model with an explicit one for the user through all of the animations and all of the kinds of affordances.”

Apple’s goal this time around he says was to add affordances for the user to understand that multitasking was even an option — like the small series of dots at the top of every app and window that now allows you to explicitly choose an available configuration rather than the app-and-dock-juggling method of the past. He goes on to say that consistency was a key metric for them on this version of the OS. The appearance of Slide Over apps in the same switcher view as all other apps for instance. Or the way that you can choose configurations of apps via the button by drag and drop in the switcher and get the same results.

In the dashboard Marineau-Mes says “you get an at a glance view of all of the apps that you’re running and a full model of how you’re navigating that through the iPad’s interface.”

This ‘at a glance’ map of the system should be very welcome by advanced users. Even as a very aggressive Pro user myself Slide Over apps became more of a nuisance than anything because I couldn’t keep track of how many were open and when to use them. The ability to combine them on the switcher itself is one of those things that Apple has wanted to get into the OS for years but is just now making its way onto iPads. Persistence of organization really was the critical problem to tackle.

“I think we believe strongly in building a mental model where people know where things are [on iPad]” says Marineau-Mes. “And I think you’re right when it comes persistence I think it also applies to for example home screen. People have a very strong mental model of where things are in the home screen as well as all of the apps that they’ve configured. And so we try to maintain a well maintained that mental model and also allow people to reorganize again in the switcher.”

He goes on to explain the new ‘shelf’ feature that displays every instance or window that an app has open within itself. They implemented this as a per-app feature rather than a system-wide feature he says because the association of that shelf with a particular app fit the overall mental model that they’re trying to build. The value of this shelf may jump into higher relief when more professional apps that may have a dozen documents or windows open at once and active during a project ship later this year.

Another nod to advanced users in iPadOS 15 is the rich keyboard shortcut set offered across the system. The interface can be navigated by arrow keys now many advanced commands are there and you can even move around on an iPad using a game controller.

“One of the key goals this year was to make basically everything in the system navigable from the keyboard” says Marineau-Mes “so that if you don’t want to you don’t have to take your hands off the keyboard. All of the new multitasking affordances and features you can do through the keyboard shortcuts. You’ve got the new keyboard shortcut menu bar where you can see all the shortcuts that are available. It’s great for discoverability. You can search them and we even you know and this is a subtle point but we even made a very conscious effort to rationalize the shortcuts across Mac and iPadOS. So that if you’re using universal control for example you’re going to go from one environment to the other seamlessly. You want to ensure that consistency as you go across.”

The gestures however are staying as a nod to consistency for existing users that may be used to those.

To me one of the more interesting and potentially powerful developments is the introduction of the Center Window and its accompanying API. A handful of Apple apps like Mail Notes and Messages now allow items to pop out into an overlapping window.

“It was a very deliberate decision on our part” says Marineau-Mes about adding this new element. “This really brings a new level of productivity where you can have you know this floating window. You can have content behind it. You can seamlessly cut and paste. And that’s something that’s just not possible with the traditional [iPadOS] model. And we also really strive to make it consistent with the rest of multitasking where that center window can also become one of the windows in your split view or full size and then go back to to being a center window. We think it’s a cool addition to the model and we look really look forward to 3rd parties embracing it.”

Early reception of the loop Apple gave at iPadOS 15 has an element of reservation about it still given that many of the most powerful creative apps are made by third parties that must adopt these technologies in order for them to be truly useful. But Apple Borchers says is working hard to make sure that pro apps adopt as many of these new paradigms and technologies as possible so that come fall the iPad will feel like a more hospitable host for the kinds of advanced work pros want to do there.

One of the nods to this multi-modal universe that the iPad exists in is Universal Control. This new feature uses Bluetooth beaconing peer-to-peer WiFi and the iPad’s touchpad support to allow you to place your devices close to one another and — in a clever use of reading user intent — slide your mouse to the edge of a screen and onto your Mac or iPad seamlessly.

“I think what we have seen and observed from our users both pro and and otherwise is that we have lots of people who have Macs and they have iPads and they have other iPhones and and we believe in making these things work together in ways that are that are powerful” says Borchers. “And it just felt like a natural place to be able to go and extend our Continuity model so that you could make use of this incredible platform that is iPadOS while working with your Mac right next to it. And I think the big challenge was how do you do that in kind of a magical simple way. And that’s what Seb and his team and been able to accomplish.

“It really builds on the foundation we made with Continuity and Sidecar” adds Marineau-Mes. “We really thought a lot about how do you make the experience — the set up experience — as seamless as possible. How do you discover that you’ve got devices side by side.?

The other thing we thought about was what are the workflows that people want to have and what capabilities that will be essential for that. That’s where thinks like the ability to seamlessly drag content across the platforms or cut and paste was we felt to be really really important. Because I think that’s really what brings to the magic to the experience.”

Borchers adds that it makes all the continuity features that much more discoverable. Continuity’s shared clipboard for instance is an always on but invisible presence. Expanding that to visual and mouse-driven models made some natural sense.

“It’s just like oh of course I can drag that all the way across all the way across here” he says.

“Bob you say of course” Marineau-Mes laughs. “And yet for those of us working in platforms for a long time the ‘of course’ is technically very very challenging. Totally non obvious.”

Another area where iPadOS 15 is showing some promising expansionary behavior is in system-wide activities that allow you to break out of the box of in-app thinking. These include embedded recommendations that seed themselves into various apps Shareplay which makes an appearance wherever video calls are found and Live Text which turns all of your photos into indexed archives searchable with a keyboard.

Another is Quick Note a system extension that lets you swipe from the bottom corner of your screen wherever you are in the system.

“There are I think a few interesting things that we did with with Quick Note” says Marineau-Mes. “One is this idea of linking. So that if I’m working in Safari or Yelp or another app I can quickly insert a link to whatever content I’m viewing. I don’t know about you but it’s something that I certainly do a lot when I do research.

“The old way was like cut and paste and maybe take a screenshot create a note and jot down some notes. And now we’ve made that very very seamless and fluid across the whole system. It even works the other way where if I’m now in Safari and I have a note that refers to that page in Safari you’ll see it revealed as a thumbnail at the bottom of the screen’s right hand side. So we’ve really tried to bring the notes experience to be something that just permeates the system and is easily accessible from from everywhere.”

Many of the system-wide capabilities that Apple is introducing in iPadOS 15 and iOS 15 have an API that developers can tap into. That is not always the case with Apple’s newest toys which in years past have often been left to linger in the private section of its list of frameworks rather than be offered to developers as a way to enhance their apps. Borchers says that this is an intentional move that offers a ‘broader foundation of intelligence’ across the entire system.

This broader intelligence includes Siri moving a ton of commands to its local scope. This involved having to move a big chunk of Apple’s speech recognition to an on-device configuration in the new OS as well. The results says Borchers are a vastly improved day-to-day Siri experience with many common commands executing immediately upon request — something that was a bit of a dice roll in days of Siri past. The removal of the reputational hit that Siri was taking from commands that went up to the cloud never to return could be the beginning of a turnaround for the public perception of Siri’s usefulness.

The on-device weaving of the intelligence provided by the Apple Neural Engine (ANE) also includes the indexing of text across photos in the entire system past present and in-the-moment.

“We could have done live text only in camera and photos but we wanted it to apply to anywhere we’ve got images whether it be in in Safari or quick look or wherever” says Marineau-Mes. “One of my favorite demos of live text is actually when you’ve got that long complicated field for a password for a Wi-Fi network. You can just actually bring it up within the keyboard and take a picture of it get the text in it and copy and paste it into into the field. It’s one of those things that’s just kind of magical.”

On the developer service front of iPadOS 15 I ask specifically about Swift Playgrounds which add the ability to write compile and ship apps on the App Store for the first time completely on iPad. It’s not the native Xcode some developers were hoping for but Borchers says Playgrounds has moved beyond just ‘teaching people how to code’ and into a real part of many developer pipelines.

“ think one of the big insights here was that we also saw a number of kind of pro developers using it as a prototyping platform and a way to be able to be on the bus or in the park or wherever if you wanted to get in and give something a try this was super accessible and easy way to get there and could be a nice adjunct to hey I want to learn to code.”

“If you’re a developer” adds Marineau-Mes “it’s actually more productive to be able to run that app on the device that you’re working on because you really get great fidelity. And with the open project format you can go back and forth between Xcode and Playgrounds. So as Bob said we can really envision people using this for a lot of rapid prototyping on the go without having to bring along the rest of their development environment so we think it’s a really really powerful addition to our development development tools this year.”

Way back in 2018 I profiled a new team at Apple that was building out a testing apparatus that would help them to make sure they were addressing real-world use cases for flows of process that included machines like the (at the time un-revealed) new Mac Pro iMacs MacBooks and iPads. One of the demos that stood out at the time was a deep integration with music apps like Logic that would allow the input models of iPad to complement the core app. Tapping out a rhythm on a pad brightening or adjusting sound more intuitively with the touch interface. More of Apple’s work these days seems to be aimed at allowing users to move seamlessly back and forth between its various computing platforms taking advantage of the strengths of each (raw power portability touch etc) to complement a workflow. A lot of iPadOS 15 appears to be geared this way.

Whether it will be enough to turn the corner on the perception of iPad as a work device that is being held back by software I’ll reserve judgement until it ships later this year. But in the near term I am cautiously optimistic that this set of enhancements that break out of the ‘app box’ the clearer affordances for multitasking both in and out of single apps and the dedication to API support are pointing towards an expansionist mentality on the iPad software team. A good sign in general.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL2F1dG8uaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2F1dG8vbmV3cy9hcHBsZS10YWtlcy1vbmJvYXJkLWZvcm1lci1ibXctZXhlY3V0aXZlLWZvci1pdHMtZWxlY3RyaWMtY2FyLXByb2plY3QtNDE2MjM0MTI3MzU5MzMuaHRtbNIBhwFodHRwczovL2F1dG8uaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2F1dG8vbmV3cy9hcHBsZS10YWtlcy1vbmJvYXJkLWZvcm1lci1ibXctZXhlY3V0aXZlLWZvci1pdHMtZWxlY3RyaWMtY2FyLXByb2plY3QvYW1wLTQxNjIzNDEyNzM1OTMzLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple takes onboard former BMW executive for its electric car project,"Apple Inc. has hired Ulrich Kranz a former senior executive at BMW AG’s electric car division to help lead its own vehicle efforts according to people familiar with the situation.

In 2014 Apple began developing a vehicle but shelved the idea in 2016 to focus on an autonomous platform that it could sell to other companies or use

The technology giant hired Kranz in recent weeks about a month after he stepped down as chief executive officer of Canoo Inc. a developer of self-driving electric vehicles. Before co-founding Canoo Kranz was senior vice president of the group that developed the i3 and i8 cars at BMW where he worked for 30 years.

Kranz is one of Apple’s most significant automotive hires a clear sign that the iPhone maker is determined to build a self-driving electric car to rival Tesla Inc. and other carmakers. Kranz will report to Doug Field who led development of Tesla’s mass-market Model 3 and now runs Apple’s car project said the people who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter.

Apple has become the world’s most valuable company with a market capitalization of more than $2 trillion by selling iPhones iPads Apple Watches Macs and services. With investors and customers clamoring for new products the company has targeted cars and augmented-reality headsets. An Apple spokesperson confirmed Kranz’s hiring.

Apple began developing a vehicle in 2014 but shelved the effort around 2016 to focus on an autonomous platform it could sell to other companies or eventually use itself. Along the way Apple poached several Tesla executives who now help head up drive-train engineering self-driving software and interiors and exteriors.

Last year Apple gave oversight of the operation to John Giannandrea senior vice president of machine learning and artificial intelligence and Field’s boss. Several months ago Apple rebooted its efforts to develop a full-fledged electric car but development remains in the early stages so a launch is likely at least five years away.

Before hiring Kranz Apple lost some key auto executives. Benjamin Lyon Jaime Waydo and Dave Scott who worked on engineering safety systems and robotics respectively all departed in recent months. It’s unclear why the three left.

Following successful stints at BMW’s Mini division and teams working on sports cars and SUVs Kranz was asked to run Project I a battery-powered vehicle skunkworks started in 2008. It yielded the all-electric i3 compact and the plug-in hybrid i8 sports car. The former was panned by design critics and production was very limited on the latter.

Kranz left BMW in 2016 and soon became chief technology officer at Faraday Future an electric vehicle startup based in Los Angeles. He stayed only three months before co-founding Canoo. Both firms have struggled with their technology and ability to produce vehicles while Canoo reportedly discussed selling itself to Apple and other companies.

Canoo went public in December after a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company or SPAC called Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. Canoo last month said it was being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission becoming the third clean-energy auto startup to disclose a federal probe in the past year. Canoo plans to debut a minivan for less than $35000 next year.

Apple has worked with BMW for many years integrating the iPod with auto infotainment systems back in 2004 and more recently making the iPhone double as a car key. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook was spotted checking out a BMW i8 outside Apple’s Cupertino California headquarters in 2014 and company executives have been known to visit BMW offices in recent years.

But your resulting energy bill? Not so much. What if your home could stay cool all on its own—no electricity required?

That’s the premise of Yi Zheng’s new invention. The associate professor of mechanical and industrial engineering at Northeastern University in Boston has created a sustainable material that can be used to make buildings or other objects able to keep cool without relying on conventional cooling systems.

Zheng envisions this material dubbed “cooling paper” covering the roofs of houses warehouses and office buildings.

Not only does the light-colored material reflect hot solar rays away from the building it also sucks heat out of the interior too—heat that is emitted from electronics cooking and human bodies.

Cooling paper is in fact made of paper and the porous microstructure of the natural fibers inside absorbs the indoor warmth and re-emits it away from the building.

Zheng who studies nanomaterials got the idea when he looked at a bucket full of used printing paper. He recalls thinking to himself ‘How could we simply transform that waste material into some functional energy material composite materials?’

So with the help of a high-speed blender from his home kitchen Zheng made a pulp out of paper waste mixed with the material that makes up Teflon. Then he formed it into water-repelling “cooling paper” that could coat homes. Then he and his team tested its capacity to keep cool under various temperature and humidity conditions.

LOOK: Not Only Does New Solar Chimney Design Cut Energy Costs By 50% It Can Also Save Lives During a Fire

Zheng and his colleagues found that the cooling paper can reduce a room’s temperature by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit (6 C). He selected materials that would reduce the cost of deploying the new technology to cool homes.

The cooling paper isn’t just eco-friendly in its ability to reduce your energy footprint. It’s also recyclable. The material can be used exposed to solar radiation weather and varying temperatures then reduced to a pulp (again) and reformed without losing one iota of its cooling properties. Zheng has tried it. And the recycled cooling paper performed just as well as the original.

“I was surprised when I obtained the same result” Zheng says. “We thought there would be maybe 10 percent 20 percent of loss but no.”

The process for creating and testing the new material was described in a paper published last month in the American Chemical Society journal Applied Materials & Interfaces—and Zheng was awarded a National Science Foundation CAREER Award grant for his research.

Zheng doesn’t just aim to reduce your utility bills through his research. He also hopes that his work will help combat climate change.

“The starting point is to reduce the use of carbon-based materials and also to reduce global warming” Zheng says.

However interesting things are happening in the land of Homer and Achilles.

2020 was the strongest year yet for the Greek startup ecosystem with key deals acquisitions and impressive growth stories. The stage is set for an even better 2021.

“We're far from being a mature ecosystem. However the delta from a few years ago is pretty big” says Panos Papadopoulos a partner at Athens-based Marathon Venture Capital.

According to Marathon the amount of money invested annually in Greece grew 23 times over from just $51m in 2010 to over $1.1bn in 2020.

“People are kind of forgetting about the delta and just seeing where we are currently. Last year we saw half a billion dollars in exits” adds Papadopoulos.

2020 and beyond

2020 was an impressive year for Greek startups despite the global pandemic. In August 2020 grocery delivery platform InstaShop was sold to food delivery behemoth Delivery Hero for $360m the largest exit for a Greek founded startup to date (even the country’s prime minister got excited about it).

Last year also saw the acquisition of software robotic automation platform Softomotive by Microsoft in a deal thought to be worth in excess of $125m as well as the acquisition of deep-tech startup Think Silicon by Nasdaq-listed Applied Materials for more than €20m according to sources.

Moreover the top 10 Greek startups raised a total of €115m according to a recent report by EIT Digital and startup accelerator Found.ation with more than €150m raised in total. This was a far cry from early years with the country struggling through much of the last decade economically and haemorrhaging talent.

“Now we have at least 20 startups that have high potential that have raised follow on rounds and are competing globally” says Apostolos Apostolakis a partner and cofounder at early stage investor VentureFriends.

At the same time in October 2020 Microsoft announced that it would be creating a data centre hub in Greece investing an initial €500m and an annual spending of €50m in the coming years. The Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said at the time that the project would include a training program in digital skills for about 100k people.

“If Microsoft will hire many engineers in Greece that's another thing but if they opening just a data centre where there will not be a lot of talent working it’s a nice investment good for the country but for the ecosystem it's not so valuable” says Apostolakis. “I think that what really affects the ecosystem is successes that have started” he adds.

Amazon Web Services also opened its first office in Athens in January 2021.

Often overlooked

Greece has a population of just under 11m and financial crises of the last decade or two led to many young educated Greeks leaving the country to find work abroad. This brain drain affected many sectors of the economy and when it came to the startup ecosystem it meant that many potential Greek entrepreneurs relocated and set up their companies in places like London Berlin etc.

Panos Papadopoulos partner at Marathon Venture Capital

Marathon’s Papadopoulos believes that ultimately the brain drain of the last decade will be a net positive allowing Greeks to accumulate experiences working in places like Spotify and if and when they return bringing those experiences and better connections with investors and others back with them.

“At some level I think the brain drain was fortunate we would like to have more people come here. Some are returning some will never return” he adds.

Much of this money flowing into startups (excluding those being acquired) has come through VCs backed by the Equifund initiative of the European Investment Fund and the Greek Government which was launched in 2017. It remains one of the EIF’s largest venture capital projects in a single EU member state.

“The money from the European Investment Fund has had a lot of impact not only practically because there was money but also people were more willing to stay here to build their startups” says Elli Diakanastasi an entrepreneurial teams' development strategist at the Athens Centre for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB).

However she says that most of the money is still going to more established startups. “Early stage startups don’t have access financially.”

Marathon’s Papadopoulos says that a lot of Greek startups are still bootstrapped flying under the radar of investors.

In November 2020 Marathon completed the first closing of its second fund worth €40m and backed by the EIF among others. The fund will be used to invest in seed-stage rounds of between €1m to €1.5m. Marathon’s initial fund invested in 10 startups including Netdata an open-source monitoring platform which raised $17m in Series A financing in September 2019.

In March the Hellenic Development Bank of Investments also announced a €60m fund dedicated to financing Greek startups.

2021 starts well

This year has already seen some important deals. In May Greek biomedical startup Causaly raised $17M in Series A funding the latest in a long line of raises by Greece-based or Greek-founded startups.

A month earlier Viva Wallet a Greek startup focused on banking services aimed at small and medium merchants raised a further $80m from investors a precursor to a Series D round including Chinese tech giant Tencent and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).

The company which was founded in 2005 and is active in 23 European markets is one of those vying for the title of Greece’s first unicorn.

“If it was our target to become a unicorn we’d raise right now we're trying to become a decacorn” Haris Karonis cofounder and chief executive of Viva Wallet tells Sifted.

The company cofounders are also among those trying to support the growth of the Greek ecosystem as a whole.

“My cofounder and I we are invested in 36 companies right now” says Karonis. He adds that Viva Wallet’s stock option plan which has seen almost 8% of the company owned by 76 employees could also help to create a Viva Wallet ‘mafia’ within the next few years.

Holding back

Many talk about the likes of ride-hailing app Taxibeat bought by Daimler-owned mytaxi in 2017 for around €40m (and later rebranded as Beat) and cloud-based recruitment platform Workable as the early stars of the Greek startup ecosystem.

Now names like Netdata ecommerce platform Skroutz and smart money management app Plum which raised $10m in July 2020 are thrown around.

“Taxibeat really helped things and pushed things along” says AUEB’s Diakanastasi.

Still there are issues that need to be overcome before Greece can be seen as an established startup hub.

“I think that the main thing is the mentality. In Greece when you say you’re an entrepreneur it’s still seen as something bad” says Diakanastasi.

She says that even the young generation still think of entrepreneurs as nightclub owners or drug dealers as opposed to dentists and more white collar professions.

“It's slowly changing but it is changing” she adds. At the same time in Greece there is still a major hangup when it comes to failing. “In places like the Netherlands if you are 22 and make an effort and fail it’s okay. Here you're a failure” she says.

Ecosystem growth

As well as enticing back Greeks who went abroad during the dark days of the financial crises the country is also hoping to bring in digital nomads.

Greece has also introduced a 50% income tax cut for digital migrants which goes into effect this year while the government has announced plans for the development of the first innovation hub in the country.

In February Endeavor Greece a non-profit focused on supporting high-impact entrepreneurs announced that it was launching a new platform aimed at connecting international tech experts who would like to work in Greece with local fast-growing companies. Individuals simply need to input their details into a database and they can be contacted directly by Greek tech companies.

Bright future

There is a sense that now is the time for Greece to show it can become a proper hub for startups in Europe.

“Greece is not doing something special but it's great that we're doing those things because just a couple of years ago with a different political establishment we haven't done those things” says VentureFriends’ Apostolakis.

“We have improved our brand as a more stable country coupled with the successes that we increasingly have. I have seen notably Greeks coming back and choosing to join Greek companies as well as international tech people who chose to spend time in Greece” he adds.

Apostolakis predicts that by the end of 2022 Greece will have companies that have crossed the €500m valuation. “Some of them are in our portfolio. I believe [real estate startup] Blueground will be a unicorn eventually” he says.

Others agree.

“Nothing is holding it back anymore” says Viva Wallet’s Karonis. “I strongly believe that Greece has reacted and Greece is back for good.”",,,,,,,,,

In April Daniel Carraway founder of the polyhydroxyalkanoate start-up RWDC Industries found himself in an unusual forum for someone trying to sell plastic. Carraway was being interviewed by the Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr. on the FootPrint Coalition’s YouTube channel. The FootPrint Coalition is Downey’s venture capital firm and also an RWDC investor. The FootPrint Coalition’s other investments include a bamboo toilet paper company and an outfit developing mealworm protein.

Encouraged by Downey Carraway pitched his biodegradable biopolymer as the solution to the plastic waste crisis. “We have to clean up the mess we made” Carraway said. “But we also have to stop making the mess.” The plastic industry has been trying to establish a recycling infrastructure since the 1970s he noted but it “just doesn’t work.”

Carraway and other proponents are hyping polyhydroxyalkanoates known collectively as PHA as the next big thing but they are hardly new. Nature has used this class of polymers to store cellular energy for millions of years. Companies have been trying to commercialize them—via industrial fermentation—for several decades. But despite what should be a strong selling point—biodegradability in a wide range of environments—they haven’t taken off. The list of companies that have tried and failed to bring PHA to market keeps growing.

We have to clean up the mess we made but we also have to stop making the mess. Daniel Carraway founder RWDC

This time boosters of the polymer maintain will be different. The world has changed they say. Cities are banning plastic straws and take-out containers and PHA is a responsible alternative. Large consumer product companies are clamoring for biodegradable packaging. Indeed PHA Skittles bags and Bacardí rum bottles are due out in stores soon.

Danimer Scientific the firm responsible for those applications puts the addressable PHA market at 230 million metric tons (t) per year—more than half the world’s plastic demand. Meanwhile the PHA industry is still in its infancy with capacity of less than 1 million t.

Detractors however warn that it won’t be easy for PHA to compete with the likes of polyethylene and polypropylene. PHA’s biodegradability is overhyped they say. And the biopolymer is too expensive to compete with petrochemicals on a large scale. Regardless all eyes are on PHA.

The company leading the current charge for PHA is Danimer. The firm based in Bainbridge Georgia started as a polylactic acid compounder and bought its PHA fermentation technology from Procter & Gamble back in 2007.

Only recently has the PHA business begun to gain significant traction for Danimer. The company opened its first commercial plant in Winchester Kentucky last year. It can make 9000 t per year and is being expanded to about 30000 t by next year.

Danimer says it is struggling to keep up with forecast demand. The first plant it projects will be running at full capacity by the end of this year. Danimer is close to having the output for the expansion reserved by customers as well CEO Steve Croskrey says. “If you count pending contracts we’re there.”

The firm’s biggest-volume product right now Croskrey says is resin for drinking straws used in jurisdictions that have banned straws made from petrochemical plastic. Its sales may soon shift toward packaging. Mars Wrigley plans to start selling Skittles in PHA bags by early next year. Bacardi plans to introduce PHA liquor bottles in 2023 replacing 3000 t per year of conventional plastic. Danimer has also been working with PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay unit on snack bags.

Danimer went public last year through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. Such SPACs now trendy are shell companies that raise money in the stock market on the promise that they will buy a high-growth firm.

The SPAC transaction “gave us a little more certainty about the future and allowed us to focus on customers and construction and things like that as opposed to fundraising” Croskrey says. Flush with the $380 million it raised Danimer ratcheted up its growth agenda. It unveiled plans for a $700 million plant to open in Georgia by 2024 with more than 113000 t per year of PHA capacity.

But Croskrey quickly learned that going public has its downside. Danimer is now facing much more scrutiny than it ever did as a private company. Recent months have brought an exposé from the Wall Street Journal of its biodegradability claims and a series of reports from an investment firm alleging that Danimer executives are hyping the firm’s prospects.

The Wall Street Journal report published in March looks at claims such as the one Bacardí made of its PHA bottle: that it would biodegrade in 18 months. This claim was extrapolated the article states from laboratory tests on PHA sheet under ideal conditions. The article also spotlights a Danimer statement that PHA would biodegrade in landfills—not particularly an environmental benefit when garbage isn’t supposed to degrade in landfills.

A month later Spruce Point Capital Management targeted Danimer. Spruce Point is a short seller an investment firm that bets a company’s stock will decline. Short sellers will often issue reports designed to sour opinion about a company and push its stock price down.

Spruce Point combed through all the information about Danimer it could find. It even obtained Danimer’s production numbers through a Freedom of Information Act request for environmental records from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

It issued a report alleging for example that the company has financial ties to University of Georgia scientists who wrote complimentary studies about Danimer’s technology. It mentions that PepsiCo which had been a Danimer investor sold its shares in the company shortly after it went public.

The report chides Danimer for missing construction targets in Kentucky. It highlights Danimer’s admission made during an earnings call that only 10% of its planned production in Georgia is reserved under contract despite assurances that the new plant will be sold out. And from the Kentucky environmental figures Spruce Point gleans that Danimer is running at only 66% of capacity.

The report also compares Danimer to Metabolix a public company that has become a cautionary tale in PHA. A decade ago Metabolix seemed to have everything going for it including a 50000 t per year PHA joint venture in Iowa with Archer Daniels Midland. But the partnership struggled to sell even 1% of that capacity and ADM pulled the plug in 2012.

Metabolix sold its technology to CJ CheilJedang in 2016. The South Korean firm is now building a plant in Indonesia.

Spruce Point’s founder Ben Axler says he learned about Danimer from the Wall Street Journal story and decided it needed more attention. “We are trying to fill a gap in the traditional research that comes out of the Wall Street investment banks” he says adding that such analysts “tend to take management’s claims at face value.”

One prominent analyst covering Danimer Laurence Alexander of Jefferies Financial Group was bullish on the company when it went public and remains so after the Spruce Point reports. In his most recent note to clients for example Alexander writes that the coming shift toward commercialization “will be a positive one” for the company.

Short-seller reports can be influential. In 2019 the Italian company Bio-on was riding high. It ran a small plant in Bologna Italy that produced PHA from molasses and sugar beet by-products. It launched a line of sunscreens with Unilever that incorporate PHA micropowders. And it signed licenses for its technology in Italy Spain France Mexico and Tatarstan.

Then Quintessential Capital Management issued a report alleging that Bio-on was a “house of cards” that booked fictitious licensee revenue from its own shell companies. Bio-on declared bankruptcy later that year.

Danimer’s stock has lost nearly half its value since the Wall Street Journal article was published in March. However its market capitalization of nearly $2.3 billion is about what it was when it went public.

Croskrey says he often gets asked about the downside of being a publicly traded company. “And you know the downside is clearly this kind of situation where people can attack a company that’s trying to do good and save the world from plastic pollution” he says. “It should be criminal but it’s not unfortunately.”

Danimer released a three-page statement in May addressing the “misconceptions falsehoods and speculation that have been circulating.”

Responding to Spruce Point’s criticisms Danimer says the figures reported to the Kentucky government don’t reflect actual production because they measure polymer coming out of the fermenter before it is compounded with other ingredients and sent to customers. The firm also reiterates its projections for capacity expansions and its ramp-up in sales.

Croskrey adds that Danimer’s expansion plans were delayed to conserve cash during the pandemic a defensive maneuver a lot of companies used in 2020. He also notes that Danimer continues to work with PepsiCo which still has a seat on Danimer’s board.

Croskrey argues that Danimer has advantages Metabolix didn’t have. For instance Danimer starts with a medium-chain-length PHA which he says has more robust physical properties than the short-chain polymers Metabolix was developing. Moreover the company which has long been a major compounder of polylactic acid has more applications expertise than Metabolix did.

Croskrey is standing his ground on biodegradability as well. “PHA is nature’s recycling program” he proclaims. He says the polymer can degrade in landfills because most such facilities aren’t sterile. “PHA will go away in conditions where bacteria can thrive regardless of where that is” Croskrey says.

Industry watchers say PHA has traction in the marketplace though companies shouldn’t hype it. Ramani Narayan a chemical engineer at Michigan State University says the biodegradability of PHA has at times been “oversold” creating the impression that it will quickly disappear in the environment.

But Narayan notes PHA is one of the most biodegradable polymers on the market. A bottle that finds its way into the ocean “is going to last for several years before it’s going to be removed by microbial metabolism which is better than polyethylene and polypropylene which will keep on accumulating” he says. “So there is value.”

Jan Ravenstijn an independent biopolymer consultant and a veteran of Dow and DSM says PHA might indeed be on the cusp of a high-growth phase a transition many new polymers finally make after years of development. It took the polylactic acid maker NatureWorks 23 years to finally turn a profit he notes.

Evidence for PHA’s transition is the blistering demand coming primarily from Asia. “Prices have tripled over the past 9 months or so” Ravenstijn says. “They can sell much more than they can make at the moment.”

Ravenstijn says this demand is driving a raft of expansions from newer players like CJ Kaneka and a firm poised to become a US rival to Danimer: RWDC.

Carraway founded RWDC in 2015 with businessperson Roland Wee. Carraway was no newcomer to PHA having established Danimer in 2004 with his wife Meredith. Carraway sold most of his Danimer stake in 2014 and now has no connection to the company.

RWDC raised $133 million in financing last year. Its investors include Vickers Venture Partners and Flint Hills Resources a chemical arm of Koch Industries.

RWDC launched a 5000 t per year demonstration facility in Athens Georgia earlier this year on the site of a former Invista fiber plant. It has begun construction on a 25000 t unit that it hopes to open in 2023 also in Athens. It plans to build a similar-sized plant after that and possibly a plant in Singapore.

RWDC has a big customer lined up in Cove a California company that aims to bring a biodegradable water bottle to the market later this year. Cove signed an agreement to buy 160000 t over 5 years—most of the PHA that RWDC expects to make. Earlier this month RWDC announced a partnership with Kimberly-Clark a producer of diapers and other consumer products.",,,,,,,,,

One of these stocks was Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS).

Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS) has experienced a decrease in hedge fund sentiment lately. Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS) was in 3 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic is 17. Our calculations also showed that ASPS isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Hedge funds have more than $3.5 trillion in assets under management so you can't expect their entire portfolios to beat the market by large margins. Our research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). So you can still find a lot of gems by following hedge funds' moves today.

With all of this in mind let's take a look at the recent hedge fund action encompassing Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS).

Do Hedge Funds Think ASPS Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

At the end of the first quarter a total of 3 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock a change of -25% from the fourth quarter of 2020. By comparison 8 hedge funds held shares or bullish call options in ASPS a year ago. So let's check out which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.

The largest stake in Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS) was held by Renaissance Technologies which reported holding $6.7 million worth of stock at the end of December. It was followed by Arrowstreet Capital with a $0.4 million position. The only other hedge fund that is bullish on the company was D E Shaw.

Story continues

We view hedge fund activity in the stock unfavorable but in this case there was only a single hedge fund selling its entire position: Citadel Investment Group. One hedge fund selling its entire position doesn't always imply a bearish intent. Theoretically a hedge fund may decide to sell a promising position in order to invest the proceeds in a more promising idea. However we don't think this is the case in this case because none of the 750+ hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey identified ASPS as a viable investment and initiated a position in the stock.

Let's check out hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS) but similarly valued. We will take a look at Protalix BioTherapeutics Inc. (NYSE:PLX) Avinger Inc (NASDAQ:AVGR) Summit Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:SMLP) Pangaea Logistics Solutions Ltd. (NASDAQ:PANL) Pieris Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:PIRS) Ayala Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:AYLA) and Apollo Endosurgery Inc. (NASDAQ:APEN). This group of stocks' market values are similar to ASPS's market value.

View table here if you experience formatting issues.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 5.6 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $14 million. That figure was $8 million in ASPS's case. Pieris Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:PIRS) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Summit Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:SMLP) is the least popular one with only 1 bullish hedge fund positions. Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for ASPS is 17. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 17.2% in 2021 through June 11th and surpassed the market again by 3.3 percentage points. Unfortunately ASPS wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was quite bearish); ASPS investors were disappointed as the stock returned -22.3% since the end of March (through 6/11) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market in 2021.

Gallagher Sold US$11m In Stock Alluding To Potential Weakness \,"The fact that multiple Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (NYSE:AJG) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions as insider selling can have various explanations. However shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.

Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.

Arthur J. Gallagher Insider Transactions Over The Last Year

The Corporate VP & Chief Human Resource Officer Susan Pietrucha made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.2m worth of shares at a price of US$212 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$206. We generally don't like to see insider selling but the lower the sale price the more it concerns us. In this case the big sale took place at around the current price so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).

Klondike grâce aux Premières Nations,"Le S.S. Klondike le célèbre bateau à vapeur qui trône fièrement à l’entrée de Whitehorse porte en lui un pan entier de l’histoire du Yukon : la ruée vers l’or et le transport maritime sur le fleuve. Parcs Canada a installé de nouveaux panneaux explicatifs pour raconter cette histoire de façon « plus juste » en ajoutant les histoires et le point de vue souvent écarté des Premières Nations.

Si seulement ces bateaux pouvaient raconter leurs histoires ça serait incroyable tout ce que nous pourrions apprendre se met à rêver Anne-Marie Miller du Conseil des Ta’an Kwäch’än.

Si l’imposant monument de bois vieilli par le temps ne peut prendre la parole des panneaux racontent sa riche histoire aux visiteurs.

Cette histoire a été réécrite pour mieux refléter la réalité historique. La ruée vers l’or n’était pas qu’une histoire de colons venus du Sud rêvant de faire fortune elle a aussi changé la vie des Premières Nations qui vivaient le long du fleuve Yukon.

Ouvrir en mode plein écran Anne-Marie Miller du Conseil des Ta’an Kwäch’än estime qu'il est important que les visiteurs puissent découvrir le rôle qu'ont joué les Premières Nations sur le fleuve Yukon. Photo : Radio-Canada / Vincent Bonnay

Parcs Canada en collaboration avec la Première Nation Kwanlin Dün et le Conseil des Ta'an Kwäch'än a lancé en 2018 ce projet de réécriture. Une historienne a suivi le fleuve pour rencontrer les communautés qui ont été touchées par l’arrivée des bateaux à vapeur à la fin du 19e siècle.

Une équipe de travail a ensuite été créée avec des membres de Parcs Canada de la Première Nation Kwanlin Dün et du Conseil Ta'an Kwach'an.

Cette collaboration a permis de développer ensemble 23 panneaux décrivant l'histoire du transport fluvial au Yukon du point de vue des Premières Nations.

Ouvrir en mode plein écran Au total 23 panneaux ont été ajoutés à l'extérieur du S.S Klondike. Photo : Radio-Canada / Vincent Bonnay

Technicienne du patrimoine pour le Conseil des Ta'an Kwäch'än Anne-Marie Miller a participé à leur élaboration en travaillant avec les aînés. C’était important de le faire maintenant car de nombreux aînés qui connaissent l’histoire du fleuve disparaissent et emportent cette histoire avec eux dit-elle. Il faut donc les écouter et les enregistrer pour l’enseigner aux jeunes.

Mais en se plongeant dans ces récits c’est sa propre histoire familiale qu’elle a rédigée. À l’entrée du site historique ce qui n’est qu’une photographie d’archive pour les visiteurs est pour elle un souvenir de famille qui date de 1940 : son grand-père sa grand-mère son oncle sa tante et d’autres tous sur le pont d’un bateau.

Grand-père était un citoyen du Conseil des Ta'an Kwäch'än il est né et a grandi sur les rives du Lac Laberge toujours près de l’eau  explique-t-elle.

Rectificatif : Une version précédente de ce texte affirmait à tort que Frank Slim était citoyen de la Première Nation Kwanlin Dün près du Lac Marsh.

C’est son amour pour le fleuve qui a poussé son grand-père Frank Slim à renoncer à son statut d’indien pour pouvoir devenir un pilote de bateau fluvial un emploi refusé aux autochtones à l’époque. Ce n’était pas rien à cette époque  rappelle Anne-Marie Miller qui précise qu’en abandonnant ce statut cela a permis aux enfants de ne pas être envoyés au pensionnat autochtone.

Frank Slim est ainsi devenu un pilote autochtone de renom et le premier pilote autochtone à descendre le fleuve vers Dawson avec des passagers des vivres et des marchandises et le remonter vers Whitehorse avec le précieux minerai.

C’est l’une des histoires jusqu’ici méconnues que les visiteurs peuvent maintenant découvrir en visitant le S.S. Klondike.

A l'issue du G7 Emmanuel Macron a voulu éteindre la polémique naissante assurant que ""la France ne s'est jamais permise de remettre en cause la souveraineté britannique"". Plus tôt dans la journée ce dimanche Londres avait demandé dimanche ""du respect"" aux Européens après un entretien du président français avec Boris Johnson en marge du G7.

L'échange tendu a plombé l'entente entre les grandes puissances lors de leur sommet en Angleterre et a ravivé les divergences entre Londres et les Européens sur les nouveaux contrôles imposés à certains échanges entre la Grande-Bretagne et l'Irlande du Nord de l'autre côté de la mer d'Irlande perturbant les échanges et provoquant la colère des unionistes qui défendent le maintien de la province au sein du Royaume-Uni.

Tensions autour de l'Irlande du Nord

Alors que le gouvernement britannique s'inquiète particulièrement de l'entrée en vigueur en juillet de règles empêchant l'envoi en Irlande du Nord de viande réfrigérée Boris Johnson a évoqué le sujet avec Emmanuel Macron samedi matin. Selon l'entourage du président français le Premier ministre britannique lui a dit: ""A Toulouse il y a des saucisses non ? Et bien c'est comme si les saucisses ne pouvaient plus être vendues sur les marchés parisiens"".

""Macron a été étonné et lui a dit 'qu'il n'était pas convenable de comparer des situations qui n'étaient pas comparables' car Toulouse faisait partie du même 'territoire' alors que ce n'est pas le cas de l'Irlande puisqu'il y a une mer entre eux"" a précisé la même source.

Une remarque qui aurait rendu furieux Boris Johnson. Ce dernier aurait menacé d'invoquer l'article 16 du ""protocole nord-irlandais"" permettant de passer outre certaines dispositions du texte.

Macron demande du ""sérieux""

Emmanuel Macron interrogé sur le sujet en conférence de presse à l'issue du G7 ce dimanche a appelé ""au calme"".

""Nous avons en France beaucoup de villes régions et d'appellations d'origine contrôlées ou protégées où nous faisons de la saucisse. Nous en sommes fiers et nous l'aimons. Il y a celle de Toulouse (...) et beaucoup d'autres. Je ne voudrais pas des problèmes avec Montbéliard Strasbourg ou d'autres régions. Nous défendons la gastronomie française dans sa diversité"" a-t-il longuement ironisé avant d'appeler au ""sérieux"".

""On ne peut pas créer des polémiques chaque matin sur des sujets comme ceux-ci au moment même où nous réunissons pendant trois jours pour dire que notre priorité est de réussir à recréer dans nos démocraties de la croissance à défendre notre modèle fragilisé (...) comment bâtir une stratégie pour défendre notre modèle avec la montée de la Chine"" a-t-il estimé.

Emmanuel Macron qui a assuré que la France respectait ""l'intégrité"" et la ""souveraineté"" du territoire britannique.

""C'est aussi vrai que le Brexit est l'enfant de cette souveraineté britannique et a occupé des milliers d'heures de travail des dirigeants européens. La souveraineté britannique nous européens nous savons ce que c'est.

Destruction in Gaza: Side-by-side aerial look at the Israel-Hamas war's devastating damage

Thousands of mosques churches homes restaurants colleges and other buildings have been turned to rubble across the Gaza Strip as the Israel-Hamas war continues.

On Oct. 7 Hamas terrorists invaded Israel and Israel retaliated with ongoing military operations in Gaza. Since the beginning of the retaliation at least 34735 people in Gaza have been killed and 78108 have been injured according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health.

At least 1700 Israelis have been killed and 8700 others injured according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Since then many of the once-bustling streetscapes -- home to roughly 2.3 million people -- have been flattened.

A report from the United Nations Development Programme found that the war has set back human development in Gaza more than 20 years. That setback will increase the longer the war goes on according to the U.N.

Roughly 86000 housing units have been destroyed and almost 300000 more have been damaged in the Palestinian territories according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.

Additionally 25000 buildings have been destroyed 32 hospitals forced out of service and three churches 341 mosques and 100 universities and schools destroyed according to the Palestinian agency.

Thousands more Gazans are estimated to be missing under the debris according to the Palestinian Civil Defense.

Here is a look at Gaza before the war compared to now:

Smith is disappointed with Patrick Beverley for his behavior toward a fan and a producer following the Bucks' loss. (2:30)

INDIANAPOLIS -- Indianapolis police announced Wednesday they've opened an investigation into an ""NBA player and citizen"" altercation that happened at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on the night Milwaukee Bucks guard Patrick Beverley threw a ball at a fan in the final minutes of a season-ending loss to the Indiana Pacers.

Police said in a news release the case has been forwarded to detectives ""who are currently investigating this situation and take all accusations seriously.""

Detectives will present the case to the Marion County Prosecutor's Office at the conclusion of the investigation the release stated.

Cameras showed Beverley sitting on the bench and tossing a ball into the stands hitting a fan in the head with about 2½ minutes left in Thursday's contest. After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley who was holding his arm out for it the Bucks guard fired it back at that spectator.

Beverley spoke about his behavior on an episode of ""The Pat Bev Podcast"" that was released Wednesday. He said he was called a word that he'd never been called before but added that his own actions were ""still inexcusable.""

""I will be better"" he said. ""I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said that should have never happened. Simple as that.""

Beverley added the atmosphere in Indianapolis ""was great"" aside from ""a handful of fans"" who crossed a line. The Pacers beat the Bucks 120-98 eliminating Milwaukee in six games in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.

""I will be better. I have to be better and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said that should have never happened. Simple as that.""

""I ain't bringing a basketball on the bench no more"" Beverley said. ""That ... threw my whole vibe off.""

After the game Beverley wouldn't allow ESPN journalist Malinda Adams to ask him a question in a group interview in the locker room. He said it was because she didn't subscribe to his podcast. Beverley told her to get her microphone out of his face then eventually asked her to leave the interview circle.

On his podcast Wednesday Beverley said he had asked that of reporters who interviewed him ever since he launched his podcast. Beverley said he told Adams that ""it was never my intent to disrespect you.""

A day after the loss Bucks coach Doc Rivers said Beverley's behavior was ""not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way.""

One was a familiar sight: a massive cruise ship bringing hundreds of tourists to the pristine shores of this nation of 15000 people. The other a neon-orange vessel hauling complex scientific equipment was more unusual.

On a nearby wharf Prime Minister Mark Brown and many other prominent citizens had gathered to celebrate the smaller boat’s arrival. To Mr. Brown the cruise ship represented his country’s troubling dependence on tourism. He described the other vessel owned by an international mining company as a harbinger of incredible wealth.

“Officers were called after a person attempted to gain access to the property” Toronto police said in a statement. “The person was apprehended under the Mental Health Act and they were taken to receive medical attention.”

Police said the incident was unrelated to the shooting which took place early on Tuesday morning. Investigations continue into that incident after reports that the assailant was seen fleeing the scene in a vehicle.

No motive has been ascribed to either incident which have happened amid an especially high-profile month for Drake.

He has been involved in a vehement war of words with rival rapper Kendrick Lamar with insults and criminal allegations levelled by each of them at the other via a series of diss tracks which have gone on to become huge global hits on streaming services.

One of Lamar’s tracks Not Like Us is currently the most-streamed song in the world on Spotify. Its artwork features an aerial shot of Drake’s Toronto mansion.

Drake used his most recent diss track The Heart Part 6 to refute some of the allegations made against him by Lamar including child sex offences and that he is harbouring a secret child. “If I was fucking young girls I promise I’d have been arrested / I’m way too famous for this shit you just suggested” he rapped and said that Lamar had been deliberately fed false information regarding the secret child to undermine his own diss tracks."

Although it was a revelation to them it wasn't news to company and state officials.

A flurry of lawsuits filed both last year and this year show many plaintiffs believe the plant was contaminating soil and groundwater on-site and off before a fire hydrant was broken on Nov. 23 2011 while Dresser employees made repairs to fire and water suppression system components.

The lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. District Court Western District of Louisiana in Alexandria. Those filed in district courts in Grant and Rapides parishes have been moved to federal court because the defendants and some plaintiffs are scattered across the United States.

One seeks class-action status. Others allege deaths from cancer and other health issues including the loss of an unborn child. Some contend there's been an active effort to mislead residents about health threats.

All concerned have experienced decreased property values in the northern southern and eastern areas around the plant — in Grant and Rapides parishes — where contamination has been found in soil and groundwater.

A history and 'the 2011 contamination event'

The facility which made pressure relief valves for the oil and gas industry opened on Oct. 30 1961 as Manning Maxwell & Moore according to Town Talk archives. It stayed in business under changing ownership for more than 50 years before closing for good in 2017.

Dresser Industries merged with the Halliburton Co. in 1998 but Halliburton sold it off the Dresser units in 2001. It then was bought in 2010 by General Electric Oil & Gas.

In November 2011 the fire hydrant break happened. Water filled an area excavated for the repairs and as some of the lawsuits state a ""hydrocarbon sheen was observed on standing water"" at the excavation site.

By 2015 almost 300 employees at the Tioga plant learned of a restructuring that might close it. By the next year they learned GE-Dresser would lay off more than 90 percent of its workforce according to Town Talk archives.

According to at least one of the lawsuits Baker Hughes Co. merged with GE in 2017 the same year the plant closed completely.

But by then the damage already had been done. Company officials and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality knew it too according to the lawsuits.

GE-Dresser notified DEQ about the spill in June 2012. DEQ installed monitoring wells so that soil and groundwater samples could be analyzed. Various testing continued into 2014 and as one lawsuit alleges the department first learned about contamination in the Aurora Park subdivision in December 2019.

The public notices began going out the next month in January 2020 although some residents said they weren't notified until months later.

The notices stated the contamination was from trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE).

Officials involved with the ongoing cleanup have said drinking water found hundreds of feet below ground is safe. TCE has been found in groundwater closer to the surface though.

What does create a danger is a volatilization which happens when the chemicals move as vapors through the soil and into the air. It will dissipate outdoors but it can and has gotten into buildings in the contamination area.

When that happens it lingers and can be a health concern.

""Defendants knew for many years that they were disposing storing discharging and otherwise releasing toxic poisons and pollutants onto and into the ground groundwaters and surface waters on or near plantiffs' property"" reads the lawsuit of several individuals.

""Yet defendants failed to inform or warn plaintiffs concerning the extent nature cause and origin of this pollution.""

What are TCE and PCE?

Both are clear liquids with a ""chloroform-like"" smell that can be used to remove grease from metal parts according to the Centers for Disease Control. Neither occurs naturally and both can be harmful to humans.

TCE can irritate eyes and skin but also can cause other health issues if someone is exposed to higher concentrations. The CDC says it can ""cause dizziness headaches sleepiness confusion nausea unconsciousness liver damage and even death.""

In addition TCE can cause kidney cancer and possibly liver cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma according to the National Cancer Institute.

PCE is listed as a possible carcinogen according to the CDC. It can irritate the eyes skin nose throat respiratory system and can cause liver damage.

More than lower property values

Lawsuits began popping up just months after people in the area started to be notified by DEQ.

The lawsuit that seeks class-action status was filed in federal court on Jan. 6. The list of plaintiffs stretches for two pages. Another initially filed in the 35th Judicial District Court in Grant Parish includes 44 individuals and four limited liability companies as plaintiffs.

Others count couples or individuals as plaintiffs. At least 14 lawsuits have been filed.

They allege their property values have been damaged and some seek to have the environmental damage done to their properties repaired. One initially filed in East Baton Rouge Parish alleges that Dresser intentionally drained fluids from the plant onto his property which has been in his family since the 1920s.

But some also detail what they contend are adverse health consequences of the contamination. For example:

One couple living on Champions Way with their granddaughter who became pregnant with twins. All were exposed according to the lawsuit and the granddaughter ""lost one unborn child and the other ... was born with one or more developmental abnormalities including a cleft lip and palate.""

Another lawsuit details what happened to four people who lived on Titleist Drive Deerbrook Trail and Shreveport Highway. One man was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma while one woman died from the same disease. Another woman died from liver cancer while a Dry Prong resident was diagnosed with kidney cancer.

A married couple living on W. Medalist Drive alleges the contamination is responsible for the wife's cancer diagnosis in 2018.

A resident of Aurora Drive blames the contamination for her seizures headaches and mental anguish.

What's next?

None of the lawsuits are ready to move forward to trials yet. And some of the responses highlight the tough time plaintiffs will have recovering damages from DEQ.

""First contrary to plaintiffs' contentions LDEQ does not owe plaintiffs a general duty to investigate in any particular way and remediate purported contamination of their property"" reads part of a filing on behalf of Haliburton Energy Services Inc. in one of the lawsuits.

On June 9 U.S. District Judge David C. Joseph granted motions filed by multiple defendants to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims in that lawsuit for failure to state a claim.

A status conference via video is set in other lawsuits for June 15.

Meanwhile cleanup continues in the area as some residents debate whether to try to sell their properties.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vb2lscHJpY2UuY29tL0VuZXJneS9DcnVkZS1PaWwvUmVtb3RlLVdvcmstSXMtVGhlLU5ld2VzdC1UcmVuZC1Jbi1PaWwtQW5kLUdhcy5odG1s0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9vaWxwcmljZS5jb20vRW5lcmd5L0NydWRlLU9pbC9SZW1vdGUtV29yay1Jcy1UaGUtTmV3ZXN0LVRyZW5kLUluLU9pbC1BbmQtR2FzLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remote Work Is The Newest Trend In Oil And Gas,"Remote work was one of the changes bestowed upon us by the pandemic—and it may turn into a long-term trend. This trend was most visible in office jobs but it was by no means limited to them. Oil drillers went remote too. And they plan to stay remote.

The words “remote drilling” probably conjures up an image of a lonely offshore platform or a field in the Texas shale plays with no crew to man the equipment because everything is done from a command center hundreds of miles away.

Yet remote drilling is much more than that.

The activities grouped under the term remote drilling are a whole spectrum Shan Jegatheeswaran vice president of digital for Oilfield Services at Baker Hughes told Oilprice this week. It is not only about remote control either. Remote drilling spans activities as diverse as drilling logistics data processing and sharing and a better operational organization overall.

Baker Hughes recently announced what it calls the largest deployment of its remote operations digital technology and this deployment involved all of Aramco’s drilling operations. This is how the company describes what the project entails: “a single solution that covers data aggregation from the edge; real-time unified data streaming and visualization; data management; software development services; rig-site digital engineers; and monitoring personnel.”

In other words what we may call remote drilling in a conversation actually involves a comprehensive push to unify and centralize operations in the upstream industry. Baker Hughes has been doing it for 20 years already and its peers are doing it too. According to Jegatheeswaran this is the future of the upstream. Because it’s beneficial for everyone involved.

To begin with reducing the number of personnel needed on site means reducing costs associated with personnel the potential for safety issues and not least emissions. According to Baker Hughes for every engineer the company remotes from an offshore platform it saves travel- and accommodation-related emissions to the tune of 6 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually.

The emission-reduction side of the remote drilling trend is one of its major benefits without a doubt. It is also among the benefits of remote drilling that the pandemic made a lot more visible than before. As Schlumberger put it in an article on remote drilling for Offshore magazine before the pandemic remote drilling was something that was nice to have. The pandemic turned this technology into a critical element that could ensure operational continuity.

The stats speak for themselves. Baker Hughes says the share of remote operations in its drilling services increased from 50 percent in 2019 to 87 percent in 2020. For many of its clients no remote drilling meant no drilling at all during the lockdowns. So even if some might have been unwilling to embrace the new era of remote drilling they now had to—or risk their business.

Yet remote drilling is not only a way to cut costs by sending fewer people to the field and reducing emissions. It also reduces risks all along the supply chain of the upstream industry by effectively shortening it. The fewer risks there are in an operation regardless of their nature the better for everyone.

Operational efficiency is another clear advantage of the spectrum of remote drilling. It makes data collection and processing much more productive by centralizing these processes at a single point Baker Hughes’ Jegatheeswaran explains. Yet to step away from the digital into the physical field for a moment remote drilling also speeds up the start of new projects and this is becoming increasingly important in the post-pandemic industry where budgets will continue to be allocated carefully for the observable future.

There are challenges of course. Finding and training the right talent is one of them according to Jegatheeswaran. Yet there is a silver lining in this particular problem: as companies find and train the new “remote” employees they can then transfer these skills to another field should they decide to change careers.

Another challenge is deriving the maximum value from the technology because it’s all about value these days in oil and gas as the era of lavish spending on everything because Brent trades at $100 are over. Now even if Brent does go up to $100 oil companies—even the biggest and richest—will think twice before splashing on extravagant projects with long ROI periods.

Remote drilling—and data visualization and monitoring and maintenance—is the future of oil and gas; that much is clear. It will be quite a while before fields are fully automated and this is good news for the people working in the industry. More people will be needed to ensure the long-term sustainability of remote field operations and that’s good news for the next generations joining the workforce. Because remote drilling is a long-term endeavor.

As Baker Hughes’ Jegatheeswaran put it once the oilfield services operator deploys the remote operations system someone needs to monitor and maintain it. It’s not like selling a car and letting the customer deal with whatever happens to it afterward. It’s more of a long-term partnership of equals beneficial both for the participants in it and everyone else with the possible exception of those who want to keep oil and gas in the ground.

Will It Pay Off for Investors?,"Investors love Citigroup's treasury and trade solutions unit and would like to see it become a bigger part of the bank.

While its new CEO Jane Fraser is attempting to turn the bank around Citigroup (C 1.21%) is trading at a very cheap valuation compared to its peers and the broader industry. Not only does Citigroup need to address regulatory issues but Fraser is also looking to refresh the bank's strategy which has held it behind the other big U.S. banks for years.

A key part of that refresh will likely involve a heavier emphasis on Citigroup's treasury and trade solutions (TTS) division which Fraser recently called the ""crown jewel"" of the bank and a big driver of valuation going forward. Let's take a look at how this division currently fits into the broader bank and whether it can help Citigroup deliver for shareholders.

What is the TTS division?

Of the four largest U.S. banks by assets Citigroup is the most difficult to understand and analyze in my opinion. Its business model is more global than those of JPMorgan Chase Bank of America or Wells Fargo and it has the smallest lending operation of any of the four. But these two factors are likely why Citigroup has developed a world-class treasury and trade division.

The TTS division is part of Citigroup's larger institutional clients group but it essentially helps businesses all over the world run their operations. TTS solutions help clients carry out import and export operations manage liquidity and process payments using analytics to help them run more efficiently. The TTS group operates in 160 countries and 140 currencies and processes roughly $3 trillion in daily transactions.

At a recent conference Fraser said:

Having run Latin America I saw companies can't operate without us multinationals on the ground. So it really becomes this network we have in cash management in foreign exchange and trade and lending. ... Just given the dynamics in the world and you know the competitive position that the business has it's very hard to unseat this.

In 2020 TTS generated more than $9.5 billion of revenue for Citigroup. At the end of the first quarter of 2021 loan balances from the TTS group reached close to $71 billion while deposits from the division totaled $649 billion.

Does TTS drive valuation?

To a certain extent TTS has been a driver of valuation because it's a part of the bank that investors and analysts cite as a huge positive at Citigroup along with the bank's investment banking and credit card operations. But the $9.5 billion in revenue Citigroup made from TTS only made up about 13% of total revenue in 2020 and it hasn't been enough in recent years to overcome issues with other parts of Citigroup's operations such as parts of its global consumer bank.

Citigroup recently just exited its consumer banking operations in 13 global markets that were inefficient used too much capital and ran into credit quality issues during the pandemic. Investors overall seemed pleased with the move but there is still work to do in Citigroup's U.S. retail bank which in general does not have nearly the same scale as the other large U.S. banks like JPMorgan.

At the same conference where Fraser spoke analyst John McDonald of Autonomous Research noted that investors have told him it would be great to see TTS become a bigger part of Citigroup's business. Unfortunately since it only makes up a smaller portion of total revenue TTS has had a difficult time overcoming some of the pitfalls from the global consumer bank. Additionally Citigroup's profits from its credit card and other investment banking capabilities are still a larger piece of the pie so TTS does not really drive the bank's valuation right now although it contributes.

The good news is Fraser seemed to indicate that the bank recognizes this and will put more investment and effort going forward in order to create unmatched platforms and TTS capabilities in the future.

Can it drive valuation?

While TTS is clearly the ""crown jewel"" of Citigroup it still needs to scale further if it's truly going to drive the bank's valuation. If Citigroup does invest more in the unit and make it a larger portion of total revenue I am sure investors will reward Citigroup with a much more attractive valuation and stock price than it currently has. And with Citigroup refreshing its strategy and starting to exit businesses and geographies it either hasn't succeeded in or doesn't have the scale to compete in it should be able to focus more on areas like TTS moving forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2NyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN5L21vcmUtdXMtZmluYW5jZS1naWFudHMtdGlwdG9lLWludG8tY3J5cHRvLWFzc2V0cy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MzQ3ODIyOS5jbXPSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3kvbW9yZS11cy1maW5hbmNlLWdpYW50cy10aXB0b2UtaW50by1jcnlwdG8tYXNzZXRzL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MzQ3ODIyOS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More US finance giants tiptoe into crypto assets,"You Might Also Like: Basel panel plans crypto rules for banks in a big booster for Bitcoin

This paradox guides Andreas Koefoed’s masterfully told documentary The Lost Leonardo which debuted this weekend at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. In just 95 minutes Koefoed charts how the painting became the most expensive artwork of all time and how it mysteriously disappeared in the process managing to offer new insights into a story that has been explored ad nauseam in the press.

The film opens dramatically with reenacted footage of a man rifling through an art storage unit at night. With a flashlight in hand he explains what a “sleeper” painting is: “a painting that’s being offered … which is clearly by a much better artist than the auction house has recognized. A sleeper hunter is someone who looks for these mistakes and that’s what I do.” We soon learn that he is Alexander Parish one of the two art dealers who purchased the painting at a 2005 auction in New Orleans where Salvator Mundi sold for $1175 and was attributed to one of Leonardo’s followers.

When he unpacks the work Parish quickly realized that portions of it had been painted over. He and his partner in the deal Robert Simon brought on Dianne Modestini an art restorer who is also a conservation professor at NYU’s Institute of Fine Arts to clean the painting. She discovered that it was extremely damaged with parts of the figure’s face almost indiscernible. Later on Modestini uncovered that the artist had changed the position of the Christ’s thumb generating a pentimento or evidence of an artist’s revision. Only later as she was restoring the lips of the figure did she note similarities between the painting and the Mona Lisa. “No one except Leonardo could have painted this picture” she tells Koefoed.

Modestini’s role in the Salvator Mundi saga is controversial and it’s clear that she agreed to be interviewed to rebuff her critics by sharing her side of the story. Modestini has been accused of having financial interest in the work as some people believe that she was a part owner in the work. In the documentary she flatly denies this saying only that she was “paid generously” for the restoration.

Koefoed’s film interrogates her restoration process with Leonardo expert Frank Zöllner saying “The new parts of the painting look like Leonardo but they are by the restorer. In some parts it’s a masterpiece by Dianne Modestini.” Modestini responds: “Well that’s ridiculous because I can’t paint like Leonardo. I mean it’s very flattering but it’s absurd.”

Simon too began to look for proof that this painting could in fact be a Leonardo. The work in question can be traced back as far as 1900 but its provenance before that is murky. “Where did this object come from and in what context did it land in the moment it’s in right now?” asks Evan Beard global art services executive at Bank of America. Still today no one has the full story but Simon claims to have been found in the inventories of the English kings Charles I and Charles II two now-missing works by Leonardo da Vinci both called Salvator Mundi that describe the works as depicting a figure holding an orb. The rediscovered Salvator Mundi doesn’t have the royal brand (a crown with the letters CR underneath) on its back as would be expected of works that were in royal collections but to Simon that’s just an irrelevant detail.

For some what cemented this rediscovered work as a bona fide Leonardo was its inclusion in a 2011 exhibition about the Renaissance artist at the National Gallery in London. The show’s curator Luke Syson asked Parish and Simon to bring the work to London to be reviewed by a panel of da Vinci experts including Martin Kemp and Maria Teresa Fiorio. A cagey Syson says in the film that Kemp and Fiorio both felt strongly that it was a Leonardo. But the two experts deny this to Koefoed telling him that they would have never given such an opinion especially in such an informal setting. Another layer of mystery derives from whether any scientific analysis was done to the painting prior to its London debut.

Enter the beleaguered Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier who has become well known for the numerous lawsuits that have been brought against him by his onetime client the Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. Rybolovlev claimed he believed that Bouvier was acting as his art adviser and that he would take a commission on works that Rybolovlev purchased. In actuality Bouvier bought high-quality blue-chip masterpieces for a certain price and sold them for a steep profit to Rybolovlev pocketing a reported $1 billion for himself.

One of those works was Salvator Mundi. The U.S. dealers had in mind a $200 million price tag for the painting. Bouvier was able to negotiate it down to $83 million but he told Rybolovlev’s financial director he was only able to get it down to $127.5 million. (Bouvier claims that Rybolovlev had previously agreed to buy the painting from him for $130 million.) It’s clear that he has no regrets. “You buy low and you sell high” he says in the film. “It’s the principle of commerce. People don’t understand and say ‘Mr. Bouvier is a cheater’ but Mr. Bouvier is a businessman like any other.”

Once Rybolovlev learned about the price differences between what Bouvier paid the U.S. dealers and Rybololev’s $127.5 million payment he tried to sell the works he had bought through Bouvier at auction according to the documentary. Unimpeachable masterpieces by Klimt Gauguin Magritte Picasso and Rothko were consigned by Rybolovlev to Christie’s as well as Salvator Mundi. But according to Evan Beard the Bank of America executive the only work that “had questions around it” was the Salvator Mundi. In order to “keep their client happy they went all in on this picture.”

And so began a frenetic marketing campaign in which the auction house called the painting the “male Mona Lisa.” In one promotional video actor Leonardo di Caprio is shown standing in front of the painting. Meanwhile the painting goes on a global tour as crowds snake around the block to get a glimpse of it. As Alison Cole the editor of the Art Newspaper puts it “Christie’s is in the business of selling—it’s not in the business of authenticating.”

After the painting sold for $450 million shooting far beyond its $180 million estimate speculation swirled about who bought it. New York Times journalist David Kirkpatrick reported that it was bought by a proxy for Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. MBS and the Saudi government have never confirmed that they were the buyers though Koefoed spends time exploring why they may have purchased the work. Was it merely a political strategy intended to boost Saudi Arabia’s place in the international art world or did MBS simply have a personal connection to the work? Koefoed never offers definite conclusions and it’s possible no one will ever know for sure what really happened.

Given the timing of the sale some wondered if the work might reappear in the 2019 Leonardo exhibition at the Louvre in Paris timed to the 500th anniversary of the artist’s death. It never ended up going on view at the museum igniting further controversy. Adding more fuel to the fire was the fact that though the Louvre had secretly analyzed the painting and produced a booklet full of new technical information in which the museum confirmed “that the work is by Leonardo da Vinci.” That book was never officially published by the Louvre because the loan never came through and the museum has tried to deny its existence.

Major questions still linger: Is Salvator Mundi without a doubt a work by Leonardo da Vinci? Was the work really purchased by MBS and why would he have paid such an astronomical price for it? Where is the painting now and will the public ever see it again? Viewers expecting answers may find themselves disappointed by The Lost Leonardo which doesn’t come any closer to the truth than any prior reporting on the subject. What the documentary does show though is that no matter what the truth is everyone has their own set ideas about Salvator Mundi and there’s no convincing them otherwise. As investigative journalist Alexandra Bregman says at one point “Even if it’s decided months years decades later that it’s not really by Leonardo da Vinci those $450 million will live out in eternity as a value put upon this work of art.”

The Lost Leonardo premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 13. It is scheduled for a theatrical release in the U.S. this August.

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Deputy Governor Chuchi Fonacier said the Monetary Board issued Resolution 695 noting the cessation of operations of Wells Fargo Bank – Manila Representative Office.

MANILA Philippines — Well Fargo Bank National Association closed down its representative office in the Philippines last month the second foreign bank to shut down its liaison office in Manila amid the pandemic.

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Deputy Governor Chuchi Fonacier said the Monetary Board issued Resolution 695 noting the cessation of operations of Wells Fargo Bank – Manila Representative Office.

“Wells Fargo decided to close its representative office in the Philippines citing the adoption of a centralized approach to optimize efficiency in line with the bank’s core international principles” Fonacier told The STAR.

Wells Fargo’s presence in the Philippines can be traced back to 1901 as part of its Asian operations footprint. It established an operations function in Manila in 2011 and then quickly grew to provide capabilities including risk project management data analytics finance and accounting.

In February last year Wells Fargo & Co. laid off about 700 workers in the Philippines as it decided to move most of its technology employees to locations with high concentration of workers such as India.

The BSP allows foreign banks to open representative offices in the Philippines to serve as liaison offices to promote and provide information about the services or products they offer but may not transact banking businesses such as acceptance of deposits issuance of letters of credit and foreign exchange trading.

Last December Korea Development Bank – Representative Office in the Philippines also closed down.

Korea Development Bank opened its representative office in the Philippines in July 2014 to provide financial advice and information to Korean companies relocating their manufacturing activities to the country.

With the closure of Wells Fargo Bank there are 11 remaining foreign banks operating representative offices in the Philippines.

These are the Bank of Singapore Ltd. Philippines Bank of Taiwan Credit Suisse AG DBS Bank Ltd. Japan Bank for International Cooperation Korea Eximbank Rothschild (Singapore) Ltd. State of India The Bank of New York Mellon The Ogaki Kyoritsu Bank Ltd. and UBS AG.",,,,,,,,,

There are lots of things that go into Met Gala prep. Kim Kardashian had to learn the art of breathing in a corset for example. If you’re Jessica Biel the night before the Met Gala was all about dumping more Epsom salt than anyone has ever needed into a bathtub. How much Epsom salt do you think that would be? A pound maybe? Two? Think bigger.

In a TikTok Biel shared that she would be spending the night before the Met Gala soaking in a bath filled with 20 pounds of Epsom salt. That’s five full bags of magnesium sulfate. Dr. Teal’s the brand used by Biel in the video recommends customers use “at least” two cups per bath to relax muscles and reduce inflammation. So technically she is following the instructions.

For scale the average 1-year-old weighs about 20 pounds. Why would anyone need a baby-size amount of Epsom salts in their bath? Biel did not explain her reasoning but kindly shared her routine. The actress said your bath should have “water as hot as you can take it.” Then she instructed you soak for 30 minutes then “drink tons of water” and “off to bed early.” Anyone who has ever taken an Epsom-salt bath knows that there’s no way you wouldn’t be off to bed early after soaking in that high of a concentration.

If you think that maybe 20 pounds of Epsom salt might fix everything for you think again. First of all that’s like a $25 bath. Second of all medical professionals don’t think it’s a good idea. Dr. T.N. Rekha Singh told Yahoo Life that Biel’s method could have negative side effects. “Overuse or excessively concentrated solutions can lead to dehydration salt imbalance or magnesium overdose” she told the website.

Long story short you don’t need more than two cups of Epsom salt to get the maximum amount of relaxation. Your muscles will still thank you and — I’m just guessing on this one — so will your pipes. (That much salt can’t be good for them right?)

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

Now her rich history will be told in a documentary by Johnnoy Johnson. A dancer Johnson said it was important for him to share the story of Baxter in a documentary highlighting her magnificent talent and tremendous contributions to the development of the arts through the lives of those she impacted over the years.

Baxter was born in the 1920s. Hailing from Spanish Town St Catherine she shifted the performing arts landscape and was the first person to bring Jamaican traditional drumming and dancing to the main stage. Responsible for training two international sensations in dance Clive Thompson and Garth Fagan Baxter also introduced the late Professor Rex Nettleford to creative and modern dance. She planted a tree of dance which grew when she created her dance group – the Ivy Baxter Dance Group — in 1950. From there founding members branched out to form their own creative bodies including National Dance Theatre Company Stella Maris Dance Ensemble and Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts’ School of Dance along with a host of others. She even became an author when she wrote the book titled Arts of an Island which examines local culture from the era of the Tainos all the way to Independence.

Most of the pioneers of dance like the ones previously mentioned and Barbara Requa were positively influenced by her tutelage and work. Wherever this genre of dance is being practised on the island chances are the movement is somehow connected to the history of the woman who started it all.

Johnson was initially fascinated when he was introduced to her name while attending Excelsior Community College in 2009. Compelled to explore more about her dance journey his studies compared Baxter to the likes of Isadora Duncan the barefoot American dancer of North America and Europe. It marked as a fitting juxtaposition since the Jamaican dancer was instrumental to the barefoot dance movement of the island. He described that learning experience as educational eye-opening and something he believed many local modern contemporary dancers of today take for granted.

“We take our dancing for granted not knowing what others put in. And Ivy Baxter had put in a great amount of work for us to even have a modern dance movement in this country. It was very inspiring and very humbling to know that what she did allows me to call myself a dancer” the dancer and choreographer told The Gleaner in a recent interview.

Armed with knowledge passion and exuberance he transferred his energies to film and production recruiting persons with a modern contemporary dance background to speak about her vibrant and thriving career. To take this homage one step further he chose seven women from different professions to come together in dance choreographing a piece of work that celebrates this phenomenal powerhouse.

The women include Dr Terri-Karelle Reid media services specialist; Keita-Marie Chamberlain Clarke attorney-at-law; Jacqueline Logan director of special assignments at the Ministry of Finance; Paula Shaw administrative manager at Paul Goldson & Company; Carreen Walton owner of DanceFyah; Nicole Baine administration and communications officer at Incrementic; and Neila Ebanks dancer-choreographer and academic. “The feedback from the teaser has been amazing. People are excited and looking out for the documentary” he revealed.

With plans for a late June release Johnson hopes that viewers will walk away from the film with a greater understanding and appreciation for Baxter “I want dancers and the public to know about Ivy Baxter; to learn about this great lady and the different lives and spaces that she has impacted.”

IN his five-year-stint at Mamelodi Sundowns Khama Billiat worked under one coach — and he flourished.

However that stability has been lacking at Kaizer Chiefs where he has already changed coaches three times in a period of two years.

The big question is will the Zimbabwe international flourish under the Glamour Boys’ latest appointment Stuart Baxter who returned to the club this week replacing Gavin Hunt.

Baxter was the last coach to win silverware with the club. He returns at a time Billiat has faced challenges at the Soweto club where he has failed to reproduce the form which saw him win a treble of individual awards in May 2016.

The awards included the top gong of Footballer of the Year. However all that came during his days at Sundowns when he was under the guidance of coach Pitso Mosimane.

The Warriors midfielder has to battle to try and regain his form as well as adapting to different coaches and their methodology.

At the Brazilians he worked with legendary coach Mosimane winning back-to-back league trophies. When he joined Amakhosi in June 2018 he began to work with Italian coach Giovanni Solinas who was brought to the club in July shortly after the Amakhosi had swooped on Billiat. Solinas regarded Khama highly and believed he was the “Lionel Messi” of his team.

He was once quoted by the South African media praising the Zimbabwean midfielder who had quickly settled at the club and had contributed a number of goals and assists.

“Barcelona play with 10 players plus Messi. Kaizer Chiefs play with 10 players plus Billiat” Solinas told the media.

‘‘Billiat is the best player in the PSL. He’s a top-class player in my opinion. Maybe someone may disagree but in my personal opinion he’s an unbelievable player.

‘‘A fantastic player.

“He’s a player that makes the difference. He’s a player that’s not for the PSL sorry guys. This player is for Europe.”

Solinas though lasted just five months.

Kaizer Chiefs then hired Ernest Middendorp who took charge of the team from 2018 to 2020.

The German mentor however did not have a good relationship with Billiat.

The supporters were frustrated as their coach kept subjecting the Zimbabwean the highest-paid player in the league to the bench. The breakdown in the relationship further affected the Warriors midfielder’s performances.

When the club were on the verge of clinching the 2019/2020 league title Middendorp appeared to be was once quoted backing Billiat.

“We know it hasn’t been a great season for Khama but everybody knows that he has huge potential and we can only support him and put him in the next movement and expect that he can do better” Middendorp said.

However he was fired after the club were beaten to the title by Sundowns on the last day of the season. Billiat scored three goals during that season. Baxter who once coached Warriors skipper Knowledge Musona at the Amakhosi won two League and Cup doubles in 2012/2013 and 2014/2015.

Warriors team manager Wellington Mpandare said they are hoping Baxter will bring the best out of Billiat.

“We are hoping for the best. Since he now has a new coach we will be hoping for a positive change in his career’’ he said.

‘‘Hopefully Baxter will bring the best out of Khama he is a star and he can do more in the field. He is currently recovering from the injuries and once he’s fit he will be back to show his skills on the field.

‘‘Baxter will bring out the best in him even more than we can ever anticipate.

“He has always delivered for the Warriors we have so much faith in him a fit Khama benefits Chiefs and Zimbabwe.’’",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzb3V0aGFmcmljYW4uY29tL3Nwb3J0L3NvY2Nlci9wc2wtc291dGgtYWZyaWNhL2thaXplci1jaGllZnMtc3Rhci1wcmFpc2VzLW5hbWliaWEtY29tcGF0cmlvdHMtcGV0ZXItc2hhbHVsaWxlLWRlb24taG90dG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Kaizer Chiefs star praises Namibia compatriots Shalulile and Hotto,"Peter Shalulile of Mamelodi Sundowns during the DStv Premiership 2020/21 match between Mamelodi Sundowns and Baroka at Loftus Versfeld Stadium Pretoria on 17 February 2021 ©Samuel Shivambu/Sports Inc

Shalulile won the DStv Premiership Player of the Season and DStv Premiership Players’ Player of the Year after helping Mamelodi Sundowns to their fourth consecutive PSL title with 15 goals from 26 appearances in his maiden season at the club.

Hotto meanwhile was instrumental in Orlando Pirates winning the MTN8 and breaking the Buccaneers’ long-standing trophy drought.

Nauseb says the duo have made Namibia proud.

“First of all I just want to say congratulations to Deon Hotto for winning the last man standing I want to say congratulations to Peter Shalulile for winning the PSL Player of the season and Players’ Player of the season” Nauseb told Kickoff.

“My brother this is a big achievement not only for them but for the country itself and the teams that they are playing for. You know these guys have worked very hard obviously. And you know as a professional footballer you play to achieve something. And in your first season at a top club like Mamelodi Sundowns you perform the way you perform.

“Obviously you wanna top it up cherry on top you want to win the league. Obviously you want top it up by winning an award and he has done it you know. So I’m very very honoured to coach them at the national team and privileged to work with them because they are talent. Last time we had a chat he said ‘Coach I’m gonna push all the way’.”

That's the view of money managers who see huge pent-up demand from wealthy seniors for medical services and luxury goods. They also expect that the forced adoption of the Internet by older people during lockdown will open up this demographic permanently to e-commerce companies and social networks.

The number of people aged 65 and over is projected to double to more 1.5 billion by 2050 greatly increasing their economic impact. The total spending power of the older population globally was about US$8.4 trillion (S$11.1 trillion) in 2020 according to World Data Lab. That's expected to grow to US$14 trillion over the next decade.

""The pandemic has accelerated many of the issues related to aging populations and has highlighted the urgency of resolving them"" said Mr Christopher Rossbach chief investment officer at J. Stern. ""We think they will be significant drivers for growth and investment.""

Underpinning the thesis are global fertility rates that are forecast to keep falling as life expectancy rises even as the virus takes a staggering human toll. China's decision in May to allow three-child families may have only limited impact on the ageing trend in the most populous country.

Here are some key focuses of investors who argue that the ageing theme will be even more important as economies move past the pandemic.

Pent-up medical demand

From cancer screening to hip replacements and cataract surgery countless medical procedures have been postponed since the virus took hold. As this changes global healthcare spending is projected to bounce back in 2021 rising 5.8 per cent to US$8.8 trillion according to IHS Markit.

Mr Rossbach expects shares of medical device manufacturers to benefit and cited Thermo Fisher Scientific Medtronic Becton Dickinson and Alcon.

Shares of all four companies have underperformed the global stock benchmark so far this year.

Mirabaud Asset Management also likes Medtronic as well as Edwards Lifesciences for exposure to the cardiovascular diseases sector said global equities head Anu Narula.

Hearing aids are another market hurt by fewer in-person consultations with Morgan Stanley estimating sales will normalise this year following a 15 per cent decline in the market in 2020. Among businesses in this field it has an overweight recommendation on Copenhagen-listed GN Store Nord and equal-weight on Demant which have both surged this year.

""The large contingent of developed countries that have universal health coverage is being joined by an increasing number of developing markets that are establishing and/or expanding universal health-care systems especially in emerging Asian markets"" said Mirabaud's Mr Narula.

Yearning for luxury and travel

As well as long-delayed holidays the travel sector is poised to pick up with support from cashed-up seniors. ""Older or richer people tend to want to visit relatives more"" said Mr Sanjiv Bhatia founder of Pembroke Emerging Markets.

Mr Rossbach also has his eye on a rebound in luxury spending with LVMH and liquor makers Pernod Ricard and Diageo among his preferred reopening bets.

""A general point is that as people age their purchasing power increases and they become more concerned with quality not quantity of their consumption"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Warren Buffett is being cast as the face of billionaire greed after ProPublica reported this week that he pays very little in federal income taxes relative to his vast wealth.

However the investor's minimal tax bill seems far less outrageous when viewed in the context of his modest lifestyle philanthropic efforts the nature of his company and its shareholders his calls to raise taxes on the wealthy and his refusal to use popular tax loopholes.

The case against Buffett

ProPublica analyzed leaked copies of Buffett's tax returns between 2014 and 2018 and found the Berkshire Hathaway CEO paid just $24 million in federal income taxes on $125 million of reported income. The non-profit publication emphasized how little tax he paid by pointing out that his net worth grew by an estimated $24 billion in that five-year period.

""No one among the 25 wealthiest avoided as much tax as Buffett the grandfatherly centibillionaire"" ProPublica declared.

Politicians including Sen. Chris Murphy Sen. Bernie Sanders Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Pramila Jayapal rushed to condemn Buffett and his fellow billionaires calling for heftier taxes on the super rich and the closure of loopholes in tax laws.

ProPublica highlighted Buffett's two main strategies to minimize his income and therefore his taxes. The investor keeps over 99% of his wealth in Berkshire stock — which isn't taxed until sold — and his company doesn't pay a dividend which shareholders would have to pay taxes on.

Not a typical billionaire

ProPublica reported that billionaires such as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk paid no federal income taxes in some years partly by taking out loans and deducting the interest paid on them from their incomes. There's no indication that Buffett uses the same tricks; the investor said in 2016 that he has paid taxes every year since 1944.

Bezos is reportedly building a yacht so large that it comes with a support yacht while Musk previously boasted a real-estate portfolio valued at north of $100 million — although he appears to have sold most of it to fund his dream of colonizing Mars.

The 90-year-old Buffett lives far less extravagantly. He resides in the same house in Omaha Nebraska that he bought for less than $32000 in 1958 ($290000 in today's dollars). He grabs breakfast at McDonald's on his daily drive to Berkshire headquarters guzzles Coca-Cola and snacks on See's Candies. He treats himself with an occasional trip to Dairy Queen and entertains himself by playing online bridge.

The investor doesn't use a company car belong to any clubs where Berkshire pays his dues or commandeer company-owned aircraft for his personal use — even though Berkshire owns NetJets which sells fractional ownership of private jets.

Buffett also buys damaged cars and has them repaired to save money and drove the same Cadillac for eight years until his daughter told him it was embarrassing and badgered him into upgrading to a newer model in 2014.

Notably the Berkshire chief has drawn a $100000 annual salary for the past 40 years — a fraction of the $15 million average pay of S&P 500 CEOs in 2019 — and doesn't receive bonuses or stock options. While some details might be embellished it's clear that he lives a modest lifestyle relative to other billionaires.

Giving it all away

Buffett defended his tiny tax bill in a detailed statement to ProPublica explaining that he's pledged to donate more than 99% of his fortune to good causes. He's donated about half of his Berkshire stock — worth about $100 billion at the current stock price — to five foundations since 2006.

The Berkshire chief told ProPublica that he prefers to hand his money to charitable organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation instead of the government.

""I believe the money will be of more use to society if disbursed philanthropically than if it is used to slightly reduce an ever-increasing US debt"" he said.

Read more: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has $140 billion in cash yet it pulled billions out of Apple Costco and Chevron. Veteran investor Chris Bloomstran explains why the cash pile isn't excessive and the sales made sense.

Buffett aware that skeptics would likely dismiss his charity as a tax write-off added that he's only garnered 50 cents in tax benefits for every $1000 he's donated over the past 15 years.

The investor made a similar point in 2016 after Donald Trump accused him of taking a massive tax deduction. Buffett shared the details of his 2015 tax return highlighting that he paid $1.8 million in federal income tax on $11.6 million of gross income and only deducted $3.5 million for charitable contributions despite giving almost $2.9 billion to charity that year.

Moreover Buffett noted that only $36000 of his $5.5 million in total deductions that year were unrelated to charity or state income taxes. He added that he's never used a ""carryforward"" which allows taxpayers to deduct losses or tax credits from previous years. He pegged his unused carryforward at north of $7 billion in 2010.

Buffett clearly sees charitable donations as a reasonable way to pay fewer taxes and has championed them in the past.

""If you want to give away all of your money it's a terrific tax dodge"" he quipped in response to an investor's question at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in 2010. ""I welcome the questioner or anybody else following my tax dodge example and giving away their money. They will save a lot of taxes that way and the money will probably do a lot of good.""

Buffett is also happy to keep his fortune in Berkshire stock. It signals to investors that he's confident in his company and focused on generating long-term value and means he has more skin in the game than anyone else. Moreover he doesn't feel guilty as his company's success will ultimately benefit society.

""Many shareholders including me enjoy the long-term buildup in value knowing that it is destined for philanthropy not consumption or dynastic aspirations"" he told ProPublica.

Buffett also explained that Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend because its shareholders overwhelmingly voted against one in 2014. They prefer Buffett to allocate Berkshire's profits across the conglomerate and use them to buy quality stocks and businesses instead of returning cash to them. Buffett also views buybacks as superior to dividends for several reasons not just tax efficiency.

Buffett wants higher taxes

While some billionaires complain of excessive taxes on the wealthy Buffett has called for higher taxes on the richest 1% of Americans as well as changes to the tax code to prevent tax avoidance.

The investor highlighted more than a decade ago how ridiculous it was that his secretary paid a higher tax rate than him. The revelation spurred President Barack Obama to pursue the removal of tax breaks for the wealthy and name his ultimately unsuccessful bill after Buffett. ""If all the diseases have been taken I'll take a tax"" the investor joked at the time.

Buffett has also called for policies to reduce income inequality such as expanding the earned-income tax credit to help workers get ahead. He once testified to Congress that estate taxes should be higher and better enforced he told ProPublica but his ""persuasive powers proved to be limited.""

Overall it's not surprising that under the current tax rules a 90-year-old who keeps his fortune in his company's stock and funds a simple lifestyle with a modest income doesn't pay a lot of tax.

It seems harsh to go after Buffett when he's giving away virtually all of his money calling for higher taxes on the wealthy refusing to use several loopholes to pay less tax and running a company where holding its stock for the long term and not paying a dividend makes perfect sense.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xMS13YXlzLXdhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LWxpdmVzLTIyMDAxNDAyMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 Ways Warren Buffett Lives Frugally,"Steve Pope / Getty Images

Despite his roughly $78 billion net worth according to Forbes the sixth-wealthiest man in the world enjoys a life of simple taste frugal living and generous philanthropy. Here's a look at Warren Buffett's tips for living frugally.

Last updated: May 20 2021

Warren Buffett house.

1. Warren Buffett’s House Is the Same One He Bought in 1958

Billionaires live in mansions right? Not Buffett.

He lives in the same residence in Omaha Neb. that he bought in 1958 for $31500 the equivalent of roughly $285000 in 2020 dollars. Buffett has no intention of putting his own home up for sale. ""I wouldn't trade it for anything"" he told CNBC earlier this year.

In today's money Buffett would have paid about $43 per square foot for the 6570-square-foot home. But these days the home is worth about $161 per square foot according to the home's current value listed by the tax assessor's office in Douglas County Nebraska where Buffett lives.

If you want to live like Buffett consider buying less home than you can afford. Instead of paying pricey mortgage payments you'll be able to put more of your money toward savings retirement or vacations.

And if you must take out a loan perhaps get a 30-year mortgage -- it's ""the best instrument in the world"" Buffett told CNBC. In fact Buffett took out a 30-year mortgage in 1971 when he bought a vacation home in Laguna Beach California.

""If you're wrong and rates go to 2 percent which I don't think they will you pay it off"" he said. ""It's a one-way renegotiation. It is an incredibly attractive instrument for the homeowner and you've got a one-way bet.""

2. Buffett Starts His Day With a Cheap Breakfast

You might assume billionaires brunch at the most extravagant restaurants ordering eggs Benedict and bottomless mimosas. Or they hire a personal chef who can whip up whatever and whenever they want -- right?

Wrong. Adopting Buffett's lifestyle doesn't include paying high prices for daily gourmet French toast prepared in the comforts of your own home.

Story continues

When it comes to food the billionaire investor has been known to save money by taking the fast-food route. In fact he might kick off his day with a trip to McDonald's during his five-minute drive to work reports CNBC.

If he's feeling rich he'll splurge by spending $3.89 on a bacon egg and cheese biscuit sandwich. If the market's down he might spend $3.19 on a sausage egg and cheese sandwich instead. On a really bad day he buys two sausage patties for $2.38 puts them together and washes it down with a Coke he pours himself.

Buffett also is known to opt for cheap food when he's on the road -- but forget the cholesterol-soaked bacon and eggs at a local restaurant. Buffett's travel breakfast might consist of a pack of Oreos his friend Bill Gates -- yes his good buddy is the Microsoft founder -- wrote on his blog.

""One thing that was surprising to learn about Warren is that he has basically stuck to eating what he liked when he was 6 years old"" Gates wrote. ""He did move past baby food of course but he mostly eats hamburgers ice cream and Coke.""

Buffett explained his diet in a 2015 interview with Fortune: ""I checked the actuarial tables and the lowest death rate is among 6-year-olds. So I decided to eat like a 6-year-old. It's the safest course I can take.""

3. Buffett Buys Reduced-Price Cars

Although some CEOs drive around in million-dollar cars you'll likely find Buffett driving something much more modest.

In a BBC documentary his daughter Susie Buffett said he bought cars that he could get at reduced prices -- like those that had been damaged by hail. The cars were fixed and didn't look hail-damaged and became a regular part of the Buffett lifestyle.

""You've got to understand he keeps cars until I tell him 'This is getting embarrassing -- time for a new car'"" said his daughter in the documentary.

Buffett also told Forbes in 2014 about his car-buying habits -- or lack thereof. ""The truth is I only drive about 3500 miles a year so I will buy a new car very infrequently"" he said.

Remember this the next time you're in the market for a car: Cars tend to depreciate quickly so it can be better for your finances if you try to keep your well-working car for as long as possible -- or at least opt to buy a used car instead of new.

4. Buffett Enjoys Affordable Hobbies

A commitment to live like Warren Buffett doesn't mean all work and no play. After all even billionaires have hobbies. But compared to other famous CEOs investors and entrepreneurs Buffett's hobbies are much more affordable. For example he enjoys playing bridge.

""If I play bridge and a naked woman walks by I don't even see her"" laughed Buffett during a CBS News ""Sunday Morning"" interview. Yep Buffett is a self-proclaimed bridge addict and you might even catch him playing the game about 8 hours a week according to a Washington Post interview from 2017.

""I one time said that I wouldn't mind going to jail if I had the right three cellmates so we can play bridge all the time"" he also said in the interview.

When Buffett's not busy being a business mogul you might find him strumming his ukulele and singing as well. He's played for investors and at charity events. A video of him playing the instrument with Gates even went viral after it was posted on Gates' blog in 2016.

5. Buffett Treats His Friends Well but Not Extravagantly

What do you give a friend who's also a billionaire? Buffett's long-standing friendship with Gates is legendary. In honor of Buffett's 90th birthday the Microsoft magnate explained on his blog what's kept their friendship strong over the years:

""Of all the things I’ve learned from Warren the most important thing might be what friendship is all about"" Gates wrote. ""A person that I admire as well as like — that's the perfect description of how I feel about Warren. Happy birthday my friend.""

And Buffett didn't earn Gates' gratitude through grandiose and expensive gestures. Instead it's simply about how he treats others. In his 2016 blog post Gates gave examples of how Buffett is a kind and thoughtful friend such as driving personally to the airport to pick up Gates whenever he's in Buffett's hometown town calling frequently and sending news clippings by mail that he thinks Gates and his wife will enjoy.

Those special touches that mean a lot to friends just might be the best takeaway for those seeking to live the Warren Buffett lifestyle.

6. Buffett Used a Nokia Flip Phone Long After Smartphones Existed

Buffett likely won't be shelling out big money for the newest iPhone even though he's now using one. The billionaire revealed in a February 2020 CNBC Squawk Box interview that he has been given several iPhones including by Tim Cook.

He stated the Nokia flip phone which he had held on to for years is permanently gone and he now uses the newest model iPhone which was an iPhone 11 at the time of the interview.

While it's tempting to always splurge on the latest technology take a page from Buffett's book and only upgrade your phone when you really need to. If you insist on buying the latest iPhone to hit the market look for other ways to save on your phone expenses such as using a no-contract phone plan or buying a family plan to share data.

7. Buffett Doesn’t Splurge on Designer Suits

Buffett shuns high-end designer suits. Instead he exclusively wears suits created by a Chinese sewing entrepreneur named Madam Li whom he met in 2007.

""They fit perfectly"" he said of the suits in a 2017 CNBC interview. ""We get compliments on them. It's been a long time since I got compliments on how I looked but since I am wearing Madame Li's suits I get compliments all the time.""

The takeaway: Opt for quality goods that will last you a long time rather than buying something just because it has a brand name attached to it.

8. Buffett Clips Coupons

Buffett proves that even billionaires still appreciate an opportunity to save money. In Bill and Melinda Gates' 2017 annual letter Bill recalled a trip he took with the investor during which Buffett paid for their fast-food lunch using coupons. He even provided photographic proof of this.

""Remember the laugh we had when we traveled together to Hong Kong and decided to get lunch at McDonald’s? You offered to pay dug into your pocket and pulled out … coupons!"" Bill wrote. ""Melinda just found this photo of me and 'the big spender.' It reminded us how much you value a good deal.""

Save on your next purchase -- even if it's something as inexpensive as a McDonald's meal -- by using applicable discounts which you can easily find on online coupon sites.

9. Buffett Has Worked in the Same Office Building for More Than 50 Years

Buffett has remained in the same office building since he joined Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s.

""It's a different sort of place"" Buffett said of the company's Omaha headquarters in the 2017 HBO documentary ""Becoming Warren Buffett"" CNBC reports. ""We have 25 people in the office and if you go back it's the exact same 25. The exact same ones. We don't have any committees at Berkshire. We don't have a public relations department. We don't have investor relations. We don't have a general counsel. We just don't go for anything that people do just as a matter of form.""

Even if you're not a business owner you can still benefit from Buffett's way of thinking. It boils down to the old saying: If it ain't broke don't fix it.

10. Buffett Thinks Outside the Box To Save Money

In Roger Lowenstein's biography of the businessman ""Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist"" the author says that after Buffett's first child was born he converted a dresser drawer into a space for the baby to sleep instead of spending money on a bassinet reports Forbes. When it came to the family's second child he borrowed a crib rather than buying one.

Perhaps making your baby sleep in a drawer seems a little extreme but it's just an example of thinking outside the box. Use resources that are already available to you to prevent unnecessary spending.

11. Buffett Values Relationships Over Material Things

Buffett explained his choice to live frugally during a 2009 Q&A session he conducted with a group of business school students.

""You can’t buy health and you can’t buy love"" said Buffett according to the Underground Value blog. ""I’m a member of every golf club that I want to be a member of [...] I’d rather play golf here with people I like than at the fanciest golf course in the world. [...] I’m not interested in cars and my goal is not to make people envious.""

And in a 2017 interview with People Susie Buffett said of her father: ""...it’s really true that he does not care about having a bunch of money."" Instead she said he emphasizes family.

“I don’t think people realize he’s got a bunch of great-grandchildren and he could tell you everything about what they’re all doing. He knows every one of those kids and he knows about their lives” she said.

Mr. Buffett is neither Zuckerbergian messiah nor Musky provocateur neither Bezosist space cadet nor Sacklerian undertaker. He is or seems to be quiet humble indifferent to money philanthropic and critical of the system that allowed him to rise. Years ago a proposed tax increase was named after him.

It’s easy for people to think: If only members of the Sackler family were more like Mr. Buffett imagine how many lives would have been saved. If only the billionaires who haven’t signed the Giving Pledge would give away as much as Mr. Buffett has pledged to imagine the impact on the world. If only more billionaires would make use of the system without feeling the need to pervert it so many of our troubles would vanish.

So I regret to inform you that Mr. Buffett is actually the most dangerous kind of billionaire we have. The worst billionaires are the Good Billionaires. The sort who make it seem like the problem is the distortion of the system when in fact the problem is the system.

Actually malevolent and disastrously negligent plutocrats get most of the attention. And when we hear about these Bad Billionaire exploits it is possible to conclude from them that the system needs better policing updated regulations and maybe slightly higher taxes. The system needs to be made to work again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzEyLzMtZGl2aWRlbmQtc3RvY2tzLXlvdS1jYW4tdHJ1c3QtdG8tcGF5LXlvdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Dividend Stocks You Can Trust to Pay You,"These three dividend stocks have shown consistent earnings growth while increasing their payouts annually.

When searching for dividend stocks there are a few things you want to consider. Of course you want a company that has an attractive dividend yield and anything above 2% to 3% is generally considered to be pretty good. High yield isn't everything though -- you also want to make sure the company has a history of steady earnings growth. Increasing profits provide a company with stability which allows it to not only make consistent dividend payments but also to raise those payments on a consistent basis.

These traits are ideal in dividend stocks and they're why Arbor Realty Trust (ABR 0.30%) Cincinnati Financial (CINF 0.20%) and United Bankshares (UBSI -0.06%) are all great dividend stocks you can trust to pay you year after year.

Arbor Realty: A REIT with a high yield

Arbor Realty is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on the multifamily housing sector with 81% of its total loan portfolio made up of these loans. The multifamily housing space has high barriers to entry which gives Arbor Realty a competitive advantage and provides stability to its earnings.

Multifamily loans tend to be less cyclical than single-family housing which can fluctuate depending on market conditions. In times of recession individuals are less likely to take out mortgages for single-family units. However housing is always in need and those individuals would be more likely to look toward multifamily units to rent. That's why multifamily housing tends to weather recessionary conditions better than single-family housing.

Not only that but multifamily loans are protected against prepayment. This means you don't see a big rush of refinancing in the space when rates are lowered. As a result earnings don't see such large fluctuations as single-family real estate companies.

Arbor Realty has done a good job of growing its loan portfolio which is up 29% on a compounded annual basis since 2015. This strong portfolio growth has resulted in net interest income growth of 15% compounded annually and 29% compounded gains in net income since 2015. Thanks to its stellar growth rate Arbor Realty has increased its dividend payout for nearly a decade straight and pays investors a 7.1% yield to boot -- making it a high-yield dividend stock you can trust.

Cincinnati Financial: A Dividend King

Insurance companies are another good source of income stocks. That's because insurance is a relatively straightforward business -- companies underwrite policies and if they manage risk properly they make an underwriting profit. With these excess profits companies put the money to work in the financial market to generate some form of investment income. Insurance companies can be a cash cow and a great source of yield in your portfolio as well which is why Warren Buffett has often called the insurance industry Berkshire Hathaway's ""most important sector.""

Cincinnati Financial is a property and casualty insurer that has increased its dividend payout for 61 years straight. This makes it a member of the exclusive Dividend Kings group of stocks. A Dividend King is a company that has increased its dividend payout for at least 50 years straight and only 27 companies currently hold the title.

The insurer has managed to increase dividends for so many years thanks to its capital management and underwriting profitable policies. Last year the company posted a combined ratio of 98.1%. Combined ratio is an important measure of profitability in the insurance industry; anything under 100% means you are earning an underwriting profit. In the past five years Cincinnati Financial has achieved an average combined ratio of 96.1%.

As a result it has seen its earned premiums grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6.2% -- above average for its industry. Continued growth in premiums coupled with underwriting profitable policies make Cincinnati Financial another trustworthy income stock that yields investors a solid 2.1%.

United Bankshares: The unheralded income stock

United Bankshares isn't a Dividend Aristocrat but it's not for a lack of increasing its dividends. The regional bank has raised its dividend payout for 47 years straight. The only reason it's not included with the Dividends Aristocrats is because it's not an S&P 500 company -- making this regional bank an under-the-radar dividend stalwart.

Last year it increased net income by 11.1% despite the pandemic. This was boosted by its mortgage banking activity as well as its expansion into the Carolinas with its purchase of Carolina Financial.

In the first quarter this year interest income was up 14% compared to last year to $206 million. The bank was boosted by a drastic reduction in provision for credit losses as well as income from mortgage banking activities. This helped net income increase 166% over last year to $107 million.

United Bankshares has done a stellar job of increasing net interest income and net income over the past decade as well achieving compound annual growth rates of 10% and 14% respectively. Not only that but it pays out a solid 3.7% dividend yield making it another solid dividend stock you can trust.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYml0Y29pbi1pcy1sZWdhbC10ZW5kZXItaW4tZWwtc2FsdmFkb3Itd2hhdC1kb2VzLWl0LW1lYW4tZm9yLXRoZS1icm9hZGVyLWNyeXB0by1tYXJrZXQtc29tZS1idWxscy10aGluay1pdC1jb3VsZC1iZS1odWdlLTExNjIzMjY3OTMx0gGqAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvYml0Y29pbi1pcy1sZWdhbC10ZW5kZXItaW4tZWwtc2FsdmFkb3Itd2hhdC1kb2VzLWl0LW1lYW4tZm9yLXRoZS1icm9hZGVyLWNyeXB0by1tYXJrZXQtc29tZS1idWxscy10aGluay1pdC1jb3VsZC1iZS1odWdlLTExNjIzMjY3OTMx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bitcoin is legal tender in El Salvador.

Find out more about how we test .

HyperX Pulsefire Haste specs Price: $49.99

DPI: Up to 16000

Buttons: 6

Size: 2.62 x 4.8 x 1.5 inches

Weight: 2.08 ounces

Wireless gaming mice are slowly phasing out those permanently attached to a lengthy cable. Thanks to incredibly low latency easy portability and stupidly high polling rates gamers are shifting their sights away from wired mice. Now HyperX is bucking the trend by making a great case to own a tethered gaming accessory.



It’s hard not to think of the great Mohammed Ali’s famed boxing analogy when using the HyperX Pulsefire Haste as the wired gaming mouse certainly floats like a butterfly on a mousepad and has clickers that sting like a bee. You’ll find this isn’t just a mouse for elite gamers it fits the bill for office use too.



While HyperX’s honeycomb-patterned Pulsefire Haste deserves a spot in our best gaming mouse list it has a couple of shortcomings that may not appeal to the avid gamer. In fact those with a strong case of trypophobia (a fear of closely packed holes) may immediately be turned off by its design. If that doesn’t bother you read on.

HyperX Pulsefire Haste price

The HyperX Pulsefire Haste isn’t the most affordable gaming mouse on the market but compared to other elite gaming mice it’s on the edge of being budget-friendly. On HyperX’s official website  the gaming mouse is priced at $49.99 or £49.99. With the current exchange rate as of writing those in the U.K. will pay an equivalent of $70. Clearly U.S. customers get a much better deal.

(Image credit: Future)

That said other retailers such as Amazon offer the mouse for a similar cost. A majority of wired gaming mice including the Corsair Sabre RGB Pro  cost $60/£60 to $80/£80.

HyperX Pulsefire Haste design

Without the hex-shaped holes the HyperX Pulsefire Haste has a one-note design. It is a symmetrically shaped wired right-hand mouse with a matte-black plastic chassis and RGB strips on either side of its scroll wheel. So far so standard.

(Image credit: Future)

The Pulsefire Haste’s six buttons are all where they are supposed to be and include two narrow clickers on the left side a center DPI button above a clickable scroll wheel and the left and right-click buttons. It uses TTC Golden micro switches rated for 60 million clicks which should last more than a few years even if you’re using the Pulsefire Haste for both gaming and work day in and day out.



Underneath you’ll find four 100% virgin-grade white PTFE skates which make it easy to glide the mouse across a mousepad or even a plain table. While I couldn’t imagine the skates wearing out anytime soon HyperX includes an extra set of replacement skates for good measure.

(Image credit: Future)

The Pulsefire Haste’s main draw is of course its hex shell design. The honeycomb-like formation covers a majority of the mouse meaning you can see right through to check out what makes it tick. I was worried that the naked design would make the mouse look and feel cheap but the hollow shell lends to the Haste’s striking appeal.

(Image credit: Future)

HyperX didn’t carve out these holes purely for stylish design however. The holes contribute to the Haste’s ultra-lightweight frame which comes in at 2.1 ounces (59 grams). When using it its lightness makes me forget it’s attached to a 1.8-meter (5.9 foot) cable and moving the mouse around is effortless. With dimensions of 2.6 x 4.8 x 1.5 inches the Haste has a short narrow frame. For gamers with large hands this can affect the grip style used.

HyperX Pulsefire Haste comfort

The HyperX Pulsefire Haste is a comfortable gaming mouse to use although it favours a claw grip over a palm grip.



The Pulsefire Haste’s frame has a properly shaped hump for the base of your thumb and the middle of your palm to rest on but I found the bottom of my hand dragging along my mousepad when using a palm grip. This can become uncomfortable over long periods and ultimately forced me to switch to a claw grip. That said this was never an issue when using bigger gaming mice such as the Razer Naga Pro .

(Image credit: Future)

I was happy switching to a claw grip during work and play sessions as the Haste works best this way. The holes offer better ventilation and airflow than any other mouse I’ve used which meant my hand never felt grimey after playing PC games for one too many hours. I thought the holes would be a trap for dust and gunk but in my time using it I never felt like I needed to give the mouse a deep clean.



As for the clickers each button feels precise and satisfying especially the two primary buttons. The on-the-fly DPI button was also in easy reach while not being so prominent to accidentally be pressed during intense gameplay sessions.

(Image credit: Future)

HyperX also includes grip tape for the Pulsefire Haste which I love having the option to use. There’s tape for either side of the mouse and both left and right mouse buttons all with honeycomb-shaped dents to add to the erm buzzing appeal of the mouse. They added a slight boost in grip and comfort. While I didn’t feel the need to keep them on I’m also not a professional esports player. I can see how the grip tape could give gamers an edge so it’s a nice option to have on hand.

HyperX Pulsefire Haste performance

The HyperX Pulsefire Haste boasts a Pixart 3335 optical sensor with customizable DPI settings ranging from 200 DPI to a whopping 16000 DPI at a max speed of 450 inches per second (IPS). This is the standard for some of the best gaming mice on the market today and although the DPI doesn’t go as high as the Razer Basilisk Ultimate ’s 20000 DPI you’ll find a majority of gamers like myself are perfectly happy with a 1000 DPI setting for competitive FPS.



HyperX’s polling rate for all of its gaming mice tops out at 1000Hz per millisecond and this is no different for the Pulsefire Haste. For gaming this delivers fantastic performance for precision accuracy and speed. Other gaming mice will boast up to 8000Hz for a reporting speed of an eighth of one millisecond. In practice you won’t notice the difference so a 1000Hz polling rate is just fine for tracking movements.

(Image credit: Future)

I booted up Valorant to test out the Pulsefire Haste’s performance and was largely impressed by how swift yet accurate each of my shots were. While playing as Cypher placing cameras in my usual spots was a breeze and I finally started opting for sniper rifles in each match as I was achieving a few headshots. Did it earn me the title of MVP? Heck no but I found the Pulsefire Haste boosted my in-game performance. As an added perk I also enjoyed toggling my DPI settings easily with the DPI button.

HyperX Pulsefire Haste features

The Pulsefire Haste packs HyperX’s signature NGENUITY software. After a quick setup I easily customized the gaming mouse to my personal preferences and saved individual profiles thanks to the onboard memory.



There is a variety of RGB lighting effects available (breathing cycle solid) along with a cool “fade” trigger effect. While there are many colors to choose from and speed settings to play around with the glow is subtle as the RGB lighting is limited to the scroll wheel. My fingers always covered my line of sight of the wheel making the RGB effects feel superfluous.

(Image credit: Future)

The rest of the customizable settings more than make up for this however. Each button can be assigned a multitude of functions from multimedia options for controlling volume to Windows shortcuts such as cut copy and paste. Customizable buttons are great for gaming but the Windows shortcuts make the Pulsefire Haste fantastic for the office too.



The NGENUITY software also offers the option to change the on-the-fly DPI setting by the hundreds and you can even add additional levels. The software also lets you adjust the polling rate from 125Hz to 1000Hz but I’d kept it at the optimal speed as it didn’t affect my laptop’s performance.

The 75-inch 8-Series originally listed for $2999 making it one of the more premium models on the market.

But the two-year-old 8-Series has dropped significantly in price. As of this writing you can find the 65Q825 for $1124.99 and the 75Q825 for $1429.99 on clearance discount from Best Buy. That makes the 8-Series 75-inch model cheaper than the 6-Series model of the same size!

It also makes a couple of buying decisions easy. If you need a 55-inch TV due to limits on available space then the TCL 6-Series is your only option. And if your budget trumps all other concerns the 75-inch TCL 8-Series is the more affordable pick.

TCL 6-Series vs. TCL 8-Series: Display

Both the 8-Series and 6-Series feature quantum light emitting diode (QLED) screens with mini-LED backlighting and 120Hz refresh rates. Both also support Dolby Vision HDR10 and HLG (but not HDR10+). As a result both have excellent picture quality. With all those features behind the displays the images on the screen were bright and color rich producing great contrast in dark scenes.

The main difference between the two displays is the number of dimming zones: the 6-Series has up to 240 dimming zones while the 8-Series claims up to 1000 dimming zones. But that's not the whole story. The 8-Series was TCL's first use of mini-LED backlighting technology and there is a marked improvement in the later 6-Series R635 models which also use mini-LED. Most notable is that the 8-Series backlight doesn't do as well in off-angle viewing. That's fine if you're watching by yourself but it's a bigger issue when the family gathers for movie night. The 2020 TCL 6-Series however seemed to have ironed out these issues.

In the lab the 8-Series shows its muscle though the 6-Series is no slouch. The 8-Series reproduced 99.9% of the sRGB color space; however the 6-Series was just as good also scoring 99.9%. The colors on 8-Series are also extremely accurate registering a Delta E of 1.5 one of the lowest scores on the market (lower scores being better). The 6-Series wasn’t quite as good at 2.8 but that’s still very respectable. Both delivered very good lag times — important to gamers playing fast action games — with the 8-Series edging the 6-Series by a nose 20.2 milliseconds to 21.5 milliseconds. If you’re choosing based on test results alone the 8-Series is the one to go with. If real-world performance is your concern the TCL 6-Series actually has the slight edge having worked out the kinks in what was a brand new technology on the 8-Series.

Winner: TCL 6-Series Roku TV (R635)

TCL 6-Series vs. TCL 8-Series: Design

The two TCL TVs are similar in appearance though there are a few differences. The 65-inch 8-Series measures 56.9 x 32.9 x 3.1 inches making it slightly thicker than the 56.9 x 32.9 x 2.8-inch 6-Series.

More significantly the two take different approaches to their stands. The 6-Series uses boomerang feet that are popular on many TVs these days. The 8-Series features an T-shaped stand that attaches to the back. It’s definitely a visual difference but could also be a practical one: if you want to use a soundbar with the 8-Series you’ll need to place it in front of the bar of the “T.” The 8-Series stand makes the footprint with the stand 13.8 inches versus 13.7 inches for the 6-Series. It’s minor thing but could help you decide.

Winner: TCL 6-Series Roku TV (R635)

TCL 6-Series vs. TCL 8-Series: Audio

While we have low expectations for audio coming from thin 4K TVs the 8-Series pleasantly surprised us with its two 15-watt speakers. It produces clear rich tones and decent bass to go along with Dolby Atmos support. The 6-Series isn’t far behind with decent overall sound and clear dialog as well as Dolby Atmos support. But its two 8-watt speakers can’t match the output of the 8-Series.

Winner: TCL 8-Series Roku TV (Q8235)

TCL 6-Series vs. TCL 8-Series: Remote control

(Image credit: TCL)

Since both the 6-Series and 8-Series run Roku TV they both come with a Roku remote and we’re good with that. Roku remotes feel firm in your hand and have a simple layout.

Both remotes include a microphone for voice control. The remote has four quick launch buttons for apps. The 6-Series’s remote has buttons for Netflix Disney plus Hulu and Sling TV while the 8-Series opts for Netflix Hulu ESPN Plus and the Roku channel. You can’t reprogram those Quick Launch buttons unfortunately.

Winner: Tie

TCL 6-Series vs. TCL 8-Series: Roku vs. Roku

TCL partners closely with Roku to provide the interface for these TVs and as a result TCL consistently produces the best Roku TVs on the market. With almost every app available and an intuitive interface Roku TV ranks among the best smart OSes for TVs. Both TVs run Roku TV quickly and the controls are responsive. (Check out The best Roku TVs for more.)

As mentioned the 6-Series and 8-Series come with remotes that support voice control. This lets you search for shows across apps and control some basic functions of the TV like volume. However voice control isn’t as fully featured on Roku as it is on a TV with Alexa or Google Assistant built in. But in this competition it’s a draw.

Winner: Tie

TCL 6-Series vs. TCL 8-Series: Which one wins?

We think the TCL 6-Series Roku TV (R635) is one of the best TV deals around. For the price you get a great display with an excellent experience thanks to Roku TV. In most cases the TCL 6-Series Roku TV (R635) gets our recommendation — it's a better deal for the 65-inch model it's a more current TV and it offers many of the same premium features of the 8-Series with slightly more polish.

But the TCL 8-Series Roku TV (Q8235) may even be a better overall TV with a slightly better display and much better audio. And with current deals it is definitely worth the small premium for the 65-inch — and the 75-inch is cheaper than the 6-Series!

Regardless of which TCL TV you pick you’ll go home with an excellent TV at a competitive price.

Aduhelm by Biogen Source: Biogen

The FDA's approval of Biogen 's Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm was a landmark moment in the life of Dr. Paul Aisen. The director of the Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute at USC has spent the past three decades focused on treating the neurodegenerative disease and in recent years helped shepherd this particular drug through the various phases of clinical trials. But sitting in his sun-drenched office in San Diego in early June he felt slightly confounded by the manner in which the Food and Drug Administration early June approved its use on an ""accelerated"" basis which is usually reserved for cancer medications. This meant its clinical benefits were considered likely but approval for long-term use would be subject to more extensive study in a fourth phase of trials. Highlighting the ""unusual nature"" of the regulator's green light given that an advisory board of experts had strongly and publicly opposed the approval Aisen who works as a paid consultant to Biogen insists there were still ""a lot of questions that I have — that do not yet have answers."" Three members of the FDA panel overseeing research have resigned since the approval this week including Dr. Aaron Kesselheim a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who said in a letter the agency's decision on Biogen ""was probably the worst drug approval decision in recent U.S. history."" Last November in an 8-1 vote that panel said Biogen's late-stage study didn't provide ""strong evidence"" showing that aducanumab effectively treated Alzheimer's; two other panelists said it the data was ""uncertain.""

watch now

While Aisen considers Aduhelm an ""effective treatment"" for a disease that affects millions of Americans he also has concerns about the FDA ruling's implications for the panoply of other potential treatment options that are in late-stage development. One immediate challenge facing other teams working on a wider Alzheimer's drug pipeline he said in a recent video call would be to retain participants in ongoing trials let alone attract new ones. ""In most cases"" he explained many Alzheimer's sufferers will drop out of other drug studies to pursue treatment with the newly approved Aduhelm. Their departures would make trial data for those alternative drugs less useful even though the drugs in question might one day prove safer more effective or more appropriate for different stages of the disease's progression. But perhaps perversely he still considers Aduhelm's approval ""a boost towards those efforts — a strong boost.""

Over 6 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's

In recent years some major drug companies abandoned efforts to research brain diseases including Pfizer and Boehringer Ingelheim in 2018 — in fact Biogen had given up on Aduhelm at one point during the clinical trials in 2019 before reversing its decision— after decades of failure in search of a breakthrough. The controversy surrounding the Biogen drug including its potential cost comes against a landscape of massive unmet need for dementia treatment and a disease that costs the U.S. as much as $259 billion annually. More than 6 million Americans have Alzheimer's or another form of dementia according to estimates from the Alzheimer's Association and by 2050 that number could reach over 12 million people at a cost of $1 trillion annually. That is why some dementia drug experts are focusing on the renewed attention and fresh financing rather than the potential negatives from the Biogen approval according to Dr. Jeffrey Cummings a neurologist at the University of Nevada Las Vegas who publishes an annual review of the Alzheimer's drug development pipeline. His research consistently showed the drug-failure rate at 99.6 percent before the Biogen approval a stark contrast to the 1 out of every 5 cancer drugs (20%) that are successful. Cummings says any negative side effect for other drug trials in the short term would be ""overcome if anything by the increased interest that companies and venture capital and biotech has once they see that there is a way to get an approval for a particular disease."" In recent history The National Institutes of Health spent two to three times more on heart disease and cancer research than on dementia while a lack of qualified participants for clinical trials also slowed progress.

Next in the dementia drug pipeline

For the handful of other developmental Alzheimer's drugs hoping to clear those same regulatory hurdles and prove their efficacy — Eli Lilly 's donanemab Roche's gantenerumab and Eisei's lecanemab among them — there may be a silver lining to ceding first-mover advantage to Aduhelm. After decades of expensive but thus far largely fruitless research trials the CEO of pharma giant Eli Lilly David Ricks said his firm was ""getting closer and closer to the goal"" after a positive set of Phase Two results for its offering donanemab. Speaking at CNBC's Healthy Returns Summit in May a month before the FDA's approval for rival Biogen's Aduhelm he said his team felt ""good about the probability of success"" and said he wanted to explore an ""accelerated"" route too using what he called ""adaptative pathways at the FDA to consider looking at data sooner"" that ""should be applied in a serious and widespread condition like Alzheimer's."" However he acknowledged that recruitment for the next phase of trials required a significantly larger cohort of participants and given that it would last 18 months he did not expect a new approved product before late 2023 at the earliest.

watch now

Several experts told CNBC the Biogen drug's unique threshold for regulatory approval with treatment potential seeming to trump uncertain real-world benefits could reinvigorate efforts by competitors like Lilly who are focused on developing drugs that rely on relatively similar techniques. Aduhelm's own clinical trial data had shown the drug successfully targets and clears out clusters of a specific type of protein that are believed by many researchers to be responsible for Alzheimer's. But it offered insufficient evidence to prove the drug provides patients with cognitive benefits.

Debate over targeting beta amyloid formations

Known among scientists as aducanumab it works by offering an array of identical antibodies that are cloned from white blood cells. These antibodies are chosen for their targeting abilities since they can identify specific proteins called beta amyloids that have constructed particular formations in the body. There is extensive evidence suggesting that these beta amyloid formations also known as ""pathological aggregates"" or ""plaques"" are a major driver of Alzheimer's disease though the exact causal mechanisms are still not fully understood according to Christian Pike of USC's Leonard Davis School of Gerontology. Nonetheless he says the antibodies can help prevent these plaques from forming before directing other particles to break them apart a process that's clearly identifiable in before-and-after neural imaging. For an analogy it may be helpful to think of the beta amyloid proteins as young people walking around a city over the course of the day where the city is the human body and the day is a human lifespan. In certain cities as afternoon turns into evening individual young people start to congregate and some of those congregations can turn toxic and begin to cause problems. The antibodies delivered by Aduhelm act like law enforcement officers arriving on the scene identifying troublesome gatherings surrounding them separating them then ordering bystanders to make the young people disperse. ""If you say 'Well hey the FDA is buying into this general concept'"" said Pike in a phone call ""if we can remove beta amyloid from the brains of persons that are affected by the disease even with limited evidence of cognitive benefits"" he continued ""there might be a variety of different therapies that would qualify under these types of criteria."" The long line of past failures from within the Alzheimer's pipeline that targeted beta amyloid will continue to weigh on optimism until conclusive proof is generated — something this week's controversy over the first new Alzheimer's drug approved in decades indicates has not been done yet. ""What we're going to find out from the use of this drug one way or the other is whether or not the amyloid clearing hypothesis is correct"" says USC health economist Darius Lakdawalla who argues the continued trialing of Biogen's drug will prove useful to that confirmatory effort. ""If it is correct then I think it opens the door for a lot of innovation a lot of drug candidates that are going to try to clear amyloid in the future pursuit of that hypothesis.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMTIvaGVhbHRoL2ZkYS13b29kY29jay1hZ2VuZGEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,F.D.A. Still Lacks a Permanent Commissioner,"The contested decision by the Food and Drug Administration earlier this week to approve a drug to treat Alzheimer’s has renewed concerns about the Biden administration’s prolonged delay in choosing a permanent commissioner to lead the agency.

It has also once again exposed the sharp divide between supporters and detractors of the F.D.A.’s interim commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock the longtime chief of the agency’s drug division who has seemed to be on an extended tryout for the top post.

To Alzheimer’s patient advocacy groups which had called for Dr. Woodcock’s nomination back in February when the application for the drug aducanumab by Biogen was pending its approval was a sign that they backed the right candidate.

But Dr. Woodcock’s decision to allow the accelerated approval of aducanumab over the overwhelming opposition of the agency’s own independent advisory panel has provided further ammunition to her critics including a group of leading Senate Democrats who consider her too close to the pharmaceutical industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFtZXJpY2FuY29uc2VydmF0aXZlLmNvbS90aGUtcmVndWxhdG9yeS1jYXB0dXJlLW9mLXRoZS1mZGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Regulatory Capture of the FDA,"This week three members of an 11 member FDA advisory committee of experts resigned in protest over the FDA’s approval of Aduhelm (aducanumab) for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. These resignations are extremely unusual but in this case understandable.

Aduhelm was approved by the agency despite the fact that both pivotal trials were stopped early because they were judged to be futile the FDA’s own statistical reviewer did not support approval and the FDA advisory committee reviewing the application voted it down overwhelmingly. Additionally in a survey conducted by Endpoint News whose readership is heavily weighted to biopharmaceutical industry staffers and executives over 80 percent consider the approval to be a bad idea. So how did Aduhelm’s June 7 approval happen? Two words: regulatory capture.

Regulatory capture is defined as when a supposedly objective regulatory agency ends up promoting the ends of the industries they are regulating. The FDA has been captured for quite a while. In a 2016 study published in the British Medical Journal the majority of the FDA’s hematology-oncology reviewers who left the agency ended up working or consulting for the biopharmaceutical industry. In another investigation by Science magazine 11 of 16 FDA reviewers who worked on 28 drug approvals and subsequently left the agency are working or consulting for the companies they recently regulated.

For example Dr. Thomas Laughren a former director of psychiatric products for the FDA who had a history of less than objective actions while at the agency left the FDA in 2012 and started a consultancy to help companies focused on psychiatric products navigate the regulator’s approval process. One of these companies is AstraZeneca maker of Seroquel. He was instrumental in getting Seroquel a broader approval in 2009 going so far as to personally minimize questions about cardiac risk related to the drug at an FDA advisory committee meeting. After approval however there was no hiding from these side effects and a warning label had to be added to the drug in 2011.

Back in 2016 there was a major controversy related to the actions of Dr. Janet Woodcock the current acting FDA commissioner while she was the director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). The FDA at the behest of Woodcock overruled significant internal dissension to approve Exondys a therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) a rare and severe disease which currently has an annual treatment cost of around $1 million per patient per year. Luckily for the public the FDA published the internal dissension with their approval documents.

One of the most vocal objections came from Dr. Ellis Unger who was director of the Office of Drug Evaluation at CDER. According to Unger Woodcock was intensely involved in the review of Exondys from the very beginning and decided to approve the drug before the actual review team had finished its own recommendation. And besides interference Unger was very vocal in his belief that Exondys is ineffective even calling it a “scientifically elegant placebo.” Exondys was approved based on its impact on dystrophin which is thought to be a biomarker for efficacy. Unger pointed out that the impact on dystrophin is so small that if you had 10 inches of snow on the sidewalk the drug effect would be equal to 1/32 of an inch. Additionally Dr. John Jenkins who was the director of new drugs at the agency also voiced opposition to the approval and retired soon afterwards.

Why did Woodcock fight so fiercely for the approval of Exondys? The worst reason was probably due to worries over the stock price of Sarepta the manufacturer of Exondys. In her presentation in front of the Agency Scientific Dispute Process Review Board (SDR Board) Woodcock noted that Sarepta “needed to be capitalized” and mentioned how the stock reacted to different FDA actions. She also suggested that if Sarepta did not receive approval the company might have insufficient capital to continue its study of Exondys and other drugs in the company’s pipeline. Or in essence we have to approve this drug so they can study it.

And we shouldn’t forget the political pressure of course. Within the approval documents it was noted that both Unger and Woodcock received significant correspondence from Congress and the public urging approval for the drug. It was also probably not a coincidence that Sarepta significantly increased its lobbying spending ahead of and during the approval process. Lobbying continues to have a fantastic return on investment as Exondys revenues are currently over $400 million per year (after spending less than a year’s worth of revenues from one patient on the activity on an annual basis).

Now let’s get back to Aduhelm. In March of 2019 Biogen’s two identically designed randomized controlled studies looking at Aduhelm in mild Alzheimer’s patients (trials 301 and 302) were stopped due to the data safety monitoring board judging them to be futile and unlikely to produce a clinically meaningful benefit. Then in October of that year Biogen announced that after receiving additional data from one of the trials they decided to file for approval of the high dose tested (10mg/kg) with the FDA. This despite the fact that the benefit was only seen in trial 302 while in trial 301 patients on the high dose actually did worse than patients on placebo. Even the pooled data combining that from both trials did not show a significant benefit for the high dose.

After Biogen made the decision to move forward the company then went to work on the narrative. At the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease conference in December 2019 during a session to discuss the data no skeptics or even statisticians were given a platform to speak. Additionally no open question-and-answer segment was allowed and all microphones were removed from around the room. This was highly unusual especially given that question-and-answer sessions are the rule at a medical conference. Even more shocking was that Biogen and the FDA released joint briefing documents for the meeting of the FDA Advisory Committee (a panel of experts convened prior to a drug’s approval) to discuss the safety and efficacy of the drug. In my 22 years looking at the biotechnology sector I don’t remember this ever happening. Typically the FDA has one set of briefing documents where they discuss the data from their point of view and the company has a different set.

Despite this questionable degree of collaboration if not collusion the meeting did not go well for Biogen. Statisticians typically do not like the acrobatics required to make a negative study into a positive one and the FDA’s statistician at the meeting Dr. Tristan Massie was no different. He concluded that the evidence was conflicting and that approval might actually negatively impact the development of more effective treatments both with regard to the design of future trials as well as recruitment (patients often would prefer to use an approved drug over one in clinical trials). The advisory committee shared his view and on the key question regarding whether trial 302 provided evidence of effectiveness of the drug; not a single committee member voted yes and 10 voted no with one abstention. A pretty overwhelmingly negative response.

And yet the FDA approved it anyway. Even worse the actual drug label which is what physicians and patients review when considering a drug reads like it was written by Biogen’s marketing team. First the label indicates that it is approved for the treatment of all stages of Alzheimer’s disease even though it was only tested in mild patients and had meager efficacy even there. This greatly inflates the addressable market size as now all six million Americans with Alzheimer’s are eligible for therapy. Given the company decided to price the drug well ahead of any projections at $56000 per patient per year (the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review calculated a fair price to be between $2500 and $8300) this drug could be a real budget buster. And this six million patient estimate only includes people over the age of 65 hence they will be covered by Medicare (specifically Medicare Part B as it is an infusion). In 2019 total spending by Medicare Part B was $37 billion. If just 15 percent of patients with Alzheimer’s decide to go on Aduhelm that would equal $50 billion in spending.

The FDA also stated that they approved Aduhelm because of reduction in amyloid plaques—misfolded proteins between nerve cells—even though that was not the primary endpoint of either study and there is actually no evidence that a reduction in plaques improves anything. Even in the case of Aduhelm both studies indicated a significant reduction in plaques and yet one of the studies showed a placebo outperforming the high dose. We’ve seen a similar scenario play out before. Merck’s Verubecestat was able to show 60 to 80 percent reductions in plaques and was still unable to show any clinical benefit (and was even worse than placebo on several important measures).

There were a couple of additional irregularities in the label which seem to benefit Biogen. Trial 301 was the “bad” one while trial 302 was the “good” one. The label reverses the numbering so that the “good” trial is referred to as “Study 1” which allows them to speak about that data first and in detail. When discussing “Study 2” the label excludes any presentation of the clinical data that showed that placebo patients did better than patients who received the approved dose despite the fact that this occurred with regard to the primary endpoint of the trial. That’s a very key piece of information that would be important for patients and physicians to know about when considering therapy and whether the benefit outweighs the risk of side effects which include cerebral microhemorrhage (19 percent of patients who received the high dose) and cerebral edema (35 percent of patients).

Why did the FDA do all of this? Besides the usual incentives for post-FDA careers there were likely political considerations at work as in the case of Sarepta (and remember Janet Woodcock who heavily influenced that decision is currently acting FDA commissioner). Less than two weeks prior to the approval President Joe Biden said that “if we don’t do something about Alzheimer’s in America… every single [hospital bed] will be occupied in the next 15 years with an Alzheimer’s patient.” Guess which 2020 candidate was the largest recipient of campaign funds by a large margin from Biogen and affiliated parties? Joe Biden with $76241. And like Sarepta Biogen also significantly increased their lobbying ahead of the FDA decision with 2020 being a record year and 2021 being a record first quarter. The FDA did not publish the internal deliberations like they did with Sarepta but my guess is that they wouldn’t necessarily be that different and would indicate similar pressures.

I have a lot of respect for the FDA and I think the vast majority of reviewers are looking to do the right thing but the system is broken and there need to be more firewalls to insulate the FDA from manipulation. A 2006 survey of FDA scientists indicated that 18.4 percent of them had “been asked for non-scientific reasons to inappropriately exclude or alter technical information or their conclusions in a FDA scientific document.” I have to imagine a similar survey wouldn’t show any better results today.

According to a Wall Street Journal report BlackRock – led by billionaire Laurence Fink – is purchasing entire neighborhoods and converting single-family homes into rentals; while in cities like Houston investors like Fink account for one-quarter of the home purchasers.

On ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" Chronicles journalist and associate editor Pedro Gonzalez said that BlackRock's actions are leading 40% of American renters to believe they will never be able to purchase a home.

""Homeownership gives people a stake in a society. It’s a way to build generational wealth. It’s the foundation of the middle-class and part of the American dream"" he said.

Meanwhile ""permanent capital"" like that from firms like Fink's are ""killing the dream and giving us a nightmare of dispossession.""

The impetus for firms to mass-purchase housing is to underwrite pensions and pad their books by spiking housing prices.

But Gonzalez warned that these reckless actions will only accelerate the next housing bubble to burst – as it did a decade ago.

""The same institutions also promote progressive [political] policies like environmental policies that also raise the price of housing – and they push for more immigration like JPMorgan Asset Management"" Gonzalez reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhaXhpbmdsb2JhbC5jb20vMjAyMS0wNi0xMi9ibGFja3JvY2stcmVjZWl2ZXMtbm9kLXRvLXN0YXJ0LWNoaW5hLW11dHVhbC1mdW5kLWJ1c2luZXNzLTEwMTcyNjQ1MC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BlackRock Receives Nod to Start China Mutual Fund Business,"The New York headquarters of the BlackRock investment management firm

(Bloomberg) — BlackRock Inc. became the first foreign asset manager allowed to start a wholly owned mutual fund business in China a step toward winning a slice of one of the fastest-growing wealth markets.

The world’s largest asset manager was granted a license from the China Securities Regulatory Commission to start selling onshore investment products to Chinese investors the company said Friday in a statement.

The approval comes a month after BlackRock won the nod to pursue a joint venture asset management business along with China Construction Bank Corp. and Singapore’s Temasek. Together the two entities give BlackRock an edge to reach more investors in China as it competes with a slew of global institutions going after an asset pool estimated by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to surpass $70 trillion by the end of the decade.

“China is taking significant steps in opening up its financial markets” BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said in the statement. “We can support more Chinese investors to access financial markets and build portfolios that can serve them throughout their lives.”

The string of approvals are a positive sign for other asset managers including Fidelity International Ltd. and Neuberger Berman Group LLC which are still waiting for permission for their fully controlled operations in the country.

For BlackRock being first “gives it a head start among global managers” said Sun Guiping an analyst with Shanghai Securities Co. The investment giant will also benefit China’s mutual fund industry by bringing in more product offerings and expertise he said.

More wholly foreign-owned or controlled mutual fund providers will emerge as China’s opening up continues Sun said. Their joint ventures already occupy 11 spots among the top 20 largest fund managers in China excluding money-market funds he said.

New York-based BlackRock’s strategy in China stands in stark contrast with Vanguard Group Inc. which ditched plans in March for a wholly owned mutual fund license. Vanguard is taking a different path by working with Ant Group Co. and building a robo advisory service.

BlackRock oversaw more than $9 trillion globally as of March 31.

Posted on 06/12/2021

As the COVID pandemic prompted the Federal Reserve to flood the country with U.S. dollars the price of single-family homes in the U.S. have increased as there remains a tight supply in single-family housing. Inflation has crept in and there is increased speculation in American real estate in 2020 and 2021. The Wall Street Journal issued a story on BlackRock and their activities in buying homes. Single-family homes are widely regarding among the populace as the American dream the idea of owning property. Furthermore Wall Street banks’ greed on underwriting risky loan products drove the housing bubbles in 2006 and 2007 which ended up as the global financial crisis of 2008. Then taxpayers bailout out Wall Street and other companies like AIG General Motors and Ally Financial. In the ashes of the financial crisis private equity firms like BlackRock created Invitation Homes to buy up cheap homes and rent them out. Other investors followed suit such as GI Partners backing Waypoint and the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation backing American Homes 4 Rent.

By age 80 half of Americans either have cataracts or have had surgery to remove them according to Dr. Waid Blackstone an ophthalmologist at University of Alabama at Birmingham Callahan Eye Hospital Clinic at Pell City.

""In terms of the typical age-related cataracts the average age of onset is 40 to 50 years but most people don't experience vision problems from that until later"" he said in a university news release. ""The average age for a cataract surgery patient is 73 to 75.""

A cataract is a clump of protein that leaves the lens of the eye cloudy or tinted impairing vision. A cataract can occur in one or both eyes. The cause is unknown.

Often the early stages of a cataract are accompanied by an increase in nearsightedness which can be corrected with glasses. As the cataract progresses night vision may worsen and colors may appear duller.

""Blurred vision is the primary problem although that can manifest in a couple of different ways"" Blackstone said. ""The first thing most people notice is glare. Light hits the cataract scatters and makes it difficult [to] see. The common complaint is difficulty driving at night because of glare from oncoming headlights. The flip side is that in dim lighting cataracts block low levels of light. The next most common complaint is difficulty reading fine print or seeing smaller images.""

Early cataract symptoms may be improved with eyeglasses brighter lighting anti-glare sunglasses or magnifying lenses. If these measures don't help surgery is the only effective treatment according to Blackstone.

Cataract removal is one of the most common operations in the United States and among the safest and most effective. The surgeon removes the cloudy lens and replaces it with an implant.

Typically surgeons perform the surgery on one eye and on the other eye soon after. The most common method takes about 15 minutes. About 95% of people see better after the surgery.

""The decision for any cataract surgery is based entirely on how the patient is functioning"" Blackstone said. ""We have patients with moderate or even severe cataracts that we elect to leave alone simply because based on what that patient's needs are it may not be a good idea. But we also see patients who can read an eye chart very well but struggle with nighttime glare. It's when they begin having difficulty with daily activities that we start considering cataract surgery.""

In a new filing Byju’s revealed that scores of investors including Abu Dhabi government fund ADQ and Phoenix Rising had together invested about $350 million in the startup. The new valuation helps Byju’s surpass Paytm which was last valued at $16 billion for the crown position in the Indian startup ecosystem. (Paytm is currently working on exploring the public markets and eyeing to raise as much as $3 billion and eyeing a valuation of up to $30 billion.)

The new tranche of investment is part of a larger round that Byju’s kickstarted earlier this year and is looking to secure over $1.5 billion. Some of its recent investors also include B Capital Group and hedge fund XN. The startup was valued at $11 billion late last year and $5.75 billion in July 2019.

The startup plans to use the fresh capital in part to acquire more startups. Byju’s which acquired Indian physical coaching institute Aakash for nearly $1 billion earlier this year is conducting due diligence to buy an online learning startup Toppr and has also engaged with U.S.-based Epic TechCrunch reported earlier this year.

Byju’s prepares students pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses and in recent years it has also expanded its catalog to serve all school-going students. Tutors on the Byju’s app tackle complex subjects using real-life objects such as pizza and cake.

The pandemic which prompted New Delhi to enforce a months-long nationwide lockdown and close schools accelerated its growth and those of several other online learning startups including Unacademy and Vedantu.

As of early this year Byju’s said it had amassed over 80 million users 5.5 million of whom are paying subscribers. Byju’s which is profitable generated revenue of over $100 million in the U.S. last year Deborah Quazzo managing partner of GSV Ventures (which has backed the Indian startup) said at a session in March held by Indian venture fund Blume Ventures.

The startup executives said at a UBS event earlier this year that Byju’s current revenue run rate is $800 million a figure they expect will reach $1 billion in the next 12-15 months. It has also accelerated its international expansion plans in recent months."

How travelers could benefit from hotel industry struggles

Mark Crossey U.S. travel expert at Skyscanner said Americans are looking for short domestic trips — 87% of trips booked at the site are for a week or less — and are favoring spots with fewer pandemic-related restrictions.

""Both Florida and Nevada no longer have travel restrictions for visitors and California anticipates its restrictions will soon lift too"" he said. ""All of these destinations enjoy warm summer weather and have plenty of activities for people to enjoy after a quiet year.""

Crossey said he expects to see Americans continue to travel in their own backyard throughout 2021 and anticipates ""a resurgence in foreign trips as soon as international travel restrictions relax and popular European destinations reopen.""

The top five destinations from Skyscanner Braze and Apptopia are in fact all cities: Las Vegas Orlando Los Angeles Miami and New York. All but L.A. and the Big Apple meanwhile made Booking.com's own list of top 10 destination searches for summer travel which also featured seaside spots such as Myrtle Beach South Carolina and Ocean City Maryland.

Behnisch Architekten and Harvard University Redefine Scientific Scholarship

with World-Class Research Complex

The renowned university and pioneering architecture firm team up on a groundbreaking project designed for cutting-edge pedagogy and research in a highly sustainable building that reflects the future of science.

Harvard University Science and Engineering Complex Building Boston MA

BOSTON MA—Harvard University’s new Science and Engineering Complex (SEC) designed by Behnisch Architekten has just been completed and will open its doors to students in the fall of 2021. Located directly across the Charles River from Harvard’s historic Cambridge campus the SEC is the University’s latest significant addition to its Allston campus.

Its diverse mix of labs and collaborative spaces also furthers a robust culture of interdisciplinary work. The SEC’s cutting-edge laboratory space generous approach to collaborative environments and innovative high-performance façade support the research of some of Harvard’s most translational innovators as they work on visionary projects inside the building such as flying and swimming microbots wearable robotics data privacy tools novel drug delivery platforms and brain-electronic interfaces to name a few.

A landmark design for transformational learning

The eight-level 544000-square-foot building is situated on a primary thoroughfare connecting the Boston neighborhood of Allston to Cambridge. Highly visible makerspaces and teaching labs located at street level showcase the exciting work being done at the school further connecting the academic and Allston communities. The vibrant public spaces at a variety of environments and scales incorporate the structure into the fabric of the neighborhood. The lower floors of the building embrace an extensive landscaped Engineering Yard intended for both ceremonial as well as recreational activities.

Reflecting the dynamic interdisciplinary nature of both teaching and research the SEC is designed to act as a “lab for learning” that encourages collaboration. Classrooms teaching labs and amenity spaces occupy the lower floors. They vary in size and layout ranging from typical theater-style classrooms with sloped floors and fixed seating to active-learning spaces that can be easily reconfigured to allow for flipped classroom models and student-led discussions. Two glazed multi-story atria provide light-filled social hubs for faculty students and staff creating linkages and encouraging cross-disciplinary work among more than 450 engineering and applied sciences researchers in residence.

Diversity in research

Home to a major portion of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) the SEC houses a multitude of lab and core science facilities for research that will benefit society in numerous ways strengthening Harvard’s and Greater Boston’s place as the global epicenter for the life sciences and a major center of excellence in engineering and technology. The faculty and students occupying the SEC’s offices makerspaces and wet and dry labs work in diverse fields including robotics bioengineering computer science materials science electrical and mechanical engineering and more.

The upper floors house 69120 square feet of open wet research laboratory space accommodating biological chemical physical optical and electronics activities as well as 24000 square feet of dry research laboratories for computer science researchers. Modular flexible laboratory environments smart zoning of highly ventilated zones from dry space and centralized lab services ensure the future adaptability and flexible evolution of laboratory space as research directions change. The upper stories are clad in a façade whose layered design celebrates and calibrates the scale of the large volumes that comprise the research activities of the building creates an identity for the complex and plays a crucial role in the efficient energy performance of the building as well as ensuring occupant comfort.

The healthiest building on the Harvard campus

Charged with making the SEC the “healthiest building on the Harvard campus” the Behnisch team reinforces Harvard’s robust commitment to sustainability with a design that has earned both LEED Platinum and Living Building Challenge (LBC) Petal certification in Materials Beauty and Equity. Unprecedented for a building of this size the LBC Materials Petal attests that the building has been constructed with healthier materials that are free of key harmful chemicals and comply with both the LBC Red List and meet the rigorous requirements of Harvard’s Healthier Building Academy a partnership among faculty from SEAS the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Harvard Medical School and the Harvard Office for Sustainability.

To set a design precedent for further local development as well as advance sustainability goals the SEC’s design combines performance and aesthetics. Behnisch custom-designed the world’s first hydroformed tensile façade system that significantly reduces solar gain at glazed openings and enables the use of low-energy high-comfort radiant systems for interior climate conditioning. The design team also incorporated water-based heating and cooling systems that use one-third the energy of comparable air-driven systems large glass atria and highly glazed interior partitions that transmit daylight deep into the heart of the building and five acres of vegetated roof terraces.

Beyond its immediate function the project addresses several threads of contemporary life which will influence future generations: engineering’s decisive influence on the discovery and mitigation of some of the world’s most pressing problems the critical importance of cross-disciplinary efforts to achieve major research advances and genuine leadership in sustainable design and urban development.

Now just as the competition’s slated to intensify the U.S. company is building its case with new patient survival data.

Adding Darzalex to Bristol Myers Squibb’s Revlimid and steroid dexamethasone (Rd) could slash the risk of death by 32% in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients ineligible to receive stem cell transplants J&J reported at the European Hematology Association’s virtual congress.

The survival benefit is “unprecedented” for an aging myeloma population almost all of whom were 65 years of age or older said Craig Tendler M.D. vice president of oncology clinical development and global medical affairs at J&J’s Janssen unit during an interview.

The Darzalex-Rd regimen got its FDA go-ahead in transplant-ineligible patients in 2019 based on data from the same phase 3 MAIA trial showing it could pare down the risk of disease progression or death by 44% after a median follow-up of 28 months. Now after 56.2 months of follow-up over half of Darzalex patients were still alive without their disease worsening a showing that’s again “unprecedented” for a front-line myeloma treatment Tendler said.

The entire set of results “strongly support” the Darzalex-Rd combo as a new standard of care for newly diagnosed transplant-ineligible multiple myeloma patients Thierry Facon M.D. an investigator of the MAIA trial said in a statement.

RELATED: ASCO: Does J&J's Darzalex work as a myeloma maintenance therapy? Maybe not for patients who've already used it

Darzalex does have another regimen approved for the same myeloma population. Darzalex combined with Takeda’s Velcade melphalan and prednisone (VMP) reduced the risk of death by 40% in the phase 3 ALCYONE trial. But disease progression had already occurred in half of patients on the Darzalex-VMP combo after about three years of follow-up a much shorter period than the five-year mark the Darzalex-Rd regimen is approaching.

The two trials studied similar patient populations Tendler said but VMP was an old standard of care that’s not really used today in the U.S. Still Tendler believes the two regimens may both have roles to play based on each patient’s ability to tolerate them. Whichever cocktail physicians choose the two phase 3 studies have confirmed the benefit of Darzalex in transplant-ineligible patients he added.

But Sanofi’s rival CD38 antibody Sarclisa may soon be able to challenge Darzalex in the same front-line transplant-ineligible population with the help of a more powerful backbone.

RELATED: Sanofi's Sarclisa forays into Darzalex's new territory with FDA nod in earlier myeloma

Currently allowed as a second-line treatment Sarclisa is expected to have top-line data from the phase 3 IMROZ trial later this year. The trial is adding Sarclisa to a VRd cocktail of Velcade Revlimid and dexamethasone which has established itself as the standard-of-care first-line therapy for patients with myeloma.

Darzalex has its own VRd combo trials dubbed PERSEUS and CEPHEUS which are testing a newly approved under-the-skin version of the J&J drug called Darzalex Faspro. The CEPHEUS trial appears to have just completed its primary analysis according to a listing on ClinicalTrials.gov.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxmb3JkZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxLzA2LzEzL2JyaWVmcy1sb2NhbC1idXNpbmVzc3Blb3BsZS1pbmNsdWRpbmctdGhvbWFzLWhhcm1vbi1kci1kYXJyb2x5bi1tY2NhcnJvbGwtYW5kLWtldmluLXNjaG5laWRlci83NjA0NjA2MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Briefs on local businesspeople including Thomas Harmon Dr. Darrolyn McCarroll and Kevin Schneider.,"The Milford Daily News

In recent years we have seen Pharmaceutical company megadeals that saw Takeda acquiring Shire for a total value of $81.7 billion Bristol-Myers Squibb’s acquisition of Celgene for $74 billion AbbVie’s $63 billion acquisition of Allergan and the proposed acquisition of Alexion by AstraZeneca for $39 billion. All of these acquisitions continue to have a lasting impact on the leadership and staff at these companies which collectively employ hundreds of thousands of employees worldwide. In addition there have been a plethora of product transfers between organizations with larger multi-national companies pruning portfolios adding gene therapy and biotechnology divisions and consolidating core assets.

Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the Pharmaceutical/Biopharmaceutical industry are critical for organizations to implement strategic changes to their business. Whether it be to (a) future proof an organization’s pipeline by accessing innovation (b) obtain additional manufacturing capacity or (c) to divest non-core assets (products facilities etc.) companies continue to grow modernize and evolve to meet the targets set out in their strategic plans.

When two or more organizations reach the ‘deal’ and it is announced that ‘A’ will take over ‘B’ or that A and B will share in ‘A-B’ or indeed that ‘A’ will sell part of their organization to ‘B’ it is frequently followed by uncertainty and apprehension among internal stakeholders. This changing landscape tests an organization’s ability to communicate the distinct ‘win-win’ elements of the deal. The Kübler-Ross change curve (see fig.1 below) is always worth having in mind during this transitional period of M&A and never fails in tracking the internal stakeholder mindset albeit with differing levels of severity.

Figure 1. Kübler-Ross Change Curve

The transition from pre-M&A to the post-M&A reality can be both fast and slow. The physical symbols of such transitions such as the company name logo and headed paper can be changed in a matter of minutes but the hearts and minds of management and employees can lag significantly further behind. It can take years before a post-M&A steady state is reached (sometimes never!) where full commitment to the change is obtained and all the anticipated ‘win-wins’ are realized.

Some acquired organizations are left to their own devices (pardon the pun medtech sector!) and they are run as true satellites whose contact with the corporate office is limited to communicating the positive financial results. In this scenario the management team in-situ at the time of the M&A event are trusted to continue as-is and maintain the upward trajectory. Alternatively and more commonly where there is a dominant merging partner a strict cut-over timeline is applied for an acquired entity to morph into a fully incorporated affiliate. Typically these sites implement corporate structures policies and systems swiftly and assertively.

Where M&A becomes can be interesting is the cultural piece; everyone who has worked in an organization through a merger or acquisition knows that there can be a seismic shift in the objectives of the new organization… not so much what the objectives are but how the objectives are expected to be met. Post M&A organizations frequently change structure with new reporting lines new titles merged departments increased/reduced layers of management with revised spans of control. Systems of work can also change where new policies are cascaded into procedures that are followed with varying degrees of success. Supporting systems software tools and information flows are further material changes that tend to require extensive training and oversight in the early periods post-M&A.

When cultures collide in merging organizations it has serious ramifications for business and its stakeholders. The industry is littered with mergers and takeovers that did not meet expectations simply because the cultural differences were too difficult to overcome. Naturally organizations do not admit to failed mergers or acquisitions too often but some of the more interesting ones are referenced below.1 Very often the differences in personal and collective discipline personified in the leadership differences in the two organizations is challenging for the organizations to reconcile. Where rigid structured and conservative management methods meet innovative and unorthodox management can be a recipe for M&A difficulties.2

At PharmaLex we believe we have a unique understanding of the cultural challenges experienced during Mergers and Acquisitions. Having merged ourselves in 2017 into PharmaLex we have insight in how to overcome the challenges of maintaining agility while benefitting from working in a bigger corporate environment having economies of scale with an increased resource pool.

The elite schools took $10 million from 2017 to 2023 from entities within the “State of Palestine” according to the analysis by Open the Books a Republican-owned nonprofit dedicated to revealing government spending.

Brown University Harvard University and non-Ivy Indiana University of Pennsylvania are among the schools to accept funding from donors located in the nation that technically doesn’t exist at least by UN standards.

The “State of Palestine” is not a recognized entity by the United Nations or the US — though some 140 countries do officially recognize it.

Brown University in February 2020 received a $643000 gift from a foundation located within the “State of Palestine” to create a professorship in Palestinian Studies as part of the college’s Middle East Studies program according to federal disclosures reviewed by Open the Books.

Though the financial filing does not disclose the donor’s name Brown previously said the money was gifted by the Munib and Angela Masri Foundation based in the West Bank.

Nine different donors — including multiple Brown alumni and the foundation — came together to fund the “Mahmoud Darwish Professorship in Palestinian Studies” according to a 2020 press release.

Meanwhile Harvard took in $1.6 million from donors within the “State of Palestine” and the Indiana University of Pennsylvania received $6.4 million from entities within the “State of Palestine” and another $900000 from a donor from “Palestinian Territory Occupied” according to the review of the financial disclosure documents.

The donors are not identified in the filings. Harvard previously said that monies it received from Palestinian donors in 2017 2018 and 2019 did not come from the Palestinian Authority though the Ivy League would not disclose the donor names in a 2020 news report.

Most of the money helped pay for Palestinian students from the occupied territories to receive an education at American universities according to the filings.

They were often reported as “payment of tuition and fees for students from Palestine. Funds are also utilized to pay for educational-related expenses incurred by the university for these students through their enrollment in this program” the documents state according to Open the Books.

Indiana University of Pennsylvania received at least $2.3 million from the West Bank-based Arab American University to cover the tuition and other expenses for Palestinian students attending the US college according to the same 2020 report.

In addition to the funding the US universities have had ongoing relationships with universities in the West Bank.

Brown’s inaugural professor of Palestinian Studies Beshara Doumani was granted permission to simultaneously serve as the president of Birzeit University in the West Bank for two years.

The Palestinian university was criticized after its Union of Professors and Employees penned an op-ed days after Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 attack stating “2023 will be recorded historically as the year that Palestinians stood boldly in the face of colonial fascism and screamed in defense of their homes humanity and lives.”

For its part Indiana University of Pennsylvania offers business Ph.D. and master’s programs in partnership with Arab American University.

During her confirmation hearing in 2022 Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson introduced herself to Congress as an originalist. This surprising move from a presumptively liberal justice signified to many the triumph of originalism as the accepted methodology of the Supreme Court. Jackson was following in the footsteps of Justice Elena Kagan who famously declared that “we are all originalists now” during her own confirmation.

Kagan however came to regret that quip after watching her conservative colleagues implement a series of GOP policy preferences in the name of applying the Constitution’s “original” meaning which is what originalism claims to be. She is surely not the only progressive with second thoughts: The legal left’s embrace of originalism was a major influential development in the 12 years between Kagan’s and Jackson’s elevation to the court—one that’s arguably waning today despite Jackson’s appointment. After three terms of precedent-smashing activism by the Supreme Court’s 6–3 conservative supermajority almost always under the banner of originalism the methodology looks more intellectually bankrupt manipulable and dangerous than ever.

Some liberals have responded with accusations that this supermajority peddles “fauxriginalism” cherry-picking history to fit Republicans’ favored results. This allegation is certainly true but doesn’t answer the underlying question: Is it even a good idea to concede that the “original meaning” of the Constitution—even if it could be reliably ascertained—is the authoritative one? Jackson’s approach illustrates the benefits and risks of trying to beat originalists at their own game from the left. And with each passing term the payoff looks smaller and smaller.

For progressives the problems begin with the origin of the theory. Conservative scholars politicians and activists developed the idea of originalism in response to Brown v. Board of Education—yes the decision that desegregated public school—arguing that the Framers of the 14th Amendment would never have intended to integrate public education. They may have been right about that claim: The same Congress that proposed the 14th Amendment in 1866 segregated the District of Columbia’s public schools while a supermajority of states that ratified the amendment also strictly separated education by race. That doesn’t mean the push toward integration was the wrong move for our country and our 20th-century understanding of what equal rights ought to mean legally. Regardless in the coming decades the burgeoning conservative legal movement refined and pushed the theory to combat other contested Supreme Court decisions including Roe v. Wade Griswold v. Connecticut (birth control) Miranda v. Arizona (self-incrimination) Reynolds v. Sims (malapportionment) and Regents v. Bakke (affirmative action).

Today originalism is the house style of the Federalist Society the lavishly funded network of conservative lawyers who provide intellectual cover for the Republican Party’s preferred policies. It’s propounded to some degree by all six conservative justices who have placed it at the center of their continual smash-and-grab campaign against progressive precedent. When the Supreme Court overruled Roe its justification boiled down to a single claim: Abortion was largely illegal when the 14th Amendment was ratified so it may still be criminalized today. When the court established a new right to carry guns in public it deployed the same reasoning: People could allegedly carry guns in public when the Second Amendment was ratified so they have a right to do so today. And when the court struck down affirmative action? Same story: The original meaning of the equal protection clause requires the law to be “colorblind” the court declared.

This last decision gave Jackson an opportunity to flaunt her skills as a progressive originalist as did an earlier case designed to gut the Voting Rights Act’s remnants. In both she delivered: The justice drew heavily upon the work of historians like Eric Foner who reject the “colorblind” conception of the 14th Amendment in favor of a nuanced interpretation that allows for “race-conscious” remedies to protect minorities’ equal citizenship. Jackson pitched this theory in a lengthy monologue during oral arguments in the voting rights case—her second day on the bench—as if to warn her conservative colleagues that their bogus originalism would no longer go unchallenged. And perhaps her shaming strategy worked since the court ultimately delivered an unlikely victory for the Voting Rights Act.

Jackson’s approach here echoed the work of advocacy groups that seek to employ originalism for progressive ends most prominently the well-respected Constitutional Accountability Center. The goal here is to engage with conservative judges on their own turf demonstrating that their own methodology would actually yield a liberal result if they did it honestly. In short these advocates try to out-originalist the originalists. And on select topics the tactic can work marvels. Race is one example since the conservative fixation with a “colorblind” Constitution so obviously contradicts the historical record. Federal power is another since the Framers clearly gave Congress sweeping powers to regulate commerce. (That’s why Jackson’s most important majority opinion so far is an originalist defense of Congress’ ability to create private rights through its spending power.) Many protections for criminal defendants too like the right to trial by jury and the guarantee against self-incrimination have strong historical foundations.

Other liberties treasured by progressives however do not end up saved by progressive originalism. The Supreme Court’s historical analysis in Dobbs may have been sloppy and inaccurate but that doesn’t change the fact that there’s no evidence Americans thought the 14th Amendment safeguarded abortion back in the 1860s when it was written. Selectively deploying originalism when it bolsters progressive aims does not solve the underlying problem: that as Hawaii Supreme Court Justice Todd Eddins has put it the theory champions the views of “the few white men who made laws and shaped lives during the mostly racist and misogynistic very old days.” This flaw may be most pronounced in cases involving the civil rights of those whom the authors of the Constitution scorned or ignored.

Consider for instance a group of people who were excluded from the political process—indeed from public life—when the 14th Amendment was ratified: women. Sex equality is rooted in the amendment’s equal protection clause which became law in 1868. During this period though in most of the country women had virtually no rights at all. Married women could not own property sign contracts or file lawsuits under the doctrine of “coverture” which subsumed their legal identity into that of their husband. Men could legally beat their wives under the doctrine of chastisement which allowed for “moderate” physical violence in the home. As one court put it in 1868 while upholding the acquittal of a man who whipped his wife the judiciary could “not interfere with family government in trifling cases.” (This history suddenly became relevant when the lower courts struck down a law barring domestic abusers from possessing firearms.)

Conservative litigants are not even shy about citing this evidence when defending discriminatory laws. South Carolina placed it front and center when arguing for same-sex marriage bans in 2015. The state cited congressional debates over the 14th Amendment’s impact on coverture laws that denied women equal citizenship. At the time of the amendment’s adoption some congressmen fretted that the new amendment might restrict the ability of states to discriminate against women. Contemporaneous comments from the primary author of the 14th Amendment himself Rep. John Bingham assured them that the new promise of equality would not interfere with state control over “domestic relations.” His comments reflected a broad consensus from the time reflected in the congressional record that the amendment would not establish equality or even a baseline of civil rights for women. (South Carolina cited this history to show that discrimination against both women and gay people remained constitutional by the way.) If the Supreme Court adopted this reading of the equal protection clause it would have to overturn every past ruling against sex discrimination making husbands the “head and master” of their households once again.

Progressive originalists generally respond to this obstacle by defining rights at a higher level of generality. The Constitutional Accountability Center for example argues that the equal protection clause forbids discrimination against women and gay people by outlawing “class-based” legislation. By denying rights to an entire group of people the theory goes the government condemns them to second-class status stamping them with an impermissible badge of legal inferiority.

It’s a fine idea—but is it really originalism? The answer probably depends on whether you want to salvage originalism or supplant it. If you want to salvage it then sure: It’s perfectly acceptable to define rights so broadly on such an abstract level that they can be squared with the “original meaning” of the Constitution. As George Washington University law professor Peter J. Smith has persuasively argued that is in fact precisely what today’s conservatives already do when mounting an originalist defense of Brown v. Board of Education. Evidence that the 14th Amendment’s Framers supported school segregation is overwhelming. So Brown’s defenders on the right define “equal protection” with sufficient abstraction to mandate integrated public education.

Should progressives want to salvage originalism though? Why step in to shore up a flailing theory that was born out of contempt for Black children women and criminal defendants? A theory that the Supreme Court is currently manipulating to impose conservative policy goals like nationwide public carry under the thin guise of judicial review?

Because originalist justices like Clarence Thomas are so incredibly bad at interpreting history cherry-picking facts and crediting debunked sources it may be tempting to conclude that they’re just doing it wrong. But why do it at all? The strong argument for progressive originalism is the hope that advocates can convince conservative judges to issue liberal decisions if they just present enough historical evidence. That hope feels increasingly hollow. When Thomas is presented with proof that his past views were rooted in bogus history he simply dismisses it. Activist scholars flood the nation’s law journals which are not peer-reviewed with tendentious or outright false historical claims which conservative justices then cite as the gospel truth. This is less like a legitimate judicial or academic enterprise than like a scam to reverse-engineer outcomes to fit a partisan agenda. Pointing out inaccuracies is not going to change the outcomes.

With originalism’s reputation so tarnished maybe progressives should stop co-opting the right’s brand altogether. Maybe they should embrace constitutional values like equality without squeezing them into a framework that was literally designed to shut out minorities from full citizenship. Maybe rather than trying to beat conservatives at their own game progressives should present a competing vision of constitutional interpretation to the public—one which acknowledges that original meaning is often unknowable and too frequently shackled to the antiquated views of dead white men. And maybe that would give disillusioned Americans a reason to believe in the rule of law once again."

Posted on: June 12 2021 11:58h.

One of the oldest casinos on the Strip celebrated the completion of a four-year $200 million overhaul on Thursday as officials from Caesars Entertainment unveiled the redesigned Harrah’s Las Vegas.

Dan Walsh senior vice president and general manager of Harrah’s launched the celebration by hitting a button that turned on the casino’s new exterior purple lighting.

As a flagship location of the iconic gaming and hospitality brand revamping Harrah’s Las Vegas not only enhances the guest experience but also further reflects the fun and energy that makes Las Vegas such a unique travel destination” he said in a statement.

The purple lighting isn’t limited to just the exterior as purple lighting highlights Harrah’s lobby and casino floor as well

After renovating the Valley Tower rooms in phases in 2016 and 2018 Harrah’s completed the redesign of all 2542 rooms and suites last year. That included the Mountain Tower which the company spent another $70 million to complete. Design work on the rooms was completed by Marnell Architecture.

The renovations include Harrah’s suites as well. Those accommodations now feature oversized tubs a separate living and dining room with a wet bar and the option to connect to two bedrooms.

Casino Property Dates Back to Early 70s

The history of Harrah’s Las Vegas dates back to 1973 when it opened as the Holiday Casino. Only six existing hotels on the Strip are older. Company executives renamed it after William Harrah the founder of the Harrah’s Casino chain in 1992.

Holiday Corp. which owned the casino and the Holiday Inn chain of hotels acquired Harrah’s business in 1980 less than two years after his death.

Besides the recently completed renovation the property has been overhauled three other times. The most recent occurred in 1997. At that time officials spent $200 million to abandon the riverboat casino theme that it had since its opening.

Besides the more than 2500 rooms the resort features 87000 square feet of gaming space a retail sportsbook a weekend spa 25000 square feet of convention space and a skywalk that connects to the Caesars Forum conference center. Harrah’s also features six restaurants including a Ruth’s Chris Steak House and PizzaCake by CakeBoss star Buddy Valastro.

Donny Osmond to Headline at Harrah’s

In addition to the renovations Harrah’s also provided some more information about Donny Osmond’s return to the Strip. Osmond with his sister Marie Osmond were a hit duo in the 1970s and they parlayed that fame into a long-running residency in Las Vegas. For 11 years they performed at the Flamingo another Caesars resort until Nov. 2019.

According to Harrah’s Donny Osmond will begin a multi-year residency – his first as a solo act – starting on Aug. 31. The show will run from Tuesday through Saturday and will include a mix of his hits and new material.

Tickets for his opening night show start at $295. Regular shows start at $65.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjhuZXdzbm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvaGFycmFocy1maW5pc2hlcy0yMDBtLXJlbm92YXRpb24tb2YtdmVnYXMtc3RyaXAtZmxhZ3NoaXAv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuOG5ld3Nub3cuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9oYXJyYWhzLWZpbmlzaGVzLTIwMG0tcmVub3ZhdGlvbi1vZi12ZWdhcy1zdHJpcC1mbGFnc2hpcC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harrah’s finishes $200M renovation of Vegas Strip flagship,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/harrahs-finishes-200m-renovation-of-vegas-strip-flagship/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjhuZXdzbm93LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvaGFycmFocy1maW5pc2hlcy0yMDBtLXJlbm92YXRpb24tb2YtdmVnYXMtc3RyaXAtZmxhZ3NoaXAv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuOG5ld3Nub3cuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9oYXJyYWhzLWZpbmlzaGVzLTIwMG0tcmVub3ZhdGlvbi1vZi12ZWdhcy1zdHJpcC1mbGFnc2hpcC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3R1Y3Nvbi5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9uZWQtYmVhdHR5LWFjdG9yLWluLWRlbGl2ZXJhbmNlLW5ldHdvcmstZGllcy1hdC04My9hcnRpY2xlXzY4ZDZiYjY5LThmMDgtNTVjOS1iMTIxLTc5ZjBmNjI5YTgwMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ned Beatty actor in 'Deliverance' 'Network' dies at 83,"NEW YORK — Ned Beatty the indelible character actor whose first film role as a genial vacationer brutally raped by a backwoodsman in 1972's ""Deliverance"" launched him on a long prolific and accomplished career has died. He was 83.

Beatty's manager Deborah Miller said Beatty died Sunday of natural causes at his home in Los Angeles surrounded by friends and loved ones.

After years in regional theater Beatty was cast in ""Deliverance"" as Bobby Trippe the happy-go-lucky member of a male river-boating party terrorized by backwoods thugs. The scene in which Trippe is brutalized became the most memorable in the movie and established Beatty as an actor whose name moviegoers may not have known but whose face they always recognized.

""For people like me there's a lot of 'I know you! I know you! What have I seen you in?'"" Beatty remarked without rancor in 1992.

Beatty received only one Oscar nomination as supporting actor for his role as corporate executive Arthur Jensen in 1976's ""Network"" but he contributed to some of the most popular movies of his time and worked constantly his credits including more than 150 movies and TV shows.

Beatty's appearance in ""Network"" scripted by Paddy Chayefsky an directed by Sidney Lumet was brief but titanic. His three-minute monologue ranks among the greatest in movies. Jensen summons anchorman Howard Beale (Peter Finch) to a long dimly lit boardroom for a come-to-Jesus about the elemental powers of media.

""You have meddled with the primal forces of nature Mr. Beale and I won't have it!"" Beatty shouts from across the boardroom before explaining that there is no America no democracy. ""There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and DuPont Dow Union Carbide and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today.""

He was equally memorable as Otis the idiot henchman of villainous Lex Luthor in the first two Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" movies and as the racist sheriff in ""White Lightning."" Other films included ""All The President's Men"" ""The Front Page"" ""Nashville"" and ""The Big Easy."" In a 1977 interview he had explained why he preferred being a supporting actor.

He landed a rare leading role in the Irish film ""Hear My Song"" in 1991. The true story of legendary Irish tenor Josef Locke who disappeared at the height of a brilliant career it was well reviewed but largely unseen in the United States. Between movies Beatty worked often in TV and theater. He had recurring roles in ""Roseanne"" as John Goodman's father and as a detective on ""Homicide: Life on the Street.""

On Broadway he won critical praise (and a Drama Desk Award) for his portrayal of Big Daddy in a revival of ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" a role he had first played as a 21-year-old in a stock company production. He created controversy however when he was quoted in The New York Times on the skills of his young co-stars Ashley Judd and Jason Patric.

""Ashley is a sweetie"" he said ""and yet she doesn't have a lot of tools."" Of Patric he remarked: ""He's gotten better all the time but his is a different journey."" His more recent movies included ""Toy Story 3"" in 2010 and two releases from 2013 ""The Big Ask"" and ""Baggage Claim."" He retired soon after.

Ned Thomas Beatty was born in 1937 in Louisville Ky. and raised in Lexington where he joined the Protestant Disciples of Christ Christian Church. ""It was the theater I attended as a kid"" he told The Associated Press in 1992. ""It was where people got down to their truest emotions and talked about things they didn't talk about in everyday life. ... The preaching was very often theatrical."" For a time he thought of becoming a priest but changed his mind after he was cast in a high school production of ""Harvey.""

He spent 10 summers at the Barter Theater in Abingdon Virginia and eight years at the Arena Stage Company in Washington D.C. At the Arena Stage he appeared in Chekhov's ""Uncle Vanya"" and starred in Arthur Miller's ""Death of a Salesman."" Then his life changed forever when he took a train to New York to audition for director John Boorman for the role of Bobby Trippe. Boorman told him the role was cast but changed his mind after seeing Beatty audition.

Beatty who married Sandra Johnson in 1999 had eight children from three previous marriages.

(CHWY) and more.

Is inflation transitory cyclical or secular?

Almost all prices are going up! The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.6% in May and 5.0% over the last 12 months the biggest 12-month increase since August 2008. The current controversy is whether or not this jump is transitory. Let’s dive into some of the biggest drivers.

It’s going to be a lot more expensive to hit the road

Used cars prices were up 29.7% over the last 12 months. Usually car prices depreciate over time but COVID fears compelled commuters to avoid public transit and drive themselves. As businesses plan to bring more employees back on-site this trend may not fade away so quickly.

Gasoline prices were up 56.2% year-over-year (YoY). During the pandemic lockdown OPEC decided to cut oil production by 9.7 million barrels a day. As economies re-opened OPEC+ countries gradually increased production yet they are hesitant to bring production back to full capacity. The bad news for summer travelers is that prices at the pump will likely go up in the foreseeable future. Over the long term however a shift towards electric vehicles will decrease overall reliance on fossil fuels and demand for gasoline.

Airfares were up 24.1% YoY. With higher energy prices additional costs for health and safety and limited business travel airlines are facing challenges on multiple fronts just as vacation demand starts to lift off. Even when everyone is vaccinated the cost of travel may never be the same again.

Fast food may not be the cheapest option

Food prices were up 2.2% YoY. Relative to other categories the gain seems moderate. Across various food sub-categories there are two areas that have gained some attention: limited-service meals and meat prices.

The limited-service meals index rose 6.1% YoY. Restaurants have been one of the most battered industries during the pandemic. Just as restrictions ease restaurants are faced with new challenges: higher transportation costs labor shortages and potentially higher wage costs. Many customers saw higher delivery costs being added to their tabs. In the post-pandemic world service fees will likely increase to offset higher operation costs.

Meat prices particularly pork are causing some sticker shock. Global economic recovery particularly in China is driving up demand for U.S. pork. This trend may prove to be transitory. Recently China moved to tame its inflation and reduce pork imports.

As the same time many food sub-categories haven’t changed much over the past year and a few have dropped. Potato prices fell 4.8% YoY. Food-at-home is forecasted to only increase between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2021 (see table).

Where can you save money?

It seems ironic that during a year of pandemic prices for health insurance policies are getting cheaper. Multiple fiscal stimulus bills have made COVID-19 testing and vaccination free for all Americans. Furthermore under the American Rescue Plan private health insurance through public exchanges is set to become more affordable at least for a few years.

Looking ahead

Some elements of the current inflationary experience may be transitory some may be cyclical while others may be secular. While the overall level may not cause any stir at the Federal Reserve some industries are clearly more affected than others. Many economists have revised their 2021 CPI inflation forecasts from below 2% to 2.5% to currently north of 3%.

Here's what you need to know.,"Barajas is Spain's largest airport in terms of size operations and passenger traffic and the airport is located just 12 miles from the city center.

The name of the airport was previously just ""Madrid-Barajas"" but it got its newer longer title in 2014 to honor the late Adolfo Suárez the first prime minister of Spain after the reintroduction of democracy.

If you're one of the lucky flyers transiting through the Spanish hub here's everything you need to know for your layover.

The layout

Madrid has four main passenger terminals: T1 T2 T3 and T4 and a satellite terminal T4S. While T1 T2 and T3 (this terminal is mainly an extension of T2) are all connected T4 and its satellite terminal T4S (both serving Oneworld) are the newest terminals and opened in 2006.

Getting between terminals

While T1 T2 and T3 are connected and walkable you can't get from there to T4 on foot. Instead you'll have to drive take a ride-hailing service or a taxi. There's also a free shuttle bus that runs 24 hours a day between the terminals. You can catch the bus in the arrivals area of each terminal -- just look for an Alsa bus with the digital screen in the front saying T1-T2-T3-T4. The frequency is as follows:

From 6:30 a.m. – 23:30 p.m. every five minutes.

From 23:30 p.m. – 2:30 a.m. every 10 minutes.

From 2:30 a.m. – 6:30 a.m. every 20 minutes.

Terminals 1 2 and 3

You can walk between these three terminals though it may take you some time to get from one to the other. You'll likely be flying out of T1 or T2 as T3 is rarely used. T1 operates mostly non-Oneworld international flights that are outside the Schengen countries. Most flights within the EU/Schengen countries fly out of T2. If you do fly out of T3 it will likely be on a regional flight.

There are Priority Pass lounges in all three terminals:

T1 has the Cibeles Lounge after passport control near gate B26. This one features a sun terrace so make sure to go outside if the weather is nice.

T2/T3 has Puerta de Alcala Lounge near Gate D62 upstairs and the Puerta Del Sol Lounge near Gate E69 upstairs (this one has a small nap area).

Note that the Priority Pass lounges at Madrid airport only allow you to bring in one guest. If you don't have a Priority Pass Membership you can pay to access the lounge -- rates range from $40 - $42.

These terminals have a large collection of shops and restaurants -- you can find the full list here. Highlights are the Mama Framboise pastry shop in T1 after passport control and the Sibarium Delicatessen for traditional Spanish products like ham olive oil or cheese. You can also find Duty Free shops within the terminals.

A variety of services are also available in these terminals:

Luggage storage facilities are available in the arrival hall of both T1 and T2. Rates start at $7 per piece for up to two hours.

Currency exchange and ATMs are located in the arrival halls and other various spots within the terminals.

Play areas for children are located throughout T1 and T2. A breastfeeding lounge is available near the D gates in T2. Stroller rental is available after security in T1 T2 and T3.

Pharmacies are located in the public areas of both T1 and T2.

Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the airport but you have to register your name and email address.

Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe Chapel is located in the public area of T1 and the Nuestra Señora de Loreto Chapel is in the public area of T2.

AvGeeks should make sure to check out the miniature scale model of T2 near the D gate while art enthusiasts should go and see a statue by Colombian artist Fernando Botero outdoors in the arrival area of T2.

Terminals 4 and 4S

T4 and T4S are the newest additions to the airport. Oneworld long-haul flights on wide-body aircraft on airlines like American Iberia Royal Jordanian and Qatar leave from T4S while Iberia or British Airways flights to Milan or London leave out of T4.

To get to T4S you need to get on a short mini-train that's located within the airport. After going through security in T4 follow the signs for T4S where you'll have to go downstairs. The train comes every couple of minutes and takes about five minutes. Once you arrive have your passport ready as you'll need to go through passport control.

There are Priority Pass lounges in both T4 and T4S:

T4 has Plaza Mayor Lounge near the McDonalds (Schengen flights only).

T4S has Neptuno Lounge on the second floor after exiting passport control (non-Schengen flights only).

There are Iberia VIP lounges in both T4 and T4S too -- both of which have been renovated. Access is limited to those flying business class on Iberia or another Oneworld carrier or those holding Oneworld Emerald or Sapphire elite status. Those flying Iberia business class on flights longer than four hours and who hold certain Iberia (not Oneworld) elite status can also access the lounge.

T4 has the Dalí Premium Lounge which is just past security.

T4S has the Velázquez Premium Lounge which is just adjacent to the Duty-Free shop after passport control.

The Arrivals Lounge is located in the Arrivals Hall on Floor-1 near the Metro (look for Premium Air Rooms Madrid).

The Iberia Arrivals Lounge is actually located in the Premium Air Rooms Madrid which is a ""hotel"" that offers 22 guest rooms available for day or overnight use. Non-Iberia elite flyers can access this space by paying either a day (this may include a shower room and breakfast) or overnight rate. Iberia elite customers or business flyers that meet the aforementioned requirements can use the space to shower or have breakfast. Breakfast and shower rates start at $55 day rates at $91 and overnight rates at $172.

T4 has many high-end shops like Carolina Herrera and MaxMara as well as more affordable brands like Zara and Victoria's Secret as well as a number of Duty-Free shops. For a fancier dining experience eat sushi at Kirei by Kabuki.

A variety of services are also available in these terminals:

Luggage storage facilities are available in the arrival hall of T4. Rates start at $7 per piece for up to two hours.

Currency exchange and ATMs are located in the arrival hall and other various spots within the terminals.

Play areas for children are located throughout T4. Pram rental is available after security.

Pharmacies are located in the public area of T4 and the passenger-only area after security.

Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the airport but you have to register your name and email address.

The Chapel of Santiago is located in the public area of T4.

Ensenza by SHA spa has locations in both T4 near Gate J55 and T4S near Gate S24.

Getting from the airport to the city center

It's fairly easy to get from the airport to the city center. Taxis cost a flat rate of $36 (remember tipping taxis isn't customary in Spain) but you can usually do it for about $24 - $30 using a ride-hailing service like Uber or Cabify depending on traffic and exact destination. The Metro system is easy to use and a one-way ticket costs $5.50 which includes the added airport supplement. You can also take the bus 200 to Avenida America for $2 or the Express Airport Bus for $6 which runs 24-hours and makes just three stops: O'Donnell Cibeles and Atocha.

Renfe trains also have a line C1 which runs to T4 only stopping at Fuente de la Mora Chamartín Nuevos Ministerios Recoletos and Atocha. If you hold a Renfe AVE or Larga Distancia ticket with a same-day departure or arrival your ticket between any of the aforementioned stops to or from the airport is free. If not a one-way ticket costs $3.

If you have a day

If you have more than a seven-hour layover it's enough time to see Madrid and make it back in time for your next flight. Here are some ideas to spend a few hours seeing the sites of Madrid:

Madrid's green spaces and rooftops: Hop on the Express bus to Cibeles and get off to admire Cibeles Square. Head inside the Cibeles Palace to the rooftop where you can enjoy views of the famous Cibeles fountain Bank of Spain and the iconic Metropolis Building. Afterward walk up Calle Alcalá to see the Puerta de Alcalá monument and into Retiro Park. Wander through the canopies of trees to see the lake the Chrystal Palace (made almost entirely of glass) and the peacocks roaming the Jardines de Cecilio Rodríguez. Then stop at Florida Park a bar/restaurant inside the park for a snack or one of the many tapas bars along the nearby Avenida Menéndez Pelayo like Arzábal Retiro.

Madrid's history and architecture: Take the Renfe train to Sol hopping out to admire the city's most central square. Then using Google Maps do a self-guided walking tour starting with Plaza Mayor where 237 balconies face a central statue of Felipe III on his horse. Continue on to the touristy-but-wonderful Mercado de San Miguel where you can grab a snack and drink -- a cone of Iberian ham cured Manchego cheese or Spanish olives. Then head down Calle Mayor until you arrive at the towering Almudena Cathedral and the Palacio Real -- home to almost 3500 rooms.

Madrid's art triangle: Take the Express bus to Atocha and walk to the nearby Reina Sofia museum home to modern-art masterpieces by Picasso and Dalí. For a more classical art experience walk past the famous Plaza Neptuno and its epic fountain of Greek gods to the Prado Museum where you can view works by Goya El Greco and Velázquez. Or visit the Thyssen-Bornemisza which is home to an eclectic private collection of art with paintings by Caravaggio Degas Manet Van Gogh and more.

Madrid's shopping: Take the metro changing from the pink to the brown line at Mar de Cristal. Get off at Serrano and peruse some of Spain's most popular shops: Roberto Verino Bimba y Lola Uterque Aristocrazy Sito Murt Lladro and more including one of Madrid's largest Zara stores that's four floors high. Finish up with drinks and tapas at trendy food market Platea housed in a former theatre.

If you spend the night

Madrid has a number of hotels where you can use points and here are some of the top picks for a quick stay:

A sunset at the Hyatt Centric Madrid. (Photo by Lori Zaino/The Points Guy)

The Westin Palace Madrid is perfectly located across from the Prado Museum. Rates start at $304 or 50000 Bonvoy points per night.

The Hyatt Centric is ideal for those wanting to explore the famous Gran Vía and has a rooftop overlooking the street. Rates start at $268 or 20000 points per night.

The Hilton Madrid Airport is near the airport for those with a short layover -- and it has a large swimming pool. Rates start at $206 or 40000 points per night.

When the next fintech all-star is created in Latin America QED Investors plans to have a first crack at the company.

The venture capital firm has gained a foothold in the region where funding for startups remains scarce. It recently closed a $12 million fund named Fontes Latin for fountains that's earmarked for pre-seed and seed companies in Latin America. The fund is being led by an immigrant-entrepreneur and principal Ana Cristina Gadala-Maria.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The secret to attracting the best founders Gadala-Maria says is a deep bench of limited partners who are sourcing deals. The fund's investor base includes more than two dozen successful startup founders from Latin America who refer other entrepreneurs to the firm. Plenty of founders also know the firm's reputation so in other cases they reach out she said.

""The foundation is being set for this fintech explosion"" Gadala-Maria said. ""We are excited to be on the forefront.""

The venture industry has historically avoided the region because investors just didn't understand the market Gadala-Maria who was previously a strategy consultant helping companies better serve their multicultural customers said.

That's no longer the case. The startup scene in Latin America is scaling and venture capitalists are paying attention as Crunchbase News reporter Christine Hall writes. The total dollars invested in fintech companies in Latin America has increased almost every year since 2016 she reports and the mix of venture firms participating in deals is also diversifying.

They're often drawn by the investment prospects in fintech which are beating out the incumbent banks by offering lower costs and better customer service Gadala-Maria said. The region also has a heavily underbanked population.

The firm was founded by a cofounder of Capital One Nigel Morris and his right-hand-man Frank Rotman in 2008 a rough economic year. They set out to create a venture firm focused on financial services companies. But the firm's strategy was pretty unpopular at the time it was founded. The financial crisis had wiped out trillions of dollars of stock-market wealth and ""the world of financial services was not exactly attracting a ton of entrepreneurs and a ton of capital"" Rotman previously told us.

The two investors were like ""hammers in search of nails"" Rotman said. Their persistence paid off.

They placed early bets on startups such as GreenSky SoFi and Klarna a Swedish fintech that's now worth $46 billion. Credit Karma another early investment had one of the biggest exits in fintech last year with a $7 billion sale to Intuit.

Feelings about fintech have changed. The industry is exploding as more people bank and trade from their phones and banks seek to upgrade their infrastructure. The startups that help them do these things are seeing record investment.

Now the venture firm that made an early bet on fintech is taking another calculated risk in Latin America.

In 2014 QED made its first investment in Nubank and its first investment south of the border.

Nubank is the most important financial services company most people have never heard of. Based in São Paulo the financial center of Brazil the digital bank and credit-card issuer has 40 million users across Latin America. This week it raised a $750 million mega-round at a $30 billion valuation launching it into the pantheon of fintechs worldwide.

The startup is one of about 25 investments that QED has made in the region. They're mostly concentrated in Brazil and Mexico Gadala-Maria said but the firm wants to spread the new fund across Mexico Colombia Chile and Peru.

Haiti - Covid-19 : Cardinal Chibly Langlois health measures during liturgical assemblies





In a note addressed to priests members of religious communities and lay faithful Cardinal Chibly Langlois Bishop of Les Cayes reminds the health measures to reduce the risks of the spread of Covid during liturgical assemblies



Note from Cardinal Chibly Langlois :



For some time now there has been a strong upsurge in Covid-19 cases in our country.



Faced with this situation we owe it to ourselves to act as responsible people in order to be able to reduce the risks of contamination in our liturgical assemblies.



We therefore come to remind you of your obligation to apply certain measures taken during the first wave of the pandemic in our country.



Installation of a device for washing hands at the entrances to churches and parsonages;



Wearing a mask compulsory for ministers and the assembly;



Maintaining physical distance by reporting on the benches and marking on the ground in the main aisles of the Church;



Disinfection of the hands of the faithful who are going to receive Communion and of those who must handle the liturgical material;



The quest must be done after Communion;



Receptions during patronal festivals are prohibited.

“We stand by the fact it takes a village to raise a child” Ayesha an actress and best-selling cookbook author said. “To be that village in this instance is a no-brainer.”

The village this time included multiple volunteers working over four days to install a new playground structure and a basketball court and paint some 300 yards of murals much of it in the Golden State Warriors’ trademark blue and gold as well as build a raised garden that will help students access fresh vegetables right in their play space.

The upgrade was deeply needed by students said first-year principal Lusa Lai adding that none of the kids have seen the new structures in person. School is now out for the summer.

“They just deserved so much more; the old structure that we had literally had holes on the slides” Lai said. “When we come back to school I want to have a big welcoming party — socially distanced of course.”

The new playground was designed with input from students who were asked to draw their ideal play area she said. Students then got to vote on one of three designs sent back by KABOOM! a nonprofit that builds and improves playgrounds aimed particularly at underserved communities of color.

Among the students’ favorite elements were the two slides and track ride — tested and approved on Saturday by the Curry family — as well as a balancing boogie board.

Safe quality playgrounds are a “basic need” for children said Steph Curry the Warriors’ superstar who has become a fixture of the Oakland community since joining the team — which now plays in San Francisco — in 2009.

“You have some of your best memories on the playground playing basketball other sports going down on the playground slides and all that” he said. “It’s heartbreaking though in that that’s not a guarantee for every kid depending on where they live.”

The project is a collaboration of The CarMax Foundation KABOOM! the Oakland Unified School District and the Currys’ Eat. Learn. Play. Foundation. It was announced in November when the pandemic had kept many kids away from their school buildings for months. That absence affected students already struggling with a lack of access to quality play areas Lysa Ratliff acting CEO of KABOOM! said in a statement at the time.

Along the walls of the renovated space are murals created by Bay Area artist DJ Agana representing athletes activists and community leaders alongside messages like “Stronger Together” and “Believe.” The messages and faces were carefully chosen to inspire students showing them people who may not be superstars but made a positive influence in their community Lai said.

They include Marley Dias who founded the #1000BlackGirlBooks movement; Richard Aoki an early Black Panther Party member; and Sophie Cruz who at a young age became a prominent advocate for undocumented immigrants.

“We want them to dream big and we want them to lead” Lai said of her students about 90 percent of whom receive free or reduced lunch and nearly half of whom are English language learners according to data from the California Department of Education.

Steph Curry had visited the campus before Lai said and his and his family’s involvement in the new project sent a powerful message to students.

“For someone with his stardom to come and want to do this for the kids speaks volumes” she said. “The kids will know that you know what we matter. Even to Steph Curry we matter.”

“Coming from Toronto slash North Carolina we didn’t know a lot about the Bay before ’09 and it’s all we’ve known for the last 12 years” Steph said. “It’s an amazing community full of life full of inspiration full of potential and talent but opportunity is kind of far and few between so we’re committed to the work committed to opportunities to continue to leave some impact.”

That sentiment was echoed by Ayesha who alongside their daughters had helped paint part of a mural plant some of the garden and install the outdoor basketball court’s rubber flooring earlier in the day. The family later cut a ribbon made up of paper hands crafted by the school’s students.

“This is not about us so I just hope that this brings joy to the kids and peace of mind to the parents and the teachers that these kids have a safe place to play” she said. “They deserve that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGVzbGFtb3RvcnNjbHViLmNvbS90bWMvdGhyZWFkcy9tb2RlbC1zLWFjY2lkZW50LXRvdGFsLXRoZS1jYXItb3ItcmVwYWlyLjIzMDc4OC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Model S Accident TOTAL THE CAR or REPAIR?,Tesla FamI’m heartbroken. Never ever in my life I thought I’d be writing this but I got into a car accident. Last Sunday morning a lady failed to stop at the Stop at the Stop Sign and wrecked my baby. In 12 years of driving I’ve never had a ticket never ran a red light not even a single scratch - I drive like a granny. It is in the shop now and they are deciding between repairing the car or just deem it a total loss. Both doors on left passenger side are now gone and need to be replaced. After the hit airbags deployed and I was “Oh $hit”No injuries. And that’s great.I’m emotionally attached to the vehicle. I’m only 27 but for three years I was saving up every penny hustled on the weekends and finally was able to buy the car. And now she is gone. I’m a mess.insurance has been great (progressive) they sent the guy a few days later and he estimated 18k in damage.the Tesla approved body shop said it’ll be around 28k before teardown. The process will be finished this Tuesday and they will give us a final estimate. I’m 100% sure it’ll be more than 18k stated by the insurance guy.So please help me. What do I do:1) do we just total it and I fight with the insurance to get the correct amount2) do I authorize repairs and wait 8-10 weeks for parts etcI do have a rental.

On Saturday volunteers along with the Curry’s daughters Ryan and Riley helped plant flowers in the school’s new garden and paint murals that were designed by San Francisco artist DJ Agana. The unveiling of the new space was commemorated with a ribbon cutting.

In November when the initiative was announced to the children at the school Steph Curry said in a video he was looking forward to hearing from the kids about what they wanted in the new school yard so that it is designed specifically with them in mind.

Carnival Cruise Line

This year Carnival Cruise Line became the latest brand to introduce a new livery. In May the company announced that the new hull design of the new Mardi Gras will become a feature across the fleet as the company prepares to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2022.

The livery is highlighted by a stately navy-blue hull inspired by officers’ uniforms along with vibrant red and white accents running the entire length of the ship.

After the Mardi Gras the Carnival Magic (pictured above) was the first vessel to receive the new colors during a drydock in Marseilles.

Royal Caribbean International

Royal Caribbean International updated its livery in 2020 adding a larger name on the hull of the new Odyssey of the Seas. Unusually big the vessel name runs 87.4 meters down each side of the ship.

It’s the second new look for Royal Caribbean in the last decade.

The Quantum of the Seas launched in 2014 debuted a new color template for the company with a light blue hull.

The color scheme was later added on selected vessels including the recently “Amplified” Freedom of the Seas.

Celebrity Cruises

As part of the Celebrity Revolution program Celebrity Cruises is adding a new livery to its fleet. While undergoing the upgrades the company’s existing ships also receive the color scheme of the new Edge-cClass vessels that have a dark blue hull.

The livery has been added to seven of the 11 Celebrity ships.

Princess Cruises

Princess Cruises introduced a new livery in 2016 adding a giant version of its “sea witch” logo to the hull of the 2013-built Royal Princess.

The fresh look which also includes the repositioning of the ship’s name was later added to other vessels and is now present on the entire fleet.

Costa Cruises

In 2018 Costa C became another Carnival Corporation brand to introduce a revised livery. The subtle change saw the name of the ships painted on the bow with a specially designed new font in larger lettering as well as the addition of a stylized Italian flag.

The livery was created to mark the 70th anniversary of the Italian brand and has since been added to the entire fleet.

P&O UK

With the introduction of the 2015-built Britannia P&O Cruises also introduced a new paint scheme to its fleet.

The brand’s traditional funnels were repainted in blue with the addition of P&O’s rising sun logo. As part of the new livery the hulls across the fleet saw a stylized British flag added.

P&O Australia

In 2016 P&O Australia announced the addition of a stylized Southern Cross to the hull of its latest vessel the Pacific Explorer. Along with a new color and a new logo on the funnel the five-star constellation image became P&O’s new livery.

More recently the look was added to the Pacific Encounter the newest ship in the fleet.

Silversea Cruises

Silversea is introducing a new hull color to its fleet with a light gray adorned on the hulls of select ships.

Three vessels are currently sporting the updated color scheme including the new Silver Origin.

Under construction in Italy the newbuild Silver Dawn already shows the new gray hull as well.

Marella Cruises

To mark the addition of the former Splendour of the Seas to its fleet the TUI-owned Marella Cruises introduced a new livery in 2016.

Then called Thomson Cruises the brand created a new “wave design” in-line with TUI’s airplanes.

According to Marella the new branding was meant to keep the consistency across all markets and is now present on the entire cruise fleet.

Fred. Olsen Cruise Line

In 2015 Fred. Olsen debuted a new look on its fleet.. The new color scheme and livery represented the change of position for its product within the premium market the company said at the time.

The gray hull is a throwback to Fred. Olsen’s heritage when the first Black Watch and Black Prince were launched in the 1930s according to the company. The use of the “Cartier” red line refers to the company’s “Red Carpet” service level for every guest.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL3doaWNoLWNhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1zaGlwcy13aWxsLXJlbWFpbi1vbi1ob2xkLXRocm91Z2gtYXVndXN0LzUxODY10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which Carnival Cruise Ships Will Remain on Hold Through August?,"Now that Carnival Cruise Line has released its plans on which cruise ships will resume operations in July and August we now know which ships will have to remain on hold for just a little longer. We take a look at Carnival’s further suspension on select ships through August 2021.

Carnival Cruise Line Cancellations

On Thursday Carnival Cruise Line released its long-awaited plan on resuming operations in August. That followed the already released details for the ships that will set sail in July. With a more clear schedule for the summer we also now know which ships will have to remain suspended for even longer and that includes a total of eight cruise ships through August 2021.

Here is the list of the ships that will remain on hold through August:

Carnival Pride (Baltimore)

Carnival Sunshine (Charleston)

Carnival Ecstasy (Jacksonville)

Carnival Liberty (Port Canaveral)

Carnival Conquest (Miami)

Carnival Sensation (Mobile)

Carnival Glory (New Orleans)

Carnival Dream (Galveston)

Carnival Cruise Line has already stated that it continues to ramp up its plan to restart with even more ships in September. So hopefully some of the vessels will make a return sometime that month. Carnival Splendor and Carnival Spirit are based in Australia and those ships are on hold until September 17 and November 21 respectively.

Do keep checking for the latest updates as the situation remains very fluid and there could be further cancellations through September we’ll know more closer to the time. A lot does depend on the Conditional Sailing Order which is in place by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

A major reason why Carnival can’t just resume cruises for all ships is due to crew vaccination. President and CEO Christine Duffy has said that ships will only begin sailing again once all crew members onboard are fully vaccinated.

In recent weeks cruise ships have been in various ports including PortMiami Port Canaveral and Port of Galveston so that that crew can receive a vaccination shot. However that does take time including getting crew back onboard from their home country.

Options for Impacted Guests

So now that select Carnival cruise ships are suspended for even longer the cruise line has some options for guests detailed in a letter already sent out to those on affected sailings.

Carnival Cruise Line has fully automated the process for guests to choose an option regarding an impacted booking. It can all be done using an online tool which apparently makes the processing faster.

There are the options of a future cruise credit and onboard credit or a full refund if a guest no longer wants to take a cruise vacation with the cruise line.

President Andrew Evans said the entire family is excited to open its doors again and continue the family business of bringing smiles to the community.

“I'm just excited for things to start getting back to normal.” Evans said. ""I think everybody has just missed out on that joy that feeling of hope and fun.”

Evans is finding his joy again after shutting down his passion project for a full year. Evans Midland Empire Shows has been a family business for four generations. His grandfather and great grandfather built it from the ground up after World War II.

“I just love being able to pass this onto my children” Evans said. “They are seven and four so they’ve got some time to make up their minds there.""

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit and everything shut down it hit home for the Evans. Months went by without a call which turned into a full year of no income.

“Pandemic was hard. Bills are still due and you have to come up with payments but we had no source of income” Evans said.

As an incentive to get people back out to his carnival he partnered with Johnson County Health Department for free vaccinations. If you get the shot you get a free wristband to enter for one free session. Sessions run from 1 to 5 p.m. and 5 to 10 p.m.

You can find anything from flying elephants to spinning motorcycles and if you are up for it a friendly competition. Parents said it is a fun way to beat the heat.

“We just needed to get out. We passed this on the road and it seemed like a fun place to be” mother Willow Woodall said.

“Good weather… A lot of people are out having fun since COVID-19” Catina Champion said.

Evans said it is great to be back but even more so in his hometown.

“We love being in Kansas City we are Kansas City we’re local to Kansas City"" he said. ""We live here my kids go to school here… The Kansas City metro area is just home.”

[shareaholic app=""share_buttons"" id=""13106399""]

In recent years we have seen Pharmaceutical company megadeals that saw Takeda acquiring Shire for a total value of $81.7 billion Bristol-Myers Squibb’s acquisition of Celgene for $74 billion AbbVie’s $63 billion acquisition of Allergan and the proposed acquisition of Alexion by AstraZeneca for $39 billion. All of these acquisitions continue to have a lasting impact on the leadership and staff at these companies which collectively employ hundreds of thousands of employees worldwide. In addition there have been a plethora of product transfers between organizations with larger multi-national companies pruning portfolios adding gene therapy and biotechnology divisions and consolidating core assets.

Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the Pharmaceutical/Biopharmaceutical industry are critical for organizations to implement strategic changes to their business. Whether it be to (a) future proof an organization’s pipeline by accessing innovation (b) obtain additional manufacturing capacity or (c) to divest non-core assets (products facilities etc.) companies continue to grow modernize and evolve to meet the targets set out in their strategic plans.

When two or more organizations reach the ‘deal’ and it is announced that ‘A’ will take over ‘B’ or that A and B will share in ‘A-B’ or indeed that ‘A’ will sell part of their organization to ‘B’ it is frequently followed by uncertainty and apprehension among internal stakeholders. This changing landscape tests an organization’s ability to communicate the distinct ‘win-win’ elements of the deal. The Kübler-Ross change curve (see fig.1 below) is always worth having in mind during this transitional period of M&A and never fails in tracking the internal stakeholder mindset albeit with differing levels of severity.

Figure 1. Kübler-Ross Change Curve

The transition from pre-M&A to the post-M&A reality can be both fast and slow. The physical symbols of such transitions such as the company name logo and headed paper can be changed in a matter of minutes but the hearts and minds of management and employees can lag significantly further behind. It can take years before a post-M&A steady state is reached (sometimes never!) where full commitment to the change is obtained and all the anticipated ‘win-wins’ are realized.

Some acquired organizations are left to their own devices (pardon the pun medtech sector!) and they are run as true satellites whose contact with the corporate office is limited to communicating the positive financial results. In this scenario the management team in-situ at the time of the M&A event are trusted to continue as-is and maintain the upward trajectory. Alternatively and more commonly where there is a dominant merging partner a strict cut-over timeline is applied for an acquired entity to morph into a fully incorporated affiliate. Typically these sites implement corporate structures policies and systems swiftly and assertively.

Where M&A becomes can be interesting is the cultural piece; everyone who has worked in an organization through a merger or acquisition knows that there can be a seismic shift in the objectives of the new organization… not so much what the objectives are but how the objectives are expected to be met. Post M&A organizations frequently change structure with new reporting lines new titles merged departments increased/reduced layers of management with revised spans of control. Systems of work can also change where new policies are cascaded into procedures that are followed with varying degrees of success. Supporting systems software tools and information flows are further material changes that tend to require extensive training and oversight in the early periods post-M&A.

When cultures collide in merging organizations it has serious ramifications for business and its stakeholders. The industry is littered with mergers and takeovers that did not meet expectations simply because the cultural differences were too difficult to overcome. Naturally organizations do not admit to failed mergers or acquisitions too often but some of the more interesting ones are referenced below.1 Very often the differences in personal and collective discipline personified in the leadership differences in the two organizations is challenging for the organizations to reconcile. Where rigid structured and conservative management methods meet innovative and unorthodox management can be a recipe for M&A difficulties.2

At PharmaLex we believe we have a unique understanding of the cultural challenges experienced during Mergers and Acquisitions. Having merged ourselves in 2017 into PharmaLex we have insight in how to overcome the challenges of maintaining agility while benefitting from working in a bigger corporate environment having economies of scale with an increased resource pool. In addition we have supported numerous Quality and Regulatory functions through these challenging periods through Gap Assessments Benchmarking Studies Cultural Assessments Staff Augmentation Organisational Optimisation and Leadership Coaching and Mentoring.

In 2010 the specifications for the 13000 ton LPD project were changed and it evolved into a +25000 ton LHD project though confusingly it retained the PPD nomenclature. The first tender for the LPD project released in June 2000 was canceled with a second tender for the LPD Ship defined in the tender released 06 April 2007. As of early 2009 the preparation of RFP (Request for Proposal) for LPD (Landing Platform Dock) Project was in process and it was estimated that the RFP would be issued in October 2009. But over the years the requirements of the Turkish Navy changed so that the size of the LPD increased and Turkey began looking at an Amfibi Taaruz Gemisi Helikopter (LPH) or a Çok Maksati Amfibi Taaruz Gemisi (LHD) - Amphibian Attack Ship [taarruz means attack or offensive]. By 2010 the Turkish Navy was preparing to buy its first landing-platform dock capable of overseas amphibious force deployment as part of NATO and peacekeeping efforts.

A landing platform dock or LPD is an amphibious warship that transports elements of a landing force for expeditionary warfare missions. The landing ship dock will be required to be able to deploy a battalion-sized force of up to 1000 troops and personnel eight utility helicopters three unmanned aerial vehicles 13 tanks and 81 armored vehicles. The expected price tag of more than $500 million for the landing dock does not include the helicopters to be deployed on the ship.

The prime contractor for the $500 million project will be a local company but because of the high degree of technology transfer required there will also be heavy foreign-industry involvement. The Undersecretariat for the Defense Industry or SSM Turkey""s defense-procurement agency opened a competition in late February 2010 among seven domestic companies that are expected to establish partnerships with foreign counterparts including Italian South Korean Spanish Dutch French British and German firms according to procurement officials and business sources familiar with the program.

Procurement of this Turkish-designed helicopter carrier Turkeys first ""aircraft carrier"" would be capable of carrying four helicopters or four vertical takeoff jet fighter-bombers. A second carrier will be optional.

Levent Class LPD is a monohull vessel designed to perform amphibious and logistics support missions including heavy seas equipped with conventional all diesel-CPP propulsion system conforming naval norms/standards and classification rules.

Levent Class LPDs main purpose with the personnel vehicle helicopter and load carrying capacity onboard is;

to improve force projection capability to provide flexibility and expedition during amphibious operations to perform peace support public evacuation humanitarian aid and disaster relief operations while accommodating and supporting a battalion size force and operations head quarters

In addition to the LST project HAVELSAN the first dock landing ship of the Turkish Navy (LPD) the combat systems for the program are mandated to provide solutions. HAVELSAN's responsibilities in this regard are as follows:

The Lagos-based airline was founded by Babawande Afolabi an American returnee that holds the record as the youngest airline owner in Africa’s largest economy. The Osun State-born entrepreneur is in his 30s.

The company which is offering the cheapest airfare in Nigeria is coming into the market at a time when the prices of flight tickets have jumped to one of their highest levels.

Airlines in Nigeria have continued to increase the price of tickets because of the scarcity of dollar depleting fleet and the surge in demand for flights amid heightened insecurity in Nigeria’s inter-state roads.

With plans to start its flights from 24 June 2021 Green Africa is offering a 70 percent slash in airfares compared to its peers in the industry. The Lagos-based airline is commencing its operations six years after the day was first established.

Founded on 15 June 2015 by Afolabi who serves as the chief executive officer Green Africa describes itself as a low-cost carrier as it targets the low-income segment of the Nigerian economy that cannot afford the luxurious but expensive seats on the flights of other carriers.

Originally planned to start its operations in 2019 Green Africa Airways has received the necessary operating licences from the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority and is said to have placed an order for fifty A220-300s from Airbus while it also committed to leasing an additional three A220-300s aircraft from leasing company GTLK Europe. The leased aircraft will allow Green Africa to meet its planned launch of commercial operations this June.

Green Africa’s Board of directors consists of industry veterans including Afolabi’s former boss Tom Horton former chairman and CEO of American Airlines (Afolabi was a summer associate at American Airlines in 2013); William Shaw current CEO of Interjet; Virasb Vahidi former CCO of American Airlines; Wale Adeosun founder and CEO of Kuramo Capital; and Gbenga Oyebode founder and chairman of Aluko & Oyebode.

Before founding Green Africa Airways Afolabi worked in the finance and airline industries. His experience includes investment banking for financial institutions and emerging market clients at Morgan Stanley as well as corporate strategy at American Airlines.

The Political Science and Economics graduate of the Illinois Wesleyan University (2010) where he served as student body president is also the founder of Teatime Capital a venture capital initiative focused on making micro-equity investments to ultra-small Nigerian businesses in often overlooked regions of the country.

“Giving people microloans means giving them a shot at life” Afolabi said. “Small businesses give people the means to send children to school hopefully raising the literacy rates and lowering crime. It provides a new foundation for society.”

Born in Ile-Ife Afolabi who holds an MBA from Stanford Graduate School of Business (2014) plans to expand the low-fare service offered by Green Africa across the African continent after it kicks off in the most populous country in the region.

Having interned with Morgan Stanley on Wall Street an article published in Illinois Wesleyan University Magazine 2002-2017 said Afolabi was focused on bringing microloans to Nigeria. Afolabi according to the magazine applied for an internship with Sponsors for Educational Opportunity (SEO) which places minority students with some of the nation’s top companies.

“Of the more than 5000 students who applied for internships through SEO Afolabi is one of only 438 students to receive an internship working this summer for Morgan Stanley on Wall Street” the article said.

The oldest of five children Afolabi was raised to believe the world can be changed.

“My mother is an elementary school teacher and my father is a financial analyst on a very small scale” said Afolabi. “They both instilled in me the knowledge that education can make things better. I must learn all I can and build my credentials so the financial institutions in Nigeria will truly understand how this can help. Before people change the world they have to change themselves.”

Afolabi whose internship was in investment banking was one of only 48 sophomores granted an SEO internship in the summer of 2008. The SEO Career Program most often works with college juniors placing them in seven categories of internships ranging from accounting and corporate law to global corporate finance leadership.

“All of this will help when I return to Nigeria and speak to financial institutions there about creating a microloan program” Afolabi whose own father had a business idea that died away because he could not secure a loan for as little as $200 said in 2008.

According to Afolabi his father’s business idea could not flourish because he had no money no collateral and no connections to make it happen.

“There are so many people like him. I hope microloans can help. I hope they can be a lifeline for my people” he said.

Afolabi’s plans from his university days to help the most vulnerable segment of the Nigerian economy is coming to life today as he has been able to set up Teatime Capital a venture capital that is helping to invest in ultra-small businesses in Nigeria.

The reason for Afolabi’s decision to establish a low-fare airline is not far-fetched from his plan to provide products that can serve the low-income segment of the economy.

With the business model of Green Africa Afolabi is trying to attempt the ‘Southwest effect’ on air travel in Nigeria. Its first flight is days away yet the Lagos-based startup budget airline is edging closer to disrupting the Nigerian airspace forever. It has announced its entrance with cheaper airfares for seven routes including Lagos to Abuja a strategy that looks well suited to a large country where average incomes are low and rising insecurity is increasingly discouraging road travel.

Green Africa’s strategy is not new at least not on the global scene. It has a similar playbook to the world’s largest low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines. Southwest despite being a low-cost carrier has been able to stay profitable through many decades. It even has an economic term named after it popularly called “the Southwest effect”.

Southwest started out with an idea to make air travel accessible for all. While most carriers in the US focused on wealthy travellers it set out to disrupt the market by giving more people the opportunity to travel by air at a low cost.

Southwest Airlines focused on four main things: a low-cost structure that stayed low due to fast growth happy employees who liked their jobs and translated that to customers being future-minded and differentiated.

Green Africa just like Southwest is coming into the Nigerian aviation sector with a low-cost structure with fares between N16500 and N23000 which is about a 50 to 70 percent slash in average fares charged by other airlines. Although there have been questions as to whether the prices will remain low.

“I would not say the price they have started with will be permanent it is an introductory offer but you can be sure that if you pick the first three airlines in the country with the lowest fare in two or three months Green Africa would be one of them” Olumide Ohunayo a member of the Aviation Safety Roundtable Initiative (ASRTI) said.

“They have started with a very low-cost aircraft they are taking a smaller market that fits the Nigerian market and if they build on that and get good maintenance organizations continue with the same fleet get better deals with the manufacturer of such aircraft the maintenance and cost of operation would go lower their fares will not increase” Ohunayo said.

Despite the similarity in low fares differences such as fleet and routes make Green Africa different from Southwest.

Green Africa will use ATR72-600S jetliners a turboprop while Southwest operates Boeing 737 jet planes. Turboprops are generally more fuel-efficient than jets whose fuel usage is higher."

The caterpillars known as browntail moths are about 1.5 inches long and have white dashes down their sides and two red dots on their backs.

Browntail moths are most common along Maine’s coast and on Cape Cod but they’ve been spotted this year in all of Maine’s 16 counties said Jim Britt a spokesman for the Maine Department of Agriculture Conservation and Forestry.

“People are finding them everyplace: on the ground on the picnic table on the electrical box on the corner — you name it” Mr. Britt said. “They are heavily present. Folks will see them all over.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3Qtam91cm5hbC5jb20vbmV3cy90b3Atc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLzA2L2F0LWhvbWUtY2hpY2thZGVlcy1uZXN0LWluLWxhcmdlLW1hcGxlLXN1Z2FyLXRyZWUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,At Home: Chickadees Nest In Large Maple Sugar Tree,"I’ve found entertainment in my yard in the past few weeks. I’ve been watching Black-capped Chickadees nesting in a dead tree. The tree they chose is a large Sugar Maple whose top fell over in a storm seven years ago. The top has been cut and burned in the campfire or decomposing in the “messy” corner of the yard. But the wide trunk still stands strong — at least strong enough to still hold the clothesline. But soft enough for chickadees to excavate a small cavity to raise their young.

Watching this little bird family reminds me of my college apartment. There was a creek in the backyard. Most days there was a Great Egret standing in the creek still as a statue as it waited for a fish frog or other tasty meal to come into range of its long bill. We nicknamed this white lanky bird “Television” — mostly as a joke. But I think we also recognized the expectation to justify our time and find our entertainment in “normal” ways. So when just needed some time outside quietly doing a whole bunch of nothing near the creek we could say we were “watching television”.

But like television nature holds drama too. I first noticed the chickadees in mid-April. Their calling back and forth caught my attention. Then I noticed the small perfect circle of a hole in the tree. And they kept hanging around that spot. They were starting a nest inside this hole in the tree just big enough for the two adults and a handful of eggs.

After a quite few weeks I glimpsed a chickadee perched on the clothesline with a fat green caterpillar in their mouth. There must be baby birds! For the next week I watched. I watched as I ate dinner outside as I laid in my hammock took breaks from gardening and sat behind the lens of my camera. I watched as caterpillar after caterpillar after caterpillar was brought to that cavity by one of the adults.

Each time they wouldn’t come directly to the entrance. The adult would sit on the clothesline or branch nearby. They would make a soft “See-saw” call until the other adult came out. There was a quick exchange of a caterpillar and then they were off again.

I watched every morning as I let the dog out. If the dog was too frantic the chickadee would fly away not depositing the caterpillar with its mate. Presumably the chickadee saw the dog as a predator and did not want to reveal the location of the nest.

As I waited to see the chickadee return I wondered what would happen to that family if a predator — the neighbor’s outdoor cat the mostly likely — got one of the adult birds? How difficult the single parent life would be! As I crawled into bed in the comfort of my home I wondered about the sleeping arrangements in that tree. I hoped they were warm on the unusually cold evenings we had.

My yard is nothing special. Just a quarter acre lot in a rural village. I work to make my yard a place for relaxation and for play. A place of beauty for me and those that pass by. But also as a home for the other creatures we share the world with.

There is a sense of pride that my yard — and the surrounding yards — can sustain this chickadee family. Most bird parents forage for food close to home because the energy cost of traveling far is too great when one has to feed rapidly growing young and oneself. And most songbirds chickadees included feed their young protein- and fat-rich caterpillars despite what they eat other times of the year.

In his book Nature’s Best Hope Douglas Tallamy describes a study by Richard Brewer who counted the number of caterpillars that Carolina Chickadees (a close relative of our Black-capped Chickadee) brought to their nest. He found that parents brought 350 – 570 caterpillars a day to their nestlings. That means that over the typical nesting period of sixteen days chickadees collect 6000 – 9000 caterpillars.

I’m shocked that there are that many caterpillars and insects in my yard — and more! There must be more caterpillars to feed other bird’s nestlings and enough larva to continue on into adulthood to start the life cycle over.

And all this is because of the plants. They are the first step in the chain whose links are forged by who eats whom. Caterpillars eat the plants. Birds eat the caterpillars. Some plants support more life than others. For example the Norway Maple supports many many fewer caterpillars and insects then the oaks or the cherries. The Bee Balm is abuzz with tiny green bees while the Bearded Iris is fairly quiet. But I appreciate the much needed shade from the maple and delight in the blooms of the iris.

In working in and enjoying my little patch of land I don’t want perfection to get in the way of good. My casual observations will never reach the point of Brewer’s intensity and scientific significance. I will keep plugging along as best I can to develop this space as a home for me and for others including the four and the six legged and the winged kind. And regardless of what we are expected to do I know that watching and supporting the natural world is the right thing to do — however much we can manage in whatever way we can.

The Ideal eFrac Pump and natural gas reciprocating engines were deployed on a simul-frac operation in West Texas for a major operator and were fueled with customer-supplied field gas. The natural gas reciprocating engine will be the primary power source for the first NOV Ideal eFrac Fleet which is expected to be deployed by NexTier and NOV in the first half of 2022.

The reciprocating engines supplied by Caterpillar Inc. can output 2.5 MW of power at 13.8 kV. Mounted on a standard trailer this scalable power solution provides leading emissions reduction for a wellsite-based power source. Embedded in each unit is a control system that enables automatic load sharing across multiple engines. The reciprocating engines require minimal maintenance and are not hampered by emissions derating due to temperature and elevation. Field tests are ongoing and will be performed in multiple shale basins in the coming weeks.

""The NexTier team continues to set the bar for the future of low-cost low-carbon solutions for the oil and gas industry"" commented Robert Drummond president and CEO of NexTier. ""This latest achievement brings our team one step closer to the deployment of our first eFrac fleet. This power source provides a scalable fit-for-purpose solution that can meet the mobility demands required in today's fast-paced well completions environment.""

""Over this time we've had strong customer partnerships and have used their feedback to drive our machine development"" he said. ""In the case of the new MH3250 and MH 3260 we had clear demand from customers to bring in modern replacements for the 330D and 345 C material handler models. We've taken proven and durable legacy MH components and integrated them into our next-gen product architecture. This approach provides a new level of operator comfort technology and performance while maintaining the reliability and parts availability that our customers expect.



""With the addition of these new units we currently have six purpose-built models in our portfolio"" continued Uitermarkt. ""This includes four wheeled offerings ranging from 22 to 40 metric tons and now two track models at 50 and 60 metric tons.



""We've also focused on owning and operating cost improvements through optimized maintenance intervals and significant reduction in fuel consumption. Finally our electro-hydraulic controls provide maximum control for operators and open additional opportunities for new features in the future.""



Rich Knudson Cat's North American product application specialist for both material handlers and excavators emphasized that while these new models are built with the durability and tradition of the 330D and 345 C machines that have preceded them ""We're also leveraging the reliability of our existing components used on Cat next-generation excavators.



""In terms of maximizing productivity we've married the new engines with standard auto-reversing fans"" he said as an example. With respect to the safety aspects of the new machines he continued ""A lot of times you'll see a 3200 series-sized machine operate in a busy scrapyard with not only foot traffic but also motor vehicle traffic. To enhance that productivity and safety we've made rear and right-side side cameras standard as well as improved visibility.""



Tyler Adams COO of family owned SA Recycling a long-term Cat customer based in California with a total of 85 facilities across the U.S. and over 600 pieces of Cat equipment in operation including multiple new material handlers commented on the new 3200 series. ""Our first impression is that it's a beautiful machine from an operator standpoint"" he said. ""We've gotten really positive feedback from our operators. They love the horsepower the response time the cycle time and the technology that they built into these new machines has all been very well received.""



According to Vincent Migeotte Caterpillar's global product marketing and application specialist ""We only use Caterpillar-proven components and parts. Our customers like to move a lot of iron and scrap as quickly as possible as safely as possible. To do this we based these new material handlers on our next-generation platform which means the machines are fully electrohydraulic and share a lot of design philosophy with our earthmoving excavators.



""We are very pleased to have an extended range of purpose-built material handlers from the MH 2022 [weighing about 46000 pounds] up to the MH 3260 [weighing 133200 pounds]"" continued Migeotte. ""With this full range of Cat material handlers we want to serve different industries by offering a complete solution including waste and recycling transfer stations scrapyards and mill yards as well as barge and boat loading at ports and harbours."""

When casino giant Genting Group bought an abandoned resort site on Las Vegas Boulevard in 2013 with plans for a lavish project the deal sparked hopes for the sleepy north end of the Strip.

The area was blighted by abandoned hotel projects and sprawling tracts of land where big visions never materialized. Foot traffic was thin the area was poorly lit and overall it was just quiet especially compared with casino-packed sections of the boulevard a few miles away.

“It was dead” developer Lorenzo Doumani recalled.

Eight years later Genting is scheduled to open its long-planned project Resorts World Las Vegas on June 24. The north Strip isn’t in the kind of dire straits it used to be in but the new hotel could bring more tourists to the area and if history repeats itself a surge of visitors overall to Las Vegas who want to see the latest offering in America’s casino capital.

The $4.3 billion project is set to be a flashy property with lots of star power and is the first newly built megaresort to debut on the Strip in more than a decade — all at a time when Las Vegas’ tourism industry the backbone of the local economy is starting to find its footing after getting crushed by the coronavirus pandemic.

“We are trending in the right direction but we are far from recovered” said Jeremy Aguero a principal with Las Vegas consulting firm Applied Analysis.

Big offerings

Resorts World on the site of the former mobbed-up Stardust was initially supposed to open in 2016. But its debut kept getting pushed back and in real estate circles it was all too common for people to ask “What’s going on with Resorts World?”

The property which underwent design changes is massive by any measure featuring 3500 rooms more than 40 food and beverage spots a 5.5-acre pool complex a 27000-square-foot spa a 5000-person-capacity theater 250000 square feet of meeting space and a 117000-square-foot casino.

Its collection of retail stores is slated to include a Kardashian Kloset pop-up shop that will sell items from the reality TV family’s personal closets and the resort boasts a lineup of scheduled concerts from Celine Dion Katy Perry Carrie Underwood and Luke Bryan all of whom are slated to perform several shows.

Miley Cyrus is slated to perform there as well at a grand opening celebration July 4 that will be broadcast on the skyscraper’s 100000-square-foot exterior LED screen.

Resorts World also has an affiliation with Hilton that according to analysts could lure plenty of guests who want to use or earn points with the hotel chain.

‘Shiniest new property’

Industry watchers told the Review-Journal that Resorts World could initially siphon customers from competitors. Macquarie Capital analyst Chad Beynon for instance figures other high-end properties “will probably lose some business at least early on” given Resorts World’s room count.

Also simply being the newest destination in town gives people a reason to walk in.

People “want to see the shiniest new property on the Strip” Truist Securities analyst Barry Jonas said.

Casinos rely on plenty of walk-in traffic. According to Aguero of Applied Analysis the average visitor to Las Vegas goes to five properties while here and resorts will have guests who want to venture out to see the new one.

Tourism overall has often climbed in Las Vegas when a megaresort opens as people are drawn to the city because of the new property.

“It makes Vegas that much more of an attraction” said Doumani who expects to break ground this fall on Majestic Las Vegas a nongaming hotel off the north Strip.

Alan Feldman distinguished fellow in responsible gaming at UNLV’s International Gaming Institute said that over the past 30 years “new resorts have almost always expanded the market and brought new visitors.”

Feldman a former longtime executive with MGM Resorts International said it appears that “all of the stars are aligning” for Resorts World’s debut which he believes will spark more tourism overall and higher room rates across the market.

Travel to Las Vegas is already on the rise and Feldman said Resorts World is bringing “new consumer energy” with its amenities.

There are always customers who want to see the “newest and greatest thing” but even beyond that Genting could draw visitors from Asia as international travel restrictions loosen according to Michael Parks a hotel-casino specialist with real estate brokerage CBRE Group.

Genting based in Malaysia has locations in its home country and in Singapore among other places including New York. On the Strip Resorts World was envisioned early on to feature a live panda exhibit and a replica of the Great Wall of China and even though such offerings were later scrapped the property will “pay homage to Genting Group’s roots with Asian-inspired touches throughout the design and amenities” Resorts World Las Vegas President Scott Sibella previously told the Review-Journal.

Plus with the economy reopening vaccines rolling out and coronavirus restrictions being lifted tourism overall has been gaining momentum.

As Jonas of Truist Securities noted people want to visit Las Vegas after a year of not coming here “or going anywhere for that matter.”

‘Finally coming to life’

Boyd Gaming Corp. imploded the Stardust in 2007 to clear space for its multibillion-dollar Echelon project but halted construction in summer 2008 as the once-roaring economy was stumbling.

The unfinished casino was one of many abandoned projects that littered the valley after the frenzied mid-2000s bubble burst and one in a long line of failed supersized projects on the north Strip.

By the time Genting bought the site that stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard featured two halted partially built resort projects Echelon and Fontainebleau; the vacant former New Frontier site where plans by Israeli investors for a newly built luxury resort went nowhere; the empty former Wet ‘n’ Wild water park site where multiple plans including a 142-story casino-resort never left the drawing board; and the shuttered Sahara which was being transformed into the SLS Las Vegas.

Today the north Strip is by no means buzzing with activity everywhere. The former New Frontier site — now owned by Wynn Resorts Ltd. — and the Wet ‘n’ Wild plot — the site of along-stalled arena and hotel project by ex-NBA player Jackie Robinson — remain undeveloped. Also the 60-plus-story Fontainebleau still hasn’t been finished more than a decade after it went bankrupt under the original developers.

However the SLS after a volatile start traded hands in 2018 and the new owner launched a $150 million overhaul and renamed the property Sahara Las Vegas. The Fontainebleau was reacquired by its old developer in February albeit with no word on when it would open and construction of Resorts World has brought lots of people and activity to that once-quiet site.

Moreover the nearby Las Vegas Convention Center recently finished a $1 billion expansion that brought the facility even closer to the Strip. The first major trade show in the U.S. since the pandemic hit World of Concrete was held this month at the convention center’s new West Hall.

Southern Nevadans have long predicted a turnaround on the north Strip thanks in large part to Resorts World’s long-planned entrance.

That resurgence said CBRE’s Parks “is finally coming to life.”

When looking for real estate brands can take advantage of associations with neighborhoods that enjoy a distinctive character such as Beijing's 798 Art District a creative hub that is starting to attract luxury brands.

Pop-up stores can be effective for luxury brands that want to do something out of the ordinary to dial-up engagement as they provide a high impact on social media that helps drive traffic.

The surge in domestic luxury spending in China has placed extra pressure on retail location strategies. Shanghai is a prime example of a flourishing retail destination. According to CBRE Group retail leasing activity in Shanghai for Q1 of 2021 showed no signs of COVID-19 fatigue with net absorption rising to a record 28562 m². Momentum also remains strong with new retail projects underway in Shanghai’s riverside locations.

The blueprint for luxury brands deciding where to open shop revolves around finding a prominent and prestigious location: identify a high-status retail location to reinforce the brand’s positioning and of course connect with local luxury consumers. For example a Diesel Hub concept store recently opened at the six-story Shanghai-based shopping mall Grand Gateway 66 which also houses luxury brands like Tesla and Bottega Veneta.

It is an effective and predictable principle for finding retail locations. However the future challenge for luxury brands is to leverage their locations as competitive selling propositions while adding brand value in the process. In other words to look at a retail location through a qualitative lens and beyond the traditional quantitative metrics of luxury footfall data.

Here Jing Daily outlines four ways luxury executives can leverage location to stand out in an increasingly cluttered luxury retail space.

Luxury brands usually decide their locations based on where and how consumers choose to spend their leisure time as luxury retail is a consequence of those spots. The K11 Art Malls in Hong Kong Shanghai Guangzhou Wuhan Shenyang and Tianjin (with further mall openings planned) are destinations for appreciating art such as with the retrospective exhibition of Georges Mathieu currently at the K11 MUSEA.

This type of dedicated cultural retail environment is the raison d’être for luxury retail. Opportunities also exist within the growing domestic tourist and leisure sector notably in popular vacation destinations such as Sanya and Hainan. Similarly China's cruise tourism industry is expected to grow into the world’s largest by 2030 — a compelling reason why select luxury brands like Bvlgari are onboard Costa Venezia an Italian-themed cruise ship purpose-built for Chinese guests.

Burberry's decision to open its first social retail store at Shenzhen Bay MixC was no coincidence. The luxury label could have opted for China's fashion capital Shanghai but the store’s distinctive concept is technology-based. Shenzhen is China’s technology capital but it is also home to Tencent which provides the technology exclusively for Burberry’s social retail experience. Location synergies are not just at the city level.

Brands can also take advantage of associations with neighborhoods that enjoy a distinctive character. One example is Beijing's 798 Art District a creative hub that is starting to attract luxury brands including Shanghai Tang which opened a concept store in the vicinity of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art.

Pop-up stores can be effective for luxury brands that want to do something out of the ordinary to dial up engagement. They also provide a high impact on social media helping to drive traffic. Most pop-up stores are located in shopping malls but they can also provide temporary access via unconventional locations while lending the brand a creative edge.

Yves Saint Laurent had launched a hotel-themed pop-up store at the Shanghai Modern Art Museum — king-size bed and bathtub included. This approach also gives brands the benefit of identifying new locations that do not show up on the retail radar. Porsche China has 136 sales outlets concentrated in southeastern coastal cities and western regions. Pop-up stores provide Porsche the flexibility to venture to underserved yet potentially viable locations with minimal risk and cost.

While the location is critical the actual physical building is equally important for sending out brand signals. Heritage buildings are favorable and their scarcity in Chinese cities adds an extra sense of exclusivity. It reportedly took two years for Tom Dixon Studio to find the ideal location in Shanghai. Its recently opened hub in Xintiandi is situated in a traditional Chinese building that celebrates Shikumen a Shanghainese architectural style. Alternatively brands can recreate uniqueness. This route is strikingly exemplified by the Apple Sanlitun in Beijing designed by the architecture firm Foster + Partners. The standalone flagship store although located in a prime location opens out onto all four sides.

The location should not just be about to touch but also has to captivate the luxury consumer. Shopping malls in prestigious areas will remain a priority. Yet luxury brands need to consider how else chosen locations can deliver a competitive advantage. As luxury brands continue to expand their retail footprints it may be prudent for executives to take a step back before signing new leases. Their locations could make the difference between just meeting expectations or vastly exceeding a brand’s commercial potential.

The much-in-the-news startup with a market valuation of $85.7 billion based on outstanding shares went public via a highly anticipated direct listing in April — the first major cryptocurrency company in the US to sell stock publicly.

Now it’s taking a bricks-and-mortar stake in the Big Apple. Coinbase has quietly subleased 30000 square feet from Steven A. Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management at Related Co.’s 55 Hudson Yards sources reported.

It’s a small chunk of Point72’s total 339000 square feet at the tower but a big move by Coinbase which has increased its number of users to 56 million as interest in cryptos soar. It’s also interesting in that Hudson Yards has been mostly known for corporate media and law tenants — not tech.

“It’s a new brand of user not only for Related’s Hudson Yards but also for the entire far West Side area” said one market-watcher.

Reps for Related Point72 and Coinbase couldn’t be reached over the weekend.

Coinbase makes it relatively easy for customers to trade cryptocurrencies by using a “digital wallet” and charges a fee for each transaction.

The operation has been flagged for security breaches that affected a handful of customers but said it was taking steps to remedy the problem.

Trading has been choppy since its listing however. The stock soared initially trading at more than $341 a share in April as the price of bitcoin soared to an all-time high of around $65000. Shares on Friday closed at $223.93 a share.

Gap is reportedly one of the companies that are pulling sublease space off the market. Getty Images

Meanwhile the citywide sublease glut — which threatened to overwhelm the office market — is easing somewhat.

According to a new CBRE report the volume of new sublease offerings has begun to slow. Maybe more meaningfully some tenants “are now pulling [sublease space] off the market” as they anticipate reoccupying space as remote workers return to their desks the study said.

CBRE didn’t say which companies were doing that. But we’ve learned from CoStar listings and certain brokers that they include State Street Corp. Bank of Montreal Gap Inc. and Avon Cosmetics.



The 2 million square feet removed from the sublease market this year are a small share of the 19 million up for grabs since the beginning of 2020. But a trend seems to be in the air as more than half of the removals occurred in April and May.



Reflecting the improved retail-space market trendy custom furniture chain ModShop has expanded from 26 W. 20th St. to larger digs at 40 E. 19th St. where it’s taken 3000 square feet for a new showroom. The location was formerly home to Beckenstein Fabrics. The asking rent was $100 per square foot.

ModShop has locations in five cities including in Los Angeles where it builds most of its products.



The East 19th Street lease was brokered by Stacey-Robins Realty principal Stacey Kelz for the tenant and by Loria Management’s Yitzak Loria for the landlord.

Last week’s openings of chef Andrew Carmellini’s beautiful two-level restaurant Carne Mare and his burgers-and-sweets spot Mr. Dips marked a milestone for Pier 17 in the Seaport District Howard Hughes Corp.’s $750 million transformation of the old South Street Seaport.

All of the pier’s eating venues are at last fully up-and-running after years of postponements. We first reported Carmellini’s lease in 2018 but it remained dark even though construction mostly wrapped last year.

Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s The Fulton launched in 2019 but closed in March 2020. It’s now running full-tilt after a gradual reopening in stages.

David Chang’s Fuku went dark for more than a year before being replaced by an outpost of his Ssam Bar.

The missing eateries were the indoor-outdoor complex’s aching black hole. But now with Malibu Pier also open in the arcade and the rooftop Greens making customers happy as well (except in the rain) Pier 17 has finally delivered on its promise.

It's a mission to locate each piece of wire every tower even street light that might carry broadband internet access. Their goal is to help make broadband access maps more accurate.

“Learning about the end of the routes the end of the lines is very important to us” said Charles “Chip” Spann.

Spann is the director of engineering and technical services for Connected Nation an organization that helps assess broadband accessibility across the country.

Spann and his son Donovan along with a team of analysts have crisscrossed Caldwell County for the last two weeks working to identify where cable broadband infrastructure begins and ends and where fixed wireless service can be picked up. (Spectrum News is owned by Charter Communications a national broadband cable and telecommunications company and is not affiliated with this project.)

“It’s not because we’re trying to find where broadband is but we’re trying to find out where broadband isn’t” Spann said.

The mapping project in Caldwell County is one of 27 being conducted or set to be conducted in Texas this year. Each project is privately funded through coordination with the Texas Rural Funders the first fully privately funded project Spann said he’s ever worked on.

“Water electricity are essential utilities - and I would add that broadband is a third essential utility needed for individuals and communities to thrive” said Abena Asante senior program officer with the St. David’s Foundation.

The St. David’s Foundation which focuses on addressing regional health care challenges is helping fund broadband mapping efforts in Caldwell and Bastrop counties - two counties in its namesake hospital’s service area. Asante said the concept of digital equity goes hand-in-hand with the foundation’s goal of health equity.

“If we want a healthy community it’s important that the community has access to broadband and connectivity” Asante said.

Here’s why the mapping element is so important to that mission: current federal broadband maps are drawn by census block a method Spann says is flawed.

“What you see on the map represents a provider that has indicated that census block to our right is served by broadband” said Spann showing off how FCC mapping of broadband availability is displayed. “And as you can tell when we look to our right it’s just a big empty field. The way the mechanism works is if one person in the census block has coverage the FCC treats it as if everyone in the entire census block has access to equal coverage service.""

Spann said that mechanism mapping out FCC Form 477 data can often lead to broadband coverage being overstated. That’s why his and his son’s work is so important.

“Because that overstatement occurs it can prevent rural areas of the state from being able to receive state or federal funding for broadband expansion” said Spann.

That’s problematic for communities trying to upgrade and/or build out existing infrastructure. It’s an issue the Spanns know personally back at home.

“I don’t have access to broadband” said Spann who receives internet access with a 15 Mbps download speed and 1 Mpbs upload speed. The official FCC definition for broadband is a minimum of 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload. “And I live in an area where the federal maps show that I should be receiving service from the cable company and a fixed-wireless provider. And that’s why my home will not have an improvement until the federal maps get fixed.”

Until those maps get fixed the Spanns will remain on the road working to make broadband access maps more accurate helping rural communities tap the resources they need in order to thrive in a digital age.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 biggest oil companies in USA.

The oil industry got clobbered in 2020 and continues to face volatility amid the coronavirus crisis. However oil investors are hopeful as countries begin to vaccinate their populations and industries restart their operations. Recently the International Energy Agency said in a report that it expects oil demand to hit 100.6 million barrels for the first time since late 2019 in the last quarter of 2022. However the agency noted that the slow pace of vaccinations in Asia could dent the expected recovery.

Nonetheless analysts believe that oil companies have seen the rock bottom and are set to gain in the coming months. Despite the global push towards renewable energy and price fluctuations the oil industry is expected to thrive for years to come with major oil companies like Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) Chevron (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) expecting huge profits.

Chipotle recently raised prices about 4% across the board.

The company says price increases are due to increased employee wages.

CEO Brian Niccol made $38 million in 2020.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Chipotle raised prices across the menu by about 4% in June a move the company says was prompted by increased wages for workers.

The average Chipotle meal will cost 30 to 40 cents more than it did before and a spokesperson told Insider that the price hike will compensate for the recent wage increases for workers. In April the fast casual chain said it would raise average hourly wages to $15 per hour by the end of June an increase of $2 over the $13 an hour average pay.

While Chipotle attributes raising menu prices to the growing price of labor some analysts point to high CEO compensation as another factor. In 2020 CEO Brian Niccol took home $38 million $1.24 million of which was his base salary. The rest was made up of other incentives and an annual bonus.

""Brian Niccol 's annual compensation package is based on a competitive analysis of CEO pay levels within our peer group and is designed to pay for performance"" a Chipotle spokesperson told Newsweek when the pay report was released.

Niccol 's compensation was 2898 times more than the median Chipotle worker's $13127 salary in 2020 based on an employee working 25 hours a week in Illinois. Companies are required to disclose the ratio of CEO pay to the pay of a median employee. At Chipotle that ratio is 1129 to one. Across the board the pay ratio of CEOs to workers averaged 830 to 1 in 2020 according to the Institute for Policy Studies.

Higher labor costs do eventually lead to higher prices for customers but experts say the difference isn't as stark as some might expect. A study from California State University San Bernardino found that for a minimum wage increase of 10% food prices increase by just 0.36%.

According to Chipotle's proxy statement executive compensation is aimed at maintaining ""a level where we can successfully recruit and retain industry leading talent critical to shaping and executing our business strategy and creating long-term value for our shareholders.""

""For 2020 Brian's compensation includes the value of a one-time modification that is not reflective of his ongoing pay package"" a Chipotle spokesperson told Newsweek. Niccol made $33.5 million in 2019 an increase of about 13%.

In 2020 Chipotle's revenue grew 7.1% to $6 billion with much of the growth attributed to an explosion in digital sales. In a year that was disastrous for many restaurants Chipotle opened 161 new locations expanded its Chipotlane drive-thru footprint and stock prices increased 65.7%.

The distance between worker and CEO pay grew wider than ever during the pandemic of the past year The New York Times reported. The largest CEO compensation packages are for tech company executives. Chipotle does stand out among fast food and fast casual restaurant compensation though. Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson took home $14.7 million. McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski received $10.8 million.

Critics of sky-high CEO pay like the Economic Policy Institute say the enormous compensation packages are ""a major contributor to rising inequality that we could safely do away with.""







""This escalation of CEO compensation and of executive compensation more generally has fueled the growth of top 1.0% and top 0.1% incomes leaving less of the fruits of economic growth for ordinary workers "" EPI said in a report released last year.

Labor costs might have increased for restaurants over the last year but so did the price of ingredients. Staple Chipotle items like corn and avocados grew more expensive this year as demand rose and shipping delays drove prices further up.

""Ingredient costs there's talk about it. We'll see where that leads"" Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung said at the Baird Global Consumer Technology & Services Conference. The company says there are no plans to further increase prices right now.

Being ""born into the hospitality industry"" Smock has a history of working in the service industry first at his grandfather's bowling alley in Davison Mich. during his childhood and then in the Chicago food and beverage industry most recently as a consultant.

When the restrictions around the coronavirus pandemic put a halt to plans Smock decided to do something about it. Taking what he's learned and joining together with three other investors the hospitality guru opened his own business.

New cocktail bar The Hummingbird Lounge opened in April along Michigan 12 in New Buffalo just blocks away from the Lake Michigan shoreline. Owners transformed the 1901 Victorian-style home into a place that offers ample private party space outdoor seating and an atmosphere that is ""soft comfortable and lush"" to attract thirsty customers who owners compare metaphorically to hummingbirds.

""Hummingbirds drink all day … so if we're going to build a place and be open all summer long having a hummingbird as a mascot is a good time"" Smock said.

Focusing on classic cocktails with a twist the bar offers such specialty options as an old fashioned that uses rum instead of whiskey a smoked pineapple margarita with seasoned and wood-smoked pineapple and tequila a house Negroni with all the ingredients of the three-part classic cocktail but utilizing a three-blend house vermouth and a HRG Manhattan named after Smock's grandfather who preferred the cocktail above others.

But in striving to offer a hospitable and unpretentious atmosphere the bar also can serve simpler cocktails that customers can find anywhere. However with no soda gun and utilizing seasonal fruits for garnishes peeled freshly or freshly muddled for each drink the attention to detail is still there.

""If somebody wants a Tito's and soda we have both those things and we will do it happily and quickly"" Smock said. ""The components that go into a cocktail even for something that is pretty simple and available at every bar in America will still get the same thoughtful process as something else is.""

In an attempt to assist businesses last year during the pandemic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation allowing carryout cocktails through 2025.

Seizing the opportunity Smock has worked with a printing company to print labels to five signature cocktails listing their ingredients and instructions (such as shake when ready to drink for the margarita) and place it onto peanut butter-shaped plastic containers.

Any cocktail can be made to-go but at the ""Rollaway Bar"" portion of the business — named after Smock's family-owned bowling alley — they will be readily available to take and go.

The outdoor bar which has been converted from a garage space also will offer frozen cocktails such as Name Your Sour with a sour base that can be topped with the customers' spirit of choice and also a weekly rotating slushy cocktail option.

""We can package drinks to go and they can take it to the marina or take it to the beach"" Smock said. ""And then we will dedicate a portion of the garden space also in case people want to hang out.""

Although drinks are the focus the business also offers a small food menu that is focused on ""what you might like to eat while drinking."" Options include a crab dip house fries pork tacos and meats and cheese platters. Like the cocktail menu the food menu will rotate based on seasonality and utilizing local ingredients when possible.

The Hummingbird Lounge is open Wednesdays through Fridays from 4 to 11 p.m. Saturdays from noon to 11 p.m. and Sundays from noon to 8.

A Grade II* listed church is to be redesignated as a Minster in recognition of its work in the community.

St Mary le Tower in Ipswich will be given the status next year to coincide with the 825th anniversary of the town being granted a Royal Charter by King John.

The charter was signed by the King in the churchyard in 1200 - although the building was largely rebuilt in the mid 19th Century.

The Church of England in Suffolk made the official announcement on Thursday.

What is a minster?

The status of Minster is bestowed on major churches of regional significance within the Church of England.

The term dates back to the 7th Century and the status helps reflect the church's importance and contribution to the local communities it serves.

In the past 30 years just 15 churches have been granted the status nationally and in total there are only 31 Minsters in England.

Some of these include Hull Minster Lincoln Cathedral and York Minster.

The name of St Mary le Tower will remain in this case the church said.

Why is St Mary le Tower being granted Minster status?

St Mary le Tower earns the status as a vital contributor to local community life.

As well as church services and choral performances that encourage participation from young people it offers a ""top up shop"" for local residents facing financial hardship.

The church has a regular weekly food delivery from FairShare and also now collects additional food from a local supermarket.

A small number of essential toiletries are also generously provided from FIND and church members.

'Community work'

The Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich the Rt Revd Martin Seeley made the announcement following months of wide-ranging consultation to assess whether St Mary le Tower should receive this designation.

According to the church the decision ""sets in motion a development plan to strengthen St Mary le Tower's response to the needs of people living in and visiting central Ipswich"".

There will be no change to the way the church is governed or financed and there is no change to its legal status or name.

The honour acknowledges the church's work in the local community and does not alter its relationship with neighbouring churches.

What does Minster status mean for Ipswich?

The Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich the Rt Revd Martin Seeley said the church would continue to serve the local community [Church of England Suffolk]

The Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich the Rt Revd Martin Seeley said this recognition was ""a sign of the continued commitment to strengthen the ties between the Church and our civic and community partners as together we seek to service the people of Ipswich.

""I look forward to the new ways in which all churches including the newly created Ipswich Minster will be a part of the transformation and flourishing of the town’s future"" he added.

""Now we will focus on the minster-making process and share those important details in due course.""

The Reverend Tom Mumford vicar of St Mary le Tower said their mission was ""to be a welcoming inclusive and open church offering peace and sanctuary to the people of Ipswich"".

""We want to be a place that the people of Ipswich know as their home a place of care and support"" he explained.

""We also want to be a place that people come to Ipswich to visit to enjoy the beautiful and historic building as well as the remarkable town in which it is set.""

'A new chapter'

The Mayor of Ipswich Lynne Mortimer said the move was a ""testament both to the rich heritage and spiritual significance of St Mary le Tower to the town"".

She added it marked a ""new chapter"" in the life of the church.

Terry Baxter BID chair of Ipswich Central similarly welcomed the news.

""The church is currently recognised as the civic focal point for many in the town centre and plays such an important role in engaging with the people of Ipswich"" he said.

John Dugmore chief executive of the Suffolk Chamber of Commerce said Minster status gave the church ""an even more important role .. in bringing together the county town’s incredibly diverse communities"".

Here's what that means for the organization's future,"Bishop Karen Oliveto is retiring in a few months as a United Methodist bishop.

Oliveto was emotional saying those words aloud. As the church's first openly gay bishop her path was not always certain.

""Every day of my ministry I've had to wonder is this the day my ordination will be taken from me?"" Oliveto said.

That is until this year's United Methodist General Conference the church's global legislative body voted to overturn every ban on LGBTQ people. The historic changes include a new definition of marriage as a lifelong covenant between ""two people of faith"" rather than solely between a man and a woman and a repeal of its ban on LGBTQ clergy.

The General Conference also struck down a 52-year-old stance on homosexuality being ""incompatible with Christian teaching.""

""To hear someone say 'we need to repent of the harm we've done.' I didn't realize my body was waiting for that"" said Oliveto.

The changes which are effective immediately open new doors for LGBTQ members. One 24-year-old who wished to go by J.M. is working toward becoming ordained as a deacon in the United Methodist Church.

""We have been here and we have been fighting and our fight has been worth it"" they said. ""It shows that progress can happen and has happened.""

J.M. said they felt they needed to navigate around their identity as part of the LGBTQ community and not address it directly until the General Conference.

""Queer kids … the church once told them 'you're loved' but then made that love conditional when they started to question their sexual orientation or gender identity"" said Oliveto. ""They're going to hear 'We love you. We want you to be who God made you to be.' That is huge. Lives will be saved.""

The General Conference overwhelmingly supported the end of anti-LGBTQ church laws after more than 7600 mostly conservative congregations chose to disaffiliate from the United Methodist Church by the end of last year. That equates to about a quarter of U.S. Methodist churches.

Those U.S. congregations were able to leave because of a 2019 special General Conference that passed a plan for congregations that wished to depart for ""reasons of conscience"" regarding human sexuality.

There was widespread joy and celebration at the General Conference that concluded on Friday but there are still global members including those from central conferences in Africa Europe and the Philippines who do not stand by the new changes.

Some African delegates protested after the vote on changing the church's stance on marriage according to the United Methodist News Service.

Reverend Jerry Kulah a delegate from Liberia said at the rally ""We do not believe we know better than the Bible.""

The General Conference also passed a constitutional amendment known as worldwide regionalization which means many congregations that disagree with the church's new inclusive stance on LGBTQ people will likely be able to make adjustments that fit their beliefs.

Regional conferences could customize parts of the Book of Discipline which outlines church laws instead of needing to conform to judgments dominated by the U.S. That includes the ordination and marriage of LGBTQ members.

The regionalization amendment must receive support from at least two-thirds of annual conference voters who are part of local governing bodies. The votes will likely not be finalized until late next year.

Even with regionalization at play some congregations may choose to depart the United Methodist Church.

Many congregations that left by the end of 2023 joined the Global Methodist Church which launched in May of 2022 and has rules against LGBTQ ordination and marriage.

Keith Boyette a former United Methodist Church member who is overseeing the Global Methodist Church during its transitional period said the Global Methodist Church now has more than 4500 churches about 90% of which are in the U.S. It will hold its General Conference in San Jose Costa Rica in September.

Boyette does not think regionalization will be helpful for the United Methodist Church.

""I believe in the long run there will be a decline in the membership of the United Methodist Church because of the decisions it has made"" he said.

But Bishop Karen Malone the president of the Council of Bishops of the United Methodist Church is confident regionalization has the ability to strengthen the church.

""It allows for a more contextualized ministry in order to address the specific social and cultural contexts"" she said.

Malone recognizes that some congregations still may decide to leave following the decisions made at the General Conference. But she also believes that ""others will come home"" she said. ""That some were waiting and have left for a season.""

As the church moves forward Malone said there is a renewed spirit of hope with the stance that all people are fully welcomed into the total life of the church.

As Oliveto reflects on the changes and prepares for life beyond the ministry she said ""I feel like I'm leaving the church better than I found it.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjEwMTFub3cuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvcnVyYWwtY2h1cmNoLWZpbGxlZC13aXRoLW1lbW9yaWVzL9IBVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjEwMTFub3cuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDgvcnVyYWwtY2h1cmNoLWZpbGxlZC13aXRoLW1lbW9yaWVzLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rural Northwest Nebraska church filled with memories,"SIOUX COUNTY Neb. (KOLN) - If you are traveling in far northern Sioux County you might want to drive by the Montrose Church which is located on the Oglala National Grassland.

We caught up with Mary Jayne Jordan to talk about some of the memories she had of attending services at the Montrose Church while growing up.

“What I remember is no air conditioning” Jordan said. “I also remember in the summer time the windows were open and you would smell sage in the air. Whenever I smell sage I go right back to Montrose in my mind.”

The Montrose Church can be found on Hat Creek Road and Road 958 in Sioux County.

“The church was built in 1887” Jordan said. “The immigrants who came to that area were mostly all Catholic so they chose to build this church. They wanted to have a gathering place to worship.”

There was a former village named Montrose that was established there for a time. The village no longer exists.

“My dad and his sisters went to school across the road from the church” Jordan said.

Amazingly the structure that still stands today is the one that’s been there since the beginning. It’s never moved or been damaged. A local family now provides funding to keep the building looking good.

“At one point they built a rectory for the priest to stay in” Jordan said. “But again it’s so remote priests are in high demand so we always had a traveling priest. They eventually sold the rectory and it moved north of Ardmore. The church closed in 1973.”

We are told supporters of the church try to hold an honorary mass there once a year.

“My older brother and I were my sister’s godparents in 1968” Jordan said. “She and a cousin of ours were the last two children to be baptized here when it was an active parish in 1968. There have been weddings since then but it’s not been an active parish since 1973.”

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

CINF,Cincinnati Financial,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzEyLzMtZGl2aWRlbmQtc3RvY2tzLXlvdS1jYW4tdHJ1c3QtdG8tcGF5LXlvdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Dividend Stocks You Can Trust to Pay You,"These three dividend stocks have shown consistent earnings growth while increasing their payouts annually.

When searching for dividend stocks there are a few things you want to consider. Of course you want a company that has an attractive dividend yield and anything above 2% to 3% is generally considered to be pretty good. High yield isn't everything though -- you also want to make sure the company has a history of steady earnings growth. Increasing profits provide a company with stability which allows it to not only make consistent dividend payments but also to raise those payments on a consistent basis.

These traits are ideal in dividend stocks and they're why Arbor Realty Trust (ABR 0.30%) Cincinnati Financial (CINF 0.20%) and United Bankshares (UBSI -0.06%) are all great dividend stocks you can trust to pay you year after year.

Arbor Realty: A REIT with a high yield

Arbor Realty is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on the multifamily housing sector with 81% of its total loan portfolio made up of these loans. The multifamily housing space has high barriers to entry which gives Arbor Realty a competitive advantage and provides stability to its earnings.

Multifamily loans tend to be less cyclical than single-family housing which can fluctuate depending on market conditions. In times of recession individuals are less likely to take out mortgages for single-family units. However housing is always in need and those individuals would be more likely to look toward multifamily units to rent. That's why multifamily housing tends to weather recessionary conditions better than single-family housing.

Not only that but multifamily loans are protected against prepayment. This means you don't see a big rush of refinancing in the space when rates are lowered. As a result earnings don't see such large fluctuations as single-family real estate companies.

Arbor Realty has done a good job of growing its loan portfolio which is up 29% on a compounded annual basis since 2015. This strong portfolio growth has resulted in net interest income growth of 15% compounded annually and 29% compounded gains in net income since 2015. Thanks to its stellar growth rate Arbor Realty has increased its dividend payout for nearly a decade straight and pays investors a 7.1% yield to boot -- making it a high-yield dividend stock you can trust.

Cincinnati Financial: A Dividend King

Insurance companies are another good source of income stocks. That's because insurance is a relatively straightforward business -- companies underwrite policies and if they manage risk properly they make an underwriting profit. With these excess profits companies put the money to work in the financial market to generate some form of investment income. Insurance companies can be a cash cow and a great source of yield in your portfolio as well which is why Warren Buffett has often called the insurance industry Berkshire Hathaway's ""most important sector.""

Cincinnati Financial is a property and casualty insurer that has increased its dividend payout for 61 years straight. This makes it a member of the exclusive Dividend Kings group of stocks. A Dividend King is a company that has increased its dividend payout for at least 50 years straight and only 27 companies currently hold the title.

The insurer has managed to increase dividends for so many years thanks to its capital management and underwriting profitable policies. Last year the company posted a combined ratio of 98.1%. Combined ratio is an important measure of profitability in the insurance industry; anything under 100% means you are earning an underwriting profit. In the past five years Cincinnati Financial has achieved an average combined ratio of 96.1%.

As a result it has seen its earned premiums grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6.2% -- above average for its industry. Continued growth in premiums coupled with underwriting profitable policies make Cincinnati Financial another trustworthy income stock that yields investors a solid 2.1%.

United Bankshares: The unheralded income stock

United Bankshares isn't a Dividend Aristocrat but it's not for a lack of increasing its dividends. The regional bank has raised its dividend payout for 47 years straight. The only reason it's not included with the Dividends Aristocrats is because it's not an S&P 500 company -- making this regional bank an under-the-radar dividend stalwart.

Last year it increased net income by 11.1% despite the pandemic. This was boosted by its mortgage banking activity as well as its expansion into the Carolinas with its purchase of Carolina Financial.

In the first quarter this year interest income was up 14% compared to last year to $206 million. The bank was boosted by a drastic reduction in provision for credit losses as well as income from mortgage banking activities. This helped net income increase 166% over last year to $107 million.

United Bankshares has done a stellar job of increasing net interest income and net income over the past decade as well achieving compound annual growth rates of 10% and 14% respectively. Not only that but it pays out a solid 3.7% dividend yield making it another solid dividend stock you can trust.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNhdGhvbGljdGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9sZWdhY3ktcHJvbWlzZS1ob3BlLzc1MjYx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Closer Look: Mount Saint Mary's Seminary Legacy Promise and Hope,"by Dr. Kenneth Craycraft

While the Archdiocese of Cincinnati celebrates its bicentennial in 2021 Mount St. Mary’s Seminary & School of Theology founded in 1829 will have to wait a few more years. Nonetheless the milestone anniversary of the archdiocese is an appropriate time to consider the past legacy present promise and future hope of Mount St. Mary’s. As the third-oldest Catholic seminary in the U.S. it serves the Church far beyond the boundaries of Western and Southwestern Ohio. While its core mission remains the education and formation of priests for the Archdiocese of Cincinnati Mount St. Mary’s has an expanding national influence.

LEGACY

The Diocese of Cincinnati’s first bishop Edward Fenwick founded St. Francis Xavier Seminary on Sycamore Street in Downtown Cincinnati near the location of the present St. Francis Xavier Church. That first class had four seminarians and six preparatory students. Two years later a college of liberal arts for lay students the Athenaeum was established next door. In 1839 St. Francis Xavier Seminary moved to Brown County but the location proved to be impractical and so it was moved back to Cincinnati after a few years.

In 1851 Bishop John Purcell moved the seminary to Price Hill and renamed it “Mount St. Mary’s Seminary of the West.” The name change was partly to avoid confusion with the new St. Francis Xavier College (now Xavier University) after the Society of Jesus assumed control of the Athenaeum and renamed it thus. But the name change was also an homage to Mount St. Mary’s Seminary in Maryland (the second oldest in the U.S.) where Bishop Purcell served as president and rector before moving to Cincinnati. Due to a financial crisis in 1879 the seminary closed its doors reopening in Price Hill in 1887. And in 1890 a separate college seminary St. Gregory’s Seminary opened in Mount Washington.

In 1923 under the leadership of Archbishop John Moeller the seminary moved from Price Hill to a newly erected building in Norwood. It operated in Norwood until 1982 when it moved to its current Mount Washington location on the former campus of St. Gregory Seminary which closed in 1980. (The Norwood campus on Moeller Avenue is the current site of Our Lady of the Holy Spirit Center.)

PROMISE

In 2020 the seminary was rebranded as Mount St. Mary’s Seminary & School of Theology. The primary purpose and core mission of the institution is as a seminary to form and educate men for the ordained priesthood. But the name change also reflects the institution’s continuing commitment to lay education and ministry which began in 1975 with the creation of the Lay Pastoral Ministry Program now operating as the School of Theology.

In the just-completed academic year 85 men were enrolled in the seminary division and 67 lay students were enrolled in various degree or certificate programs in the School of Theology. While some seminary students may also complete Master of Arts degrees all who finish the program receive the Master of Divinity degree leading to their ordinations to the priesthood. Lay students are enrolled in programs for the conferral of a Master of Arts in Pastoral Ministry a Master of Theology or one of two slightly less strenuous certificate programs.

Of the 85 seminarians approximately 50-percent are from the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. The other half are from other dioceses or religious orders that have sent their men to Mount St. Mary’s for formation and education. These include the Ohio dioceses of Toledo and Youngstown as well as the dioceses of Tulsa OK; Kansas City MO; Louisville KY; Charlotte NC; Fort Wayne/South Bend IN; and the Congregation of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri and the missionary order of the Fathers of Mercy. This reflects the confidence that these dioceses and religious orders have in the formation and education that their seminarians receive at Mount St. Mary’s Seminary.

HOPE

Despite the many challenges for the Church in the U.S Mount St. Mary’s Seminary & School of Theology is a sign of hope for the future of the Church. Over the last three years the Archdiocese of Cincinnati has ordained 21 new priests in addition to those ordained in other dioceses. The 2021 class of nine priest ordinations matches the 2019 class as the highest number over the last 40 years. And the enrollment trend of the seminary indicates that these numbers will continue at or above these levels. To meet this growing trend the seminary opened a new residence building in 2019 Fenwick Hall which brings its residency capacity to more than 100 men.

This hope is consistent with the conclusions of Franciscan University sociologist Anne Hendershott who has identified four key factors common to successful Catholic seminaries in the U.S.:

(1) a “transformational” bishop who (2) places a high emphasis on vocations; (3) commitment to theological orthodoxy; and (4) a strong seminary rector who recruits faculty who are faithful to the Magisterium. Mount St. Mary’s Seminary & School of Theology could be exhibit A for this analysis. And it is a sign that this institution can look forward to its own joyous bicentennial building upon a strong legacy with the promise of a hopeful future.

Saat sedih menimpa kita ayat-ayat Al-Qur'an sebagai peredam rasa sedih obat hati dan petunjuk jalan kita terbebas dari rasa sedih yang berlarut. Karena Allah telah menyampaikan di dalam surat nya ""La Tahzan Innallaha Ma'ana"" artinya : 'Janganlah engkau bersedih sesungguhnya Allah bersama kita'. Surat At-Taubah ayat 40. Begitu banyak motivasi di dalam Al-Qur'an saharusnya kita bersama-sama untuk memotivasi sesama kita untuk berlomba-lomba dalam mengejar kebaiakan.

Tetapi di jaman sekarang yang seharusnya kita menghabiskan waktu dengan membaca Al-Qur'an kalah dengan sosial media yang membuat kita akan lupa dunia nyata. Mulailah dari sekarang kita untuk selalu mengingat kembali bahwa hidup di dunia ini hanya sementara!.

Saat jatuh cinta kepada Al-qur'an gerak hidup nya akan selalu di landaskan pada Al-Qur'an sehingga saat kesulitan datang dia akan berusaha mendapatkan kemudahan saat dia terimpit kesedihan akan sesegera mungkin berusaha membuka jalan dalam hatinya untuk sebuah kegembiraan. Saat jatuh cinta kepada Al-qur'an setiap perintah dan larangan yang ada dalam Al-Qur'an selalu kita laksanakan dan hindari. Saat kita jatuh cinta kepada Al-qur'an tiada perpisahan paling menyakitkan selain meninggalkannya tergeletak tak pernah di baca.

Saat jatuh cinta kepada Al-qur'an malam mingguan tak pernah diisi dengan berdua-duaan bersama manusia atau kekasih tetapi diisi dengan membaca Al-Qur'an. Tetapi masih banyak dari kita yang tak jatuh cinta kepada Al-qur'an. Banyak dari kita yang enggan membacanya memahaminya dan mengamalkannya. Semua di kalahkan dengan kenikmatan duniawi yang hanya sesaat. Kita terlena akan waktu yang terbuang sia-sia karena kita berfikir bahwa manusia akan hidup selamanya di dunia.

Ketika kita mencintai suatu mata kuliah atau pelajaran saat di kelas kita akan selalu dimudahkan mengerti materi dan penasaran dengan kelajutan materi yang kita sukai. Kita akan menguasai apa yang sudah kita pelajari saat di kelas dan dengan rasa yang penasaran untuk segera menyelesaikan soal ulangan karena begitu piawai menguasai pelajaran itu sampai penasaran nilai yang akan di peroleh. Sebaliknya ketika kita tidak suka dan benci terhadap pelajaran tertentu kita sedemikian sulit mencerna materi yang di sampaikan karena ada rasa bosan bete malas dan ingin cepat-cepat pelajaran nya selesai. Dengan demikian kita tidak akan pernah menguasai pelajaran yang sudah disampaikan itu. Ada sebuah kata ""tak kenal maka tak sayang tak sayang maka tak cinta"". Makanya setiap sesuatu harus dikenali terlebih dahulu selanjutnya baru kita sayang dan apabila telah sayang akan mudah untuk selalu mengingat kembali membaca Al-Qur'an.

Kita sama-sama merenungkan wahai teman-temanku! Kita berikan tempat di hati untuk terus mencintai Al-Qur'an tidak boleh ada rasa kebencian sedikit pun kepadanya sehingga kita dapat kemuliaan dari Allah SWT. Mulai saat ini kita sama untuk meluangka waktu menumbuhkan rasa cinta terhadap Al-Qur'an untuk membaca menghafal mengamalkannya.

Buat temen-temen yang sedang menghafal semangat yah! Jangan mudah menyerah kita sama-sama berjuang. Pepatah mengatakan ""berakit-rakit ke hulu berenang-renang ke tepian bersakit-sakit dahulu baru bersenang-senang. Ingat yah pada diri kita janji dalam Al-Qur'an siapa yang membaca menghafal dan mengamalkannya. Maka Al-qur'an akan mengangkat derajat kita di sisi Allah.

Apa yang membuat kita ingin menghafal Al-Qur'an? Luruskan niat kita hanya untuk mendapatkan ridho dari Allah SWT agar Al-Qur'an dapat menaungi kita saat hari kiamat tiba dan agar menggapai singgasana yang semua makhluk inginkan yaitu surga dengan bersama makhluk Allah yang sangat dicintai-Nya dan para Nabi Allah SWT. Tujuan yang utama yaitu niatkan menghafal Al-Qur'an hanya karena Allah SWT. ""Menghafal lah karena cinta dan meroja'ah lah karena rindu"".

Down goes Carter!

Former Lakers player Lamar Odom and pop singer Aaron Carter went head to head in a celebrity boxing match Friday night. Although one of Carter’s biggest hits “How I Beat Shaq” is based on a shockingly true story the 33-year-old hardly stood a chance against this NBA legend. Bless Aaron’s heart for making it past the first-round knockdown from Odom who is nearly a foot taller at 6’10” and weighs 64 pounds more.

UFC Hall of Famer Chuck Liddell served as the referee for the mismatched fight. Carter came out swinging as best he could but told Liddel he had enough in the second round after a buffet of knuckle sandwiches.

Despite the months of tension between the two both fighters were good sports and hugged in the ring after Odom was announced the winner. When Carter talked smack about how hard he trained in the ring Odom clapped back saying “[Aaron has been] talkin’ sh*t but I’m gonna put him to sleep early.”

The night hosted by Ice-T and his wife Coco was even weirder than the main event. Ex-#LHHNY stars Cisco Rosado and Peter Gunz also faced off with Rich Dollaz as the referee. Uncle Fester’s tether and the ferociously fertile host of Cheaters got so heated that Cisco accidentally swung at Rich and snatched his gloves off ready to bare-knuckle box. All three 40-somethings miraculously survived 3 rounds in the ring and Cisco was announced the winner. Gunz graciously said the beef is over and the former friends fought to be good role models. “Ultimately the goal for this was to show kids and show people that you can put the gloves on and figure it out. You ain’t gotta run to the gun you ain’t got to go get ya mans you can get in and square off like men so we can stop killing one another.”

The 33-year-old singer and rapper took to social media early Saturday morning (June 12) to share his post-fight positivity following his defeat by the former NBA star during a sold-out celebrity boxing match at the Showboat in Atlantic City on Friday night.

“I did my best. Fought like a lion” Carter tweeted alongside a brief clip from the short-lived bout. “He was huge. And at least I didn’t go in [there] like a p—y.”

The 6-foot-10 Odom 41 knocked out Carter who is 10 inches shorter in the first round of the fight which was offered as a pay-per-view livestream on FITE.tv.

“I got punched in the throat so hard lol that s–t was so much fun!!!!” the singer tweeted. “I actually had a blast so y’all can say what you want. But I don’t see you at 6’ fighting a giant.”

Ice-T and his wife Coco hosted the event with former MMA star Chuck Liddell serving as the celebrity referee.

This edition of Official Celebrity Boxing was originally scheduled for last year but was pushed to June 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The fight card also featured a match-up between hip-hop producer Cisco Rosado and rapper/producer Peter Gunz.

C,Citigroup,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzEyL2NpdGlncm91cHMtY2VvLXNheXMtdGhpcy1kaXZpc2lvbi1pcy10aGUtYmFua3MtY3JvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citigroup's CEO Says This Division Is the Bank's Crown Jewel. Will It Pay Off for Investors?,"Investors love Citigroup's treasury and trade solutions unit and would like to see it become a bigger part of the bank.

While its new CEO Jane Fraser is attempting to turn the bank around Citigroup (C 1.21%) is trading at a very cheap valuation compared to its peers and the broader industry. Not only does Citigroup need to address regulatory issues but Fraser is also looking to refresh the bank's strategy which has held it behind the other big U.S. banks for years.

A key part of that refresh will likely involve a heavier emphasis on Citigroup's treasury and trade solutions (TTS) division which Fraser recently called the ""crown jewel"" of the bank and a big driver of valuation going forward. Let's take a look at how this division currently fits into the broader bank and whether it can help Citigroup deliver for shareholders.

What is the TTS division?

Of the four largest U.S. banks by assets Citigroup is the most difficult to understand and analyze in my opinion. Its business model is more global than those of JPMorgan Chase Bank of America or Wells Fargo and it has the smallest lending operation of any of the four. But these two factors are likely why Citigroup has developed a world-class treasury and trade division.

The TTS division is part of Citigroup's larger institutional clients group but it essentially helps businesses all over the world run their operations. TTS solutions help clients carry out import and export operations manage liquidity and process payments using analytics to help them run more efficiently. The TTS group operates in 160 countries and 140 currencies and processes roughly $3 trillion in daily transactions.

At a recent conference Fraser said:

Having run Latin America I saw companies can't operate without us multinationals on the ground. So it really becomes this network we have in cash management in foreign exchange and trade and lending. ... Just given the dynamics in the world and you know the competitive position that the business has it's very hard to unseat this.

In 2020 TTS generated more than $9.5 billion of revenue for Citigroup. At the end of the first quarter of 2021 loan balances from the TTS group reached close to $71 billion while deposits from the division totaled $649 billion.

Does TTS drive valuation?

To a certain extent TTS has been a driver of valuation because it's a part of the bank that investors and analysts cite as a huge positive at Citigroup along with the bank's investment banking and credit card operations. But the $9.5 billion in revenue Citigroup made from TTS only made up about 13% of total revenue in 2020 and it hasn't been enough in recent years to overcome issues with other parts of Citigroup's operations such as parts of its global consumer bank.

Citigroup recently just exited its consumer banking operations in 13 global markets that were inefficient used too much capital and ran into credit quality issues during the pandemic. Investors overall seemed pleased with the move but there is still work to do in Citigroup's U.S. retail bank which in general does not have nearly the same scale as the other large U.S. banks like JPMorgan.

At the same conference where Fraser spoke analyst John McDonald of Autonomous Research noted that investors have told him it would be great to see TTS become a bigger part of Citigroup's business. Unfortunately since it only makes up a smaller portion of total revenue TTS has had a difficult time overcoming some of the pitfalls from the global consumer bank. Additionally Citigroup's profits from its credit card and other investment banking capabilities are still a larger piece of the pie so TTS does not really drive the bank's valuation right now although it contributes.

The good news is Fraser seemed to indicate that the bank recognizes this and will put more investment and effort going forward in order to create unmatched platforms and TTS capabilities in the future.

Can it drive valuation?

While TTS is clearly the ""crown jewel"" of Citigroup it still needs to scale further if it's truly going to drive the bank's valuation. If Citigroup does invest more in the unit and make it a larger portion of total revenue I am sure investors will reward Citigroup with a much more attractive valuation and stock price than it currently has. And with Citigroup refreshing its strategy and starting to exit businesses and geographies it either hasn't succeeded in or doesn't have the scale to compete in it should be able to focus more on areas like TTS moving forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Kakao Bank has become Korea's top digital bank while Naver's Line is heading overseas.

Naver Corp.’s Japan-based messaging app affiliate Line Corp. is rapidly expanding its digital banking business in Asian countries outside Korea.On June 11 Line launched a digital banking platform in Indonesia in partnership with South Korea’s banking giant Hana Financial Group. The digital bank will operate under the name of Line Bank by Hana Bank.Hana Bank the banking unit of Hana Financial Group said that the Indonesian venture is the first time a major Korean bank has set up an overseas digital bank together with a large tech company.The new digital banking service in Indonesia is the chat app company’s third internet-only bank in Asia after Line BK in Thailand and Line Bank in Taiwan.Despite Naver CEO Han Seong-sook’s comment in 2019 that Naver has no intention to run a digital bank within Korea the company has been rapidly strengthening its presence in the banking sector in other parts of Asia. Naver will also establish Line Bank in Japan next year.With Naver’s absence Korea’s domestic internet-only bank sector currently has two players KT Corp.’s K Bank and Kakao Corp.’s Kakao Bank Toss Bank will also join the race in September.Line is the market leader among all messaging apps in Japan and Southeast Asia. It boasts 169 million monthly active users (MAU) in Indonesia Japan Taiwan and Thailand according to the company’s March data. Its global MAU stood at 189 million.Line Bank’s performance in Taiwan where it was launched in April has also been strong thanks to Line’s position as the top messenger app there. Line Bank Taiwan in its first week of operation surpassed the country’s first digital bank Rakuten International Commercial Bank in the number of customers.Industry analysts say that Line’s brand power as the leading app is a key advantage versus the traditional banking sector in Indonesia.“Like Korea’s Kakao Bank which was able to grow so quickly building on the KakaoTalk messenger app user base Line Bank can differentiate its banking service from local banks by utilizing Line’s wide user base” said a Korean financial industry official.Line's strong brand awareness has allowed the company to launch a variety of financial services in Asia. Line currently operates stock trading insurance as well as credit loan services in Japan. The company also runs a cryptocurrency exchange in Singapore called Bitbox.Indonesia is the world’s fourth-largest country by population with more than 260 million people.But only around 40% of the Indonesian citizens have bank accounts. As the country is made up of about 18000 islands Indonesia’s banks often fail to reach residents in more remote areas. Analysts say that’s why fintech and digital financial services have recently been skyrocketing in the country.Line Bank by Hana Bank will offer contactless account opening services online not yet offered by the traditional banking sector in Indonesia. In addition using the Line messenger app the customers of the new bank can receive notifications for money transfers use card-less cash withdrawal services and pay utility bills.The bank will also launch its credit loan service by the end of 2021.“The customers in Indonesia will be able to apply and can get their loans approved in less than three minutes just like the service we are operating here in Korea” said a Hana Bank representative.Nan-sae Bin at binthere@hankyung.com Daniel Cho edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR2aWRzaHViLm5ldC9uZXdzLzM5ODc5Mi9taWNoaWdhbi1haXItbmF0aW9uYWwtZ3VhcmQtaHVzYmFuZC1hbmQtd2lmZS10ZWFtLXphbWJpYS1iZWNvbWUtdXMtY2l0aXplbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michigan Air National Guard Husband and Wife team from Zambia become U.S. Citizens,"Photo By David Kujawa | U.S. Air Force Airman 1st Class Waicha Gondwe a material management specialist in the...... read more read more Photo By David Kujawa | U.S. Air Force Airman 1st Class Waicha Gondwe a material management specialist in the 127th Logistics Readiness Squadron Selfridge Air National Guard Base (SANGB) Michigan born and raised in Zambia stands with her husband Master Sgt.

Michigan Air National Guard Husband and Wife team from Zambia become U.S. Citizens



Detroit— On May 24 2021 Airman 1st Class Waicha Gondwe recited her Oath of Allegiance marking the completion of her journey to become a U.S. Citizen. Born and raised in Zambia Gondwe is a material management specialist with the 127th Logistics Readiness Squadron Selfridge Air National Guard Base (SANGB) Michigan.



Her husband Master Sgt. Suzgo Gondwe noncommissioned officer in charge of the 127th Maintenance Squadron SANGB also born and raised in Zambia achieved his U.S. citizenship 18 years ago.



Arriving in the United States in 2001 through an education exchange program Suzgo first enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. After serving eight years in the Marine Wing Support Group 47 an aviation combat service support unit based at SANGB he switched services in 2011 enlisting in the Michigan Air National Guard (MIANG).



“In 2003 I had the distinct honor to recite my Oath of Allegiance in my Marine uniform it was one of the days I am most proud of” he said. “After becoming an American citizen and during one of my trips back to Zambia I met Waicha who I would one day marry.”



After several years of nurturing a long distance relationship the Gondwe’s married in 2018 and Waicha then moved to Michigan.



“After arriving here Suzgo wasted no time in helping me join the MIANG and in May 2019 I left for basic training following the successful path he took nearly 18 years prior” she said. “It’s almost a dream come true - in less than three years I have become an American citizen and am working for a great organization like the Michigan Air National Guard.”



Under the Immigration and Nationality Act Section 328 special provisions apply to those who serve in the U.S. military (active duty reserves or National Guard) that allow them to file for naturalization based on their current or prior U.S. military service.



The Gondwe’s mobilized together in 2020 as part of the state’s COVID-19 Joint Task Force (JTF) 172 supporting local food banks.



Waicha is one of the 95 Airmen serving with the JTF 172 assisting the Food Gatherers of Ann Arbor. The JTF 172 team has helped the Food Gatherers distribute millions of pounds of food to more than 145 local food pantries and meal programs.



Suzgo is a federal employee assigned as a maintenance production controller at SANGB and currently serves as the MIANG noncommissioned officer in charge of the Joint Task Force 172. He leads more than 90 Airmen working in food banks throughout the state.



The National Guard provides an opportunity for individuals to live in their communities while serving their country and state part-time. This enables Guard members to pursue full time education employment and other personal interests or goals. Michigan National Guard members can receive educational financial assistance such as $14000 for in-state tuition assistance the G.I. Bill and the G.I. Bill Kicker. Waicha is taking advantage of the Michigan National Guard State Tuition Assistance Program as a full-time student pursuing an accounting degree at Washtenaw Community College Ann Arbor.



“The benefits we have received as being part of the MIANG have enriched our lives” Waicha said. “After serving two years in the MIANG I have decided to eventually take on an officer commission upon graduation” she said.



The Gondwe’s intend on making the MIANG one of their career paths for retirement benefits.



“The Gondwe’s are an incredible team it has been an honor to work side-by-side with Suzgo on the JTF 172 mission” said U.S. Army Command Sgt. Major Joseph Gregory the JTF 172 Joint Force Headquarters senior noncommissioned officer in charge.



Since 2002 more than 139000 members of the U.S. military have been naturalized both at home and abroad. Naturalization ceremonies have taken place in more than 30 countries and in 2020 more than 4500 service members were naturalized.



“The past 20 years of my life have been more fulfilling than I ever expected” said Suzgo. “My wife and I could have never accomplished so much without having the MIANG in our corner.”

Say this for the Phillies: They will be relevant this summer.

That wasn’t a foregone conclusion two weeks ago. After an 11-1 humiliation on Memorial Day in Cincinnati the Phillies were a season-worst four games under .500 five games out of first place and had lost 12 of the last 17 games. The season appeared to be at a tipping point. They could pull it together and stay in the thick of a bunched-up National League East race or fade away before schools let out.

Consider this last week to be a statement then. The toughest tests still lay ahead beginning this week in Los Angeles. But in closing out a wildly successful homestand with a gem from Aaron Nola (finally) in an easy breezy 7-0 romp (at last) over a New York Yankees team that is in full-blown crisis mode the Phillies made clear to the announced crowd of 38512 -- the largest of the season -- that they aren’t about to fade away.

“Baseball’s a weird thing. You start a new month and you almost feel like you can reset” said left fielder Andrew McCutchen who doubled twice and drove in two runs. “It’s like ‘All right. New month. Here we go.’ It just sometimes works out that way and yeah we’ve been playing some good ball this month.

In going 6-2 against Washington Atlanta and Yankees the Phillies at 32-31 climbed above .500 for the first time since May 19 when they were 22-21. They picked up only one game on the division-leading Mets during the homestand. But they gained 2 1/2 games in the wild-card standings.

(And no when you’ve been absent from the playoffs for nine years mid-June is not too early to pay attention to the wild card.)

“It’s big. Really big” Nola said. “Especially with the Yankees coming to town it was a big sweep two-game sweep of those guys.”

For a change the Phillies didn’t need last-at-bat theatrics. After three consecutive walk-off victories (two against the Braves and Saturday against the Yankees) they grabbed a four-run lead in the second inning with more top-of-the-order thunder from Odúbel Herrera and Jean Segura tacked on three runs in the fifth and let Nola do the rest in his sharpest outing in weeks.

Nola barely broke a sweat in 7 2/3 innings. Never mind that the Yankees had neither Aaron Judge nor Giancarlo Stanton in the lineup. He allowed three hits and one walk struck out nine and walked off the mound to a nice ovation in a confidence-building outing after posting a 5.68 ERA and failing to get out of the seventh inning in his previous six starts.

“It felt good to finally get back in the seventh eighth inning” Nola said.

The Phillies put Nola back on his regular turn in the rotation after taking advantage of multiple days off to give him extra rest before his previous start. But he wasn’t sharp on six days’ rest last week against the Braves. So manager Joe Girardi changed course and had him face the Yankees rather than giving him an additional day of rest and starting him Monday night in Los Angeles.

Maybe it was coincidental but Nola’s average fastball velocity ticked up to 93.4 mph slightly higher than his season average of 92.7 mph.

“He’d had a lot of days off and maybe that was contributing to it” Girardi said. “He wasn’t getting on the mound enough was kind of my thought after looking at some things. We’re trying to be proactive here because we worry about the back end but sometimes maybe a guy gets out of his rhythm. I think he tweaked a few things and this is what we got today. That’s the Aaron that we see all the time.”

Said Nola: “It felt good actually. Seven days [off] is kind of like a college schedule. I haven’t done that since college. We’re used to every five games. Felt like I was just out there a few days ago. I like that. I like to pitch as much as I can.”

Nola took advantage of the Yankees’ aggressiveness early in the game. He had an eight-pitch first inning aided by a ground-ball double play from Gleyber Torres and a 10-pitch second. But he also commanded his fastball and got ahead with strikes which didn’t allow the Yankees to work deep counts.

As much as Nola needed a game like this the Phillies did too. None of their flaws -- poor defense and a shaky bullpen to name two of the more prominent ones -- is going away. But they played their most mistake-free game in a while and won their third consecutive series for the first time all season.

“It was just all-around good baseball” Nola said. “The hitters came up big today too. Put up seven runs pretty quick. Good plays in the field. Just a solid win overall.”

Herrera picked up two more hits while Segura notched his third three-hit game in a row joining Chase Utley as the only Phillies players to record three consecutive three-hit games in the 18-year history of Citizens Bank Park.

“I joked with somebody today I said ‘Segura’s the Steph Curry of Major League Baseball. Just as easy as Steph hits a three it’s just as easy as Segy gets hits’” McCutchen said. “When [Herrera and Segura] are at the top and getting on base creating havoc it definitely sets those 3-4-5-6-and-on guys it sets them up to do some special things and drive them in.”

Now though comes a stiffer test with 11 of the next 13 games on the road where the Phillies are only 11-19 this season and 87-133 since the beginning of the 2018 season. It starts Monday night in Los Angeles against the defending World Series champion Dodgers.

“We just have to continue to keep doing what we’re doing” McCutchen said. “We played three crazy games and were able to win comfortably today so hopefully we can take that to the West Coast.”"

Claudia Kerr has experienced many changes ever since joining ClientKnowledge which was acquired by ICAP which was rebranded to NEX Group which was acquired by CME Group.

Euronext has appointed Claudia Kerr as Head of Business Management Global Markets based in London where she will be supporting the Euronext London CEO & Head of Global Sales.

Holding over 10 years’ experience in Business and Operations management within Financial Services Ms. Kerr has focused on business strategy and regulatory management by leading project programs and delivering against complex mandates.

She has implemented business operating and governance models for both new and existing products/services developed and implemented go-to-market plans and successfully launched new products & services within targeted market segments as well as managed teams of up to 20 direct staff outside contractors and led senior internal matrixed staff to deliver business goals.

This hands-on experience is the result of nearly ten years as Business Manager Director (and head of business operations EBS eCommerce) in a firm that changed brands and ownership plenty in the last few years: from ICAP to NEX Group and then to CME Group.

Prior to that Ms. Kerr worked as Operations Manager at ClientKnowledge a business that was acquired by ICAP in 2012. While Claudia Kerr’s resume shows she worked at five different companies the only change that is an actual executive move is this month’s to Euronext.

Euronext has recently made a high-profile announcement as Piero Novelli joined the exchange operator in February ahead of the acquisition of Borsa Italiana from LSEG.

The experience and skills he developed from top roles at UBS Investment Bank make him a perfect choice for Euronext as the venue aims to close a 4.3 billion euro acquisition of Borsa Italiana this year.

The proposed combination of Borsa Italiana and Euronext is set to create a leading player in continental European capital markets. This transformational project would position the newly formed group to deliver the ambition of further building the backbone of the Capital Markets Union in Europe while at the same time supporting local economies.

Italy through Borsa Italiana would become the largest revenue contributor to the enlarged Euronext group. As a new major country in the Euronext federal model Italy would be represented at group level of Euronext governance by Italian representatives in the Reference Shareholders the Supervisory Board the Managing Board and the College of Regulators supervising Euronext group’s activities.

“He made me take a personality test twice”

“The kind of dedication he showed was amazing”

“I thrive with such actors who ask questions and value add”

“I have a lot of fond memories of him”

Filmmaker Nitesh Tiwari who worked with Sushant Singh Rajput in ‘Chhichhore’ got emotional recently while re-watching his 2019 film. Scenes of SSR portraying a range of emotions in the coming-of-age drama made his director’s eyes go all numb. In an exclusive conversation with ETimes  the National Award winning director of movies like ‘Dangal’ recalls his fondest memories with SSR as he praises his intellect intelligence and commitment to cinema.Excerpts from Tiwari’s first-person account:Before we met during the narration of ‘Chhichhore’ I had only met Sushant socially. During the narrations though he asked a lot of relevant questions about the screenplay. At the time he came across as a thinker who wanted to understand what his character was and his questions were pretty bang on in an effort to understand the journey of the character. His curiosity wasn’t just limited to his character he asked a lot of questions about other characters too which is a hallmark of a good actor. Because he is not just interested in his role but is in the overall story per se which is a quality of Sushant that stood out for me.You know the charm that he carried the child-like curiosity which he had and of course there is no question about the enthusiasm which he showed about everything to me those things stayed with me.Once he came on board it was a very interesting journey with him because he was full of questions. He would message me call me and also drop in to meet me and spend a lot of time discussing the character.There was something very interesting he made me do for the prep of ‘Chhichhore’. It was a personality test for both old Ani and younger Ani for which one had to answer a long set of questions to arrive at the personality of the character. He made me take the test twice; one for Older Ani and the other one for the younger Ani.I told him ‘Arrey bhai do ghanta test doonga usse achcha main bata deta hoon’. But he said ‘Nahi sir. For my happiness do this test which I would like to prepare for my character. Because these are the questions you will answer for both of them so it will help me prepare for both of them separately’. I give respect to all my actors. If that was something that was going to make him comfortable and help him get into the skin of both the characters I had to do it. I sat and did the test twice and later he came up with the deduction for the two Anis. I told him ‘Woh toh maine tereko pehle hi bola tha’ to which he replied ‘Mereko samajhne ke liye yeh zaroori tha’ and he said ‘This is my process’. I agreed and said I am all for your process but I could’ve told you all this earlier but he said ‘Sir! Abb sab clear hai’. (smiles) He was like that only.There was a lot of course training required for ‘Chhichhore’ and the kind of dedication he showed was amazing. He was well-versed with cricket and football so didn’t need much training but he spent a lot of time understanding how basketball is played. Learning Basketball was very challenging for him and he worked under coaches worked on his posture his style and he put in the hours which were required. Never once did we hear from him that ‘I will not turn up for practice today’ or ‘Can we do it some other time’. There were no excuses.He was always there in fact when we were shooting for the Basketball game we had the location for only five days and on the third day both Sushant and Prateik (Babbar) sprained their ankles. As you know Basketball is a strenuous game and because we didn’t have time or another date for the location it would’ve been very difficult to manage. He didn’t cancel the shoot. Both Prateik and Sushant would give the shot and come back put their feet in the ice bucket and by the time we set up the second shot they would be recuperating and ready for the next. They were going through so much pain but not once did they tell me let’s do it some other time. Because both of them realised that any delay would really set us back by a lot of time. That was the kind of commitment that they showed. Another thing that remains with me about Sushant is that he always came well prepared for his scenes whether it was one dialogue or a monologue. He made everybody around him comfortable; even his co-actors. He made it a point to mingle with them and befriended them too. So everybody around him was very comfortable.Another thing I need to tell here is he never used glycerine in emotional scenes. I would ask him ‘How are you managing to get tears?’ and he would say ‘Yeh mera secret hai sir’. He did not tell me his secret but he came prepared and he had so many crying scenes with both the younger and older Ani and not even once in those shots did he use glycerine.He was a method actor who would internalise something to get into that mood and perform. He would just get tears in his eyes and to me that was quite a revelation.Apart from that shooting with him was good fun. We used to have a lot of quiz sessions and to get the actors into the engineering mood I would ask them all kinds of science questions. We also had a great time cracking riddles. I would start first and then the others would join but Sushant’s questions would be too technical for the others to understand. I would tell him to make them easier and to avoid too much science. I guess he got pleasure in seeing others struggle for the answers.His process of working was good and I thrive with such actors who ask questions and value add. I don’t want actors to follow me blindly. I want them to have a point of view. I would love to have thinking actors working with me. It shows that your artiste is taking interest in your project he is asking intelligent and relevant questions. And it shows he is going out of his way to prepare for the role. What more can a director ask for?I remember another episode on sets when we were shooting a scene where Ani and Maya are having an argument and his son is brought out of the operation theatre. He couldn’t continue with the scene because he had internalised it so much that he lost all his energy. On that day we had to reschedule the remaining portions for the next day. You have to understand your artiste’s condition. He had given a super shot and if he needed rest he needed rest.I was in touch with Sushant even after the film was complete and he had promised to show my daughter some VR (virtual reality) stuff and he’d promised to show my son the moon on his telescope unfortunately that didn’t happen.I have a lot of fond memories of him and that is how I would like to remember Sushant. He was a fantastic artiste full of energy and dedication and that is going to remain with me for the rest of my life. He has given me a fantastic film. I was watching ‘Chhichhore’ the other day and I really got emotional remembering the fun we had while making it.",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Huma Qureshi: Reading every negative comment on social media would be a waste of my time and energy,When shoots resumed after the lockdown in 2020 Huma Qureshi ’s Bell Bottom crew was among the first to take off to the UK for shooting. She also had a couple of projects releasing on OTT platforms in the past year which included a Hollywood film and a web show. And though work is her focus she also acknowledges that she has been mindful of her health and well-being. Huma says “Today fitness is a priority in our lives.We have been confined to our homes and health has become more important. Eating well taking care of your physical and mental well-being has become crucial especially for actors.”The actress was even a part of a series that offered a glimpse of her fitness and fashion fundas. “The idea behind it was to live your best life and be the best version of who you can be. I always tell others… don’t compete don’t be in the rat race be original and authentic but at the same time try and push yourself to do better – whether it is your career fashion sense fitness goals or general well-being” shares Huma.Talking about fashion the actress admits that she isn’t one for following trends. Huma says “I don’t follow these trends. I wear what I feel like and what I am comfortable in. I am here to be an actor not a model. My acting skill is what’s more important. That has always been my focus and after 2020 I am even more focused on my work and I would rather have that speak for itself as opposed to worrying about what I am seen wearing at the airport.”While it’s easy to say that actors should not stress about the constant scrutiny over their fashion sense and style choices sometimes the pressure is a lot to handle. However after being in the industry for so many years the Gangs of Wasseypur actress is quite unfazed by it. She says “If I give you a gift and you don’t take it who would it stay with? Obviously me! I view trolling in a similar manner. If someone says anything mean or nasty and I don’t acceptit then that nastiness remains with the person who is saying those things.”A huge part of the comments and scrutiny on various aspects of an actor’s life surface on social media. Elaborating on that Huma says “For me social media is a platform to connect with my fans and audience and say something if I want to. But I don’t sit down and read every comment as I think it is a waste of time energy and effort. I think I would rather say what I want to say and not worry about others’ comments. The human mind is so easily influenced that even if people pay you 100 compliments and then one person says something negative we will focus on that one mean comment rather than all the praise that we get. I would rather focus on all the love that I get than focus on that one negative comment.”,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXR5L2JlbmdhbHVydS9nb2RobmEtcHJvamVjdC1pbi1jaGhhdHRpc2dhcmgtdHVybnMtd2hpdGUtZWxlcGhhbnQtZm9yLWthcm5hdGFrYS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84MzQ3Nzg3Ni5jbXPSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0eS9iZW5nYWx1cnUvZ29kaG5hLXByb2plY3QtaW4tY2hoYXR0aXNnYXJoLXR1cm5zLXdoaXRlLWVsZXBoYW50LWZvci1rYXJuYXRha2EvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzgzNDc3ODc2LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Godhna project in Chhattisgarh turns white elephant for Karnataka,BENGALURU: In 2010 when the Godhna thermal power project was initiated in Chhattisgarh during the second term of chief minister BS Yediyurappa it was hailed as an epic decision by Karnataka which would make it “self sufficient” in energy requirements.Cut to 2021 having spent Rs 400 crore on land acquisition and other mandatory fees to hold on to the land the government is stuck with the project as the state’s demand for energy has saturated amid pandemic and additional renewable energy avenues.Earlier last week the energy department at a review meeting with the chief minister raised the issue of whether the government should let go of the land or sell it to a private player interested in the allocation. With Karnataka Power Corporation Limited (KPCL) having also received the allocation of a coal mine with a pithead the plant is all set to take off.“However at the meeting chief secretary P Ravi Kumar and additional chief secretary (finance) ISN Prasad had a different opinion. They raised the issue of whether the government was in a position to invest further in the project” said a government official privy to the meeting.Concern over spendingWith Karnataka reeling under a financial crisis and depending largely on market loans to meet its capital expenditure burden an investment in a thermal power project which is 1552km away with no guarantee of when it will actually deliver the energy was a talking point. “Having sunk Rs 400 crore what’s the point of investing another Rs 4000 crore in the project without any guarantee?” was a question posed to the energy department. However it is said that KPCL and energy department additional chief secretary Kumar Naik said no action will be initiated without consulting the government.KPCL MD V Ponnuraj had told STOI that they are moving away from setting up thermal power plants as they were becoming redundant fast.“Our focus is now towards creating energy storage infrastructure” he said. With such being the case the options before the government is to either sub-lease it or sell the land which it has been holding on to for over a decade. ACS (energy) Kumar Naik said the KPCL board will take a final call on the matter and convey the same to the government soon.,,,

Plastic items from takeaway food and drink dominate the litter in the world’s oceans according to the most comprehensive study to date.

Single-use bags plastic bottles food containers and food wrappers are the four most widespread items polluting the seas making up almost half of the human-made waste the researchers found. Just 10 plastic products also including plastic lids and fishing gear accounted for three-quarters of the litter due to their widespread use and extremely slow degradation.

The scientists said identifying the key sources of ocean plastic made it clear where action was needed to stop the stream of litter at its source. They called for bans on some common throwaway items and for producers to be made to take more responsibility.

Action on plastic straws and cotton buds in Europe was welcome the researchers said but risked being a distraction from tackling far more common types of litter. Their results were based on carefully combining 12m data points from 36 databases across the planet.

“We were not surprised about plastic being 80% of the litter but the high proportion of takeaway items did surprise us which will not just be McDonald’s litter but water bottles beverage bottles like Coca-Cola and cans” said Carmen Morales-Caselles at the University of Cádiz Spain who led the new research.

“This information will make it easier for policymakers to actually take action to try to turn off the tap of marine litter flowing into the ocean rather than just clean it up” she said.

Straws and stirrers made up 2.3% of the litter and cotton buds and lolly sticks were 0.16%. “It’s good that there is action against plastic cotton buds but if we don’t add to this action the top litter items then we are not dealing with the core of the problem—we’re getting distracted” Morales-Caselles said.

Prof Richard Thompson of the University of Plymouth in the UK who was not part of the research team said: “Having [this data] recorded in a proper scientific way is incredibly useful. There can be a reluctance to take action on something that seems very obvious because there isn’t a published study on it.”

The research published in the journal Nature Sustainability and funded by the BBVA Foundation and Spanish science ministry concluded: “In terms of litter origins take-out consumer items—mainly plastic bags and wrappers food containers and cutlery plastic and glass bottles and cans—made up the largest share.”

The analysis included items bigger than 3cm and identifiable excluding fragments and microplastics. It distinguished between take-out plastic items and toiletry and household product containers.

The highest concentration of litter was found on shorelines and sea floors near coasts. The scientists said wind and waves repeatedly sweep litter to the coasts where it accumulates on the nearby seafloor. Fishing material such as ropes and nets were significant only in the open oceans where they made up about half the total litter.

A second study in the same journal examined the litter entering the ocean from 42 rivers in Europe and was one of the datasets Morales and colleagues used. It found Turkey Italy and the UK were the top three contributors to floating marine litter.

“Mitigation measures cannot mean cleaning up at the river mouth” said Daniel González-Fernández of the University of Cádiz who led the second study. “You have to stop the litter at the source so the plastic doesn’t even enter the environment in the first place.”

In May Greenpeace revealed that UK plastic waste sent to Turkey for recycling had been burned or dumped and left to pollute the ocean. US and UK citizens produce more plastic waste per person than any other major countries according to other recent research.

The researchers recommended bans on avoidable take-out plastic items such as single-use bags as the best option. For products deemed essential they said the producers should be made to take more responsibility for the collection and safe disposal of products and they also backed deposit return schemes.

“This comprehensive study concludes that the best way to confront plastic pollution is for governments to severely restrict single-use plastic packaging” said Nina Schrank plastics campaigner at Greenpeace UK. “This seems undeniable. We will never recycle the quantity of waste plastic we’re currently producing.”

Thompson said: “What’s going on in the sea is a symptom of the problem—the origin of the problem and the solution are back on land and that’s where we’ve got to take action.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zdC5jb20ubXkvbGlmZXN0eWxlL3N1bmRheS12aWJlcy8yMDIxLzA2LzY5ODMxNi9yZWdlbnQtcGVybGlzLXVudmVpbHMtaGlzLWV4dGVuc2l2ZS1jb2tlLWNvbGxlY3Rpb24tYW5kLWhpc9IBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zdC5jb20ubXkvYW1wL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9zdW5kYXktdmliZXMvMjAyMS8wNi82OTgzMTYvcmVnZW50LXBlcmxpcy11bnZlaWxzLWhpcy1leHRlbnNpdmUtY29rZS1jb2xsZWN0aW9uLWFuZC1oaXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Regent of Perlis unveils his extensive Coke collection and his passion for the world's famous soda drink!,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL21hcmtldHMuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0b2Nrcy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1jcml0aWNpemVkLWF2b2lkaW5nLXRheGVzLWRlc2VydmVzLWJyZWFrLXBoaWxhbnRocm9weS1saWZlc3R5bGUtbG9vcGhvbGVzLTIwMjEtNi0xMDMwNTE3MzE20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett Is Under Fire for Avoiding Taxes Give Him a Break,"Warren Buffett is getting roasted for avoiding taxes after ProPublica's bombshell report.

Warren Buffett is being cast as the face of billionaire greed after ProPublica reported this week that he pays very little in federal income taxes relative to his vast wealth.

However the investor's minimal tax bill seems far less outrageous when viewed in the context of his modest lifestyle philanthropic efforts the nature of his company and its shareholders his calls to raise taxes on the wealthy and his refusal to use popular tax loopholes.

The case against Buffett

ProPublica analyzed leaked copies of Buffett's tax returns between 2014 and 2018 and found the Berkshire Hathaway CEO paid just $24 million in federal income taxes on $125 million of reported income. The non-profit publication emphasized how little tax he paid by pointing out that his net worth grew by an estimated $24 billion in that five-year period.

""No one among the 25 wealthiest avoided as much tax as Buffett the grandfatherly centibillionaire"" ProPublica declared.

Politicians including Sen. Chris Murphy Sen. Bernie Sanders Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Pramila Jayapal rushed to condemn Buffett and his fellow billionaires calling for heftier taxes on the super rich and the closure of loopholes in tax laws.

ProPublica highlighted Buffett's two main strategies to minimize his income and therefore his taxes. The investor keeps over 99% of his wealth in Berkshire stock — which isn't taxed until sold — and his company doesn't pay a dividend which shareholders would have to pay taxes on.

Not a typical billionaire

ProPublica reported that billionaires such as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk paid no federal income taxes in some years partly by taking out loans and deducting the interest paid on them from their incomes. There's no indication that Buffett uses the same tricks; the investor said in 2016 that he has paid taxes every year since 1944.

Bezos is reportedly building a yacht so large that it comes with a support yacht while Musk previously boasted a real-estate portfolio valued at north of $100 million — although he appears to have sold most of it to fund his dream of colonizing Mars.

The 90-year-old Buffett lives far less extravagantly. He resides in the same house in Omaha Nebraska that he bought for less than $32000 in 1958 ($290000 in today's dollars). He grabs breakfast at McDonald's on his daily drive to Berkshire headquarters guzzles Coca-Cola and snacks on See's Candies. He treats himself with an occasional trip to Dairy Queen and entertains himself by playing online bridge.

The investor doesn't use a company car belong to any clubs where Berkshire pays his dues or commandeer company-owned aircraft for his personal use — even though Berkshire owns NetJets which sells fractional ownership of private jets.

Buffett also buys damaged cars and has them repaired to save money and drove the same Cadillac for eight years until his daughter told him it was embarrassing and badgered him into upgrading to a newer model in 2014.

Notably the Berkshire chief has drawn a $100000 annual salary for the past 40 years — a fraction of the $15 million average pay of S&P 500 CEOs in 2019 — and doesn't receive bonuses or stock options. While some details might be embellished it's clear that he lives a modest lifestyle relative to other billionaires.

Giving it all away

Buffett defended his tiny tax bill in a detailed statement to ProPublica explaining that he's pledged to donate more than 99% of his fortune to good causes. He's donated about half of his Berkshire stock — worth about $100 billion at the current stock price — to five foundations since 2006.

The Berkshire chief told ProPublica that he prefers to hand his money to charitable organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation instead of the government.

""I believe the money will be of more use to society if disbursed philanthropically than if it is used to slightly reduce an ever-increasing US debt"" he said.

Buffett aware that skeptics would likely dismiss his charity as a tax write-off added that he's only garnered 50 cents in tax benefits for every $1000 he's donated over the past 15 years.

The investor made a similar point in 2016 after Donald Trump accused him of taking a massive tax deduction. Buffett shared the details of his 2015 tax return highlighting that he paid $1.8 million in federal income tax on $11.6 million of gross income and only deducted $3.5 million for charitable contributions despite giving almost $2.9 billion to charity that year.

Moreover Buffett noted that only $36000 of his $5.5 million in total deductions that year were unrelated to charity or state income taxes. He added that he's never used a ""carryforward"" which allows taxpayers to deduct losses or tax credits from previous years. He pegged his unused carryforward at north of $7 billion in 2010.

Buffett clearly sees charitable donations as a reasonable way to pay fewer taxes and has championed them in the past.

""If you want to give away all of your money it's a terrific tax dodge"" he quipped in response to an investor's question at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in 2010. ""I welcome the questioner or anybody else following my tax dodge example and giving away their money. They will save a lot of taxes that way and the money will probably do a lot of good.""

Buffett is also happy to keep his fortune in Berkshire stock. It signals to investors that he's confident in his company and focused on generating long-term value and means he has more skin in the game than anyone else. Moreover he doesn't feel guilty as his company's success will ultimately benefit society.

""Many shareholders including me enjoy the long-term buildup in value knowing that it is destined for philanthropy not consumption or dynastic aspirations"" he told ProPublica.

Buffett also explained that Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend because its shareholders overwhelmingly voted against one in 2014. They prefer Buffett to allocate Berkshire's profits across the conglomerate and use them to buy quality stocks and businesses instead of returning cash to them. Buffett also views buybacks as superior to dividends for several reasons not just tax efficiency.

Buffett wants higher taxes

While some billionaires complain of excessive taxes on the wealthy Buffett has called for higher taxes on the richest 1% of Americans as well as changes to the tax code to prevent tax avoidance.

The investor highlighted more than a decade ago how ridiculous it was that his secretary paid a higher tax rate than him. The revelation spurred President Barack Obama to pursue the removal of tax breaks for the wealthy and name his ultimately unsuccessful bill after Buffett. ""If all the diseases have been taken I'll take a tax"" the investor joked at the time.

Buffett has also called for policies to reduce income inequality such as expanding the earned-income tax credit to help workers get ahead. He once testified to Congress that estate taxes should be higher and better enforced he told ProPublica but his ""persuasive powers proved to be limited.""

Overall it's not surprising that under the current tax rules a 90-year-old who keeps his fortune in his company's stock and funds a simple lifestyle with a modest income doesn't pay a lot of tax.

It seems harsh to go after Buffett when he's giving away virtually all of his money calling for higher taxes on the wealthy refusing to use several loopholes to pay less tax and running a company where holding its stock for the long term and not paying a dividend makes perfect sense."

We are delighted to announce a new spreadsheet that can be used to evaluate the annualised return (XIRR) of individual stocks and that of a stock portfolio after properly taking into account corporate actions like dividends stock splits bonuses buybacks and rights issues.

We had recently published an example using this sheet: Stock XIRR Example: 18% annualized return from Colgate-Palmolive. The sheet can be used to compute the XIRR of any number of individual stocks and the overall XIRR of a 30-stock portfolio.

The XIRR makes a distinction between investor action and corporate actions. All corporate actions are deemed to be reinvested in the portfolio at the ex-date. Only investor actions refect in the XIRR calculations. For example if you purchased 30 stocks over a period of time all dividends during this time will be treated as reinvested at ex-date. If this results in additional shares of say 0.6 stocks the total number of stocks used in the XIRR calculation would be 30.6.

In addition to XIRR the sheet also computes absolute capital gain absolute dividend gain total gain and the CAGR based on the investment weighted average age of the investment or portfolio.

The CAGR is computed from the total absolute gain. This is the method adopted by simplywall.st as shown in my monthly stock portfolio updates: My Stock Portfolio May 2021 Update

The average duration of the portfolio is computed as follows.

Suppose you buy Rs. 5000 worth of stocks on 1st Jan 2018 (3.45 years ago) and Rs. 10000 worth of stocks on 1st June 2019 (2.03 years ago) then the average age duration is: [(5000 x 3.45) + (10000×2.03)]/(1000+5000)

The CAGR = ( 1 + Total Return ) ^ ( 1 / Avg age) – 1

The sheet will compute the CAGR only if the average age is > one year (this can easily be modified by the user). The XIRR will always be computed but it should be taken seriously only the 1st investment was made more than one year ago or if the avg age of the portfolio is > one year.

The sheet is available for download as an Excel sheet. The user must upload the file to Google Drive and open it via Google Sheets. The sheet uses the GOOGLE FINANCE function to retrieve stock price and this will work only on Google sheets. The sheet is completely open-source and can be modified at will. I have extensively tested the file with 391 of my own stock portfolio transactions.

Let us take a look at some screenshots. The file has three sheets with it: “Stock Portfolio XIRR” for the full portfolio; “Single stock XIRR” for single stocks. You can duplicate this sheet any number of times. “AsianPaints” as an example of single stock XIRR calculation. All sheets will have entires. Please delete them before using the sheet.

This is an overview of the stock portfolio sheet.

Details of capital gain XIRR and CAGR of individual stocks. In the overall portfolio calculation the individual XIRR of some stocks cannot be computed. However you can create a separate sheet for these stocks to compute XIRR (example in the video below).

Capital gains CAGR and XIRR of the overall portfolio is shown below.

This is the transaction entry sheet. The market price for purchase and redemptions should be entered by the user (else closing price for that date will be fetched from Google Finance). For corporate actions the ex-date should be entered. The price will be fetched from Google Finance.

However as indicated in the black rectangle above for corporate actions (in this case dividends) before a split we need to provide the market price as Google finance would incorporate the split to past data as well.

This is an example of a single stock XIRR calculation.

The tower stands 1121 feet and 60 stories tall with a central concrete core and steel floor plates. The skyscraper was designed by Foster and Partners which has designed several buildings that features metal highlights and bright lighting features and developed by Liberty Property Trust which used to be known as Rouse and Associates when Willard G. Rouse III ran the company before his death. Today YIMBY looks at the process of testing the lighting at the building’s lantern around the time of its completion.

When looking from the north and south the sides of the building mirror each other while the east and west faces are symmetrical. The west façade is split by a clearer row of glass directly in the center leading up to the lantern on the top of the skyscraper. Situated between the two structures that house the cooling equipment the lantern rises 126 feet feet above the structures and 210 above the roof. The lantern stands nine stories above the cooling towers with slim walkways and stairs inside for the roof to be accessible for the building maintenance unit and aviation warning lighting.

The lantern had its construction finished on November 27 2017 when the last level was attached to the top of the beams. Three months later the entire lantern was covered with glass and the lighting was tested the next month in March. One section was tested at some long periods worth of time and the sections were tested individually until the end of May. From then each section was tested simultaneously until July. The lights permanently returned in December 2018 with each section including the “zipper” lit up to prepare for the building completing construction.

The data shows that people have seen more than ever video content on these platforms and it looks logical. The social video content has gained almost equal views that linear TV is gaining and if we talk about Disney the reach of the audience is almost equal that shows power of social videos content. There can be many reasons for an increase in viewership of these videos such as people can get content according to their interest and short-form video content has also gained much attention from audiences.The report from GVMA and Tubularlabs has shown the data that social videos content gets about 70% as many views as the TV companies are getting and the age group of 18 to 34 years people is generating more than 50% of views on social videos platforms whereas these age groups are generating only 10% views on linear TV. Mostly aged people are more interested in watching videos on TV the data has outlined that about 60% of views are generated by more than 55 years people on TV however the views of youngsters on TV are only 13%. The main reason why youngsters are more interested in watching social video content is they mostly use mobile for their entertainment with the already installed app of YouTube in it.Social video content has a reach of 48% as compared to Disney that is getting about 52% viewership so the percentage is very close. Conventional media companies such as Disney World Comcast company and Viacom CBS are having a variety of content that are attracting many teenagers that give a tough time to the social video content. Viacom CBS generates almost 60% of views on linear TV whereas video content on Facebook and YouTube gets about 48%. Comcast gets about 57% views as compared to 41% of social video content.The data shows that 57% of youngsters only in the US get their entertainment videos content on social platforms whereas this percentage is about 16% on TV. More than half of the population of the US watch dancing and music content on social platforms whereas this percentage on TV is only 14%. Similarly the food content on social platforms gets almost double viewership than linear TV. About 64% of people watch blogs on social media where only 13% of people watch the same category on TV. Social video content on news and politics is not far away from linear TV this percentage is 48% vs 52%. People want to watch sports more on linear TV than on social platforms.Read next: Loneliness After a Year Indoors: More than 1 in 5 people said Zoom made them feel more lonely during the pandemic (infographic),https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zcG9uc29yZWQvc3RvcnkvcmVzdGF1cmFudHMtdHVybi10by10ZWNobm9sb2d5LXRvLXJlaW52ZW50LXRoZWlyLWJ1c2luZXNzLW1vZGVscy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Restaurants Turn to Technology to Reinvent Their Business Models,"The pandemic really took a toll on the restaurant industry. Before the virus hit restaurants were on track to bring in up to $900 billion for the year*. However now restaurants are poised to lose billions having been forced to close down or pivot to a take-out/delivery-only model this spring during the shelter-in-place edict.

Even though restaurants are now being allowed to open at a reduced capacity it is still a struggle to reconcile their razor-thin profit margins with the mandated safety measures they must adhere to in order to reopen according to state guidelines. Survival will require innovative tactics and the willingness to utilize technology to manage costs and appeal to a clientele that is still a bit skittish.

“We’ve taken forever to build up trust and loyalty with the customers. Now here we are thrown into this pandemic and people are like we don’t trust anyone anymore don’t trust the food source the cooks” says Robert Irvine Food Network celebrity chef. Irvine was forced to close two of his three current restaurants in the wake of COVID-19.

Here how restaurants are relying on the latest technology to navigate their new business reality.

Technology Provides the Pivot Restaurants Need

Being required to shelter in place has changed consumer habits when it comes to eating out. For restaurants to survive in the COVID era they will need to evolve with them.

Currently about one-third of consumers say they’re getting more takeout than before the pandemic according to Restaurant Business Online. However we are still seeing a reluctance to go and dine in person—32 percent say they plan to make more home-cooked meals after the virus passes. Restaurant owners will have to be creative to not only attract diners back to their dining rooms but also find ways to package their food to appeal to customers who would rather cook at home.

With fewer people dining out restaurant owners are devising new ways to make up for lost revenue. Quick service chain restaurants (QSRs) and local restaurants are now offering take-home family bundles featuring meals for the entire household. Curbside service lets diners purchase and pick up food without leaving their cars. Many have boosted their own delivery fleets or partnered with third-party delivery operators such as GrubHub or UberEats to allow contactless delivery with food dropped off at customer homes.

This contactless trend appears here to stay. Technology can help to reduce physical contact and ease customer safety concerns. Paper or plastic menus are now digital and restaurants are making it easier to order and pay digitally to reduce the need for contact with a human. Some companies are even using selfie sticks to safely hand payment machines out drive-thru windows. This way customers can swipe the credit cards themselves.

How Digitalization Enables Dining

Restaurant owners will need to embrace digitalization and adopt new business practices (outlined below) if they plan to survive and succeed.

● Forget about cash-only: Restaurants will increasingly transact business using electronic means instead of cash. Paper tips will no longer be left for the server and in fact tips may even be included in the cost of the meal. Even exchanging a credit card will be more sensitive in the contactless world. Irvine says more tableside point-of-sale (POS) devices will appear that allow diners to enter payment information or to pay from their phone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGVhdHNoZWV0LmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2NoZWxzZWEtaGFuZGxlci1hZG1pdHMtc2hlLWRvZXNudC13YW50LXRvLWRhdGUtYW5vdGhlci1jZWxlYnJpdHktaS13b3VsZC1saWtlLWEtcmVhbC1wZXJzb24uaHRtbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chelsea Handler Admits She Doesn't Want to Date Another Celebrity: 'I Would Like a Real Person',"Chelsea Handler is entering a new phase of her career as she works on developing and selling projects to streaming giants like HBO. Handler a celebrity who is well known for her skills as a writer and stand-up comedian first rose to fame in the early 2000s with her fresh and funny late-night show.

At the peak of her fame Handler walked away from her series preferring to work on more serious projects. These days with more fans than ever before Handler is just as relevant as she was in 2007 — and she is once more open to love. Still she has some ground rules in place as she revealed in a recent interview with WIRED.

Chelsea Handler | Tara Ziemba/Getty Images

In October 2020 Handler sat down with WIRED to answer some burning questions from fans. Since her dating life has always held a great deal of interest for fans of the outspoken feisty comedian one of those questions directly addressed Handler’s love life.

After responding by saying that she isn’t really dating anyone right now Handler joked that her “sweet spot” is men between 60 and 80 years old and admitted that her “ideal guy” if she had to pick a celebrity would be a “Jon Hamm type.”

Still Handler explained that she’s “not really trying to date a celebrity” stating that she “would like a real person.” Her admission that she’s over celebrities is interesting considering that Handler has stepped out with one or two very big names.

Handler’s first big relationship that was carried out in the public eye was with businessman and CEO of Comcast Entertainment Group Ted Harbert. Handler and Harbert started dating in 2006 and went out for four years before splitting up in 2010.

Handler later admitted that her high-powered career contributed to their split: “I would come home from work and Ted would be like ‘Do you want to watch your show?’ and I’d be like ‘No I just came from my show. That’s the last thing I’d want to do.’ That was the reason it didn’t work out ultimately. I think.”

After her breakup from Harbert she stepped out briefly with Animal Planet star Dave Salmoni before beginning a romance with rapper 50 Cent. While the two never directly confirmed that they were a couple Handler has talked openly about her relationship with 50 Cent in recent years. She has even joked about getting back together with him from time to time — although nothing seems to have ever actually transpired between them since 2010.

What’s next for Chelsea Handler?

These days it seems as though Handler has had enough of the spotlight — at least when it comes to her love life. Handler has worked hard to distance herself from the image that she cultivated during her years on Chelsea Lately when she talked about Kardashians and all the latest pop culture hot topics. She’s also had experience dating people in the entertainment business and based on her comments to WIRED she seems to be disillusioned enough by fame to want to pursue a relationship with a “real” person.

With recent revelations from the comedian that she wants to be more “open-minded” when it comes to dating it looks like fans can expect to see Handler testing the waters with all different types of men in the coming years — just not those who share her celebrity status."

In Tigers history the one that stands out most came Aug. 25 2007 — well actually it was Aug. 26 when Detroit's Carlos Guillen swatted a home run through the raindrops at Comerica Park to send the home fans home happy at 3:30 in the morning. The Tigers had beaten the Yankees 9-6 in 11 innings.

Under today's baseball rules with a runner starting on second base in extra innings like this is high-school softball that thrilling moment might never have happened. The Tigers or Yankees might've won it in 10 innings having pushed a runner to third and scored him on a sacrifice fly.

Would you remember where you were when that happened?

And such is the great debate about arguably the most-controversial change to the game in the Rob Manfred era of Major League Baseball. MLB went to the runner rule during a shortened 2020 season and kept it for 2021 — and gulp possibly forever — in an attempt to shorten games and preserve pitchers' health.

The Tigers lost in 10 innings on Friday night 5-4 when the White Sox start-off runner advanced to third base on a fly ball and then scored on a sacrifice fly. The Tigers' record in extra-inning games is 4-3 in 2021.

""I think it's serving its purpose"" Tigers manager AJ Hinch said before Saturday's game against the White Sox at Comerica Park. ""Whether people like it or not is up to themselves.""

That's not to say there's not room for improving the rule Hinch said.

One idea he floated was keeping the runner for extra innings but maybe starting the runner on first in the 10th inning then starting the runner on second in the 11th inning. That way there'd be at least a little more challenge in scoring the run during the first additional inning.

""Maybe"" said Hinch ""get a little creative with it.""

But even under the current format Hinch said it still creates excitement in the stands. He said you could feel the buzz Friday night to start extra innings after Daz Cameron blasted a two-run homer in the ninth to tie the game.

Like that 2007 Guillen game Friday's ended in the rain. But it ended before midnight.

""Every ballpark we've been in there's a change you can feel from the ninth inning to the 10th inning when the runner's at second"" Hinch said. ""It's hard to argue unless you are just anti-evolving that it doesn't create some sort of exciting momentum.""

Diehard baseball fans would argue though that there's just as much excitement in a marathon extra-inning game like say the Tigers' 4-2 over the Milwaukee Brewers at old County Stadium on July 8 2000. The game went 15 innings and lasted 5 hours 20 minutes. They played their seventh-inning staple ""Roll Out The Barrel"" twice.

If you're a Tigers fan who was at the game you remember it like it was yesterday.

But that's not today's MLB and it may never be again.

""You don't have any of these exhausting 15- 16- 17- 18-inning games like you'll see every now and then"" Hinch said. ""At the end of the day we're conserving health. These long games we want to keep position players off the pitching mound. I'm in favor of it.""

Health is one consideration though game time might be the bigger one. Pace of play has been one of Manfred's obsession since becoming commissioner. The average game time in 2021 is 3 hours 9 minutes three minutes longer than in 2020 but actually one minute shorter than 2019 the last year there was no special extra-inning rule. The 3:09 is the second-longest average in MLB history behind 2019's 3:10.

Around the horn

►Third baseman Jeimer Candelario is back in the country after tending to a family emergency in the Dominican Republic and is undergoing testing and quarantine. He is expected to rejoin the team at some point during the next series in Kansas City.

►New assistant hitting coach Mike Hessman was a candidate for the job after Hinch became manager but Hinch said he went with Jose Cruz Jr. because of their relationship. Cruz is leaving the Tigers next week to become head coach at Rice.

►Catcher Wilson Ramos (lumbar spine strain) out since May 24 was set to begin a rehab assignment with Single-A Lakeland on Saturday.

►Center fielder Derek Hill (shoulder sprain) will rehab in Lakeland Florida but will be on the injured list longer than the minimum 10-day stay Hinch said.

►Starter Julio Teheran still isn't throwing Hinch said. He'll be in Lakeland next week after multiple consultations with his doctors and the team's doctors.

►Cameron got a start Saturday afternoon after his Friday night heroics and Miguel Cabrera was scheduled to get a day off.

Going for his second no-hitter in the 2021 season Rodon's attempt at a historic mark — only five pitchers have thrown two no-hitters in a single regular season — was spoiled by Tigers hometown slugger Eric Haase.

Haase doubled to left field with one out in the seventh inning just past the outstretched glove of Andrew Vaughn.

""He was executing and he was on today"" Haase said. ""Just to be able to grind out that at-bat. I think it was eight pitches before he finally threw something over the plate. Even then it was a one-hand hit it where they aren't kind of deal. Obviously happy that it fell.""

TRADE DEADLINE: Will Al Avila buy or sell at the trade deadline? He's got an open mind

Still the Tigers (26-39) lost 4-1 to the White Sox in Sunday's series finale at Comerica Park. Detroit has dropped 17 of its past 19 games in the matchup dating back to last season. The most recent loss wraps up a three-game sweep for the White Sox in first place in the American League Central with a 41-24 record.

The Tigers have not been no-hit since Sept. 29 2013 when Henderson Alvarez pitched his gem at Marlins Park in Miami. There hasn't been a no-hitter at Comerica Park since Justin Verlander did so against the Milwaukee Brewers on June 12 2007.

The Tigers relied on six relievers in the loss: Kyle Funkhouser (2⅔ innings) Tyler Alexander (2⅓ innings) Buck Farmer (one inning) Joe Jimenez (one inning) Bryan Garcia (one inning) and Gregory Soto (one inning). It was a bullpen-only game to provide starters Matthew Boyd Casey Mize and Tarik Skubal extra rest before they face the Kansas City Royals.

RULE 5 DRAFT: Why Tigers rookie Akil Baddoo 'could be here to stay for a long time'

But Rodon owned the pitcher's mound.

Before Haase's double the only Detroit batters to reach base were Isaac Paredes in the second inning and Robbie Grossman in the sixth inning. Both players drew walks. Paredes got to second base on a force out. Grossman who took his walk with two outs didn't reach scoring position.

Before Haase's double the hardest balls in play against Rodon came from Harold Castro's bat. He logged a 94.8 mph exit velocity for his fly out in the third inning and a 94.6 mph exit velocity for his ground out in the sixth.

Rodon completed seven innings giving up one run on one hit and two walks. He struck out nine batters and threw 70 of 103 pitches for strikes. He recorded 22 swings and misses including 15 with his four-seam fastball and six with his slider.

""He was really good"" Tigers manager AJ Hinch said. ""Probably as good of a left-handed starting pitcher as we've seen all year. He's been dominant across the league but especially today. He was overpowering. We couldn't really get anything started against him. He dominated us.""

The Tigers scored their lone run from Niko Goodrum's sacrifice fly — after Haase advanced to third base because of a wild pitch. Chicago's bullpen featuring Evan Marshall and Liam Hendriks pitched perfect eighth and ninth innings respectively.

Starting with Funk

Funkhouser walked Brian Goodwin with one out in the first inning but responded by getting grounders from Yoan Moncada and Jose Abreu. He stranded Goodwin at second base. Then he retired all three batters he faced in the second.

Funkhouser threw strikes something he has mastered this season after struggling in 2020 which featured his MLB debut and a 7.27 ERA across 17⅓ innings. This was Funkhouser's first start in his big-league career which spans 27 appearances.

""I tried to make it as much of a relief appearance as possible"" Funkhouser said. ""I went to the bullpen at like 12:40 (p.m.) and did my routine. I got up right before the anthem got loose and threw about 15-20 pitches. Juan (Nieves assistant pitching coach) was like 'Hey you're throwing the ninth inning and it's tied 0-0.' I played it like that.""

In the third Zack Collins singled on a fastball from Funkhouser and Danny Mendick struck out swinging at a 96 mph fastball. Funkhouser got Leury Garcia to ground into a force out to complete two of three outs. That's when manager AJ Hinch summoned Alexander from the bullpen.

Funkhouser fired 22 of 33 pitches for strikes.

""He gave us as much as he could"" Hinch said. ""I could have left him out a little longer but I'm trying to manage for the next series.""

NEW POSITION: Jake Rogers teases AJ Hinch after pitching debut: 'Let me get that ERA down'

The rest of the 'pen

After Funkhouser and Alexander the Tigers didn't have many options available in the bullpen. In Saturday's 15-2 loss to the White Sox Hinch was forced to send five pitchers and two position players to the mound.

This time the relievers were much better.

Still the results weren't enough to win. The White Sox scored first on a single from Abreu in the fourth inning just after Alexander allowed a leadoff double to Moncada. In the fifth a Mendick single and Garcia double gave Chicago a 2-0 lead.

Alexander allowed two runs on four hits. He struck out three and did not concede a walk.

Farmer struggled with his command. The White Sox took a 4-0 lead in the sixth inning because he hit two batters. His second hit-by-pitch came with the bases loaded then he walked Garcia with the bases loaded.

Called up from Triple-A Toledo on Sunday morning Farmer allowed two runs on two hits and one walk with two strikeouts. Jimenez pitched a scoreless seventh working around Abreu's one-out double to center.

""He had a hard time controlling the inning"" Hinch said about Farmer. ""A couple of free passes that created an inning for himself and had to pitch out of a mess. I thought he competed well. Getting him right in there today was the plan. That's why we called him up and we needed the arm.

""I wanted him to go maybe one-plus (innings) but he used up a lot of pitches trying to get out of the bases-loaded jam that he created. His stuff has a little life to it which was encouraging. Wasn't a clean inning which is what we were hoping for.""

Garcia avoided damage despite two singles in the eighth inning. Soto allowed a walk and a single in his scoreless ninth.

He is following daily from close and afar as the next wave of players climb through the minor leagues. He checks on Spencer Torkelson the 2020 No. 1 overall pick in High-A West Michigan and keeps tabs on Double-A Erie's Riley Greene who may be the best prospect of the bunch.

And Avila has driven to see Matt Manning pitch for Triple-A Toledo whom the Tigers picked No. 9 overall in 2016. Avila is also pleased with catcher Dillon Dingler a Round 2 selection a year ago. Daniel Cabrera too might have a bright future roaming the Comerica Park outfield.

""Pretty excited what's going on there"" Avila said Friday standing outside his team's dugout at Comerica Park.

TRADE DEADLINE: Will Tigers' Al Avila buy or sell at the trade deadline? He's got an open mind

Torkelson is crushing the High-A West Michigan competition.

His spring training woes carried into his first professional season but plenty has changed. The 21-year-old is hitting .307 with eight doubles one triple five home runs 24 RBIs 24 walks and 27 strikeouts in 29 games. He has a .447 on-base percentage and .554 slugging percentage.

On Friday Torkelson finished 3-for-3 with four RBIs in West Michigan's 9-4 win over the Lansing Lugnuts at LMCU Ballpark in Comstock Park. He came a double shy of the cycle. In the sixth inning Torkelson and Dingler crushed back-to-back home runs.

DINGLER: Tigers catching prospect 'blessed with a very special talent'

TORKELSON: Why the fixes for struggling Spencer Torkelson are all in his head

The Tigers also love what they're seeing from Dingler who has contributed offensively and defensively for West Michigan. The 22-year-old came from Ohio State and was the No. 38 pick in last year's draft.

Dingler has a .307 batting average six doubles one triple eight home runs 24 RBIs 13 walks and 34 strikeouts in 30 games. He carries a .398 on-base percentage and .588 slugging percentage. He hit .500 (11-for-22) with two homers and eight RBIs in a six-game span from May 31 to June 6 to win the High-A Central Offensive Player of the Week.

""We're very excited about Dingler and Torkelson at this point"" Avila said. ""They were struggling in particular Torkelson. Now he's bounced back and showing why he was the first pick and Dingler was our second pick.""

It might be time for Double-A Erie.

""We've actually been already talking about (a promotion)"" Avila said. ""It'll come. We'll let you guys know when we make that decision. But at some point if they continue to do well it's just a natural progression. I would even include Daniel Cabrera on that one. He's also coming around and putting together a pretty solid season.""

ANOTHER PROSPECT: Daz Cameron ready for center field in his return to Tigers: 'I love it'

Cabrera — the third Whitecap being considered for a promotion — was the No. 62 pick (competitive balance round) in the 2020 draft. The 22-year-old is building on his success from his LSU career. He is hitting .254 with seven doubles two triples three home runs 25 RBIs 11 walks and 31 strikeouts in 32 games.

West Michigan has an 18-15 record. Erie has been paced to a 22-11 record by Greene who is hitting .260 with six home runs 21 RBIs 18 walks and 48 strikeouts in 32 games. He was the No. 5 overall pick in 2019.

[ With Double-A assignment Riley Greene is on the fast track to joining Tigers ]

Manning update

Not everything is perfect though.

Manning 23 has an 8.07 ERA over 32⅓ innings in seven starts. He has been tagged for 11 home runs with 10 walks and 36 strikeouts. The home-run ball and the inability to execute his pitches are the main reasons for his alarming results.

""He's had a little bit of a struggle at the beginning of the season"" Avila said. ""We believe that these are things that can be fixed. As a matter of fact they are (being fixed) as we speak. We do believe that he's on the right track.""

For Manning's most recent start Jim Leyland was in attendance at Fifth Third Field in Toledo.

Avila watched from his iPad.

Manning gave up two runs in six innings Wednesday against the Louisville Bats picking up the first win of his Triple-A career. He struck out eight allowing four hits — all singles — and two walks. He threw 54 of 93 pitches for strikes.

NOTEBOOK: Tigers hire Mike Hessman minors home run king as interim assistant hitting coach

""His last outing was good"" Avila said. ""He pitched very well. There were a few small things that if he would've avoided them then it would have been even better for him in that game.""

It sounds like Manning's MLB debut is coming soon.

""There's a lot of confidence in him. There's a lot of optimism there. We'll let you know in due time when that (promotion) is going to happen. But I would be paying attention for sure.""

Tigers starter Jose Urena was flat-out ambushed turning the day before a scheduled team bullpen day into a bullpen day of its own as the Chicago White Sox coasted 15-2 on Saturday afternoon at Comerica Park before the largest crowd to attend a sporting event in the city of Detroit since March 10 2020.

A crowd of 15913 took in the action. The game was an hour old before the Tigers came to bat in the second inning it was three hours old by last call in the seventh inning and all told it took 3 hours 47 minutes.

When the game was only two minutes old the Tigers already trailed 1-0 on back-to-back doubles. The first six White Sox batters went double RBI double hit by pitch reached on an error and two-run single and somehow it seemed that it actually went downhill from there. The White Sox scored three times in the first and after Detroit had answered with a two-run home run by Harold Castro Chicago added five in the second.

White Sox leadoff hitter Tim Anderson batted three times before Tigers No. 9 hitter Willi Castro batted once.

We're running a new-subscriber special. Support local journalism and subscribe here.

Urena (2-6) didn't make it out of the second inning retiring just five of 15 batters.

""I just don't think he had anything. He was a little sluggish"" Tigers manager AJ Hinch said of Urena adding there was no concern that he was aggravating the forearm strain that landed him on the injured list this year.

""That's a bad sign against an offensive club like the White Sox.""

Daniel Norris didn't make it into the fourth. Beau Burrows might have made 15000 new BFFs when he set down the White Sox 1-2-3 in the fourth but was tattooed early in the fifth bounced back with a couple strikeouts and then was stricken by apparent heat exhaustion vomiting on the mound before leaving the game (after the game he was optioned to Triple-A Toledo; the Tigers will call up another pitcher Sunday.)

BOX SCORE: White Sox 15 Tigers 2

The grounds crew cleaned up Burrows' mess but there was no mop big enough for the rest as Detroit suffered its most lopsided loss of the season.

Alex Lange followed Burrows and promptly threw 13 consecutive balls at one point — a streak-snapping strike nearly earning him a standing ovation and an inning-ending strikeout actually earning him a real one.

Hey it's been a while for Tigers fans. They roared and chanted ""M-V-P!"" when a fan behind home plate made a dandy catch in the seventh inning. They got The Wave going again a two-lapper even. An NSYNC singalong was pretty darn lively. Like during the COVID-19 lockdown they found ways to entertain themselves.

On the 14th anniversary of Justin Verlander's first career no-hitter at Comerica Park only two of the seven Tigers pitchers Saturday had a scoreless line — Jason Foley and umm Harold Castro take a bow — and only Castro yes you are reading that correctly had a hitless one. Before Castro in the ninth it was Jake Rogers (acquired in the Verlander trade albeit to catch not pitch) in the eighth.

Rogers begged Hinch for the ninth inning too saying ""Let me get my ERA down"" but Hinch politely declined.

""Harry went out out there and threw three up three down and kind of showed me up there"" Rogers who last pitched in summer ball in high school said with a not-so-shy smirk. ""(Hinch) said 'Don't ever question by managing again.'

""It's not the best that we're down 10 or whatever it was we want to win. But at the same time I was just wanting to go out there and have fun. I enjoyed it.""

The White Sox finished with 13 hits and 11 walks in taking their seventh of nine against the Tigers this season with the series finale set for 1:10 p.m. Sunday.

Speaking of which Sunday was already a scheduled bullpen day — in other words no traditional starting pitcher — for the Tigers who after burning through five actual pitchers Saturday afternoon almost certainly are going to be thin in arms when they visit the Kansas City Royals for a series that starts Monday.

White Sox starter Dylan Cease (5-2) improved to 8-0 all-time against the Tigers 3-0 this season alone. After the Castro homer — his first of the year a 373-foot shot to right — Cease retired 15 of his last 20 batters. He struck out seven.tpaul@detroitnews.com

""He's not coming back for a bit"" Hinch said before Friday's 5-4 loss to the Chicago White Sox in extra innings at Comerica Park. ""He played his first extended game so we'll tackle that one when it's a little bit more relevant on the day to day.""

Here's the dilemma: Ramos signed to a one-year $2 million contract this offseason completed his first extended spring training game Friday in Lakeland Florida. He is coming back from his second stint on the injured list with a lumbar spine sprain.

But the Tigers have two catchers — Eric Haase and Jake Rogers — performing well in the big leagues.

""Sure there's going to be some tough decisions"" Tigers general manager Al Avila said Friday. ""At the end of the day we're going to make the decisions best for this organization as we move forward this year and going into next year looking at this picture but at the big picture at the same time.""

TRADE DEADLINE: Will Tigers GM Al Avila buy or sell at the trade deadline? He's got an open mind

BONDING TIME: How Miguel Cabrera's mentorship helped Candelario become consistent

Between two back injuries Ramos has played 35 games this season. He is hitting .200 with six home runs 13 RBIs six walks and 29 strikeouts. He hasn't hit a home run since April 13 when he belted two of them against the Houston Astros in his ninth game.

The Tigers signed Ramos because of his offense. His defense is well-below average.

""I believe he went 2-for-4 and reported feeling really good"" Hinch said about Ramos' first game in his rehabilitation process. ""He was the DH. We've got a progression for him to get back behind the plate and ramp up his activity.""

Meanwhile Haase through 23 games is hitting .256 with three doubles one triple eight home runs 13 RBIs five walks and 31 strikeouts. Haase's ability to play left field as well as catcher gives Hinch the luxury of carrying three catchers if he desires: Ramos Haase and Rogers.

Keeping three catchers however seems like a waste of a roster spot considering Isaac Paredes Daz Cameron Derek Hill and other young players need opportunities in the majors. Their developments are key to putting the rebuild to rest.

Rogers 26 is finally getting comfortable in the big leagues. He probably won't ever be known for his bat but he doesn't look overwhelmed anymore. Hitting .234 with three homers six RBIs five walks and 21 strikeouts — along with exceptional defense — should be enough to keep him around.

Although Haase caught Spencer Turnbull's no-hitter Rogers is working well as the primary catcher for 24-year-old starting pitchers Casey Mize and Tarik Skubal. It's no surprise Hinch has them paired up with the organization's best defensive catcher.

Those scenarios could and probably should leave Ramos out of the mix.

""It's great to have tough decisions because that means you have players that you like and there's going to be tough decisions"" Avila said. ""If you don't have tough decisions that means you don't really have much going on. That is an enjoyable part of making decisions.""

Derek Hill to Lakeland

After placing Hill on the 10-day injured list Thursday with a right shoulder sprain the Tigers sent their 25-year-old center fielder to Lakeland to recover.

Initially the Tigers did not believe Hill's injury was serious. He had a Grade 1 strain which means the ligaments stretched further than normal but didn't completely tear and Hinch said he was ""moving around pretty well"" in the clubhouse Friday.

Turns out Hill's return might take longer than once expected.

""It's not a countdown to 10 days if that's what you're asking"" Hinch said.

NOTEBOOK: Tigers hire Mike Hessman minors home run king as interim assistant hitting coach

THE PROSPECTS: Promotions in sight for Spencer Torkelson Dillon Dingler Matt Manning

Jeimer Candelario is back

Before Saturday's game the Tigers reinstated third baseman Jeimer Candelario from the bereavement list and placed him on the injured list. The IL move was a formality as Candelario needs to go through COVID-19 protocols after arriving in the U.S. from the Dominican Republic.

Hinch plans to activate Candelario during the upcoming three-game series with the Kansas City Royals from Monday through Wednesday at Kauffman Stadium. Candelario is hitting .266 with four home runs and 18 RBIs in 57 games.

PROSPECT WATCH: Why Isaac Paredes feels 'more mature' in second MLB opportunity

ANOTHER PROSPECT: Daz Cameron ready for center field in his return to Tigers

""The process is underway to get him through the intake testing and quarantine given that he had left the country"" Hinch said. ""He's unlikely to travel with us given the intake process but we're expecting him to be with at some point in Kansas City.""

Carnival Cruise Line

This year Carnival Cruise Line became the latest brand to introduce a new livery. In May the company announced that the new hull design of the new Mardi Gras will become a feature across the fleet as the company prepares to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2022.

The livery is highlighted by a stately navy-blue hull inspired by officers’ uniforms along with vibrant red and white accents running the entire length of the ship.

After the Mardi Gras the Carnival Magic (pictured above) was the first vessel to receive the new colors during a drydock in Marseilles.

Royal Caribbean International

Royal Caribbean International updated its livery in 2020 adding a larger name on the hull of the new Odyssey of the Seas. Unusually big the vessel name runs 87.4 meters down each side of the ship.

It’s the second new look for Royal Caribbean in the last decade.

The Quantum of the Seas launched in 2014 debuted a new color template for the company with a light blue hull.

The color scheme was later added on selected vessels including the recently “Amplified” Freedom of the Seas.

Celebrity Cruises

As part of the Celebrity Revolution program Celebrity Cruises is adding a new livery to its fleet. While undergoing the upgrades the company’s existing ships also receive the color scheme of the new Edge-cClass vessels that have a dark blue hull.

The livery has been added to seven of the 11 Celebrity ships.

Princess Cruises

Princess Cruises introduced a new livery in 2016 adding a giant version of its “sea witch” logo to the hull of the 2013-built Royal Princess.

The fresh look which also includes the repositioning of the ship’s name was later added to other vessels and is now present on the entire fleet.

Costa Cruises

In 2018 Costa C became another Carnival Corporation brand to introduce a revised livery. The subtle change saw the name of the ships painted on the bow with a specially designed new font in larger lettering as well as the addition of a stylized Italian flag.

The livery was created to mark the 70th anniversary of the Italian brand and has since been added to the entire fleet.

P&O UK

With the introduction of the 2015-built Britannia P&O Cruises also introduced a new paint scheme to its fleet.

The brand’s traditional funnels were repainted in blue with the addition of P&O’s rising sun logo. As part of the new livery the hulls across the fleet saw a stylized British flag added.

P&O Australia

In 2016 P&O Australia announced the addition of a stylized Southern Cross to the hull of its latest vessel the Pacific Explorer. Along with a new color and a new logo on the funnel the five-star constellation image became P&O’s new livery.

More recently the look was added to the Pacific Encounter the newest ship in the fleet.

Silversea Cruises

Silversea is introducing a new hull color to its fleet with a light gray adorned on the hulls of select ships.

Three vessels are currently sporting the updated color scheme including the new Silver Origin.

Under construction in Italy the newbuild Silver Dawn already shows the new gray hull as well.

Marella Cruises

To mark the addition of the former Splendour of the Seas to its fleet the TUI-owned Marella Cruises introduced a new livery in 2016.

Then called Thomson Cruises the brand created a new “wave design” in-line with TUI’s airplanes.

According to Marella the new branding was meant to keep the consistency across all markets and is now present on the entire cruise fleet.

Fred. Olsen Cruise Line

In 2015 Fred. Olsen debuted a new look on its fleet.. The new color scheme and livery represented the change of position for its product within the premium market the company said at the time.

The gray hull is a throwback to Fred. Olsen’s heritage when the first Black Watch and Black Prince were launched in the 1930s according to the company. The use of the “Cartier” red line refers to the company’s “Red Carpet” service level for every guest.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Many people have believed that the rake of the windshield on the Wrangler and Gladiator has a lot to do with the windows getting hit by various debris.

But thanks to our dealer connections it sounds like the Jeep brand has been listening and is ready to respond with a new option that opens this month.

Jeep has told its dealer body that it has now opened ordering for a new Corning Gorilla Glass windshield option for the popular Wrangler and Gladiator models. Using the same chemical-strengthing technology as most cellphone screens and have up to 3-times higher impact resistance over standard glass. The new windshields are thinner and lighter than the conventional windshields that it replaces.

The new windshields consist of a combination of an ultra-thin Gorilla Glass inner ply with a 52% thicker outer ply

making the windshield lightweight durable and offers superior resistance to chips cracks and fractures from

stones and off-road debris that hard-core Jeepers are likely to encounter.

Jeep has listed the new windshields with the order code (GMA) and will set customers back $95 USD. Jeep expects that 80% of its orders will have the new option for both Wrangler and Gladiator models. But there is a slight catch. Jeep will offer the option on the following models…

Wrangler –

Willys (N/A on Willys Sport)

Sahara

But the city’s rebound after every major crisis in the past also gave this New York native some hope.

“New York always opens up bigger better and stronger after every catastrophe” he said in an interview. “That will continue to be the case. You already feel the energy in the streets. This business is cyclical. We are starting a new cycle."" He added that he's ""seeing a real spike in activity.""

One clear sign that gave him hope was when a retail tenant two months ago agreed to a 12-year lease for the 5000 square feet of space on the ground floor of the hotel located at 560 7th Ave. by 40th Street and a short walk from Times Square.

How much is the tenant paying? A thousand dollars per square foot El-Gamal told CoStar News. “They are paying me an arm and a leg for the property.”

By comparison the retail market rent in the Times Square submarket declined 1.5% to $254 per square foot from a year earlier while the rate in the city fell 3.6% to $43 in the same time according to CoStar’s latest data.

“That shows you the momentum” El-Gamal said at a preview event of the property where musician Jimmy Buffett performed his signature song that the resort chain is named after. “This asset is a market maker.”

El-Gamal declined to identify the tenant.

The 32-story $370 million development features what it bills as the only year-round outdoor heated pool in Times Square a 32-foot replica of the Statue of Liberty holding a margarita and views of the iconic ball used in New Year’s Eve celebrations as well as the Manhattan skyline. It opens to the public July 1 to coincide with the city’s official reopening a test for an area that was at the center of the pandemic about a year ago and that has a commercial property sector that's still battered.

Above-Market Rates

The hotel’s 234 rooms each with an island-inspired theme and a ceiling fan a traveler would find more often in tropical climates than urban New York is about 30% booked every month through the end of the year with the percentage even higher near the end of the year between Dec. 27 and Jan. 3 Kori Yoran the resort hotel’s general manager told CoStar.

Those bookings command an average daily rate in the mid-$300s in July with the rate surging to at least $800 to $900 near the year-end countdown festivities he said.

In comparison the daily rate in the Midtown West and Times Square area averaged $186 in the week that ended June 5 according to hospitality data and analytics firm STR a unit of CoStar Group the parent of CoStar News.

“We are seeing very good traction” Yoran said adding the booking window also starts to stretch far in advance instead of people waiting until the last minute to book. “I’m happy that we are there so quickly. Now that we are closer we are seeing spikes. That’s going to keep growing.”

Where the bookings came from also surprised him. In addition to those from the tri-state area guests also will come from other states including California Texas and Florida as well as overseas from countries including Australia the United Kingdom France and Amsterdam he said.

”We weren’t expecting that much international travel” he told CoStar.

In another indication travelers are gradually returning to New York Empire State Realty Trust recently said its iconic Empire State Building observatory is starting to see long-distance visitors from outside New York New Jersey and Connecticut. And the newly opened Harry Potter flagship store also in Manhattan has welcomed shoppers from Virginia to California.

‘Pent-Up Demand’

Margaritaville Resort’s bookings signal that the depressed hospitality market in New York could be edging toward recovery.

Average hotel occupancy in the week ended June 5 jumped to 72% the highest since early March 2020 according to STR. The average daily rate averaged $181.15 also the highest since March of last year. Revenue per available room of $135.58 was the highest since about the same time last year STR data shows.

“There’s so much pent-up demand” John Cohlan CEO of Margaritaville Holdings the operator of hotels restaurants and casinos featuring the brand said in an interview. “Who would have known these vaccinations would be so successful? Never underestimate the drive people have for their leisure.”

In fact that demand is evident across Margaritaville Holdings’ U.S. properties. Both its hotels and restaurants saw business rise 10% in April and May from their 2019 pre-pandemic levels according to Cohlan. Being in mostly “drive-to-leisure” locations also kept them relatively shielded from the slowdown in air travel and other restrictions he said.

The New York resort is the company’s first foray in the Northeast. There are 24 Margaritaville resorts in 21 cities and seven countries with 18 in the United States.

Declining to be more specific Cohlan said he expects the location will turn profitable “very quickly” thanks to the five restaurants and bars it has that can attract foot traffic and yield sales of “high-margin” drinks.

Not Alone on the Island

The resort despite some positive signs is competing in a market still deeply wounded from the fallout of COVID-19. New York continues to lead the top 25 U.S. lodging markets in terms of the number of hotels that remain closed according to a CoStar hospitality market report. As of early June about 100 hotels were temporarily closed and 20 hotels have shut permanently since the beginning of the pandemic.

Luxury hotels have been particularly hard hit from the lack of international tourists and business travelers the CoStar report said adding those properties make up half of the 100 that are still closed.

In efforts to revive its ailing tourism industry New York launched a $30 million marketing campaign and decided not to collect the city’s hotel occupancy tax for the summer.

The occupancy rate for top-tier hotels in the city while having recovered to 48% in the week ended June 5 from 41% a year earlier is still far short of the near 90% in the same week in 2019 according to STR data.

As demand remains low Margaritaville Resort also will vie against other newly built hotels. It’s one of 15 with a total of 3500 rooms that’s scheduled to open in the Manhattan area with the most hotels debuting this year according to the CoStar report. Citywide 70 hotels nearly 13000 rooms are projected to open in 2021.

“The supply of new hotels under construction in New York shows no signs of abating despite the difficult financial circumstances many existing hotel owners are in” the report said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY2EueWFob28uY29tL25ld3MvY2hyaXMtaGVtc3dvcnRoLXRyb2xscy1jaHJpcy1ldmFucy0xNTAwMDA1MjQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chris Hemsworth Trolls Chris Evans on His Birthday by Posting Snap with Chris Pratt: 'Number 1 in My Book',"David M.

The only thing is the pumpkin in this pie isn't the same as that pumpkin you might also pick up from Costco to turn into a jack-o'-lantern. If we really want to be accurate here Costco should probably start labeling its pumpkin pie as ""Dickinson squash pie"" because that's what it is. Unfortunately that just doesn't roll off the tongue quite as nicely.

Before you dump your Costco pumpkin pie in the trash and demand to know why you've been misled by your favorite supplier of bulk groceries it's important that we clear up two things. First off your typical Halloween pumpkin — known as a field pumpkin — is also a squash and so while it's still under that big squash umbrella it's different than a Dickinson squash. The Dickinson variety of squash is actually more closely related to the butternut squash. It has more of an elongated shape and it's a much paler orange color than a traditional Halloween-style pumpkin. Yes you could carve it but it's much better for eating (via The Atlantic).

So why don't we call the Dickinson squash a ""Dickinson pumpkin""? That would probably put this whole pumpkin pie debacle to bed right? Well the botany world can be a rather fickle one and folks are rather picky about what can be labeled a ""pumpkin"" and what is merely just a boring ol' squash. According to Heirloom Gardener botanists only refer to a particular group of squash with the scientific name Cucurbita pepo as pumpkins. These squash tend to have that distinct round pumpkin shape and have different leaves and stems than other types of squash.

Even this is debatable among some in botany though and as The Atlantic points out Encyclopedia Britannica lists Cucurbita moschata aka Dickinson squash as a type of pumpkin. Frankly it's enough to make one throw down their plate of pumpkin(?) squash(?) pie in frustration and skip dessert altogether.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtdGhpcy1jb3N0Y28taXRlbS1jb21lcy13aXRoLTUteWVhcnMtb2YtZnJlZS1yZWZpbGxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Costco Item Comes With 5 Years of Free Refills,"It's the weekend and you know what that means: Grocery shopping!

Here's Why,"Costco Shoppers Are Unhappy With These Cauliflower Egg Wraps. Here's Why

For people that are trying to eat healthier and cut out carbs in the new year Costco has them covered with its new sale on healthy egg wraps made with cauliflower per Crepini. These wraps are low in calories and contain no carbs dairy or gluten and they are on sale at Costco until Jan. 24 for just $6.29 (via costcobuys). However while they certainly check all the boxes for a healthy purchase they haven't necessarily been flying off the shelves.

Apparently its health qualifications and reasonable price isn't enough to sell everyone on these egg wraps. According to some Costco shoppers these wraps are flimsy thin and not worth the price. An Instagram user commented on costcobuys post ""These are terrible. I was so excited about them. They are paper thin so there's no way you could actually put anything into them like a tortilla. And they taste awful. Sorry."" While another was a little more generous with their assessment commenting ""They are too dry and flimsy. Just ok.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtY29zdGNvLXJlY2VudC1wcm9kdWN0LWNoYW5nZXMtanVuZS0yMDIxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 Costco Products That Have Changed Recently — Eat This Not That,"Costco looks a lot different now than it did a few weeks ago. Samples are officially back as well as seats at the food court. Though some aspects of the shopping experience are returning to ""normal"" some products on store shelves appear to be changing.

Over the last few months Costco members have taken to Reddit to comment about some products they claim are slightly different than before. To keep you in the know we've gathered them below in a comprehensive list.

It's important to note that anyone can leave feedback about products online and in the warehouse. All you have to do is go to Costco.com and click the small blue ""Feedback"" button on the right side of the webpage. ""Member feedback and concerns are of great importance to us as it gives us the opportunity to hear directly from our members regarding our merchandise"" a spokesperson for Costco says.

Paper Towels

Shoppers first noticed that paper towels were shrinking in April. Kirkland Premium Towel rolls used to come with 160 sheets but now they come with 140. The change took effect because of an increased demand for paper towels amid the ongoing pandemic and Costco says it's only temporary.

""This change enabled us to increase the number of sell units we can provide to our members and provide better in stocks so that members can more easily find the product in our stores"" a spokesperson said in a statement to Eat This Not That!. ""We do want to assure you that we did not increase the price per sheet to our members . . . We recognize this change is not ideal and hope to return to the original 160 sheet per roll item as soon as possible.""

The spokesperson also noted that the smaller rolls are cheaper matching the price per sheet of the rolls with 160 sheets.

Kirkland Microwave Popcorn

One Reddit user claims that the Kirkland Microwave Popcorn is different than normal—and they're not just talking about the taste. However no one else in the thread has noticed any changes so perhaps it was just a fluke.

Lysol Multipurpose Cleaner

The new 45% more bottles of Lysol Clean and Fresh sold at Costco are allegedly more diluted than smaller versions of the same product. Reddit user @RandomUserUniqueName called out the difference by sharing photos of the new 210-ounce bottle. In the images the older 144-ounce version appears to be less diluted.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Regardless of what size bottle you pick up it's important to keep your kitchen clean in order to ward off harmful germs. A registered dietitian and one of the members of our Medical Expert Board shares how to sanitize your kitchen in two easy steps.

Kirkland Green Tea

This may not have been a recent change but Reddit user @Gremlin_Cat claims that the organic green tea at Costco tastes different now than in the past.

Another commenter suggested a possible ""sliding scale of quality to maintain pricing over time."" Thus they speculated that the ratio of sencha to matcha had likely increased in an effort to cut costs.

In other news drinking green tea may prevent this leading cause of death according to science.

Kirkland Bath Tissue

It's not just paper towels—Costco's house brand of bath tissue has also reportedly shrunk. One role used to have 425 sheets but now they seem to only have 380 according to a post by Reddit user @ryanbebb.

Others have noticed this apparent change too. While there are fewer sheets the new bath tissue is stronger and thicker thanks to an extra ply layer (which usually translates to using less).

Kirkland Trail Mix

People love trail mix because it's easily customizable but some types truly encompass the perfect combination of chocolate dried fruit and nuts. The Kirkland Trail Mix at Costco is no exception but some members claim that it has changed. However this update has made some people like Reddit user @leonffs somewhat happy and hungry.

Others say they also like the switch to peanut M&Ms and that there seem to be fewer peanuts now and more different types of nuts. User @bowoodchintz reminds us that knowing about any changes in ingredients is very important for people with food allergies.

This word strikes fear in Colorado. Our state is facing its worst fire season ever. This summer may be as dangerous as any we have faced and we are all in a hypervigilant state to prevent fires. Compounding the threat is the unprecedented proliferation of 5G cell towers.

According to Tony P. Simmons P. E. an electrical engineer who is a subject matter expert on electrical safety in California and Nevada “Many people are not aware that electrical equipment including all cell towers and 5G small cell sites pose a fire threat that must be mitigated by a recognized electrical fire safety expert. Every electrical device is going to fail at some point. The goal is to ensure that failures do not imperil life health and property.”

Three fires in California have been started either in part or in whole by telecommunications equipment failures: Silverado Woolsey and Malibu Canyon.

The cause of the 2020 Silverado Fire appears to be shared responsibility between Southern California Edison (SCE) and telecom giant T-Mobile. SCE admits the fire started at the location of one of its utility poles but has pointed its finger at T-Mobile for the failure of a telecommunications lashing wire on an SCE utility pole as the suspected cause.

In 2018 a lashing wire belonging to an unknown carrier appears to have been the cause of at least one of two ignition points for the Woolsey Fire which destroyed over 400 homes in Malibu and caused residents to flee into the ocean because the three routes of exit out of the city were blocked by traffic and fire. The carrier at this point is unknown because the Woolsey Fire remains under criminal investigation. Over $6 billion in damages was inflicted before the fire was finally extinguished. SCE and the telecom that owned the lashing wire have shared responsibility for the Woolsey inferno.





The 2007 Malibu Canyon Fire was caused by the failure of an SCE utility pole that was overloaded with telecom equipment owned by AT&T Verizon and Sprint (now T-Mobile). These four and NextG now owned by telecom infrastructure builder Crown Castle International Inc. was accused of misleading investigators and eventually settled with the California Public Utilities Commission for over $60 million.

5G TALK Tom Lankering and Kathleen Fors are writing a monthly series on 5G for The Aspen Times; the next installment on July 11.Their previous installments can be found here: April: History of 5G and what people should know May: People deserve to know about the health effects of 5G and EMFs

Cell tower fires are infrequent but devastating when they do occur. Susan Foster writer and honorary firefighter with the San Diego Fire Department who now lives in Colorado told us in an interview that “electrical fires cannot be fought through conventional means until the power has been cut. Firefighters or anyone else trying to put water on an energized cell tower fire will be electrocuted.

“Imagine this scenario” Foster explains “a cell tower catches on fire with winds gusting at 50 miles an hour. This fire is going to spread until the utility cuts the power and that can take between 10 minutes and one hour.” Foster cautions cities to establish residential setbacks from all wireless installations so that people have time to escape in the event of a fire.

To regulate the design of cell sites to protect the public from electrical hazards Cellular installations must be viewed for what they are: electrical installations.

“Frankly the promise of 5G is hype and the fire danger of having cell towers close to our homes schools and places of business can have devastating consequences” Foster says. “Electric fire safety experts were not involved in the 5G mandate but telecom executives and attorneys were. They had different priorities. I want my family to be safe. Telecom wants their market share to increase.”

We have witnessed how fast and uncontrollable a fire can spread not only with the fires we had in Basalt and Glenwood Springs but also in other areas in Colorado. We have no desire for the “promise of 5G” to add to the existing fire risks our state already faces.

The April 2021 recall of 2.5 million hotspots by Verizon due to fire risks and the recent collapse of an AT&T cell tower due to electric arcing on a high school campus in Chula Vista California demonstrates that it is irresponsible for local governments to trust the engineering of the telecom companies. The most effective way to protect Colorado from wildfires caused by telecommunication equipment is to regulate the design of a cell site with the same rigor most cities already require from their building officials but did not realize they had the right to demand of telecoms.

The Crown Point Board of Zoning Appeals approved a variance Monday to allow one entrance for a 53-lot subdivision on the southeast corner of 109th Avenue and Iowa Street near the now-closed Mowry's Fruit Farm.

The development known as The Orchard was previously approved by the Crown Point Plan Commission earlier this month.

The commission's approval was contingent on a variance being granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals which would allow the subdivision to have one entrance.

Under Crown Point's subdivision control ordinance subdivisions with more than 40 lots need two entrances.

As previously presented The Orchard is set to have an entrance along Iowa Street.

""The split boulevard remains part of the present proposal and we continue to wish that serve as the main entrance and exit to the subdivision off of Iowa Street"" said Christian Bartholomew an attorney representing the petitioner CP Prairie LLC.

""We believe that the design that's been presented for that split boulevard provides two independent travel lanes for vehicle traffic. It keeps all vehicle entrances from being located too close ... to the roundabout entry and exit at 109th and Iowa Street.""

Bartholomew added the split boulevard also avoids interfering with utility infrastructure near the southwest corner of the project as well as ""creating further vehicle intersections along 109th Avenue.""

A new proposal for the variance has ""a few modifications"" which include installing a 14-foot median between the double lane entrance and exit to the subdivision Bartholomew said noting entrance and exit lanes would each be 20 feet wide.

The new plan also calls for a 10-foot multi-use pedestrian path which also would be used for emergency access to the subdivision. The additional entry point also would be on Iowa north of The Orchard's main entrance.

""That 10-foot wide multipurpose pedestrian and emergency access way is planned to be constructed of 6-inch thick concrete with a 6-inch aggregate base that would be capable of accommodating large emergency vehicles such as fire trucks"" Bartholomew said.

The subdivision won't be accessible from 109th Avenue he later added.

The Board of Zoning Appeals approved the variance 4-0 subject to staff comments and conditions previously set forth by the Plan Commission. Vice Chairman Jeremy Taylor was absent.

Also Monday the commission sent two 4-0 favorable recommendations to the City Council one for a reiki/yoga center at 209 W. State Road 231 and another for an indoor golf simulation at 1005 Millennium Drive.

The event was held in the Quadrangle of the castle like last year due to the pandemic.

Her Majesty was accompanied by her cousin The Duke of Kent but a small number of invited guests were also attended this year seated along the edge of the Quadrangle.

What is Trooping?

It is The Queen’s official birthday parade celebrated every year on the second Saturday in June. Normally it would see over 1400 members of the Household Division on Horse Guards Parade parading together with over 200 horses and over 400 musicians from ten bands. For the second year in a row due to Covid restrictions it has been scaled down.

The Parade was held by the Household Division and The Queen’s Colour of F Company Scots Guards (of which The Duke of Kent is Colonel) were trooped. The Parade was led by the Foot Guards who were joined by The King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery and the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.

Throughout the event music was played by a Massed Band of the Household Division which included 1st Battalion Scots Guards Pipes and Drums.

The parade was bigger than last years which only included 85 guardsmen. This time 275 soldiers paraded in front of their Sovereign as the sun shone down from the blue sky above. There was also a total of 70 horses taking part.

The Queen viewed the parade from a special dais which was erected for the event. She was seen tapping her foot along to the music and clearly was enjoying the event as she smiled.

Lieutenant Hugh Dingwall was the person given the honour of carrying the Colour while this year saw a rare occurrence for Trooping. Two officers on the parade ground Colonel Jeremy Bagshaw Chief of Staff at Army Headquarters London District and 2nd Lieutenant Henry Bagshaw of the Coldstream Guards are father and sun!

The event culminated in a 41 gun salute been fired from the East Lawn of the Castle while a 21 gun salute was fired at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich. The Red Arrows also carried out a flypast which we saw The Queen grin at.

It would not be lost on those present and those watching that the last time all eyes were on the Quadrangle was for the funeral of The Duke of Edinburgh.

Two days on from what would have been the Duke’s 100th birthday his wife enjoyed a much happier event – one of her favourites.

Cummins had a 10-5 victory over his Maine South opponent on Thursday June 10.

Talking about wrestling do you have any prematch rituals?

I just like to bounce around and get loose and shake out my legs. I have really big quads so I like to let them shake a little like as a flex. I’ll listen to the music on the way over and then just jumping around and getting ready to go right at this kid.

What are your plans for next year?

As of right now I’m attending Colorado State University. They have a wrestling club that competes at what would be comparable to a Division III conference. I think I’m actually going to pursue that. I gave up wrestling after freshman year because I didn’t like it anymore and it wouldn’t have been far to coach (Marc) Tadelman or anybody else if I was on the team. Now that I re-entered it … I think I’ll like that club wrestling environment there.

What is your favorite thing to do outside of sports?

I love being with my friends two good friends Jake Meiners and Liam Fraleigh. Anytime we get together it is a good time and it doesn’t take a whole lot of us.

You are on the smaller side for a defensive lineman. What made you so effective?

I didn’t play football freshman year. I thought I’m not that guy I’m not big enough. Sophomore year I started working out with the (defensive backs) and receivers and I just don’t get it ya know. I went to the line coach and asked ‘Can I just get in here? This is what I do.’ And I kind of had a breakout year. I had 15 sacks sophomore year and my junior year I got out there and was able to hang. I can attribute that to … lifting a lot of weights having a lot of grit and having fight inside you not to get your ass kicked.

What is your dream job?

If I could do anything I would probably have a big piece of land and a congregation … running a huge farm where people could be free and be happy. Something like that. I used to want to be a big rich (guy) but as the days go by moments like tonight and good experiences I just want something where I could just be happy and be in charge too — because that’s part of having a job right?

What do you want to study at Colorado State?

Health and exercise sciences. I just love lifting weights and exercising. I love what it can do for people. Exercise is a very big field. … The broadness of that attracts me.

If you are in Walgreens with a couple bucks what are you buying?

A box of Charleston Chews and a strawberry banana BodyArmor.

If you could try another sport what would it be?

Probably hockey. I played lacrosse when I was in middle school and it was fun. Hockey and lacrosse I can compare because you can hit people but in hockey you can people a lot harder. To this day I’ve never gotten in a physical altercation. In a hockey game it seems reasonable and pretty safe.

What is something people do not know about you?

I read the bible every single day. I’m reading the bible front to back. I got it for Christmas.

How would you summarize this wrestling season?

What happened was that we lost that game to Maine South (in football) and I told my dad ‘I’m going to join the wrestling team.’ He said ‘OK but it’s on you. I’m not making you do this. … I went to a practice — and this is still during football practice going on — and coach said ‘If you’re going to do this you’re in.’ I got my ass kicked by everybody I wrestled and was dog tired. Over the season I got better and better and cleared off the rust I had. Out there tonight (June 10) I went six minutes and got a win. It was a journey.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ubHlpbnlvdXJzdGF0ZS5jb20vdGVubmVzc2VlL3NwZWN0YWN1bGFyLWN1bW1pbnMtZmFsbHMtc3dpbW1pbmctaG9sZS10bi_SAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5vbmx5aW55b3Vyc3RhdGUuY29tL3Rlbm5lc3NlZS9zcGVjdGFjdWxhci1jdW1taW5zLWZhbGxzLXN3aW1taW5nLWhvbGUtdG4vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hike Less Than A Mile To This Spectacular Waterfall Swimming Hole In Tennessee,"Tennessee in the summer can get hot.

""So I and Patty were there in KKR. We were teammates there and had a pretty good bond. I remember he gave an interview to the KKR management saying that ‘we’ll have the chin music going on’ or something like that. And then when I was batting he was continuously trying to bounce me and I was leaving them"" Gill told The Grade Cricketer Podcast in a conversation.

""After the match there was a press conference where I said ‘if they have their chin music we know the moves to dance to that’. So the banter was going on and he would go ‘where are your dance moves now?""

Gill and Cummins became teammates not too long after as the IPL returned for its 14th edition in India. Cummins and Gill were part of KKR's shoddy 2021 campaign which saw them slip to seventh on the points-table with only four points having win just two games out of seven. In seven matches Gill tallied 132 runs while Cummins picked up nine wickets along with playing a brilliant knock of 66 not out against Chennai Super Kings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL3Nwb3J0cy9jcmlja2V0L3N0b3J5L3NodWJtYW4tZ2lsbC1wYXQtY3VtbWlucy1iYW50ZXItaW5kaWEtYXVzdHJhbGlhLWNoaW4tbXVzaWMtZGFuY2UtbW92ZXMtMTgxNDM1MC0yMDIxLTA2LTEz0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vYW1wL3Nwb3J0cy9jcmlja2V0L3N0b3J5L3NodWJtYW4tZ2lsbC1wYXQtY3VtbWlucy1iYW50ZXItaW5kaWEtYXVzdHJhbGlhLWNoaW4tbXVzaWMtZGFuY2UtbW92ZXMtMTgxNDM1MC0yMDIxLTA2LTEz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shubman Gill reveals banter with Pat Cummins during 2020/21 Test series: Where are your dance moves now?,"Shubman Gill was among the young Indian players who remarkably led the team to victory over Australia in the 2020/21 Test series Down Under. As the opening batsman Gill had the unenviable task of facing Australia's fiery fast bowlers among whom was his Kolkata Knight Riders team-mate Pat Cummins.

Gill revealed that he had some banter going with Cummins during the series. ""So I and Patty were there in KKR. We were teammates there and had a pretty good bond. I remember he gave an interview to the KKR management saying that 'we'll have the chin music going on' or something like that"" Gill told The Grade Cricketer Podcast.

""And then when I was batting he was continuously trying to bounce me and I was leaving them. After the match there was a press conference where I said 'if they have their chin music we know the moves to dance to that'. So the banter was going on and he would go ‘where are your dance moves now?'"" he said.

Gill is currently with the Indian team that is gearing up for the World Test Championship final against New Zealand in England. The match will be played from June 18 to 22.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vY3JpY2tldHRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzEwLWdyZWF0LWJvd2xlcnMtYW5kLXRoZWlyLW1vc3QtZmVhcmVkLWJhdHNtZW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 great bowlers and their most feared batsmen,"Cricket makes for a tough contest between bat and ball. While the batters toil hard in net practices bowlers often upgrade their skills and introduce stock deliveries to keep them in contention by deceiving the batsmen.

However every bowler has a specific batter whom he fears since the latter is good at reading the ball and also gives a bulwark performance when he gets going.

Here are ten legendary bowlers and the batsmen they fear:-

James Anderson- Graeme Smith

England bowler James Anderson has the highest Test wickets among the current lot of cricketers. Anderson is famous for his ability to move the ball both ways. However the 38-year-old once opened up about former South African skipper Graeme Smith as the most difficult batter he had ever bowled to.

Anderson referred to the South Africa tour of England in 2003 when the veteran pacer only had inswing in his arsenal which was Smith’s strength and thus the latter smashed two double centuries in that series.

“My first series against him was in 2003 and at that time I could only swing the ball back in I didn’t have an out-swinger to a left-handed batsman. I was just feeding his strength and I was getting so annoyed. He always got it through the leg-side. That series he got two double centuries and it was just impossible to bowl at him” Anderson recollected.

Pat Cummins- Cheteshwar Pujara

Australian pacer Pat Cummins is currently ranked at the numero-uno spot in the Test rankings. Still the pacer had a hard time bowling to Indian batsman Cheteshwar Pujara.

Pujara is a defensive player and relies on wearing out the bowler. Cummins revealed in an interview that Pujara was the bulwark for his side and stood firm like a rock in Border Gavaskar Series 2020/21. Critics also believe that Pujara was the anchor of the Indian team and led them to a historic 2-1 victory against the Aussies.

“There are a lot of them out there unfortunately. But I am going to go with someone different and he is Cheteshwar Pujara from India. He was a real pain in the back for us. He (Pujara) was an absolute rock for them in that series. (He was) Really hard to get out. Just ultra concentration all day day after day. He is the hardest one in Test cricket so far I think” Cummins admitted.

Dale Steyn- Virender Sehwag

South African pacer Dale Steyn topped the Test bowling ranking charts for the longest period of time when he was in his best shape.

Steyn had a ravaging pace coupled with the ability to swing the bowl both ways. However Steyn tacitly implied that Indian opener Virender Sehwag was the most difficult batsman he had ever bowled to by recalling his magnificent 319 against the might African side in a red ball contest in Chennai.

“Happy birthday Viru! Hope it’s been a good one my friend. PS. I still have nightmares of Chennai @virendersehwag.” Steyn wished Sehwag on his 42nd birthday.

Mitchell Johnson- AB de Villiers

Former Australian speedster Mitchell Johnson is one of the most difficult bowlers to face. Johnson bagged 313 wickets in the 73 red cherry contests he participated in.

However South African batsman AB de Villiers left Johnson in deep waters by displaying his ability to hit the ball around all the corners of the park. The right-hander helped his side chase 414 runs in a Test against Australia in Perth by smashing an unbeaten 106.

“AB de Villiers he’s one outstanding player of our generation. He was always so difficult to get out and a huge challenge” Johnson spoke about de Villiers in one of his interviews.

Harbhajan Singh- Younis Khan

Former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh was known for insisting his captains to let him bowl long spells. However the off-spinner was wary of Pakistan’s batter Younis Khan who had an ardour for rescuing his side from difficult situations.

“Younis has annoyed me too much. I used to feel like crying while bowling him” Harbhajan admitted.

In addition to Younis the Jalandhar-born also mentioned that he had difficulty bowling to Jacques Kallis Matthew Hayden Brian Lara and Inzamam-ul-Haq.

Muttiah Muralitharan- Brian Lara

Former Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan holds the record for the highest wickets in both Tests and ODIs. Though Muralitharan was able to deceive most batsman with his stock deliveries former West Indies batter Brian Lara left him in deep waters.

According to Muralitharan Lara had brilliant hand-eye coordination that helped the latter adjust to deliveries easily.

“I think of all the batsmen in the world he plays my bowling better than anyone else including Sachin Tendulkar. His eyesight and hand co-ordination is very good and he’s able to adjust very quickly to very good deliveries” the veteran spinner revealed.

Brett Lee- Jacques Kallis

Former Australian pacer Brett Lee was one of the best proponents of speed that the world of cricket ever witnessed. He could bowl yorkers as well as bouncers when required.

Lee ended up as the sixth most successful Aussie bowler in Test matches bagging 310 scalps. The Wollongong-born named India’s Sachin Tendulkar West Indies Brian Lara and South Africa’s Jacques Kallis as the batters who gave him a hard time.

Lee stated that while Sachin had extra time while facing a fast delivery Lara could hit the same ball in different directions. For Kallis Lee opined that he was a complete cricketer as the veteran all-rounder could bat in the top order as well as open the bowling for his team.

Anil Kumble- Brian Lara

Former Indian spinner Anil Kumble is remembered for his persistence to send the opposition batter back to the pavilion. With 619 wickets to his name Kumble is the third-highest wicket-taker in the history of Test cricket.

Kumble once divulged that former West Indies skipper Brian Lara was the hardest batsman to bowl at since the latter could play four shots for the same delivery.

“Many batsmen who were very difficult to bowl at. But Brian Lara was probably at the top. He had four different shots to every delivery that you bowled and that was the biggest challenge you thought you could beat him you would get him but then he would change his stroke and sort of tap you through the third man” Kumble stated in an interview with Pommie Mbangwa.

Jofra Archer- KL Rahul

England pacer Jofra Archer has been the mainstay for his side since 2019. The 26-year-old speedster had also featured in Wisden Cricketers of the year list in the same year.

Known for his rhythm and pace Archer has bamboozled batters all over the world but his rampage stops when it comes to India’s KL Rahul.

Archer revealed in an interview that the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 Orange Cap holder had got the better of him on most occasions.

“There is no one else he has found difficult to bowl to not even Virat Kohli or Suresh Raina two of the most successful batsmen in the tournament. It is just KL Rahul who had probably got the better of him on most occasions” Archer enunciated.

Shoaib Akhtar- Rahul Dravid

Former Pakistan seamer Shoaib Akhtar is one of the fastest that the game has ever witnessed. Akhtar is said to have clocked over 160 kmph twice.

Yet one cannot the fiery spells of Akhtar to Indian batter Rahul Dravid who used to defend the former’s red hot deliveries thus ending the colossal run-ups in vain.

Akhtar argued in an interview that Dravid used to ‘bore’ him and the veteran pacer knew that he would have to field two more sessions when ‘The Wall’ was on the field.

“The biggest nightmare I ever faced was Rahul Dravid. He used to bore me. He was the first batsman who could intimidate me in terms of when he walked in. I knew I would have to field for at least two sessions more” Akhtar said about Dravid in an interview."

PBM is an acronym for Pharmacy Benefit Manager. They administer your prescription program and sets the rules and regulations.

When you go to your pharmacy to get a prescription filled which was written by your physician you probably have a prescription card from your employer or insurance company that lists the name of the PBM they have contracted with. About 90% of the time the PBM is either Express Scripts (ESI) CVS/Caremark or Optum.

Your pharmacist then fills the prescription through their computer sending it off to the PBM for their approval. In seconds a response is received and the following occurs:

1.) The PBM responds as to whether you are covered through the prescription plan.

2.) The PBM responds whether the drug is a covered formulary approved drug by the PBM. This is decided based on whether the manufacturer pays a rebate to your PBM not for any clinical reason. These rebates have been shown to equal up to 50-60% of the manufacturer's cost which increases drug costs to everyone along the way including you the patient. These rebates are shared between the PBM and the insurance company — you see no rebate or discount. The manufacturer is always blamed for the high prices but if rebates to PBMs are declared illegal you would see decreases in drug prices equal to the rebates that the drug companies are forced to pay to the PBM for being on their formulary. There is federal legislation being reviewed now that would stop rebates from manufacturers to PBMs. You have probably seen that drug prices in other countries are much less. That's because PBMs only exist in the United States.

3.) The PBM responds whether the pharmacy that you are choosing is in their network of pharmacies. In many cases the PBM is owned by or affiliated with a specific chain store and only those pharmacies are considered “Preferred Pharmacies”. For example CVS Health owns the insurance company AETNA. CVS Health also owns 10000 CVS retail stores the PBM Caremark a mail-order facility and a specialty pharmacy. Is there any doubt where members of AETNA plans are steered to?

4.) The PBM responds whether you must obtain this drug from their wholly owned retail mail-order or specialty pharmacy.

So what does this all mean to you:

1.) You do not have the choice of pharmacy — the PBM does. That’s one reason why you have seen many independent pharmacies close their doors. The other reason is that the PBMs pay independent pharmacies much less than they pay their own or affiliated pharmacies.

2.) Your physician does not have the final say in what drug he/she may feel is the best choice for your condition — the PBM does.

3.) Your copays are also determined by the PBM.

The top three PBMs listed above are all in the Top 25 of the Fortune 500 companies.

They should just be paid for administration and not be involved in formularies designed to increase the PBM profits. They should never be involved in getting in the way of the patient/doctor relationship.

Simon will cochair a session at SLEEP 2021 titled “The Role of the Autonomic Nervous System in the Science of Sleep.”

Transcript

Can you speak on current comprehension of the autonomic nervous system in sleep?

The autonomic nervous system is more typically known for its role in regulating involuntary body functions so breathing respiration digestion and heart rate but more recent investigations have found that it also influences cognition. And so during our seminar speakers are going to be giving the most up-to-date understanding of the role of the autonomic system as it interacts with the central nervous system to influence cognition and influence emotional processing.

How may autonomic regulation of sleep differ by race/ethnicity? Are there any subgroups who may be at increased risk of autonomic dysfunction?

Across the lifespan there's rapid development of the autonomic nervous system in early infancy and childhood snd we know there's a gradual decline in parasympathetic activity from adolescence to the end of life.

There's likely not inherent race or ethnic differences in autonomic regulation of sleep; rather systemic racism and the health consequences that occur from that likely impact cardiac activity and manifest in sleep dysregulation. And so groups who are subject to systematic and institutional oppression are those who are likely at heightened health risk and then from there that might also influence sleep dysregulation.

With research associating the autonomic nervous system with neurologic cardiovascular and other diseases what are some best practices to monitor for signs of these issues?

So our speakers are all researchers and they're not medical professionals but we do know that aging and disease contribute to autonomic imbalance and that this autonomic imbalance can also impact sleep. So as a clinical psychologist myself I always recommend that those who are experiencing health concerns and related sleep disturbances seek out medical professionals for evaluation whether it's doctors for sleep studies or psychologists to support cognitive interventions and that way we hope to promote healthy sleep throughout the lifespan.

I think this is a really exciting time to be looking at the autonomic nervous system and how it couples with the central nervous system to support cognition and emotion. It's definitely a newfound area. And I think that the more research that bridges these 2 domains together will really help us to understand underlying sleep-dependent memory mechanisms and underlying sleep-dependent cognition mechanisms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9rZXZpbi1oYXJ0LXNheXMtZG9lc24tdC0xMDI5MzcwNjYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kevin Hart says he 'doesn't give a s***' about 'cancel culture' as he addresses 2018 Oscar hosting exit,"Kevin Hart has shared his thoughts on “cancel culture” while discussing his decision to step down from presenting the Oscars in 2018.

The comedian had been due to host the Academy Awards three years ago but faced pressure to quit after old homophobic tweets and stand-up footage of his resurfaced online.

He initially refused to apologise claiming he had done so in the past but later stepped down and said he was sorry for his “insensitive words”.

Speaking to The Sunday Times  Hart said that he doesn’t “give a s***” about so-called “cancel culture” but that people should be more forgiving of past behaviour.

“If people want to pull up stuff go back to the same tweets of old go ahead. There is nothing I can do” he said.

“You’re looking at a younger version of myself. A comedian trying to be funny and at that attempt failing. Apologies were made. I understand now how it comes off. I look back and cringe. So it’s growth. It’s about growth.”

Hart continued: “I mean I personally don’t give a shit about [cancel culture]. If somebody has done something truly damaging then absolutely a consequence should be attached. But… when you’re talking ‘Someone said! They need to be taken [down]!’ Shut the f*** up! What are you talking about?

“I’ve been cancelled what three or four times? Never bothered” he added. “If you allow it to have an effect on you it will. Personally? That’s not how I operate. I understand people are human. Everyone can change.”

Brace yourself. After an unusually mild recent cold-and-flu season healthcare experts expect that it will be much worse this winter. In this Motley Fool Live video recorded on June 2 Motley Fool contributors Keith Speights and Brian Orelli discuss which stocks could profit if the warnings that a nasty cold-and-flu season is on the way prove to be right.

10 stocks we like better than CVS Health

When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen. After all the newsletter they have run for over a decade Motley Fool Stock Advisor has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and CVS Health wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of June 7 2021

Keith Speights: One of the positive side effects of the efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 has been that we really experienced an unusually weak cold and flu season over this past winter. In fact I know of someone who works in a pediatric clinic and said they were just astonished at how few flu cases with kids came in over the last several months.

They attribute it to all of the preventive measures that were in place with the COVID-19 pandemic. People wearing masks schools doing remote learning. If they were doing on-campus classes if any child showed up who had any symptoms they immediately sent them home. Anyway they were attributing all of those efforts to really just nearly stamping out the cold and flu season. Not entirely but largely. That's one of the positive side effects.

But now Brian experts are warning that we could be in store for an especially nasty cold and flu season coming up near the end of this year and into early 2022. We're investors. We're always looking ahead and looking at the investing angle on things. Are there any stocks that you think might particularly benefit if we have a really nasty cold and flu season coming up?

Brian Orelli: Yeah. I think there's probably a couple of different categories here. One would be obviously drug stores something in like CVS Health (CVS -1.49%) ticker there's CVS a Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA -0.69%) ticker there's WBA and Rite Aid (RAD -10.35%) ticker there's RAD R-A-D.

I like CVS but it's maybe not necessarily the best pick simply for cold and flu because it also has Aetna insurance. While it will sell more cold and flu medication it'll also have increased expenses on its Aetna insurance side as people go to the doctor because of their flus at least. For all these categories you want to evaluate the company on the whole not necessarily buy it just because of the cold and flu season.

For test makers Roche (RHHBY -0.20%) and Abbott (ABT -1.16%) both have flu tests but they are pretty large companies. I'm not sure how much you are going to benefit there.

If you don't want to go specific on any one test Quest Diagnostics (DGX -0.58%) or LabCorp of America (LH 0.06%) they are more general. They run a whole bunch of different tests. They contract out with doctors to run the tests.

If you want to go to small specific Quidel (QDEL) might be a good option. Ticker there's Q-D-E-L. They have stand-alone machines that run in doctor's offices and then they're razor and blades model. You pay for each individual cartridge that you put into the machines to run the test.

In terms of vaccines and treatments most of the vaccine makers are pretty large companies. Sanofi (SNY 1.07%) AstraZeneca (AZN 0.85%) are big flu vaccine companies.

Then for treatments Roche is probably the biggest there. We did have the Tamiflu and Xofluza.

Then maybe outside the treatment area but ancillary to the treatment area GoodRx (GDRX 1.06%) might be a good option if people are looking for cheaper medications they might turn to GoodRx so that could help them.

Speights: I like that you started out mentioning some of the big pharmacy retailers Brian because not only do they benefit from increased sales of cold and flu products but it also boosts their customer traffic in their stores and customers can buy more products while they're there. They really count on some sales boost during cold and flu season.

But you also mentioned something really important: Don't just look at the prospects for a company for cold and flu season because there's a bigger picture for all of the companies that you've mentioned. They are not just dependent on cold and flu sales. That's just one factor to include in your thinking."
DHR,Danaher Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jYmouY29tL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUvZW52aXN0YS1leC1kZW50YWwtdW5pdC1kYW5haGVyLXNlZXMtcHJvZ3Jlc3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Envista Ex-Dental Unit of Danaher Sees Progress,"Envista Holdings Corp. is emerging as a leaner more profitable machine as the dental industry recovers from the pandemic.



The Brea-based dental consumables equipment and services provider whose operating companies serve over 1 million dentists in 150 countries posted first-quarter revenue and earnings well above consensus estimates last month.



The company posted $709.2 million in sales for the quarter up 30% from a year ago and exceeding analyst projections of $637 million.



It was the third consecutive quarter Envista delivered adjusted EBITDA margins of over 20% company officials said.



Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $148 million compared to $19.4 million for the same period in 2020.



“We are off to a great start in 2021. A robust recovery in the dental market combined with strong execution and our continuous improvement culture drove broad-based strength across our portfolio” Chief Executive Amir Aghdaei said last month.



Stock in the $7 billion-valued firm recovered from its pandemic-low of $12.06 a share and had settled around $43.30 a share at press time.

Consolidation



Envista was originally formed as a subsidiary of Danaher Corp. in 2018 and has maintained its Brea headquarters in the same office complex as Danaher’s operating company Beckman Coulter Diagnostics.



Envista was built through the acquisition of over 25 dental businesses over the course of 15 years.



Core leadership joined in 2016 and took various steps to consolidate the business such as reducing over 10 operating companies into three. Ormco and Nobel Biocare Systems make up the company’s specialty products and technologies unit while its equipment and consumables division is comprised of KaVo Kerr.



Envista raised $643.4 million in an initial public offering in September 2019 when Danaher spun off the business into a stand-alone public company.



More changes took place in 2020 when Envista completed a $100 million cost reduction plan including job cuts as part of efforts to improve margins amid the pandemic.



Additional changes are possible; the company was said to be considering a sale of its KaVo business according to a Bloomberg report last week.",,,,,,,,,,,,

There are several reasons for that and not all of them have to do with cars.First of all Dallas began airing in 1978 and this rendering is based on a Suburban from that era. Second they loved to show large opulent American luxo barges including a lot of Lincolns and Cadillacs. Also ""wb.artist20"" declared himself a proud Texan in the last post we featured which had a Ford F-250 that had been turned into a John Deere. This creative piece perfectly captures the transition between the traditional American luxury vehicle from the 1970s and the modern. In short it's a Navigator if Lincoln was way ahead of the pack. Just think of it as one of those science-fictions things like the Marvel Multiverse where normal sedans were never invented.How ahead would this have to be? Well the first Cadillac Escalade came out in 1999 and it was quite controversial at first. And the first Navigator came a year before that. That's why it's so difficult to imagine an American SUV with those particular features.The front end of the rendering borrows heavily from the Continental Town Car. It's floaty it's boaty and it comes with a 7.5-liter hunk of steel making only 210 horsepower. The point was to have a nice smooth luxury highway cruiser.The vinyl top and the Rolls-Royce-like grille with the chrome bumper create a unique appearance for this retro Navigator. We can't help thinking that a Cullinan might look similar if it was also built in that era. But if it did J.R. would probably have one of those instead of a Lincoln.It's funny how SUVs have existed for so many years but are only now dominating the luxury market. Why do you guys think that is?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vc3R1ZHlicmVha3MuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvc291bmRzL2xhbmEtZGVsLXJheS1yZXdyaXRpbmctaGlzdG9yeS13aXRoLWJsdWUtYmFuaXN0ZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Blue Banisters' Is Lana Del Rey's Attempt To Rewrite Her Story,"For 13 years Lana Del Rey has been producing music with richly poetic lyrics while crafting a world of dark American glamour. However Del Rey has never been able to escape critical backlash. Since the beginning of her career she has been denounced for depicting situations of domestic abuse and female fragility in her lyrics. In May of last year her statement via Instagram “ Question for The Culture” promoted a stagnant version of white-washed feminism. Despite all the ridicule leveled at her Del Rey continues to write music in order to tell her own story on her own terms. Her desire to release music out of her own passion and quest for self-growth free from the need for positive critical reception was evident on May 20 when she pre-released three singles off her new record “Blue Banisters” without promoting them on social media.

However unexpected the release “Blue Banisters” “Wildflower Wildfire” and “Text Book” did not entirely appear out of the blue. Merely a day after the singer released her long-awaited seventh studio album “Chemtrails Over the Country Club” she took to Instagram to announce that a new record called “Rock Candy Sweet” was to be released on June 1. The announcement came in the form of a glamourous selfie of Del Ray staring seriously into the camera. A month later she edited this selfie with the title “Blue Banisters” which was to be released on July 4. These first two pre-released singles featured the singer reconciling with toxic relationships in her past through the healing powers of female solidarity — hinting at the rest of the album’s content.

The title track “Blue Banisters” opens with Del Rey reciting a conversation with her friend Jenny. Jenny questions Del Rey about a photo of her sitting on a John Deere tractor. In response Del Rey laments “Oklahoma” and sings of a hazy memory she doesn’t remember. From the onset Del Rey alludes to a troubled past and a version of herself she is no longer familiar with portraying herself as on the mend.

The opening verses of this song are riddled with images similar to those that dominated “Chemtrails Over the Country Club.” Del Rey’s reference to Oklahoma connects to the track “Tulsa Jesus Freak” where she sings of a passionate “white-hot” relationship that made her feel no longer like “a candle in the wind” or someone marked by great instability. It is not a mistake that she sought to connect “Blue Banisters” to this song’s story of male dependency and superficial romance.

The chorus of the song clues listeners into the symbolism behind the “Blue Banisters.” Del Rey sings of a man in her past who promised her happiness and a future so long as she painted her banisters blue. When the chorus repeats Del Rey changes the lyrics to be about “her sisters” who attempt to heal the “hole in her heart” by painting her banisters “green and grey.” It is clear that this song is focused on female friendship and collective healing contradicting the persona she portrayed in “Tulsa Jesus Freak” and in her early music. The track portrays Del Rey’s personal growth — finding out who she is outside of her romantic relations.

The following track “Wildflower Wildfire” takes listeners into another unexplored area of the singer’s life — her relationship with her mother. This highlights another feminine relationship albeit a troubled one. She sings of how her “father never stepped in / when his wife would rage at me.” She hints that this relationship prompted her to have issues with her mental health singing of “hospitals” “lithium” and ending up “awkward but sweet.”

In the song’s chorus Del Rey sings about wishing to never “turn into something that burns” or a desire to never turn into her mother thus forcing her into her identity of a slow-burning “candle in the wind” that once maintained can never get out of control. The song ends on the note of “it’s you from whom I learn” which could refer to how young women learn from their female influences. They have the power to belittle one another or uplift one another — to become wildfires that tear one another down or sisters that flock together to heal.

Despite this powerful message of self-growth and a new era of Del Rey’s songwriting evident in these first two singles their content cannot be separated from her recent social media blunders. Del Rey claimed contemporary female pop artists such as Doja Cat Ariana Grande and many others were never criticized for their vulgar lyrics as she was — a grossly inaccurate statement. Del Rey went on to champion herself as an artist who “paved the way for other women.” Regardless of any possible influence she may have had in de-stigmatizing explicit subject matter these were disturbingly disillusioned claims.

To further complicate matters Del Rey went on to assert that feminism’s third wave needs to include a space “for women who look and act like me.” After mentioning mainly artists of color in the statement critics perceived this as a declaration of ridiculous white-lady-centric feminism promoting the stereotype of white women as inherently fragile and less accountable simply to victimize herself. She also grossly delegitimized the plight of Black female artists by insisting her own struggles in the music industry were harsher than theirs.

This statement exposed the artist’s racial bias and painful unawareness of white privilege — it was impulsive and misconceived. In a video posted to Instagram a few days later Del Rey explained that she meant her statement to stress the point that “nobody gets to tell your story but you.” Del Rey seemed to be prompted originally by her inability to let go of the disapproval she received early in her career as someone who glamorized abuse.

It seemed that all Del Rey sought to do with her statement was to examine the ever-changing stigmas of artistry and the limits of what women creators are allowed to depict in their music. In harmfully victimizing herself and advocating for “fragility” Del Rey failed to convey what she truly meant; she has always sought to use her art for healing — for herself as well as for women who had been in “submissive” relationships similar to hers.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CAcQPuBJdir/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

The final track “Text Book” has the strongest connection to the accusations of racism facing the singer. Del Rey sings of desiring to reconcile with her father and mentions “rewriting history.” She refers to her unhappiness in her relationship with the man of “Blue Banisters” and the version of herself she was with him. The men she met who had once “felt right” ended up betraying her. Ultimately this song examines her romantic relationships through her relationship with her father figure. The song seems to be about her regret in allowing her relationships with men to mold how she saw herself.

Yet in this song Del Rey also references the “Black Lives Matter” movement. She uses it as a gateway into saying that her intentions are good and often get overlooked. In the song Del Rey sings of the one person who “saw who I am.” This echoes her response to accusations of racism thrown at her believing it to be a result of the perceptions of her character. Despite the power of the first two singles to rewrite her story and promote a narrative of healing and female empowerment the final single seems to continue to project her self-imposed narrative of being victimized by the “culture” and a need to be loved by a male figure to give her stability.

These three tracks are undoubtedly some of Del Rey’s most direct and vulnerable and reveal aspects of her past she has never written about before. However the singer still has some growing to do to let go of her self-victimizing habits. As any artist does Del Rey has the right to tell her own story free from immediate judgment or critical slander. But she is a public figure who has to be aware of the impact of her comments. Although she proves her talent time and time again in her music her actions make her work difficult to fully appreciate.

With cases like Del Rey’s it seems the real question for the culture becomes how and if it is possible to separate the value and beauty of an artist’s work from who they are outside of it. Del Rey does not believe herself a racist or ill-intentioned person. She is simply someone who has received so much criticism over the course of her career that she allows it to get in the way of her artistry. With the release of the full “Blue Banisters” album later this year her stunning abilities as a songwriter will bring listeners into her journey to discover her self-worth. Del Rey does not need to publicly victimize herself anymore to tell this story.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlbGxpbmd0b25hZHZlcnRpc2VyLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyeS9vdHRlbnMtbWF0dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,OTTENS Matt - Obituary,"With broken hearts we say goodbye to a loving husband fantastic father beloved son and brother and everyone’s friend.

On Saturday a Delta Air Lines spokesperson confirmed that individual was an off-duty flight attendant. Video shows passengers apparently holding the person down in the aisle.

Some passengers speculated that the man attempted to open a plane door. However a Delta spokesperson told NBCLA that was not the case.

""The passenger was not trying to open the door mid-flight rather the incident/altercation occurred in the front of the plane near that area.""

Plane doors are impossible to open at cruising altitude due to cabin pressure.

Members of the flight crew can be seen trying to subdue the passenger on the plane bound for Atlanta. Robert Kovacik reports for the NBC4 News at 11 p.m. on Friday June 11 2021.

In video of the altercation a voice over the plane’s public address system can be heard requesting help.

“This is the captain speaking. We’d like all strong males to come to the front of the aircraft to handle a problem passenger.”

FBI spokeswoman Megan Lauro would only say the FBI was investigating the incident.

The video does not show what happened prior to the passenger being restrained. The person had at least tried to access the plane's PA system before being confronted by passengers a Delta spokesperson said.

Passenger Brannon Nazarian described the mid-air chaos.

“The next thing I knew there were people rushing up the to the front and he started shoving people and there was this outrageous fight” Nazarian said during the unscheduled stop in Oklahoma City. “He was fighting them back extremely hard. His feet were flying in the air. The flight attendant was — it looked like he had a concussion.”

The plane was met by law enforcement officers in Oklahoma City according to Delta. It was not immediately clear whether the passenger was arrested.

The plane then continued to Atlanta.

The Federal Aviation Administration has warned air travelers about what it describes as a dramatic increase in unruly or dangerous behavior aboard passenger airplanes.

In a typical year the transportation agency sees 100 to 150 formal cases of bad passenger behavior. But since the start of this year through early May the agency said the number of cases has jumped to 1300 an even more remarkable number since the number of passengers remained below pre-pandemic levels.

An unruly airplane passenger may be fined around $52000 for not following the rules. Lolita Lopez reports for NBC4 News at 11 p.m. on May 17 2021.

Earlier in June a man accused of trying to break into the cockpit of a Delta flight from Los Angeles to Nashville causing its diversion last Friday to Albuquerque New Mexico was ordered to remain in custody pending further hearings. A criminal complaint submitted by an FBI agent said the passenger during the flight pounded on the cockpit door and said “we need to land this plane"" before he was restrained by a flight attendant and passengers and then carried to the rear of the plane.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2FpcmxpbmUtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA2LzEyL2RlbHRhLWZsaWdodC1kaXZlcnRlZC1va2xhaG9tYS1hdGxhbnRhLWxhLXVucnVseS1wYXNzZW5nZXItZGV0YWluZWQtcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy1jcmV3Lzc2Njc5MTEwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta flight diverted after incident with off-duty flight attendant,"A Delta Air Lines flight was forced to divert Friday after an ""unruly passenger"" got ahold of the plane's public announcement system and told passengers to get back in their seats saying oxygen masks would deploy soon.

On Monday Delta spokesman Eric Zeugschmidt confirmed the passenger was an off-duty Delta flight attendant and inactive employee who had been on leave before the incident. Zeugschmidt said Delta is taking the matter very seriously and working with authorities to reach the employee's emergency contacts.

Over the weekend Zeugschmidt said crew and passengers helped detain the man on Delta Flight 1730 from Los Angeles to Atlanta and the aircraft landed “without incident"" in Oklahoma City where the man was taken into custody by law enforcement.

The plane arrived in Atlanta around 5:09 a.m. on Saturday four hours later than scheduled according to Delta's website.

“We apologize to our customers for the delay and any additional inconvenience this caused"" Zeugschmidt said via email.

The incident is just the latest in an uptick of unruly passengers which has forced a crackdown by the Federal Aviation Administration as travel volumes pick up. The Transportation Security Administration screened more than 2 million people for the first time since the onset of the pandemic on Friday.

Earlier this month a passenger on Delta flight from L.A. to Nashville reportedly tried to breach the cockpit forcing the plane to divert to New Mexico airport officials in Albuquerque said. And last month a Southwest Airlines flight attendant ended up in the hospital after a passenger punched her in the face.

Some airlines including Southwest and American have delayed plans to start selling alcoholic drinks in the wake of the high-profile incidents and calls by flight attendant unions to limit alcohol sales on board. Delta has been serving alcohol in regular economy since mid-April.

An off-duty Delta Air Lines flight attendant apparently commandeered the intercom on an Atlanta-bound flight Friday night leading to a scuffle that forced the plane to land in Oklahoma City an airline spokesman said.

Crew members and passengers of Delta Flight 1730 subdued the man after he assaulted two flight attendants and according to Oklahoma City police said he was “going to take the plane down.” A passenger said other travelers described the man as strange and that he wore a helmet along with elbow and knee pads.

It was the second Delta flight diverted because of a disruptive passenger in as many days.

The packed flight Friday night was about two hours away from its destination when an announcement on the intercom advised passengers to return to their seats and prepare to don their oxygen masks according to passenger Benjamin Curlee 29 who was seated in the rear.

“That created quite a stir” Curlee told CNN Saturday. “People behind me were saying ‘Well that’s really bad.’ I mean that only happens when the plane goes down.”

The unruly passenger was an off-duty flight attendant according to airline spokesman Eric Zeugschmidt. Witnesses reported that the man briefly commandeered the public announcement system leading to the on-flight scuffle. No passengers or crew were injured the spokesman said.

A couple of minutes after the announcement Curlee said the captain asked that “all able-bodied men please come to the front of the plane for an emergency.”

“I feared the worst” he said. “I prayed that God would protect my family in case I was gone.”

Curlee said he and a passenger next to him bolted from their seats to help but did not get very far.

“We got nowhere near because basically every man on the plane stepped up and was in the aisle” Curlee said.

As they made their way to the front of the plane Curlee said a flight attendant said “the situation was under control” and asked them to return to their seats.

“It was very tense very adrenaline fueled” said Curlee a media producer.

Once the plane landed the unruly passenger was taken into custody and transported to a hospital with minor injuries Oklahoma City Police Capt. Jermaine Johnson said.

Passengers had to leave the plane as bomb technicians searched and cleared the aircraft according to Johnson.

Curlee said other passengers later described the man as “very chaotic very weird” and “very incoherent.” A passenger sitting next to the man told Curlee “he felt very uncomfortable with the guy” who asked “a lot of very personal questions” such as his name and the spelling. The passenger told Curlee the man wrote a note to the flight attendant accusing him of being a hijacker.

Curlee said he was told the man was “dressed quite oddly” wearing a helmet with elbow and knee pads.

The plane remained in Oklahoma City for more than three hours according to FlightAware and landed in Atlanta shortly after 5 a.m. Saturday.

The disruptive passenger was in the custody of the FBI. Criminal charges have not been filed according to Johnson. CNN has reached out to the FBI for additional information.

“I was hoping to sleep on that flight and that didn’t happen” Curlee said. “It feels very surreal … It’s a once in a lifetime event. It’s something you really always kind of in the back of your head like wonder if this will happen. Well today it actually did. I am very thankful that it did not end badly.”

The Federal Aviation Administration has received around 2900 reports of “unruly behavior by passengers” this year FAA spokeswoman Maria Njoku said in a statement.

About 2200 of those reports involved passengers “refusing to comply with the federal facemask mandate” Njoko said. The FAA has identified “potential violations” in 446 cases and “initiated enforcement action” in 42 cases” she added.

FAA Administrator Steve Dickson has said the agency is “strictly enforcing a zero-tolerance policy toward passengers who cause disturbances on flights or fail to obey flight crew instructions.”

Curlee said he has “no fear of continuing to fly.”

“If anything … it really brings to light the need for a lot more awareness on the mental health crisis a lot of people are having especially aggravated by the pandemic.”

On Thursday Delta Flight 1131 flight from Los Angeles to New York was diverted to Detroit Metropolitan Airport because of a disruptive passenger according to Wayne County Airport Authority spokeswoman Lisa Gass.

Gass said it appeared the passenger “did not have any criminal intent” and may have been “suffering from a medical issue.” The passenger was cited for disorderly conduct.

On June 4 a passenger attempted to breach the cockpit of a Delta Air Lines flight from Los Angeles to Nashville forcing the plane to make an emergency stop in Albuquerque New Mexico according to officials. Another passenger and crew took down the man and held him until the plane landed.

The disruptive passenger was taken into federal custody said Stephanie Kitts of Albuquerque International Sunport.

The Transportation Security Administration said Saturday that it screened more than two million passengers on Friday the highest number since March 7 2020.

Airline travel has been returning to pre-pandemic levels. Before the health crisis TSA screened between two and 2.5 million travelers per day.

“The growing number of travelers demonstrates this country’s resilience and the high level of confidence in COVID-19 counter measures” acting TSA administrator Darby LaJoye said in a statement.

“TSA stands ready to provide a safe and secure screening process as part of the overall travel experience.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVVMvZGVsdGEtcGFzc2VuZ2VyLWFsbGVnZWRseS1tYWtlcy10ZXJyb3Jpc3RpYy10aHJlYXRzLWFzc2F1bHRzLWZsaWdodC9zdG9yeT9pZD03ODIzODYxNtIBc2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vYW1wL1VTL2RlbHRhLXBhc3Nlbmdlci1hbGxlZ2VkbHktbWFrZXMtdGVycm9yaXN0aWMtdGhyZWF0cy1hc3NhdWx0cy1mbGlnaHQvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9NzgyMzg2MTY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Off-duty Delta flight attendant allegedly makes terroristic threats assaults flight attendants: Police,"A cross-country Delta flight was diverted to Oklahoma after an unruly passenger allegedly made terroristic threats and assaulted two flight attendants according to police.

The suspect Stephon Jamar Duncan allegedly said he was going to take down the plane Friday evening while it was en route from Los Angeles to Atlanta Oklahoma City police spokesman Jermaine Johnson said.

Duncan works for Delta as a flight attendant but was off-duty at the time according to the airline.

Delta said he went to the front of the plane and used the intercom system before being stopped by an on-duty flight attendant.

After Duncan allegedly assaulted two flight attendants an off-duty pilot helped subdue him Johnson said. Delta said crew and passengers onboard flight 1730 also helped overpower the suspect.

Darren Genet a passenger on the flight described a ""fracas"" as fellow passengers ""swooped in"" to help restrain Duncan.

""We're holding him down and he was screaming and crying"" Genet told ABC News. ""And then one of the gentlemen on the flight was a Marine and he came over and they got the restraints and we kind of all held him down until we got the restraints on. By then he was sort of apologizing.""

""It was pretty scary"" added Genet a cinematographer and director on his way to Atlanta to see family. ""We were just really fortunate that we were able to get this guy down.""

No one was else hurt.

The plane landed in Oklahoma City without incident and the passenger was removed by law enforcement a Delta spokesperson said. The plane was searched and cleared and then allowed to resume travel to Atlanta Johnson said.

Duncan was arrested and taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains and exhibiting signs of mental health issues police said.

This incident comes as the TSA screened over 2 million people at airport security checkpoints Friday -- the first time topping 2 million since the start of the pandemic.

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 biggest oil companies in USA.

The oil industry got clobbered in 2020 and continues to face volatility amid the coronavirus crisis. However oil investors are hopeful as countries begin to vaccinate their populations and industries restart their operations. Recently the International Energy Agency said in a report that it expects oil demand to hit 100.6 million barrels for the first time since late 2019 in the last quarter of 2022. However the agency noted that the slow pace of vaccinations in Asia could dent the expected recovery.

Nonetheless analysts believe that oil companies have seen the rock bottom and are set to gain in the coming months. Despite the global push towards renewable energy and price fluctuations the oil industry is expected to thrive for years to come with major oil companies like Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) Chevron (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) expecting huge profits.

Apple has been the subject of multiple antitrust probes alongside other tech giants including Google.

It seems that Japan will be adding its own investigation to the pile soon one that will affect both the iPhone maker and the search giant.

A government panel will apparently launch this month to look into tightening antitrust regulations according to sources of Nikkei in a report seen by the Mercury News.

The panel will discuss the dealings of Apple and Google with Japanese smartphone producers including whether they handle domestic companies fairly compared to overseas vendors.

It is believed that iOS and Android make up more than 90 per cent of the Japanese smartphone market according to the report.

An analysis by IDC in February pointed to Apple selling nearly half of all mobile phones in the country for the entirety of 2020.

The alleged Japanese probe will become the latest in a long line of similar activity by governments and regulators around the world seeking to curtail the power of tech giants like Apple.

However the relationship between women and finances has remained tricky at least in India as society expects men to provide for the family and take charge of the finances. This leads women to largely stay away from making any major financial decisions.





Even as the millennial and Gen Z population enjoy a professional life many either face difficulty in accessing financial tools and services or lack awareness to move their money in the right direction.

Women-focused financial platforms have become the need of the hour and this is where many women from the world of finance and investment stepping in to address this gap.

Here are four startups and non-profit organisations that aim to financially empower women.

Basis

Basis' Co-founders Hena Mehta and Dipika Jaikishan

﻿Basis﻿ is an app to help women become more financially savvy and plan better to achieve financial goals. It does so through educational webinars and lessons in finance as well as by giving them personalised investment advice depending on their goals.





After a quick and easy registration process the app guides users with three key features. This includes the knowledge boosters section that simplifies financial jargon the advisory section that offers tools to manage mutual fund investments and calculate other capital needs and finally the community section that allows users to share their experiences and learnings and clear any doubts.





Based in Bengaluru the fintech venture is inspired by founder Hena Mehta’s own experiences of dealing with finance after she secured a place at the Wharton School’s MBA programme in 2016.





Interacting with over 500 women in urban India upon her return she noted that many lacked financial awareness. In 2018 she launched the financial app for women along with her co-founder Dipika Jaikishan who had spent over a decade in the personal finance industry.

LXME

Priti Rathi Gupta Founder of LXME

Former financial advisor Priti Rathi Gupta donned the entrepreneurial hat when she founded LXME a fintech platform exclusively for women. A self-proclaimed financial feminist Priti aims to help women take charge of their finances by educating through the LXME website and mobile application.

Backed by financial services firm Anand Rathi LXME plans to bridge the knowledge and accessibility gap for women to make their own decisions instead of relying on male members of the family.

The Mumbai-based startup focuses on educating women on financial products like mutual funds stocks and bonds and creates a community of women to engage them in conversations around their finances.





Priti believes that equipping women with investing and financial planning knowledge will not only help them at a personal level but also impact the flow of investments at a macro level.

WinPE

Delhi-based WinPE is a non-profit organisation that aims to bring gender diversity in private equity by involving women. It does so through a three-pronged approach which begins by engaging with investment firms decision-makers employers and influencers to drive positive action in favour of gender diversity.

It also empowers women in the industry by helping with networking mentorship and leadership training and finally enhances women’s participation through outreach and career conversations.

The non-profit was founded in January 2020 by Nupur Garg an MBA from MIT Sloan with experience in private equity investing operations and finance in leading global organisations like IFC an arm of the World Bank Group; Discovery Networks; and PwC.





Within a year of launching WinPE the organisation had reached 77000 men and women organically through 18 events that brought together 69 industry seniors thought leaders and influencers.

Miss Piggy Bank

Former PR professional Shagun Bansali Mehta’s personal challenges with money matters led her to start Miss Piggy Banks a user-centric finance platform focused on women seeking financial advice.





Noting the shared experience of her female colleagues’ tryst with finances she started a blog and an Instagram handle to simplify financial advice and connect users with financial advisors/planners who are trustworthy and curated.





At present she is working on developing Miss Piggy Banks into a 360-degree integrated platform where users can book appointments receive guidance and get matched to the right advisors – all on a single portal.





On its website users can opt for services and advice from professionals based on their educational background expertise fees charged and investment style.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cape Cod Times

EASTHAM – Voters breathed new life into plans for a North Eastham village center on Saturday during Town Meeting.

By a vote of 293-34 they authorized the purchase of the 3.5-acre Town Center Plaza at 4550 State Highway for $3.08 million.

The parcel houses six businesses including Local Break and Nauset Ice Cream. The plaza is anchored by the longtime businesses and its location near the T-Time parcel the Cape Cod Rail Trail and the Village at Nauset Green and proponents believe the purchase will mean Eastham has a say in what is developed there.

“This is about controlling our own destiny” said Select Board Chairman Arthur Autorino. “We want a say in what goes where.”

The town had previously stifled separate attempts to put a grocery store Dollar General and affordable housing unit on the T-Time parcel bringing in the Cape Cod Commission to help them with rezoning the area.

Finance Committee Chairman Jerry Cerasale called the purchase an investment in the future of Eastham. “This kind of opportunity comes once in a lifetime” he told voters.

Karen Strauss chairwoman of the T-Time Development Committee and member of the town’s Strategic Planning Committee warned if this parcel were sold to a developer the town would have no control over what would be built there.

What Strauss the Select Board and other town officials would like to see is a walkable mixed-use village center that would be a public place for residents and visitors.

Paula Aschettino was opposed to the article for its cost and the lack of a plan for the parcel.

“I’m concerned with giving a blank check to the town” she said.

But she was also angry that the purchase price wasn’t on the warrant and that had voters known the cost more people would have shown up to vote it down.

Voters also approved (291-30) increasing the short-term rental tax from 4% to 6%. The increase in the tax would yield approximately $300000 annually which the town plans to use for community support programs.

Select Board member Jamie Demitri said the town was looking for new revenue streams to assist residents with different needs especially housing. Short-term rentals are bleeding the town's rental housing stock she said.

Article 14A sought to amend the boating bylaws on freshwater ponds including speed limits maximum horsepower engines length of tow lines and hours when waterskiing could be done on Great Pond. One section called for changing hours of waterskiing from 7 a.m. to ½-hour before sunset to 10 a.m. to ½-hour before sunset.

An amendment was successfully passed to strike the change regarding waterskiing hours before the article in its entirety was approved.

Voters also amended Article 10 which called for the town to enter into long-term solar leases or agreements for grids installed at the Town Hall campus the DPW facility and transfer station and the District G Wellhouse site in North Eastham.

Open Space Committee Chairwoman Frances Lewis called for an amendment that would delete the wellhouse site from consideration. That 5-acre site would have required clear-cutting of up to three acres. She said the committee was in favor of solar installations on land that was already disturbed not on forested land.

When Moderator Scott Karey read the vote of 284 in favor of the amendment to 38 opposed the crowd gave a round of applause. Article 10 went on to a near landslide victory 305-18.

Voters approved all eight appropriations proposed by the Community Preservation Committee. They included a playground resurfacing project Nauset Lighthouse preservation efforts and a $100000 contribution to an affordable housing project in Orleans.

More than 320 Eastham voters turned out for Town Meeting after it was delayed for an hour due to rain. It took nearly three hours to get through the 15-article warrant. The town’s operating budget for FY22 is $32807105 a 4.49% increase over last year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdGFjby1iZWxsLXZhY2NpbmF0ZWQtY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1mcmVlLXRhY29zLWZhc3QtZm9vZC1jb3ZpZC0yMDIxLTbSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3RhY28tYmVsbC12YWNjaW5hdGVkLWNhbGlmb3JuaWEtZnJlZS10YWNvcy1mYXN0LWZvb2QtY292aWQtMjAyMS02P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taco Bell's vaccinated customers offered free tacos in California,"Eligible customers can claim a free Nacho Cheese Doritos Locos taco from Tuesday.

Taco Bell



Taco Bell is offering free tacos to vaccinated individuals living in California.

Customers have to show their vaccination cards at participating locations to be eligible.

The deal is part of Gavin Newsom's Vax for the Win scheme which aims to drive up vaccination rates.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Fast-food chain Taco Bell is the latest company to get in on the huge vaccination drive taking place across the state of California. It is offering free tacos to customers who have received at least one dose of their COVID-19 vaccines from Tuesday.

Customers who show their vaccination card at participating California Taco Bell restaurants will be eligible for a Nacho Cheese Doritos Locos taco at no cost the company said in a press release.

The company announced its offer as part of California Gov. Gavin Newsom's Vax for the Win incentive program.

Mark King CEO of Taco Bell Corp said in the press release: ""It's been a tough year and we are all ready to put COVID-19 behind us.""

""We are thrilled to do our part and give back to our home state with something everyone knows and loves to celebrate those who have made the decision to get vaccinated"" he added.

At least 70% of Californian adults have received at least one dose of immunization according to Newsom. However there is still a large population of young people who need to get vaccinated or receive their second dose.

The brand hopes the effort will increase vaccinations in these specific groups to help reopen the state in a safe manner.

Other companies across the US are also offering workers perks for getting immunized. Retailers like Target and Dollar General announced incentives including extra pay and paid time off as Insider's Natasha Dailey and Brittany Chang reported.

But for other customers not getting vaccinated also has its perks. In March a New Jersey gym announced it was offering free memberships to people who refuse to take a COVID-19 vaccine.

Prior to the offer the owners of the gym were arrested last year for refusing to abide by the state's pandemic-based orders.

Work is underway at the planned location for a new Dollar General store in Century.

Land is currently being cleared for the store in the 7000 block of North Century Boulevard on the west side of the road between Highway 4A and West Hecker Road.

According to plans for the proposed store it will be 9291 square feet on about 1.5 acres. It will have 31 total parking spaces with entrances from North Century Boulevard and West Hecker Road. The developer has told the town that they will remove 17 trees from the property. They plan to replant those 17 trees at the site along with five flowering trees and 15 shade trees in the Nadine McCaw Park on North Century Boulevard just northeast of the planned store.

The new Century Dollar General will employ about 6-10 people. It will include the new “DG Fresh” concept that offers fresh produce and healthier grocery options.

Angela Petkovic of Dollar General Corporate Relations told NorthEscambia.com said the new store will not replace the current Dollar General just over a mile and a half away on North Century Boulevard near the state line the Food Giant and a Family Dollar. The existing Century Dollar General opened in July 2002 in a building that was constructed in 1970.

The new Century Dollar General will employ about 6-10 people.

There's a lot to love about Trader Joe's. The ridiculously cheap Two Buck Chuck the vast array of cheeses at price points that can't be beat the impressive frozen offerings that a busy host could totally pass off as their own creation to unsuspecting dinner guests... that doesn't even scratch the surface of all the good reasons to shop at TJ's. Really it would take a lot less time to list the things we don't love about Trader Joe's because that list consists of two items: Products that pull a disappearing act the second you fall in love with them and the bakery products that seem to spoil minutes after you leave the store. We're here to talk about the bread.

It's not your imagination. Trader Joe's bread goes bad fast. It doesn't matter if you store it on the counter or in the refrigerator or even what kind of bread you buy — whether it's sprouted multi-grain sourdough bagels lavash or tortillas — in what seems like no time at all you see the first signs of mold.

Take this accurate depiction for instance:

Threads on Quora Reddit and even NeoGAF are dedicated to the subject. A Yelp review reads ""Every time I buy bread or pita at Trader Joe's it goes moldy in about 2 days — way before its expiration date."" This is clearly not a one-off issue. So what gives?

According to the Trader Joe's website all signs point to what's not in their bread. See TJ's makes a promise to its customers when it comes to any of the foods sold under the Trader Joe's private label and part of that promise is that none of those products will contain artificial preservatives. None. Zero. (They also won't have artificial flavors colors MSG GMOs or partially hydrogenated oils.)

Trader Joe's explains their position on artificial preservatives like this: ""Preservatives are used in food to prevent spoilage and to maintain nutritional value appearance and/or flavor for a longer period. Artificial preservatives are synthetically produced chemical substances like disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid or butylated hydroxyanisole. Our theory is if it is tough to get out of the mouth don't put it in the mouth. For preservation purposes we choose to use substances from natural sources like sugar salt vinegar celery juice and/or rosemary extract...""

But celery juice and vinegar effective as they may be as a natural preservative are less effective than the artificial ingredients they replace and that lack of artificial preservatives means that you can't expect your Trader Joe's sprouted wheat sourdough to last as long as a loaf of preservative-laden cheap white bread that's somehow already been sitting on the dollar store shelf for a week. And while TJ's promises ""great quality fare for exceptional everyday prices"" they obviously can't promise that preservative-free bread will have a lengthy shelf life.

Short of buying that dollar store bread that miraculously lasts three weeks in the cabinet without a speck of mold is there anything you can do to extend the shelf life of your Trader Joe's bread? One Redditor who says they work as a TJ's manager had a piece of advice for another user who wanted to know why the expiration dates on the store's bread seem to be nearly immediate: ""...you can be that guy that I hate but understand and also shop like and reach in the back to try and find a later date. The bread shelves should pop out if you push them in go diggin'!"" The ""mate"" (as the managers are called) also explained that looming expiration dates may indicate the store is over-ordering so if you're lucky enough to have more than one Trader Joe's near you it might be worth checking out another store's selection.

If you're sticking with your quick-to-spoil Trader Joe's bread no matter what (and we don't blame you if you do — that challah is delicious) keep it in the freezer. Epicurious promises that freezing is far and away the best method for preserving bread. Not only does freezing guard against mold and the staling process but it also means your bread will return to the same state of glory as the day you bought it. That's because they say when you pop a slice of frozen bread into your toaster it actually ""re-gelatinizes the starches and makes the bread springy and chewy again."" Quick go buy all the Trader Joe's bread you can fit into your freezer and never lay eyes on a moldy slice again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15Z2FtZXIuY29tL21vcnRhbC1rb21iYXQtMjAyMS1tb3ZpZS1yZXZpZXcv0gE4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubXlnYW1lci5jb20vbW9ydGFsLWtvbWJhdC0yMDIxLW1vdmllLXJldmlldy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mortal Kombat (2021 movie) Review - Video Game News & Reviews,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.mygamer.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The billionaire acquired bookstore chain Barnes & Noble which had suffered seven years of declining revenue for $683 million in 2019 and installed a new CEO who fired nearly half of the company’s New York-based book buyers and allowed store managers to decide which books to buy.

Singer who lives in New York City took a $3.2 billion stake in telecom giant AT&T and called for sweeping changes in the underperforming company. Less than a year later the chief executive stepped down and his successor announced plans to undo a huge acquisition by spinning off WarnerMedia.

Singer scooped up 9.2% of the shares in Athenahealth a company that digitizes patient medical records and billing claims for hospitals. In response the company announced plans to close offices lay off hundreds of people and sell one of its two corporate jets. Unsatisfied Singer pushed out the company’s co-founder and CEO Jonathan Bush cousin of former President George W. Bush and installed a replacement.

Now Singer is rocking the boat again this time with his sights set on Duke Energy Corp. the North Carolina-based parent of Duke Energy Indiana the state’s largest electric utility.

The question is whether Singer will again be successful in getting his demands met even if it means turning the utility on its head.

Singer’s hedge fund Elliott Investment Management LP last month sent a letter to Duke Energy urging it to consider separating into three companies. The letter said the huge utility has been underperforming its peers and argued that Duke’s customers would be better served by locally managed utilities.

Singer’s vision: He wants the companies split along geographic lines with one covering the Carolinas; another covering Florida; and the third covering Indiana Ohio and Kentucky. Elliott’s letter said the split would unlock up to $15 billion for shareholders. Elliott is also asking for three seats on Duke’s board saying the company needs new direction.

The letter said Elliott was one of Duke’s 10 largest shareholders following large purchases of stock. It did not reveal what percentage of Duke stock it holds today.

“Despite a portfolio of top-tier utilities Duke has suffered numerous operational setbacks and investment and strategic missteps over the past decade at significant cost to both shareholders and customers” Elliott wrote to Duke’s board on May 17. It publicly released the 15-page letter the same day.

Breakup after buildup?

In response Duke said it would review Elliott’s proposals but countered that breaking up the company would be a mistake “as scale is needed to efficiently finance the company’s unprecedented capital investment and growth opportunities.” It added that the proposed breakup posed capital structure and credit problems.

Duke said Elliott’s push is just the latest in a series of proposals the hedge fund has offered the utility since last summer.

“Throughout Duke Energy’s board of directors has reviewed their proposals in depth and determined that they are not in the best interests of the company its shareholders and other stakeholders” Duke wrote in a five-page response.

The power struggle comes just four months after Duke announced plans to sell nearly one-fifth of the Indiana operation to the government of Singapore for $2.05 billion. The company said the deal which is littered with redacted documents and non-disclosure agreements will help it raise money to fund its clean-energy transition and fund other initiatives.

But consumer and environmental groups question whether the deal is likely to benefit Indiana customers and are raising sharp questions about the secrecy.

The twin announcements thrust Duke into the spotlight and raise questions about whether Duke is on the right course in a challenging environment for utilities or is getting unnecessarily sidetracked.

A corporate breakup undoubtedly an extreme move would undo years of corporate building at Duke Energy a running project largely carried out by former Duke CEO Jim Rogers. Over 30 years starting in 1988 Rogers built Duke into the nation’s largest electric utility through a series of mergers that began in Indiana with a nearly insolvent utility called PSI Energy.

Rogers retired in 2013 as CEO after 25 years with the company and its predecessors. He died in 2018 at the age of 71.

Today Duke provides electricity to nearly 8 million customers in six states including 840000 in Indiana including Bartholomew County.

Company setbacks

The company however has faced expensive setbacks in recent months. In January it agreed to absorb $1.1 billion in costs rather than have customers pick up the cost for getting rid of hazardous coal ash stored near one of its large generating plants in North Carolina following a huge spill into the Dan River.

In another expensive move Duke and a partner Dominion Energy announced last summer they had canceled an $8 billion pipeline project that would have carried natural gas across the Appalachian Trail as costs rose and environmental groups sued to block the project. That resulted in a $1.6 billion write-off for Duke.

In March Moody’s downgraded its rating on Duke’s long-term debt citing the recent settlement of coal-ash cleanup.

Singer’s hedge fund Elliott cited all of those setbacks in its letter to Duke’s board and urged the company to take huge steps to restructure.

“Under the current structure Duke has been unable to execute effectively and maximize the potential of its premium utility franchises” Elliott wrote in the letter signed by two senior managers.

Elliott officials declined further comment.

Duke Energy said its Indiana operations are well managed and a breakup would not help.

“We have become a strong better company through mergers over the years while keeping our deep local roots in the state” the company said in an email to IBJ. “Our charitable community giving has increased our economic development work is robust and we still have local managers who serve on boards and live in the communities we serve. As a Wall Street activist hedge fund Elliott Management does not have any of the same ties and commitments.”

The company forwarded several reports from analysts who are critical of splitting up the company and suggested that Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston might have some thoughts on this issue.

IBJ reached out to Huston’s office and a few days later he issued a statement.

“We are monitoring the buyout discussions around Duke Energy as it relates to Indiana and share concerns about the possibility of unintended consequences including significant ratepayer increases and modernization stagnation” Huston said in the written statement. “Duke Energy Indiana our state’s largest utility continues to be a great community partner as we continue to grow economic development throughout the state and I hope we can avoid any significant disruptions.”

Activist investor

There’s no question that Singer who created the Elliott hedge fund in 1977 (Elliott is his middle name) will push Duke hard for an overhaul. He is not the type of investor who buys stock in a company then patiently waits for management to deliver results.

Instead Singer has built a reputation as an agitator who uses his $42 billion fund to buy stock in companies he deems weak. Then he pressures management to make huge changes with the goal of improving the stock price.

“A signature Elliott tactic is the release of a letter harshly criticizing the target company’s CEO which is often followed by the executive’s resignation or the sale of the company” wrote The New Yorker in a 2018 profile of Singer.

Bloomberg called Singer “aggressive tenacious and litigious to a fault” and dubbed him “the world’s most feared investor.” Fortune magazine described him as one of the “smartest and toughest money managers” in the hedge fund industry.

But some critics say activist investors like Singer don’t build companies but instead push hard for layoffs divestitures and a cutback in new investment to make a company more profitable often just in the short term.

The former president of Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner once described Singer as a “bloodsucker” and a “financial terrorist” after the country defaulted on $80 billion of debt in 2001 and the country offered creditors 30% of what they were owed. Many took the deal but Singer and a few other hedge funds refused to go along pushing for full repayment.

Singer for his part has argued that activist investors like him can shake up mismanaged or dysfunctional organizations whether they be underperforming companies or countries defaulting on bonds.

He wrote in The Wall Street Journal in 2017 that many activists are interested in the long-term value of a company and too often companies hide behind “long term” as a way to justify prolonged underperformance.

“Equity activism means using your voice and voting rights to improve companies in ways that maximize value for all shareholders” he wrote under the headline “Efficient Markets Need Guys Like Me.”

Not always the winner

Singer doesn’t always get his way. His scorecard has a few losses or incompletes when target companies fight back.

In 2011 for example Elliott sued Vietnamese state shipbuilder Vinashin in British High Court to recover its investment in a $600 million syndicated loan that Vinashin defaulted on a year earlier. Vinashin had initially offered repayment of 35 cents on the dollar to bondholders before Elliott filed the suit according to The Wall Street Journal. Elliott sued for full repayment with unpaid interest totaling $13.2 million. A year later however Elliott quietly dropped the suit.

In 2017 Elliott tried to force Akzo Nobel the Dutch paint and chemicals company to oust Chairman Antony Burgmans and to sell itself to American rival PPG Industries. But after months of court fights the two sides announced a truce with Akzo Nobel remaining independent.

Singer is estimated by Forbes to have a personal net worth of $4.3 billion. Last year the magazine ranked him 222nd on the list of the 400 richest Americans.

What caused him to take an interest in Duke Energy remains unclear. But the utility has been popping up in the news lately as something of a problem child with the expensive cancellation of its Appalachian pipeline the costly settlement over its coal-ash ponds and other issues.

In September The Wall Street Journal reported that NextEra Energy a smaller utility based near West Palm Beach Florida whose largest operating company is Florida Power & Light made a takeover approach to Duke in a move that would create a $60 billion combination. Duke rebuffed the offer the newspaper reported.

In its letter to the Duke board Elliott said it has followed Duke and the U.S. utility industry for almost 20 years.

It said the company’s operations in Indiana Florida and some other states were once operated as separate stand-alone companies “each having more-than-sufficient scale to operate successfully and thrive.”

Road to Duke Energy

Elliott’s reference to local corporate history is likely to hit home for Indiana. In 1988 Rogers a lawyer and former journalist took over a small struggling utility then called Public Service Company of Indiana.

The company was nearly bankrupt after spending more than $2 billion in a failed attempt to build a nuclear power plant in Marble Hill a small Indiana town on the Ohio River. Costs for the plant had spiraled out of control and PSI was running out of money. PSI abandoned the project and auctioned it off for parts in 1985.

Rogers worked to rebuild PSI and fought off a takeover attempt by the much larger IPALCO parent company of the Indianapolis electric utility now called AES Indiana.

Rogers then engineered a merger with Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. Even though PSI was the smaller partner Rogers became vice chairman and chief operating officer of the combined companies called Cinergy Corp. and later rose to CEO.

Four years later he pulled off another merger this one with Duke Energy and again wound up as CEO.

In 2011 Rogers pulled off perhaps his most significant deal the $13.7 billion acquisition of Progress Energy based in Raleigh North Carolina. That deal made Duke the nation’s largest electric utility a title previously held by Southern Co. based in Atlanta.

But as far as Elliott is concerned bigger is not better in Duke’s case. It said that a separation of the company into three smaller companies would create $12 billion to $15 billion of near-term value for shareholders based on the metrics of Duke’s closest peers.

It estimated that the Carolinas Florida and the Midwest (comprising Indiana Ohio and Kentucky) would command equity market valuations of $55 billion $23 billion and $15 billion respectively for a total equivalent of $93 billion.

That’s $16 billion above the $76.9 billion in market value Duke now commands based on its closing price of $100.08 on June 1.

Skeptics

Yet some analysts are not convinced that Elliott’s prescription is the right medicine for Duke or that the stock would be more valuable after a breakup.

“Color us skeptical that separating Duke into smaller utilities would prompt a near-term re-rating in Duke’s share price” wrote Wells Fargo analyst Neil Kalton in a May 17 note to clients.

He said he agreed with Duke management that a “shrink-the-company” strategy would require significant costs for each of the three companies to set up corporate functions and that investors would not automatically respond by driving up the share prices of three companies.

Morgan Stanley analyst Stephen Byrd said he doubts the Duke board and Elliott will reach agreement on any element of Elliott’s proposal or that Duke will materially alter its strategy. “The cost of refinancing debt and establishing separate capital structure for 3 separate entities could be significant” he wrote.

Indeed shareholders seem to have responded mostly with a big yawn. Duke’s stock which closed at $103.06 the day before Elliott released its letter rose briefly as high as $108 but has since fallen back to the $100 level.

Nor do some consumer groups seem sold on the idea of a breakup although they say local control is often better.

Tyson Slocum energy director at Public Citizen the not-for-profit consumer group founded by Ralph Nader said that while breaking up Duke could have benefits such a move should be made through careful deliberation involving employees customers and communities.

“Elliott is not an agent of positive change for Duke” he wrote in an email to IBJ. “It is a vulture hedge fund with a decades-long track record of disruptive and destructive behavior.”

Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana a grassroots consumer organization said it accepted the premise that Duke is too big and utilities should be managed and operated as close to the communities they serve as possible.

“Our local public utilities should not be fodder for massive energy holding companies or for hedge funds to do with as they please” Kerwin Olson CAC’s executive director wrote in an email to IBJ. “Neither of those entities have the best interest of consumers or the communities they serve in mind.”

After a year of disastrous flooding Stauntonians held their breath after a powerful thunderstorm poured rain on the city flooding Beverley Street and making the intersection of North Augusta Street by the public library nearly impassable.

As of 4:15 p.m. when the rain had slackened owners of buildings and restaurants at the Wharf including Bistro said there was no flooding in their places yet. With the possibility of more storms in the forecast they’re expecting a second band of rain to hit them before dark.

Justin Hershey the owner of Chicano Boy Taco said the restaurant is safe and has not experienced any damage so far.

Barterbrook Road was blocked off around 4:50 p.m. due to a number of large tree branches that fell onto the road. Residents living on Barterbrook Road report flooding in their basements. The road has since been cleared.

As of 5:00 p.m. Gypsy Hill Park experienced flooding that almost submerged the walking path. The torrent of water made its way down the creek.

According the Dominion Energy's outage map more than 60 people in Staunton are without power as of 6:00 p.m.

If someone joins a church mosque or synagogue they may be seeking better emotional or spiritual health. But according to research out of West Virginia University faith communities have the potential to promote physical wellbeing as well.

A new study led by Angel Smothers Stephanie Young and Elizabeth Morrissey — researchers with the WVU School of Nursing — and James Thomas from the School of Medicine’s Division of Exercise Physiology suggests that health care providers who work directly with a faith community can help congregants stick with an exercise program.

Their results appear in the Journal of Interprofessional Education and Practice.

“Even in Biblical texts there were always caregivers who cared for people within early congregations so it’s not a new idea” said Smothers a clinical associate professor in the Department of Family/Community Health. “But a health ministry program can be from any faith background. It’s not just a Christian concept.”

Regardless of the range of beliefs that different faith communities may subscribe to the goal of any faith-community health care provider is the same: to uncover and address congregation-specific health needs.

The study involved 14 participants who were members of a Christian congregation.

When the study began in 2018 the participants completed surveys to identify their current exercise habits describe their general outlook on personal health and pinpoint what — if anything — made adherence to an exercise program difficult.

After being guided through a 12-week program of exercise health education and devotional discussions they took the surveys again. The participants tended to report more favorable responses regarding whether they had time to exercise and whether they needed more time to sleep or catch up on rest. They also reported improved comfort with exercise on a regular basis.

These results suggest that the program encouraged better time management provided the participants with more energy or did both.

That’s especially important because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists lack of time and energy as a common barrier to physical activity.

Health ministry programs may offer one way to improve the longevity of exercise programs.

“We know that when people have social support they’re more likely to engage in activities like these” said Young a clinical assistant professor and PhD student in the Department of Family/Community Health. “The little research into faith-community nursing that’s out there is showing that a spiritual component can be a motivator. If people believe they can serve God better by being healthier — if they believe that God wants them to take care of themselves — then that can be even more internal motivation.”

For the 12-week study period the participants attended two hour-long meetings in their church gym twice per week.

The first hour consisted of an exercise routine that researchers with the School of Medicine’s Division of Exercise Physiology developed. The exercises took participants’ safety and physical abilities into account.

During the second hour participants discussed health-related matters with the faith-community nurse who kept tabs on their health checked their vitals and answered questions about their medications their symptoms and ways to preserve their health.

“It was multidimensional in that some people would come and walk a little but what they really enjoyed was the devotional and educational piece” Smothers said. “Some people wouldn’t feel like walking at all but they would still come get their blood pressure checked and stay for the education and devotional.

The program proved so popular that it continued beyond the 12 weeks the study encompassed. It lasted for more than a year and a half until COVID brought it to an end.

As climate change continues to heat the planet ice sheets and ocean currents could destabilize each other leading to a climate domino effect impacting 40% of the world’s population according to new research.

And these effects could be seen at way lower temperatures than previously thought.

Scientists ran 3 million computer simulations of a climate model finding that nearly one-third resulted in disastrous domino effects even when temperature increases were below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels the upper limit set by the Paris agreement.

Climate tipping points are points of no return in the climate system. Once they are crossed severe accelerated changes to the climactic systems that support life on Earth may become irreversible according to a report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Some of these tipping points such as the collapse of the Western Antarctic ice sheet could have already been crossed Live Science previously reported .

In order to simulate Earth's climate on a computer the researchers created a simplified model that focused on how specific ""dominos"" in the world's climate systems interact. Some of those dominos were things such as ice sheets ocean currents or weather patterns such as El Nino and the model essentially simulated how tipping those — for instance by melting major ice sheets or slowing the Atlantic conveyor belt that helps cool Europe's climate -- would affect other dominos in the chain. The model simulated more than 3 million possible scenarios in which some of the dominos interacted more or less strongly with each other.

The new study found that collapsing ice sheets like those in West Antarctica and Greenland  were especially likely starting points for tipping cascades. In one disturbing scenario cold glacier meltwater triggered the slowing of the Atlantic current and then — by impacting the El-Niño Southern Oscillation — led to significantly reduced rainfall in the Amazon rainforest which could transform much of it into savanna.

In another scenario substantial melting of the Greenland ice sheet would release freshwater into the ocean and slow down Atlantic ocean currents that transport heat from the tropics to the North Pole . This current slowdown would then warm the Southern Ocean destabilizing Antarctic ice sheets which would in turn send meltwater into the ocean and ultimately lead to more sea-level rise. This rising sea level in turn would cause even more melting of the Greenland ice sheet.

And in many of the simulated futures climate alterations most dramatically affected coastal regions where 2.4 billion people or 40% of the world’s population lived in 2017 according to the United Nations .

""We’re shifting the odds and not in our favor — the risk clearly is increasing the more we heat our planet"" co-author Jonathan Donges a physicist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany said in a statement . ""It rises substantially between 1 and 3 [degrees] C. If greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting climate change cannot be halted the upper level of this warming range would most likely be crossed by the end of this century. With even higher temperatures more tipping cascades are to be expected with long-term devastating effects.""

And we may already be well on our way to some of those tipping cascades. In May a separate study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that the Greenland ice sheet the second largest in the world is on the brink of accelerated melting. The ice sheet lost 586 gigatons (532 metric gigatonnes) of mass in 2019 according to an August 2020 study . A further study published in the same month reported that the ice sheet may already have passed the point of no return.

The researchers say that their research may in fact underestimate how close Earth’s climate is to these tipping points and that drastic rapid reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is vital in order to avoid them.

""Our analysis is conservative in the sense that several interactions and tipping elements are not yet considered"" study co-author Ricarda Winkelmann a professor of climate system analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany said in the statement. ""It would hence be a daring bet to hope that the uncertainties play out in a good way given what is at stake. From a precautionary perspective rapidly reducing greenhouse gas emissions is indispensable to limit the risks of crossing tipping points in the climate system and potentially causing domino effects.""

According to a 2018 report by the IPCC put together by the world’s top climate scientists carbon dioxide emissions must be halved by 2030 if the world is to stay within 2.7 F (1.5 C) of global heating — the threshold beyond which global ecosystems and food networks will face extreme stress and small islands will be inundated. Leaders from the G7 nations are meeting at a summit in Cornwall England this week and they will also meet in November in Glasgow Scotland at the United Nations Climate Change Conference to further negotiate a path forward.

The researchers published their findings June 3 in the journal Earth System Dynamics.

You line them up like dominos and then of course knock ‘em over.

First the boxes did not randomly end up at the Lisha Kill Middle School. The students and staff collected them as part of a competition with South Colonie School District’s other middle school Sand Creek. Lisha Kill students nosed out Sand Creek students by about 100 boxes and now all the more than 2200 boxes of cereal will go to the Northeast Regional Food Bank to help feed people in need across 23 counties.

It was a lesson in civics and the importance of helping the less fortunate but nobody said that can’t be fun too. On Friday June 12 the entire student body meticulously lined up the boxes along the sidewalk outside the school and then cheered as they were knocked over.

“We thought it would be a fun activity for the kids” said Lisha Kill Principal David Wetzel. “They have had a tough year with the pandemic. School has not been the same students had to wear masks and they have had smaller class sizes so this is a great way to have some fun at the end of the year.”

While the student body laughed and cheered and otherwise blew off some steam the underlying lesson was not lost.

“Throughout the year we do a lot of community service projects and this is one of the bigger ones and students do know why they are doing it” Wetzel said. “It is more than fun and collecting boxes for a dominoes game. They understand what they did and what they are doing is to help people.”

The Regional Food Bank has been helping feed the hungry since 1982. It collects large donations of food and distributes some 55 million pounds to pantries and other charitable organizations across 23 counties from Plattsburgh to Newburgh.

Kiyomi Giboyeaux a six grader at Lisha Kill said it “was a fun day” and it was nice to be outside with all her friends without having to wear a mask.”

“It was really important so that people can have enough food” she said of the activity’s main purpose.

Her classmate Aliyah Pearson said she liked watching the cereal boxes tumble but more importantly she likes to “see people be happy” and likes to help those in need and is “glad they got all this food.”

“It was fun because we got to watch them all fall to the ground” said sixth grader Adam Elkordy. “And a lot of people will get food now who need it.”

The weather didn’t really cooperate and a slight breeze prematurely knocked some boxes over forcing the students to put them on their side rather than the bottom. It worked well albeit a little too well and an occasional “domino” did need some persuading to keep the chain going.

Next week Sand Creek students will hold a similar event with the more than 1000 boxes of cereal collected for the food bank.

CHALLENGING TIMES: The US$61.2 million deal would bolster the hotel and restaurant group’s finances which have been hit by a COVID-19 outbreak

By Crystal Hsu / Staff reporter





Formosa International Hotels Corp (FIH 晶華國際酒店集團) yesterday said that its board had approved plans to sell all its shares in Pizzavest Co Ltd (達美樂披薩) to Australia-listed fast-food operator Dominio’s Pizza Enterprises Ltd for US$61.2 million.

The deal scheduled to be completed in 90 days would give FIH the financial means to stay competitive and safeguard the interest of employees and shareholders as the hospitality industry at home and abroad is hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic the Taipei-based company said.

Pizzavest the operator of Domino's Taiwan operates 157 corporate and franchised stores and is the second-largest pizza chain in Taiwan. It generated a net profit of NT$68 million (US$2.46 million) last year despite the COVID-19 pandemic making it an attractive acquisition target for Domino’s Pizza Enterprises in Australia FIH said.

FIH which runs hotels under the Regent Taipei (台北晶華) Silks Place (晶英) Wellspring by Silks (晶泉丰旅) and Just Sleep (捷絲旅) brands across Taiwan said it intends to focus on hotel management and brand franchising.

It also runs independent restaurants the Spice Market (泰市場) Just Italian (義饗食堂) and Just Grill Steakhouse.

It took over the operation of Domino’s Taiwan in 2007.

Domino’s Pizza Enterprises said it sees long-term potential for business growth in Taiwan its 10th market with plans to expand to more than 400 stores. The deal with FIH is to be funded by a combination of cash and debt it said.

The Australian firm said it is seeking to enter more markets abroad aiming to have 1900 stores in Asia between 2030 and 2031 from 1500 now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpbmNvbG5zaGlyZXdvcmxkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9kb21pbm9zLXBpenphLXRha2Vhd2F5LXRvLW9wZW4taW4tc2tlZ25lc3MtMzI3MTAyMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Domino's Pizza takeaway to open in Skegness,"Until now people have had to go to Fantasy Island in Ingoldmells for the nearest store.

Tamia Dow a former Las Vegas police detective and Chaparral High School and UNLV graduate has made multiple short movies since 2018. (Rachel Aston/Las Vegas Review-Journal)

Tamia Dow retired in 2012 from the Metropolitan Police Department as a detective who specialized in domestic violence cases.

Now nine years later she’s developed a second career as a filmmaker.

“Fictionalized dramas but they are educational dramas” Dow said of her films. “I’m pulling from my years of experience. I worked cases (as an officer) so the elements in my films are elements of things that have happened.”

The Army veteran chaplain Chaparral High School and UNLV graduate has made multiple short movies since 2018. She tackles tough issues such as the well-being of veterans mental health sex trafficking domestic violence and child cyberstalking. Titles include “Toxic Love” “Turn Back Time” “Meet Me After School” and “Why Should I Care?” Up next is a post-apocalyptic narrative called “Angel on the Roadside.”

Each film like her policing career is aimed at helping others.

“My ultimate goal is I really want to elevate people to a different level” she said. “This is my thing. I believe that violence is not what we are here for. I believe that love is what we are here for.”

Inspired by #MeToo

Dow started with the Police Department as a patrol officer in 1989. She worked for several years in the Naked City area of Las Vegas near The Strat.

She eventually was promoted to detective and worked domestic violence cases for the last eight years of her career. It was a rewarding frustrating at times heartbreaking task that left her a witness to the horrible outcomes of domestic violence.

“If you are a police officer you generally get a call three to four times a shift of domestic violence depending on what shift you are on” she said adding “we know that in domestic violence when people get killed it is when they are trying to leave.”

Dow traveled the world for two years after retirement. She returned to Las Vegas and started to ponder what she was going to do for a second career.

“I’m a woman of God and I believe the Lord loads up our tool bag for a reason” she said. “We go through every experience we go through in life for a reason. So I always say ‘God how am I supposed to use this? What do you want me to do with this?’ ”

Her adventure into filmmaking soon followed when the #MeToo movement gained prominence in America in late 2017. Dow was troubled by the accounts of actresses abused by directors and people in power in the filmmaking industry.

“There were a lot of actresses who came out and said they had these ‘director’s couch’ type of situations where they had to do whatever with the director in order to get their part” Dow said. “I saw an online comment from an actor: ‘The only way we can solve this is to get more filmmakers. More female filmmakers.’ When he said that I was like ‘Hmmm.’ ”

Then in 2018 she was challenged by a friend to participate in the national 48 Hour Film Project. This involves a team making a movie in just 48 hours. She started as an actress then received another challenge from local filmmaker Joe Lujan to make her own movie.

“Hey I’m up to a challenge” she thought. “Obviously right?”

She’s since learned the hardscrabble path that every director faces to make a movie work. Coming up with the money people equipment and editing require unending attention.

“We’ve been making them both out of our own pockets” Dow said. “I find very creative ways to make it happen.”

Dow does it under the business Triple 8 Spirit Productions with her business partner Stephen Cibo who runs Action Shot Productions.

“She’s a go-getter” Cibo said of Dow. “She’s relentless.”

Dow’s films have been shown and recognized at multiple festivals including the Silver State Film Festival. She’ll be traveling to Spain this fall for another film festival in Barcelona.

”What I really enjoy about filmmaking is I love being able to tell a story and to show someone how they can be victorious regardless of what situation they are in” Dow said. “The reason is I do all of this is for the glory of God. God has seen me through.”

They represent the University of Washington football team and interact with game officials their coaches teammates.

Shaking hands with the referees and the opponents they call the coin flip in the air and supply vocal leadership at all times.

When everything's on the line and the clock's ticking down these individuals challenge everyone to step up and deliver.

They're Husky game captains.

Over 131 UW football seasons more than 400 players have accepted this all-encompassing responsibility and stride to the middle of the field to get things moving and if nothing else project a moment of strength when first engaging the enemy.

Frank Griffiths was the team captain for the initial Husky team put together in 1896 that played and lost a lone game that late-century football season against the Eastern College Alumni.

Last fall Jaxson Kirkland Cade Otton Elijah Molden and Keith Taylor together assumed the captains' roles for each UW game during a similarly short and extra-challenging pandemic schedule.

Out of all of these field generals who have emerged over more than a century of Husky football representing the best of the best in a UW uniform one has stood out above the rest according to former Rose Bowl offensive tackle Don Dow.

Jimmy Rodgers.

In 1984 he captained the UW's Orange Bowl-bound team one that beat Michigan and Oklahoma in the same season sharing this honor with Tim Meamber Dan Eernisee and Danny Green. A strong safety Rodgers exuded toughness and inspiration at all times. He loved his teammates and made them respect him.

Mostly he accepted that mantle and never let go of it.

""I think Jimmy Rodgers would have to be one of the most impactful captains"" Dow said ""especially on an enduring basis.""

UW Athletics

Undaunted by any football stage or college mystique Rodgers turned in his greatest performance at Michigan's overly intimidating Big House knocking down then quarterback and current Wolverines coach Jim Harbaugh whenever and however he could. He made his teammates follow him to a 20-11 victory.

All season long he kept the Huskies pointed toward an 11-1 season and a No. 2 national ranking that easily could have resulted in a national championship and he still bemoans the game that got away a 16-7 defeat at USC.

Rodgers next lobbied current UW athletic director Jennifer Cohen hard to induct his 1984 team into the Husky Hall of Fame.

He became a driving force behind UW officials players and supporters to band together to erect a statue of Don James his coach outside of Husky Stadium.

""Jimmy was calling me calling me calling me and said here it is"" Dow recalled. ""He really honcho-ed that.""

While he's lived in places such as Europe and Africa and worked as a stockbroker and as a real estate salesman Rodgers currently resides near the Seattle waterfront and acts as the city's unofficial mayor while always serving as a football ambassador.

In his latest venture he's championing a subscription podcast called ""Downtown Dawgs"" and been shooting video segments that he hopes to launch this fall featuring his former teammates and all sorts of university and citywide notables having fun and keeping memories alive.

""To me that's just a continuation of Jimmy Rodgers"" Dow said ""and that captaincy that he had and it continues to have.""

Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda

Conversations on conservation are extremely crucial especially in a country like Sri Lanka but many would argue that a sufficient number of conversations with the right persons do not take place. What does take place must be fuelled not by a gut instinct for what the environment needs and what must be done to conserve our wildlife resources nor should it have a political agenda.



What is needed is a scientific approach backed by data.



This was the topic of discussion at the monthly lecture organised by the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) in May with Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda exploring the topic ‘Conserving Horton Plains: What the Science Tells Us’.



The speaker is a biodiversity scientist and has published over 60 research papers. He has also authored several books on Sri Lanka’s fauna and flora through the Wildlife Heritage Trust (WHT). Dr. Pethiyagoda argued that public policy must be built on the basis of science and values should be guided by science.

“In every area of environmental controversy we have to remember that if we follow the science we do ourselves a huge favour. If we follow our gut or our political preferences we do the whole community an enormous disservice” Dr. Pethiyagoda said.



However there is a lack of data and research that can be studied when building policy or deciding on the best approach for conservation. This is due to the fact that Sri Lanka does not have a large community of researchers for this line of work Dr. Pethiyagoda said adding that this was why Sri Lanka needed a wildlife or biodiversity research institute.





Research institution

“We are one of the few countries in the world that does not have a wildlife institution” he said but it is not that attempts have not been made.



An effort was made in 2003 to establish a National Institute of Biodiversity and Dr. Pethiyagoda played a key role in these efforts. Funding would come from donors across the world and there was $ 22 million in pledges. One-fourth of this would go into the physical infrastructure of the institute and the remaining three-fourths would go into a perpetual endowment fund outside Sri Lanka.



The estimated 10% annual earnings from the fund would be used to offer grants to Sri Lanka’s research community.



However a public campaign was launched by certain environmental and nature protection organisations in Sri Lanka putting a stop to what could have been a well-funded National Institute of Biodiversity. The funding went to India which now has two biodiversity institutions.



The incident was brought up by Dr. Pethiyagoda not only because of his involvement in the project but because the country must learn to not make such mistakes especially such expensive mistakes.



While the need for a research institute was recognised the need for conversation too was emphasised during the WNPS lecture. The obvious place for conversation would be the Wildlife Conservation Department (DWC).



“The obvious place for the conversation to take place is the Wildlife Department and for that there is the Fauna and Flora Advisory Committee. I think that committee has not been made a pivot often enough” Dr. Pethiyagoda said adding that the Advisory Committee is usually under pressure because committees have political appointees.





Politics at play

While the involvement of politicians and persons with political backing can be a step back in the efforts made towards conservation Dr. Pethiyagoda also touched on the political differences within the conservation community itself.



Addressing the topic of management of visitors Dr. Pethiyagoda explained that some see visitors as an opportunity which others see visitors as a threat.



“We have got almost a political divide between the two groups of people and we rarely have a conversation. I acknowledge that too many visitors are the problem for Horton Plains. For example they lead to a lot of road deaths because they have got tens and thousands of vehicles coming into Horton Plains every year” he said.



However solutions must look at addressing these problems while sustaining the visitors. Dr. Pethiyagoda suggests a good visitor centre catering to a wide range of interests a cable car system on the World’s End side of Horton Plains and a good shuttle service using electric vehicles from Ohiya or Pattipola.



There is also a divide when it comes to herbicide and the use of it in efforts to remove alien or invasive species from places like Horton Plains. While saying the use of herbicide in Horton Plains may not be that popular Dr. Pethiyagoda explained that it could be beneficial when removing gorse in Horton Plains which were introduced by the British 100 years ago but has lately become an invasive species.



He explained that gorse leaves a large amount of seeds behind which can remain in the soil for up to 30 years. In addition to this the bare earth that remains after invasive species like gorse is removed seems to become home to other alien species as opposed to native Sri Lankan species.



Thus the solution is not merely to uproot and destroy the gorse.



“If you use an herbicide in a controlled way it can be very effective” Dr. Pethiyagoda said explaining that cutting off the gorse at the level of the ground damaging the stump spraying a little herbicide in it and closing it up for a few months will damage the stump and the root of the plants.

This method was tested in New Zealand and found to be successful.



While the use of herbicide can be effective in this instance it is not always the best method. This applies to efforts to remove alien grass species that have an advantage over rainforest grass as they are used to direct sunlight.



Horton Plains has two different kinds of grassland. One is the result of the potato cultivation that took place on around 1000 acres of the ground in the 1960s and was fertilised using cattle manure.



The manure contained seeds of grass brought to Sri Lanka to be used as pasture grass. “These grasses were much more aggressive than native grasses in Horton Plains so we have 1000 acres of pasture grass that is not native to Horton Plains” he said.



The rest of Horton Plains has native grasses but where new grass grew after burning in the past alien species now grow. In Horton Plains the alien species are often those brought to the country for horticulture.



Since herbicide is not an option in this instance shade netting can be used to repress alien species. However shade netting has a terrible appearance which is why it must be balanced with the tourism industry in mind.





Canopy dieback

Canopy dieback was also an area of focus in the lecture delivered by Dr. Pethiyagoda. He explained that Horton Plains is known as a tropical mountain cloud forest which means that for much of the time the cloud level is low enough to touch the ground and the vegetation.



“Many of the trees in Horton Plains that reach the canopy have leaves that are specialised. They are called sclerophyll leaves that are specialised in having mist water condensed on them they are waxy on their surface and the mist water condense then drips off to the forest floor. So in addition to rainfall this vegetation is specialised in capturing mist water” he explained.



Since Horton Plains does not receive a lot of rain mist water becomes extremely relevant. However cloud table rises when a tropical mountain cloud forest is surrounded by deforested area and this is backed by studies carried out in Costa Rica. This is unfortunately the case in Horton Plains which is surrounded by tea plantations and grassland for cattle farms.



“This means that there is less mist passing through the canopy and therefore less mist being absorbed by the vegetation. So that too could add to hydrological stress to the plants. That in turn may contribute to the phenomenon of canopy dieback” Dr. Pethiyagoda explained.



He went on to say that studies also showed that the mist passing through Horton Plains was highly acidic enough to cause acid damage to foliage. Due to its smaller size and larger surface area mist water can absorb more pollutants than rain water. “But we have never measured or monitored the quality of air on Horton Plains. As a result of that we have no idea what pollutants are passing through” he added.



Heavy metals are also an area of stress and Dr. Pethiyagoda said a 2015 study showed that a high level of lead in the soil. When lead exceeds a certain level dieback occurs.



“We do not know where this lead is coming from because we do not have monitoring studies but this is a part of the research that needs to get done. We do not have lead in petrol of course because the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation since 2003 stopped adding lead to our petrol” he said adding that he played a key role in this as well.



Studies also found that adding compost reduced the dieback but Dr. Pethiyagoda raised concerns about this as Horton Plains is a large area and it is not known if compost will address the issue in the long term.



There are thus several contributing factors to canopy dieback including heavy metal pollution longer dry period rising temperature loss of epiphytes acid mist or rain higher cloud table depleted soils and higher wind speed. These factors also interact with each other in ways we do not yet understand Dr. Pethiyagoda said stressing that even the best brains in the country cannot do anything about it because we do not have the necessary data.





Need for monitoring

“We need to have extensive monitoring on places like Horton Plains. That is the first intervention we need to put in place. We have just started measuring climate and logging climate data” Dr. Pethiyagoda said adding that we also need to look at air quality rain water quality mist water quality and soil quality across the matrix even in this very small national park.



On a more positive note Dr. Pethiyagoda said that preliminary studies suggest that forest cover is increasing. These studies show that forest cover went from 72% to 78% while grass cover went from 28% to 24% between 1998 and 2008.



“When we look at restoration we are at the cusp of a project that the Wildlife Detent is in the very early stages of right now” Dr. Pethiyagoda said.



He was referring to the 700 hectares of tea known as the Udaweriya Estate the Wildlife Conservation Department has taken over from the Land Reform Commission. This would increase the Horton Plains area by 20% and natural forest will be restored in this area.



“This is to my mind the most ambitious conservation project that has been undertaken in Sri Lanka up to now because this is terrible land to work with” he said explaining that the land is steep prone to landslides and has alien species like acacia and eucalypts growing on it.



The project will cost billions of rupees need intensive management and will take decades.

Several new housing developments including a 10-story high-rise at Main and William are under construction in the downtown area and more are expected to start soon.

Ann Arbor architect Brad Moore has helped design several of downtown’s new buildings including condos currently rising at 309 N. Ashley St. and 441 S. Ashley St.

“The Garnet should be starting shortly” he added referring to another five-story condo development he designed for a site just north of downtown on Summit Street.

“We’re also moving forward again on the high-rise behind the Michigan Theater so you’ll see construction activity there as well” said Moore one of the architects for the 19-story project along with ESG Architecture & Design.

“I just love having the opportunity to make room for more neighbors in Ann Arbor” he said.

Bloomfield Hills-based Cerca Trova LLC is teaming up with Chicago developer CA Ventures to propose mixed-income apartments and ground-floor commercial space to replace four rental houses and an old commercial building along Washington Street behind the Michigan Theater in downtown Ann Arbor.ESG Architecture & Design and J. Bradley Moore & Associates

“We’re actually having a meeting with the people over at the Michigan Theater next week to flesh out timelines and construction sequencing. It’s an intricate dance” Moore said of the development behind the historic movie palace noting there are plans to incorporate new bathrooms for the theater within the ground floor of the development.

Ann Arbor historic site will house locally based tech company

While the COVID-19 pandemic paused or delayed some projects Moore said that phase seems to be reaching an end though it’s still difficult to construct anything right now because of high lumber prices. Forecasts suggest the costs should come down in the coming months so developers have adjusted project timeframes to avoid paying a “super premium” for construction materials Moore said.

One of the biggest development projects that has yet to start is Broadway Park West a $100-million transformation of the DTE Energy riverfront property off Broadway Street just north of downtown. Detroit-based Roxbury Group plans to build four six-story buildings with 96 condos a nine-story hotel with 148 rooms a riverfront restaurant commercial spaces public green space walking trails an event pavilion and more.

“In spite of delays caused by COVID we are still on track to complete our financing this year and are targeting initial site work by year-end” said David Di Rita of the Roxbury Group.

24 Ann Arbor developments to watch in 2021

A lot of people in the construction industry are using this time to do planning and there’s a lot of interest in assembling parcels into larger properties to develop Moore said.

“So I think right now we’re seeing an increase in the planning phase in anticipation that by this time next year it’ll be kind of back to normal in the construction industry” he said.

A 10-story apartment high-rise called The Standard is still rising at Main and William and is expected to open in fall 2022. Plans call for 218 apartments with 421 bedrooms and over 6000 square feet of ground-floor commercial space.

Another major downtown development still in the works is the 13-story Vic Village South high-rise on South University Avenue expected to cater to University of Michigan students.

Hughes Properties cleared a row of buildings along South U to make way for the project late last year but vertical construction has yet to begin.

Vic Village South — complementing Vic Village North already built across the street — will add nearly 130 more apartments with 300-plus beds including 14 affordable housing units Sean Havera of Hughes Properties said previously. Havera couldn’t be reached for an update on the project Friday.

Just south of downtown the new 167-unit Hoover and Greene apartments recently replaced an entire neighborhood block.

A majority of the new condos under construction downtown are already spoken for and they’re going for high prices.

For the five-story 19-unit condo building known as The Gallery at the northeast corner of Ashley and Jefferson streets the Ann Arbor Builders website listed eight units still available as of May 15 including four two-bedroom units starting at $599000 and four three-bedroom units starting at $734000. The building is expected to be ready for tenants by this fall.

Another five-story 17-unit condo building rising at 309 N. Ashley St. is one of the latest projects from Ann Arbor developer Tom Fitzsimmons who has built several new condo buildings in the downtown area in recent years. Ten units are already reserved according to 309ashley.com.

DUK,Duke Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlcHVibGljLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzEzL2JyZWFraW5nX3VwX2lzX2hhcmRfdG9fZG9fZHVrZV9lbmVyZ3lfdW5kZXJfcHJlc3N1cmVfdG9fc3BsaXRfaW50b18zX3BpZWNlcy0yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO: Duke Energy under pressure to split into 3 pieces,"When activist investor Paul Singer sets his eyes on a struggling company he makes waves.

The billionaire acquired bookstore chain Barnes & Noble which had suffered seven years of declining revenue for $683 million in 2019 and installed a new CEO who fired nearly half of the company’s New York-based book buyers and allowed store managers to decide which books to buy.

Singer who lives in New York City took a $3.2 billion stake in telecom giant AT&T and called for sweeping changes in the underperforming company. Less than a year later the chief executive stepped down and his successor announced plans to undo a huge acquisition by spinning off WarnerMedia.

Singer scooped up 9.2% of the shares in Athenahealth a company that digitizes patient medical records and billing claims for hospitals. In response the company announced plans to close offices lay off hundreds of people and sell one of its two corporate jets. Unsatisfied Singer pushed out the company’s co-founder and CEO Jonathan Bush cousin of former President George W. Bush and installed a replacement.

Now Singer is rocking the boat again this time with his sights set on Duke Energy Corp. the North Carolina-based parent of Duke Energy Indiana the state’s largest electric utility.

The question is whether Singer will again be successful in getting his demands met even if it means turning the utility on its head.

Singer’s hedge fund Elliott Investment Management LP last month sent a letter to Duke Energy urging it to consider separating into three companies. The letter said the huge utility has been underperforming its peers and argued that Duke’s customers would be better served by locally managed utilities.

Singer’s vision: He wants the companies split along geographic lines with one covering the Carolinas; another covering Florida; and the third covering Indiana Ohio and Kentucky. Elliott’s letter said the split would unlock up to $15 billion for shareholders. Elliott is also asking for three seats on Duke’s board saying the company needs new direction.

The letter said Elliott was one of Duke’s 10 largest shareholders following large purchases of stock. It did not reveal what percentage of Duke stock it holds today.

“Despite a portfolio of top-tier utilities Duke has suffered numerous operational setbacks and investment and strategic missteps over the past decade at significant cost to both shareholders and customers” Elliott wrote to Duke’s board on May 17. It publicly released the 15-page letter the same day.

Breakup after buildup?

In response Duke said it would review Elliott’s proposals but countered that breaking up the company would be a mistake “as scale is needed to efficiently finance the company’s unprecedented capital investment and growth opportunities.” It added that the proposed breakup posed capital structure and credit problems.

Duke said Elliott’s push is just the latest in a series of proposals the hedge fund has offered the utility since last summer.

“Throughout Duke Energy’s board of directors has reviewed their proposals in depth and determined that they are not in the best interests of the company its shareholders and other stakeholders” Duke wrote in a five-page response.

The power struggle comes just four months after Duke announced plans to sell nearly one-fifth of the Indiana operation to the government of Singapore for $2.05 billion. The company said the deal which is littered with redacted documents and non-disclosure agreements will help it raise money to fund its clean-energy transition and fund other initiatives.

But consumer and environmental groups question whether the deal is likely to benefit Indiana customers and are raising sharp questions about the secrecy.

The twin announcements thrust Duke into the spotlight and raise questions about whether Duke is on the right course in a challenging environment for utilities or is getting unnecessarily sidetracked.

A corporate breakup undoubtedly an extreme move would undo years of corporate building at Duke Energy a running project largely carried out by former Duke CEO Jim Rogers. Over 30 years starting in 1988 Rogers built Duke into the nation’s largest electric utility through a series of mergers that began in Indiana with a nearly insolvent utility called PSI Energy.

Rogers retired in 2013 as CEO after 25 years with the company and its predecessors. He died in 2018 at the age of 71.

Today Duke provides electricity to nearly 8 million customers in six states including 840000 in Indiana including Bartholomew County.

Company setbacks

The company however has faced expensive setbacks in recent months. In January it agreed to absorb $1.1 billion in costs rather than have customers pick up the cost for getting rid of hazardous coal ash stored near one of its large generating plants in North Carolina following a huge spill into the Dan River.

In another expensive move Duke and a partner Dominion Energy announced last summer they had canceled an $8 billion pipeline project that would have carried natural gas across the Appalachian Trail as costs rose and environmental groups sued to block the project. That resulted in a $1.6 billion write-off for Duke.

In March Moody’s downgraded its rating on Duke’s long-term debt citing the recent settlement of coal-ash cleanup.

Singer’s hedge fund Elliott cited all of those setbacks in its letter to Duke’s board and urged the company to take huge steps to restructure.

“Under the current structure Duke has been unable to execute effectively and maximize the potential of its premium utility franchises” Elliott wrote in the letter signed by two senior managers.

Elliott officials declined further comment.

Duke Energy said its Indiana operations are well managed and a breakup would not help.

“We have become a strong better company through mergers over the years while keeping our deep local roots in the state” the company said in an email to IBJ. “Our charitable community giving has increased our economic development work is robust and we still have local managers who serve on boards and live in the communities we serve. As a Wall Street activist hedge fund Elliott Management does not have any of the same ties and commitments.”

The company forwarded several reports from analysts who are critical of splitting up the company and suggested that Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston might have some thoughts on this issue.

IBJ reached out to Huston’s office and a few days later he issued a statement.

“We are monitoring the buyout discussions around Duke Energy as it relates to Indiana and share concerns about the possibility of unintended consequences including significant ratepayer increases and modernization stagnation” Huston said in the written statement. “Duke Energy Indiana our state’s largest utility continues to be a great community partner as we continue to grow economic development throughout the state and I hope we can avoid any significant disruptions.”

Activist investor

There’s no question that Singer who created the Elliott hedge fund in 1977 (Elliott is his middle name) will push Duke hard for an overhaul. He is not the type of investor who buys stock in a company then patiently waits for management to deliver results.

Instead Singer has built a reputation as an agitator who uses his $42 billion fund to buy stock in companies he deems weak. Then he pressures management to make huge changes with the goal of improving the stock price.

“A signature Elliott tactic is the release of a letter harshly criticizing the target company’s CEO which is often followed by the executive’s resignation or the sale of the company” wrote The New Yorker in a 2018 profile of Singer.

Bloomberg called Singer “aggressive tenacious and litigious to a fault” and dubbed him “the world’s most feared investor.” Fortune magazine described him as one of the “smartest and toughest money managers” in the hedge fund industry.

But some critics say activist investors like Singer don’t build companies but instead push hard for layoffs divestitures and a cutback in new investment to make a company more profitable often just in the short term.

The former president of Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner once described Singer as a “bloodsucker” and a “financial terrorist” after the country defaulted on $80 billion of debt in 2001 and the country offered creditors 30% of what they were owed. Many took the deal but Singer and a few other hedge funds refused to go along pushing for full repayment.

Singer for his part has argued that activist investors like him can shake up mismanaged or dysfunctional organizations whether they be underperforming companies or countries defaulting on bonds.

He wrote in The Wall Street Journal in 2017 that many activists are interested in the long-term value of a company and too often companies hide behind “long term” as a way to justify prolonged underperformance.

“Equity activism means using your voice and voting rights to improve companies in ways that maximize value for all shareholders” he wrote under the headline “Efficient Markets Need Guys Like Me.”

Not always the winner

Singer doesn’t always get his way. His scorecard has a few losses or incompletes when target companies fight back.

In 2011 for example Elliott sued Vietnamese state shipbuilder Vinashin in British High Court to recover its investment in a $600 million syndicated loan that Vinashin defaulted on a year earlier. Vinashin had initially offered repayment of 35 cents on the dollar to bondholders before Elliott filed the suit according to The Wall Street Journal. Elliott sued for full repayment with unpaid interest totaling $13.2 million. A year later however Elliott quietly dropped the suit.

In 2017 Elliott tried to force Akzo Nobel the Dutch paint and chemicals company to oust Chairman Antony Burgmans and to sell itself to American rival PPG Industries. But after months of court fights the two sides announced a truce with Akzo Nobel remaining independent.

Singer is estimated by Forbes to have a personal net worth of $4.3 billion. Last year the magazine ranked him 222nd on the list of the 400 richest Americans.

What caused him to take an interest in Duke Energy remains unclear. But the utility has been popping up in the news lately as something of a problem child with the expensive cancellation of its Appalachian pipeline the costly settlement over its coal-ash ponds and other issues.

In September The Wall Street Journal reported that NextEra Energy a smaller utility based near West Palm Beach Florida whose largest operating company is Florida Power & Light made a takeover approach to Duke in a move that would create a $60 billion combination. Duke rebuffed the offer the newspaper reported.

In its letter to the Duke board Elliott said it has followed Duke and the U.S. utility industry for almost 20 years.

It said the company’s operations in Indiana Florida and some other states were once operated as separate stand-alone companies “each having more-than-sufficient scale to operate successfully and thrive.”

Road to Duke Energy

Elliott’s reference to local corporate history is likely to hit home for Indiana. In 1988 Rogers a lawyer and former journalist took over a small struggling utility then called Public Service Company of Indiana.

The company was nearly bankrupt after spending more than $2 billion in a failed attempt to build a nuclear power plant in Marble Hill a small Indiana town on the Ohio River. Costs for the plant had spiraled out of control and PSI was running out of money. PSI abandoned the project and auctioned it off for parts in 1985.

Rogers worked to rebuild PSI and fought off a takeover attempt by the much larger IPALCO parent company of the Indianapolis electric utility now called AES Indiana.

Rogers then engineered a merger with Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. Even though PSI was the smaller partner Rogers became vice chairman and chief operating officer of the combined companies called Cinergy Corp. and later rose to CEO.

Four years later he pulled off another merger this one with Duke Energy and again wound up as CEO.

In 2011 Rogers pulled off perhaps his most significant deal the $13.7 billion acquisition of Progress Energy based in Raleigh North Carolina. That deal made Duke the nation’s largest electric utility a title previously held by Southern Co. based in Atlanta.

But as far as Elliott is concerned bigger is not better in Duke’s case. It said that a separation of the company into three smaller companies would create $12 billion to $15 billion of near-term value for shareholders based on the metrics of Duke’s closest peers.

It estimated that the Carolinas Florida and the Midwest (comprising Indiana Ohio and Kentucky) would command equity market valuations of $55 billion $23 billion and $15 billion respectively for a total equivalent of $93 billion.

That’s $16 billion above the $76.9 billion in market value Duke now commands based on its closing price of $100.08 on June 1.

Skeptics

Yet some analysts are not convinced that Elliott’s prescription is the right medicine for Duke or that the stock would be more valuable after a breakup.

“Color us skeptical that separating Duke into smaller utilities would prompt a near-term re-rating in Duke’s share price” wrote Wells Fargo analyst Neil Kalton in a May 17 note to clients.

He said he agreed with Duke management that a “shrink-the-company” strategy would require significant costs for each of the three companies to set up corporate functions and that investors would not automatically respond by driving up the share prices of three companies.

Morgan Stanley analyst Stephen Byrd said he doubts the Duke board and Elliott will reach agreement on any element of Elliott’s proposal or that Duke will materially alter its strategy. “The cost of refinancing debt and establishing separate capital structure for 3 separate entities could be significant” he wrote.

Indeed shareholders seem to have responded mostly with a big yawn. Duke’s stock which closed at $103.06 the day before Elliott released its letter rose briefly as high as $108 but has since fallen back to the $100 level.

Nor do some consumer groups seem sold on the idea of a breakup although they say local control is often better.

Tyson Slocum energy director at Public Citizen the not-for-profit consumer group founded by Ralph Nader said that while breaking up Duke could have benefits such a move should be made through careful deliberation involving employees customers and communities.

“Elliott is not an agent of positive change for Duke” he wrote in an email to IBJ. “It is a vulture hedge fund with a decades-long track record of disruptive and destructive behavior.”

Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana a grassroots consumer organization said it accepted the premise that Duke is too big and utilities should be managed and operated as close to the communities they serve as possible.

“Our local public utilities should not be fodder for massive energy holding companies or for hedge funds to do with as they please” Kerwin Olson CAC’s executive director wrote in an email to IBJ. “Neither of those entities have the best interest of consumers or the communities they serve in mind.”

There's nothing inherently unique about the liquified natural gas (LNG) business but the company — along with the supplier Cheniere — want you to think of this liquified natural gas delivery as different: this shipment of gas was deemed ""carbon neutral."" This isn't the only instance of this happening; earlier this year Occidental Petroleum sold a shipload of crude oil it too deemed 100 percent ""carbon neutral.""

How exactly does a massive shipment of crude oil or fossil gas fracked in the United States and shipped across the Atlantic manage to get a ""carbon neutral"" label? The greenhouse gas emissions associated with this drilling is not absorbed or erased. They are zeroed out on paper thanks to an accounting trick: Using credits from carbon offsets.

These emissions illusions are key components to corporate climate pledges. Fortune 500 companies including many fossil fuel polluters have raced out to announce ""net zero"" commitments often accompanied by slick self-congratulatory advertising. But these schemes are more often about image management than pollution reduction; Shell after all plans to grow its fossil fuel business while making ""net zero"" promises.

Shell's ""carbon neutral"" LNG is an instructive case. Where do these ""credits"" come from exactly? Shell's website of ""nature based"" credits lists one project in the United States: The GreenTrees initiative a reforestation project in Louisiana that claims to have protected 120000 acres and planted over 40 million trees. But a recent investigation found that it was paying landowners to do things they had already done on their own — like planting trees or simply not cutting down existing ones — while creating carbon credits to sell to companies like Shell Duke Energy and Microsoft.

This is par for the course. One multimillion-dollar offsets program touts its role protecting threatened trees but much of it is based on selling credits for trees that were in no danger. An investigation into a major aviation emissions offsets program found a range of similar problems. And a deep look at California's multi-billion dollar forest offsets program found millions of ""ghost credits"" purchased by polluters to enable them to continue spewing carbon into the atmosphere.

A meaningful effective offsets program would need to result in verifiable emissions-reducing actions that would not have happened otherwise (what's called ""additionality"" in policy circles). But it's not clear this is possible; the programs being critically scrutinized have been certified by so-called ""independent"" auditors.

While it's bad that corporations are faking it when it comes to climate action the more profound danger is that these programs are actually increasing emissions in the real world — while corporations and government regulators point to spreadsheets that show progress.

Truly effective climate action would require direct emissions reductions at the source. Even the normally cautious industry-friendly International Energy Agency admitted as much in its recent report which drew banner headlines because it spoke an inescapable truth: confronting climate chaos means we must stop drilling and fracking now. But corporate polluters along with politicians and even environmental organizations favor the creation of complex credit markets based on the misguided notion that direct regulation of pollution is too onerous and prescriptive.

These are not just theoretical concerns. The Biden administration is expected to unveil a Clean Electricity Standard designed to create a carbon-free power goal by 2035. But if that standard rests on credits and offsets or on empty promises that gas-fired power plants can be equipped with ""carbon capture"" technology we will fail. Creative accounting cannot rescue us from the climate catastrophe.

There is an alternative: A bona fide renewable energy standard based on clear regulations that requires a rapid shift away from burning fossil fuels. Renewable portfolio standards have been among our most effective means of reducing localized pollution and climate emissions. These proven success stories must be emulated and expanded nationally. We have no time not to embrace the most effective method to reign in the urgent threat posed by our climate crisis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndmYWUub3JnL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvMjAyMS0wNi0xMi9jaGFybG90dGUtbG9jYWwtdHJhbnNpdC1yaWRlcnNoaXAtaXMtc2xvdy10by1yZWNvdmVy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Charlotte Local Transit Ridership Is Slow To Recover,"We now have our first look at transit ridership’s post-COVID recovery — and a sense of how far the Charlotte Area Transit System has to go.

Here are the numbers:

In April 2019 CATS handled 1.8 million passenger trips. The Lynx Blue handled just under 690000 of those. The bus system carried the rest.

Fast-forward to April 2020 — the first full month of the county and state’s semi-lockdown.

That month CATS traffic fell to just under 594000 trips. That’s a two-thirds drop.

CATS recently tabulated transit ridership for April 2021 — the first time we can compare what post-pandemic life may be like after the state and businesses started really easing restrictions.

For that month CATS says it handled 721500 passenger trips. That’s a 21.5% increase over the previous year but still only 40% of the traffic from the comparable pre-pandemic month two years earlier.

(It should be noted that 2019 wasn’t Charlotte transit’s peak. That was in 2014 when CATS carried 29.4 million trips. Ridership had already fallen by 18% from 2014 to 2019 even with the opening of the $1.1 billion Lynx Blue Line extension.)

Is Work From Home Here To Stay?

April 2021 is arguably a transition month.

Vaccines were just becoming widely available although most uptown businesses were still allowing work from home. Bars and restaurants were pretty full but Gov. Roy Cooper’s mask mandates were still in effect.

As ridership numbers for the summer are tallied it’s likely traffic will keep climbing as life returns to normal.

But how long until CATS reaches 2019 passenger levels? And will it ever?

A Trip On The Blue Line

I rode the Lynx Blue Line Tuesday afternoon through uptown. There were 15 people in my car and a handful of people waiting on the platforms of uptown stations. It wasn’t particularly busy but the passengers I spoke with said there were more people riding than for much of the pandemic.

Charles and Mary Phillips are retirees from south Charlotte. They love the train and rode it several times — even before vaccines.

“The biggest issue is what happens with work from home” Charles Phillips said about the future. “That’s going to be very important.”

Not back to the office yet: an uptown parking lot at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday.

The work-from-home issue is indeed critical to transit’s success.

Earlier this spring Duke Energy announced it would be consolidating its uptown workforce into a new skyscraper under construction on South Tryon Street. The move will shrink the company’s footprint by 60%.

The accounting firm Grant Thornton has said it’s moving from uptown to South End. It will also use less space — a sign that work from home will continue.

What About Other Modes Of Transportation?

Driving across the nation and in North Carolina is nearly back to pre-pandemic levels.

Steve Harrison Vehicle traffic plunged during the early days of the pandemic but has since bounced back.

During lockdown airlines were hurt even more than transit.

In April 2019 Charlotte Douglas International Airport handled 2.07 million passenger enplanements.

That fell to just under 170000 in April 2020 the first full month of the pandemic.

But a year later it’s almost back to normal despite a steep drop in international service. CLT handled 1.9 million enplanements in April 2021.

That’s the classic “U shaped curve” of a rapid economic recovery.

CATS is experiencing a more gradual comeback — for now it’s looking more like a backwards J.",,,

In an equally tight girls race Dupont Manual claimed the state championship with a 58-53 victory over West Jessamine.

Sweltering heat tested the endurance of every athlete while weather delays tested their patience. St. X led Male by only three points before the deciding 4x400 relay that would decide which would take the team title. As the teams went to their starting blocks thunder rumbled over the track and forced an hour delay before the final event could begin.

Once the storm passed worried that another lightning strike would delay the event again the athletes rushed to their respective starting blocks without much warm-up. St. X’s Trae Burns Nick Brooks Nathen Wacker and Sean Beam ran neck-and-neck with Male’s Nicholas Pearson Jaden Warfield Maikyah Stowe and Myles Sloan. Neither team needed a first place finish in the relay only needing to finish before the other to clinch the team state title.

St. X’s Beam and Male’s Sloan fell behind runners from Marshall County and Owensboro and battled for the third place spot as they entered the final stretch. The two matched each other stride for stride until Beam pulled just far enough ahead to cross the finish line third to claim the state championship for his team.

BOYS

The day-long battle between St. X and Male was foreshadowed in the first boys event of the meet as the teams were the top two finishers in the 4x800 relay.

St. X clinched the relay victory to open the meet as Nate Very Sami Hattab Nick Brooks and Roman Schrader finished in 7:57.81 ahead of Male’s 7:59.50. Hattab strode to the front of the pack as he entered the second exchange and Brooks pulled into the lead ahead of Male’s Myles Sloan before Schrader held on to the lead to claim his team’s victory.

St. X star Anthony Woods leapt up and down on the infield as he watched Brooks take the lead in the 4x800 race. He ran to the edge of the track in between his warm up attempts for the upcoming triple jump and shouted encouragement to Schrader as he entered the final turn to bring home the state title.

Woods served as his team’s hype-man throughout the entire meet cheering his teammates on in every event and competing in four events himself.

“I love them” Woods said. “I'm always on the field. Every meet I'm on the field cheering them on. And I'm talking to them before and after the race I'm congratulating them. I know all their times I know everything. I’m my team’s biggest supporter.”

Woods was the top seed entering the boys triple jump event recording a 48-10 in regionals. He claimed a personal state championship on Saturday with a distance of 48-3.50. In between his fourth and fifth triple jump attempts Woods ran in the 100-meter dash placing third in 10.92 seconds.

Woods also joined St. X’s Noah Royal Varlee Kamara and Kaleb Jones in the 4x100 event clinching the event title as well as 10 team points for the Tigers.

St. X senior Nolan Hester secured his personal state crown and 10 points for his team in the 1600-meter event. He finished with a time of 4:15.22 ahead of Madisonville-North Hopkins’ Jackson Watts (4:17.02).

Male won the 4x200 relay with Jaden Warfield Shan James Tyler Brown and Jaylen Cole finishing in 1:28.03 ahead of Frederick Douglass.

Woods later clinched the long jump state title with a distance of 23-11.25. The St. X senior was top seeded in the event and had the crowd on his side as he took the final long jump attempt of the meet. Fans and athletes alike clapped rhythmically in unison as Woods took his state title winning attempt and leapt up to flex towards the crowd. He clinched 10 points for the Tigers allowing his team to take a three point lead over Male as the final event approached.

Paul Laurence Dunbar's Mario Paul claimed a personal state championship and set an overall state record in the 300-meter hurdles in 36.74 seconds.

Scott County's Bryce Chisley claimed a state title in the 100-meter dash with a time of 10.64 seconds after he pulled ahead of Eastern’s Terrance O’Bannon (10.91) St. X’s Woods (10.92) and Male’s Jaylen Cole (10.92).

DuPont Manual’s Darius Brown grabbed gold in the 110-meter hurdles with a time of 14.05 seconds.

Marshall County claimed the third place spot in the teams standings with 46 points.

GIRLS

West Jessamine led Manual in the teams race as the final event of the meet approached but Manual’s Abigail Bohn Sophia Richter Jessica Secor and Ruby Nwosu were able to secure the 4x400 event title and overtake Jessamine to clinch the team points win.

The girls side of the Class 3A meet saw several class records as Marshall County senior Sophie Galloway broke the class record in the 100-meter hurdles finishing in 14.10 seconds. She later won the long jump title with a distance of 18-10.75 and concluded the meet by breaking her own overall state record in the triple jump with a distance of 41-7.75.

“It's a blessing I've worked so hard my entire life without a track and I finally came to school this year that had one” she said as her eyes welled with tears. “I had to compete. You know this is my fifth track meet all season since I was playing basketball with the school so this is just a big deal for me. I'm very happy and sad it's the last one.""

Pulaski County senior Maddy Dunn secured her own personal state title in the 100-meter dash before anchoring in the 4x200 and 4x100 helping her team secure titles in both relays. Dunn alongside Shelby Colthron Morgan Bruin and Abbee Coomer finished with a time of 1:43.56 in the 4x200 and 48.56 in the 4x100.

“I’m super excited. It’s my senior year and we’ve had a lot of difficulties but we finally just pushed through. All my events have pretty much been back-to-back” she said. “It’s hard but I just have motivation to win because I’ve had a really tough season with back problems so I’m just really excited for my senior year to win these events.”

Assumption’s foursome of Lila Bensenhaver Mattie Whitworth Julia Schmitt and Ellie Meyer captured the 4x800 event title as Whitworth outstrode Dupont Manual’s Mary Dye to give her team the lead entering the second exchange. Assumption finished in 9:29.85 ahead of Manual (9:35.00).

Grant County junior Brooklyn Hammons broke the overall state record in the discus with her mark of 143-9.

Why is this important? Because advanced recycling makes it possible to recover large volumes of plastics that currently go unrecycled and convert them into new products that can be recycled again and again. In this way advanced recycling is harnessing the power of science and technology to help curb waste and propel us toward a more sustainable future. Together with traditional recycling advanced recycling will be key to combatting the plastic waste problem which must continue to be a top priority.

As we approach mid-year I’m happy to report that momentum in advanced recycling is accelerating. Globally recognized corporations and mature recycling enterprises are making significant commitments. States are passing legislation to update their laws so companies are more appropriately regulated in their deployment of advanced recycling technologies. And a first wave of advanced recycling enterprises is achieving third-party validation through international certification.

Here are some recent highlights.

First company commitments. We’re seeing a much greater magnitude of new products plans and ventures (listed in no particular order):

LyondellBasell announced availability of polymers made from plastic waste using advanced recycling.

Amsty and Agylix announced plans to explore development of a jointly owned advanced recycling facility at AmSty’s styrene facility in St. James LA adding to the companies’ existing joint ventures.

Chevron Phillips Chemical (CPChem) signed a long-term agreement with New Hope Energy for its certified renewable chemical feedstocks produced through pyrolysis.

And Chevron Phillips Chemical (CPChem) and Braven have reached a long-term supply agreement whereby Braven will convert mixed difficult-to-recycle plastics into a feedstock for making new circular plastics.

ExxonMobil is partnering with Plastic Energy on an advanced recycling facility in France – expected to be one of Europe’s largest – to convert plastic waste into feedstocks for virgin-quality polymers.

Eastman Chemical Company announced plans to build one of the world’s largest plastic-to-plastic “molecular” advanced recycling facilities at its site in Kingsport TN.

Pyrolysis company Agilyx announced circularity goals to “deliver technology for partners to build new commercial-scale advanced recycling facilities that enable the conversion of at least 1500 tons per day of post-use plastic annually by 2030” and to divert post-use plastic through advanced recycling by 300000 tons by 2025… and 3000000 tons by 2030.

These are some of the latest in a string of commitments that add up to billions of dollars in projects to accelerate our ability to reuse plastics as raw materials in new products. Existing and planned advanced recycling facilities in the United States have the potential to divert at least 7 billion pounds of waste from landfills annually. That’s the weight of 28000 Statues of Liberty.

Next state policies.

Many states have outdated policies that could regulate advanced recycling as “waste disposal” rather than manufacturing. Doing so sends entrepreneurs down the wrong regulatory pathway for siting a facility making it more difficult for companies to invest in new projects which deploy advanced recycling technologies.

Thankfully bipartisan leaders in multiple states (blue red and purple) are responding to a widespread desire to recycle more plastics. To date 13 states (Arkansas is the latest) have passed laws confirming that advanced plastics recycling = manufacturing. These laws will enable greater adoption of advanced recycling help create new jobs and divert post-use plastics away from landfills and into valuable new materials. And several more states are considering similar legislation.

Of course advanced recycling facilities are well-regulated and subject to federal state and local regulations. Research has shown air emissions from advanced recycling facilities were the same or lower than other manufacturing facilities and major institutions like universities hospitals and food producers.

Finally certification.

The International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) System is a leading global certification system (its words) for multiple sustainability issues such as deforestation biodiversity and greenhouse gas emissions.

For example ISCC tracks materials through supply chains to verify sustainability claims. For advanced recycling ISCC physically inspects the operations of advanced recycling operators. And it tracks inputs (used plastics) and outputs (multiple valuable products) throughout the process verifying that materials are recycled.

When an advanced recycling company obtains certification through the ISCC+ process (or a similar certification system) its customers (e.g. brand owners) have confidence that sustainability requirements have been met. Certification systems such as ICSS+ reinforce that the recycled material is just that… and it’s helping drive greater deployment of advanced recycling technologies.

Multiple plastic makers already have received ISCC+ certification related to advanced recycling technologies and the number continues to grow.

So… commitments helpful state policy certification. All good news for advanced recycling and the environment.

More good news? There’s a lot more material available to explain what advanced recycling is and why it’s so important. Here are links to three of my favorite recent videos that help explain advanced recycling:

Izzy showed two dogs both of which she co-owns. On Saturday she took her turn in the ring with French bulldog Jaime.

Her mother Jocelyn Eaton said she was proud of her daughter.

""In French bulldogs she was pulled out for the initial cut which was an honor to be out there with the top dogs"" she said.

Breeder and co-owner Gale Golden posted a Facebook summary of the day praising Izzy's performance:

""Today this young lady checked something BIG off her bucket list. Izzy Eaton showed her juniors dog in the breed ring at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. This is significant because Izzy was showing with world class professionals and world class dogs. Fourteen year old Izzy represented Morgan Manor well bringing her charge to the final cut of eight dogs under respected judge Mr. David Kirkland demonstrating her poise expertise and grace under pressure.""

Golden noted that Izzy is not just a a co-owner in name only but takes an active role in training Jaime.

""Izzy was not handed a finished champion dog trained by a professional. Izzy has worked with him since he was a puppy finishing his championship and then earning a grand championship. She picks him up from us when he is entered cares for him at shows under adult guidance and comes over to bath and groom him too. We couldn’t be prouder of her and believe she will be rocking the ring for many years to come"" Golden posted.

On Sunday it was time for Izzy to show her Great Dane Riddick.

""In Great Danes she was awarded an Award of Merit"" her mother said. ""Awards of Merit are awarded at breed specialties and large prestigious shows. They are given out to dogs the judge feels are the most worthy in the ring behind the breed and select dogs. There were Great Danes in the ring competing from as far away as Costa Rica.

""Izzy had an amazing time showcasing her dogs and spending time with friends she doesn’t get to see too often"" Jocelyn said. ""Cheering on your friends makes the experience that much more fun. It was such an honor to be able to show at the Lyndhurst estate such a change from the downtown city venue but certainly something for the Westminster history books.

""As her mom there is nothing that makes me more proud than seeing her excel at something she truly loves"" Jocelyn said.

The life of a five-year-old autistic boy has been improved thanks to the sight and sound of water bubbling.

A £359 bubble wall funded by a children's disability charity has provided a much-needed calming effect on five-year-old Zac Render of Long Eaton.

Zac who his mum Chrissie Render describes as “a very touchy-feely boy who loves a good snuggle” was diagnosed with autism and global development delay just before his third birthday and is non-verbal.

Chrissie said: “Because he’s non-verbal Zac can find it difficult to communicate which frustrates him.

""He also struggles with changes to his routine or anything that’s unfamiliar which can result in outbursts so his behaviour can be challenging at times.

“Zac’s older sister Lottie is only 7 and doesn’t really understand why he acts out. So trying to keep everyone happy can be hard work.

“We first discovered the calming effect of a bubble wall on a holiday in Tenerife a few years ago.

""He was absolutely mesmerised by a wall of bubble tubes in a restaurant. It had such a soothing effect on him.”

Bubble tubes and bubble walls have been found to help those affected by autism who have difficulty with sensory processing and struggle to tune out unnecessary sensory input.

With its bright light source the sound of the bubbles and even the feel of gentle vibrations a bubble tube or wall can help to provide focus and offers a soothing effect.

Chrissie said: ""When the bubble wall arrived Zac was beside himself with excitement. He was jumping up and down.

“Although he has recently started to use some words he’s usually non-verbal but when we connected the equipment he instantly started shouting out the different colours as they changed – 'blue red green!' I couldn’t believe it as Zac normally relies on PEC cards – picture cards that show items and feelings – to communicate.

“It was so emotional seeing how much he loved it. Now that the initial excitement has worn off it definitely has the desired calming effect we’d hoped for.”

Zac started at Dovedale Primary School in September 2020 and despite his challenges Chrissie says: “He’s doing really well. He was very introverted but he’s started to come out of his shell a bit.”

Chrissie has also created a sensory room for Zac in their outdoor summer house using lights different fabrics and textures like sequins.

Chrissie added: “Initially we intended to put the bubble wall in the summer house but the walls weren’t strong enough so it lives in the kitchen diner which has a sitting area too.

""It’s worked out really well as Zac struggles to sleep and will often wake up multiple times through the night. Now when he gets up he usually gazes at his bubble wall instead of watching TV or playing and it helps to settle him.”

The bubble wall was provided by funding from the Children Today Charitable Trust which specialises in funding adapted equipment – including sensory equipment adapted buggies and car seats – for children and young people with disabilities.

Emma Prescott charity director said: “It’s great to hear that Zac’s bubble wall is helping to keep him calm and soothe him when he’s overwhelmed.

“Sensory overload can be really distressing for children with autism and sadly bubble tubes and other sensory equipment that can help are prohibitively expensive for many families.

""But as you can tell from Zac’s story the effect of such a simple item on both the child and the family as a whole is often profound.”"

It’s difficult (and likely impossible if you’re under 25) to remember how much more complicated buying and selling stuff was before eBay came along.

Just think right now on your desktop or phone you could at the touch of a button buy a charging cable for your iPhone sell your obscure collection of garage band records and find a new owner for your bizarre gullwing door stretch limo Dodge Challenger.

Or even buy a set of Speedline wheels from a rarer than rocking horse poop Ferrari F40 LM. Honestly the amount of rare groove parts available for exotic cars is mind-boggling. Here’s just a taste of what was live at the time of writing.

Ferrari

Here’s a 458 Speciale engine the most expensive Ferrari item listed that isn’t an actual car. The final incarnation of Maranello’s naturally aspirated V8 it made 597 hp and revved to 9000 rpm.

The entire Speciale only cost $298000 when it was new but these days the cars change hands for upwards of $400000 and you’ll need to part with $84980 just to bag this motor. Still $100k all in and you could have the world’s first Speciale-powered Miata.

Moving into the turbocharged era how about a brand new set of carbon fiber wheels? I seem to remember Ferrari wouldn’t even let us try these on the road loop at the press launch because they were so worried we would trash them. If you’ve trashed yours you can pick up this brand new boxed set for $27500.

Sticking with the carbon fiber theme this seller claims to be offering a set of carbon engine bay panels for a Ferrari 812 Superfast (though we’re not sure the car in the picture has them). They can be yours for $13546 and no that doesn’t include the engine. If you want a V12 to go with it you’ll need to throw in another $60k.

It’s not often you read a description for a car part and come across the line “Fits the following models: 250 GT 2+2 250 GT Berlinetta Lusso 250 GTO” like we’re talking about a set of Ford Focus brake pads. But that’s what it says in the listing for this brand new no-longer-available-from-the-factory Ferrari V12 crankshaft. A mere $18256 takes it.

Rolls Royce

For $35000 this haul of Rolls Royce parts provides the bumper hood grille lights and fenders you’d need to put a wrecked Wraith or Dawn back on the street. Or maybe it’s crying out for some nut-job to bolt it onto the front of a Chrysler 300 and really rile those up-tight Brits.

No wonder Rolls-Royce makes those Spirit of Ecstasy mascots retract below the hood line when you try to grab them: a traditional silver winged lady could cost you $3250 and someone’s trying to sell a black one for over $7k.

So you backed your Bentayga into your Cullinan while doing some rearranging of your 24-car garage need a couple of headlights but are too mean to buy new ones from your local dealer? No problem when you’ve got an eBay account. Getting our heads around the $16000 bill for this pair of used LED lamps is definitely presenting a problem however.

It’s a Rolls Royce V12 but not the kind you’re thinking. Incredibly this $12k 27-liter monster is one of two RR Meteor engines built to power military tanks in the last century currently available on eBay.

Bugatti

Yes you can even find parts for a Bugatti on eBay including an entire carbon fiber rear bumper for a Veyron on offer at $14285. The same company (ATD Sportscars) also has a rear fender ($12855) hood ($8650) and front bumper ($7135) in case you really did make a real mess of leaving that car show.

Inserting this second ‘Speed’ key in the Veyron added 40 mph to the Bugatti’s top speed so it must be worth at least an extra 30 mph if you wire it into your Supra’s console right? You can buy it for $5999 and for another $6999.99 you can have the ignition key to go with it.

We’ve owned plenty of actual cars that cost less than this official Bugatti indoor car cover but we guess if you can afford to drop $1 million on a sunny-days supercar you probably wouldn’t think twice about spending $3000 to keep the dust off its pristine paint.

And finally a pair of Veyron’s distinctive engine cover grilles is up for grabs. The seller is asking $1700 for each one. We’re hoping someone buys both and glues them to the back of a Fiero.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvMTk2OC1jaGV2cm9sZXQtY29ydmV0dGUtaGFzLWEtc3Ryb25nLTQyN2NpLWhlYXJ0LWJ1dC1uZWVkcy1hLWdvb2QtYm9keS13b3Jrb3V0LTE2MzAxMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1968 Chevrolet Corvette Has a Strong 427ci Heart but Needs a Good Body Workout,"Born in 1967 and produced until 1982 it’s safe to say that Chevrolet’s C3 Corvette enjoyed a long and meaningful life. That is probably what also happened to this numbers-matching L71/L89 427ci 435-horsepower 1968 Corvette coupe that is now up for grabs at no reserve through an eBay auction.

It has been listed up for grabs through seller advancedautogroupllc a dealer located in Westchester Pennsylvania and according to the description we’re dealing here with a 427ci Corvette sporting no less than 435 horsepower and equipped with either a four- or a five-speed manual transmission. Yes there’s a ""but"" situation right here so that begs the question if any of the information provided in the description has other discrepancies.As far as we can tell this Safari Yellow coupe example has a four-speeder tucked inside. Thus we’re taking the rest of the provided highlights with a pinch of salt and advise anyone interested in buying to inquire about everything in person or other means of direct communication if possible before placing a bid.Still we can’t help but feel a little biased towards the C3 that has only traveled for 44539 miles (71679 km) during its lifetime but still manages to look as if the owner ran one too many equatorial circles around the world with it. As such the exterior is definitely not something to write home about Instead one of the main trump cards for this vehicle has to do with the reworked interior given a new lease of life during a partial restoration that was ultimately abandoned. As such the ‘Vette looks much better when seen from inside so at least part of a future restoration project is already done.In addition the car has a nice L71 V8 engine sporting the L89 aluminum cylinder heads capable of churning out no less than 435 horsepower back in the day. We can easily imagine that a professional nip and tuck could go a long way towards freshening up what’s hidden inside the engine bay.In the end it remains to be seen if this will go above the current highest bid of just $21300 but this is always the peril with a no reserve sale—someone might end up making a way better deal than imagined and it’s not always the seller",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2NoZXZyb2xldC1jb3J2ZXR0ZS1zdGluZ3JheS12cy1wb3JzY2hlLTkxMS1ndDMtcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Auction Dilemma: Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Vs.

EW,Edwards Lifesciences,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jYmouY29tL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUvZWR3YXJkcy1nZXRzLWJvb3N0LWNyaXRpY2FsLWNhcmUtdW5pdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Edwards Gets Boost To Critical Care Unit,"Edwards Lifesciences Corp.’s foray into smart recovery technologies already allowed physicians to foresee when critical care patients are at risk of low blood pressure events.



Now for the first time the technology is applicable to lower-risk surgical patients who don’t require an invasive arterial line to be monitored in hospital settings.



It’s the latest sign of innovation at Orange County’s most valuable public company (NYSE: EW) whose stock last week hit an all-time high at one point pushing its market value over $62 billion for the first time.



The Irvine-based device maker is best known for its heart valves and related products which allow for less-invasive catheter-based heart repair and replacement procedures.



Edwards also has a growing collection of products—catheters monitoring systems and other products primarily used for hemodynamic or blood flow monitoring—that fall within its emerging critical care division.



That division got a boost this month when it received FDA clearance for its Acumen IQ Finger Cuff a device which pairs with its software that predicts low hypotension a condition that can lead to organ damage and death. It’s expected to launch in the U.S. and Europe in the fourth quarter.



The Acumen Hypotension Predictive Index uses machine learning to grade a patient’s likelihood of developing the condition updating the score every 20 seconds and providing continuous predictive insights.



The Acumen HPI algorithm was trained on more than 59000 hypotensive and 144000 non-hypotensive events and has been proven in clinical studies to have a positive predictive value of at least 98%.



The company’s latest predictive technology “demonstrates our commitment to patient care and providing clinicians with ‘smart’ monitoring tools that allow for better prediction and management” said Katie Szyman Edwards’ corporate vice president and general manager of critical care.



Edwards has tripled the size of its R&D team in the last five years and about 40% of those employees are focused on software and artificial intelligence advancements Szyman told the Business Journal last week.

Shifting ‘Smarter’



Acumen IQ cuff is the newest addition to Edwards’ critical care portfolio which is comprised of the HemoSphere monitoring system and various software sensors and catheters used to aid surgical recovery for over 14 million patients each year.



It has an installed base of about 20000 monitoring systems in operating rooms and intensive care units globally and about 25% to 30% of its customers have adopted products from the smart recovery suite.



The 3000-person unit—including about 10% based in Irvine—is increasingly focused on shifting its product mix to smart recovery which advances clinician decision-making and is believed to have the highest growth potential within the expanding critical care division of Edwards.



To that end the company aims to grow smart recovery products from 20% of its portfolio today to about 50% in the next five to seven years Szyman said.



While other companies such as Irvine device maker Masimo Corp. (Nasdaq: MASI) are looking to introduce their monitoring products in home care settings (see story page 1) Edwards is focused on growing within hospitals where about 50% of patients go unmonitored.



“We envision expanding into more operating rooms and general wards for a world where all patients inside hospitals are monitored properly” Szyman said.

Successful Q1



Critical care is the second-smallest reporting unit at Edwards generating about $725.4 million or about 16% of overall sales annually. Revenue dipped 2% in 2020 compared to a year ago amid pandemic-related impacts to its hospital customers.



Edwards companywide reported some $4.4 billion of sales last year with 65% of that from its main heart valve division.



A rebound appears underway for the critical care group which saw sales grow 7% to $196 million in the first quarter ended March 31 the company said citing higher hospital spending amid waning cases of COVID and related hospitalizations.



“We’re seeing recovery in hospital’s capital replacement cycle and we anticipate being on guidance in 2021” Szyman said referring to projections of between 5% to 10% growth for the unit.



First-quarter results exceeded expectations across all company units in April pushing Edwards’ stock to an all-time high of $97.45 and past a $60 billion market cap for the first time.



Shares took another jump last week and approached $100 for the first time.

Real-World Evidence



Clinical trial and follow-up results presented at the EuroPCR conference late last month also demonstrated support for Edwards’ largest and smallest business units: transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies (TMTT).



■ In a real-world registry analysis of over 6000 patients treated with the company’s Sapien 3 TAVR at low surgical risk the all-cause mortality rate for bicuspid valves was low and similar at one year when compared to those with tricuspid valve disease (4.6% versus 6.6%) as were stroke rates at one year (2% versus 2.1%).

Under the project a National Consortium of Oxygen is enabling the national level supply of critical raw materials such as zeolites setting up of small oxygen plants manufacturing compressors final products i.e. oxygen plants concentrators and ventilators the government said. The consortium is not only looking forward to providing immediate to short-term relief but also working to strengthen the manufacturing ecosystem for long-term preparedness the Office of Principal Scientific Adviser said.

A committee of experts has been evaluating critical equipment such as oxygen plants concentrators and ventilators from a pool of India-based manufacturers startups and MSMEs in partnership with FICCI MESA and others. The manufacturing and supply consortium also includes Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL); Tata Consulting Engineers (TCE); C-CAMP Bengaluru; IIT Kanpur (IIT-K); IIT Delhi (IIT-D); IIT Bombay (IIT-B) IIT Hyderabad (IIT-H); IISER Bhopal; Venture Center Pune; and more than 40 MSMEs.

The second wave of covid-19 saw an increase in demand for medical oxygen in different parts of the country. While meeting the current demand manufacturing medical oxygen also became important to ensure India has adequate supply in the future.

The consortium has started to secure CSR/philanthropic grants from organizations like USAID Edwards Life sciences Foundation Climate Works Foundation etc. Hope Foundation American Indian Foundation Walmart Hitachi BNP Paribas and eInfo Chips are procuring oxygen concentrators and VPSA/PSA plants as part of their CSR efforts to aid the consortium’s work. NMDC Ltd has agreed to fund the procurement of raw materials like zeolite for the manufacturers in the consortium.

Apart from oxygen generation the covid-19 cases surged in different parts of the country leaving infrastructure in hospitals under immense pressure. The government is also looking at modular hospitals which are an extension of hospital infrastructure and can be built adjacent to an existing hospital building.

Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser invited private sector companies donor organizations and individuals to support various projects of national importance. Project Extension Hospitals is one such initiative. The office of PSA identified requirements of close to 50 hospitals in states where the highest number of covid-19 cases were reported.

Modulus Housing a startup incubated at Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M) developed the MediCAB hospitals. This enables building a 100-bedded extension facility in 3-weeks’ time. MediCAB hospitals are designed with a dedicated zone of Intensive Care Units (ICUs) that can accommodate various life-support equipment and medical devices. These negative pressure portable hospitals have durability of around 25 years and they can also be shifted in the future for any disaster response in less than a week.

“These rapidly deployable hospitals will plug a major health infrastructure gap in India’s fight against covid-19 especially in rural areas and smaller towns. The O/o PSA has been actively working towards securing CSR support to implement these projects in different areas across the nation"" said the government in a statement.

Modulus Housing has started deploying MediCAB extension hospitals with the help of the American Indian Foundation (AIF). Mastercard Texas Instruments Zscaler PNB Housing Goldman Sachs Lenovo and NASSCOM Foundation have also extended CSR support.

Hackers breached the network of gaming giant Electronic Arts (EA) and claim to have stolen 780 GB of data including game source code and ""related internal tools"" in news first reported by Motherboard.

The publisher of ""Battlefield"" ""FIFA"" and ""The Sims"" told FOX Business that it is ""investigating a recent incident of intrusion into our network where a limited amount of game source code and related tools were stolen…No player data was accessed and we have no reason to believe there is any risk to player privacy.""

EA went on to say that it is working with law enforcement.

""Following the incident we’ve already made security improvements and do not expect an impact on our games or our business. We are actively working with law enforcement officials and other experts as part of this ongoing criminal investigation"" the company said.

Not ransomware but…

The hackers who stole the source code for the game ""FIFA 21"" ""are advertising it for sale in various underground hacking forum posts"" Motherboard reported.

This is a different approach than ransomware where hackers encrypt the data and then demand ransom.

""Interestingly at this time it appears they did not attempt to ransom the data back to EA but instead chose to offer it to the highest bidder"" Erich Kron security awareness advocate at KnowBe4 told FOX Business.

""If this data includes a significant amount of proprietary information it may be valuable to competitors or it may include information or vulnerabilities that could be used in future attacks against EA products or customers with installed EA games"" Kron said.

But Kron wonders why the hackers took this approach.

""Given the demonstrated success that cyber criminals have had with ransomware… I would not have been surprised to see the same extortion tactic attempted against EA"" he said.

""Instead they chose to put the data up for sale…[this] complicates the ordeal by expanding the number of people they would potentially have to negotiate with"" Kron said.

The hack also proves tech-savvy companies like Electronic Arts can be victims of attacks.

""This incident demonstrates the fact that even high-tech organizations are vulnerable to potential data breaches"" Kron said.

And it could get worse.

Hackers have reportedly made away with nearly 1 Terabyte of sensitive data including the source code for the Frostbite engine.

4 Reviews

Just days after the announcement of Battlefield 2042 hackers revealed that they made away with nearly 1 TB of sensitive information from Electronic Arts servers including the source code for FIFA 21 and Battlefield's Frostbite engine.

Electronic Arts clarified that the data breach didn't result in player information being compromised. However this incident comes just months after CD Projekt Red was hit by a hacker attack resulting in REDEngine and Cyberpunk 2077 assets making their way to underground auctions.

According to Motherboard the EA hackers are currently trying to sell the stolen data. Because Player information wasn't apparently compromised the data breach is unlikely to have an immediate impact on Battlefield or FIFA 21 players. However as we saw with the CDPR data breach the real risk here is when malicious actors and competitors get access to the stolen source code and assets.

According to Upguard the global cost of data breaches is expected to hit a remarkable US$6 trillion by the end of the year. With COVID-19 and work-from-home putting many businesses in a vulnerable security position this might not be the last AAA developer data breach we see this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vZ2JoYWNrZXJzLmNvbS9lYS1zcG9ydHMtaGFja2VkL9IBK2h0dHBzOi8vZ2JoYWNrZXJzLmNvbS9lYS1zcG9ydHMtaGFja2VkL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EA Sports Hacked – Hackers Stolen Source Code With 780 GB of Data,"Recently one of the largest video game distributors in the world EA (Electronic Arts) sports has undergone a severe cyberattack. As per the reports a hacker group stole the source code of some video games of EA Sports.

Not only that even hackers also gained access to internal development tools like “Frostbite” it’s the graphics engine that powered the titles like Battlefield 2042 possible.

On several private internet forums the hackers revealed that they have attacked all EA services and managed to gain illicit access to the internal networks of EA Sports. That’s why as a result they have managed to steal over 780 GB of confidential files from Electronic Arts.

The stolen source codes include two widely popular games in the gaming community FIFA 21 and The Sims. Apart from Frostbite the hackers have also claimed that they have also managed to steal the patented works and other internal development tools (SDK) of EA.

While the EA press announced that the users didn’t have to worry about the data leak since this security breach hasn’t affected the user data.

After the discovery of this breach to ensure the users’ security EA has already taken all the necessary security measures and the experts at EA are also working with the law enforcement officials as well to investigate the whole matter.

Hackers steal data worth $28 million

The hackers claimed that they managed to gain access to all the EA data and services worth $28 million. Apart from this they have also pronounced that the buyer will receive the chance to fully abuse all the EA services as a reward.

Here’s the list of all stolen data:-

FrostBite game engine source code and debug tools

FIFA 21 matchmaking server code

FIFA 22 API keys and SDK & debug tools

debug tools SDK and API keys

proprietary EA games frameworks

XBOX and SONY private SDK & API key

XB PS and EA pfx and crt with key

The hackers have already presented their evidence that they fully have the stolen data from EA with them but the hackers have not yet made any hacked source codes and tools public; however they have shown their intention to sell the stolen data.

Moreover EA is not the only gaming company that suffered such cyberattacks as this year last February CD Projekt RED also experienced a ransomware attack that dramatically curtailed its work rate.

Instead it's projecting into the near future with Battlefield 2042 a multiplayer-focused entry that's imagining a future for us that's not particularly bright.

Electronic Arts and DICE gave GameSpot an early look at Battlefield 2042 with a big rundown of some of what we can expect from the game and a chance to check out the game's reveal trailer and gameplay trailer. First and foremost DICE is foregoing a single-player campaign for Battlefield 2042--instead the developer says it's focusing on ""what it does best"" with multiplayer. But that doesn't mean there's no narrative driving the conflict at the heart of the game. Instead it's maybe a little too close to home imagining a world 20 years from now that's been thrown into turmoil by real-world issues like climate change. And it looks like DICE will still find ways to deliver story through its multiplayer gameplay albeit in a new as-yet-unclear way.

Battlefield 2042 puts you in the role of a ""No-Pat"" a person from one of the many countries that has collapsed as climate change worsens resources dwindle and governments fail. No-Pats or non-patriated people have no country of their own with Battlefield 2042 imagining a worldwide refugee crisis creating a whole lot of conflict itself. The No-Pat people come from all walks of life but just as farmers doctors engineers and factory workers are displaced by the global problems so are soldiers--and without a country to fight for they're also searching for a way to make a future in the world.

Thrown on top of this is a war that explodes between the US and Russia. With an influx of No-Pats there suddenly is a huge number of soldiers that each country can recruit and use on the battlefield. So while you might fight for one side or the other you aren't really a citizen of either nation; instead you're fighting in campaigns all over the globe in hopes that you'll be on the winning side and that you'll earn ""a seat at the table"" when hostilities finally end.

So there's what sounds like a fairly deep story setup for Battlefield 2042 despite it being a multiplayer-only game.

""We're really leaning into the thing that we really do best we really do massive battlefields massive multiplayer experiences"" Design director Daniel Berlin said in an interview with GameSpot. ""...But there's still a really important aspect of this and that is the narrative of 2042 and we still aim to really deliver a compelling story as we develop this world.""

""As we go through the live service and each season the first four seasons in year one we will deliver a new specialist"" Berlin said. ""And you will see the world evolve the locations and the world which is pushed forward with narrative and you'll see it through the eyes of the new specialists that we're introducing.""

The specialists Berlin referred to are the No-Pat characters you can play as during multiplayer matches which somewhat replace Battlefield's traditional class system. Those classes like Recon Assault Support and Engineer still exist but they're more like categories into which different specialists fall. DICE showed off four different specialists that you can play as in the game with each carrying a specific trait and gadget that's unique to their particular character.

The four specialists DICE showed were Webster a nimble Assault character who sports a zipline gun for quick repositioning and who can move faster than other characters while aiming; Maria a Support whose teammates get more health when she revives them than if others handle that job and who carries a pistol that can heal and revive allies from a distance; Boris an engineer who can deploy independent turrets but whose trait amps up their capabilities when he stays near them; and Casper a Recon character with a drone he can pilot manually to spot enemies or leave hovering for passive enemy identification and a trait that allows him to sense when enemies are sneaking up on him to make sniping a little less dangerous.

DICE said there will be 10 specialists in the game when Battlefield 2042 launches with four more releasing over the course of its first four seasons. And according to Berlin those fully voiced characters are the way through which you'll experience the game's story. Each one brings a different perspective on what's happening as the game evolves through its live-service offerings.

But while you'll have specific characters with specific items and abilities who fall into general class categories there's still a lot of customization in terms of how you play. In Battlefield 2042 any character can use any weapon or secondary gadget such as grenades--so you're not locked to a certain loadout based on who you pick or what role you decide to fulfill on your team.

Multiplayer is the main thrust of Battlefield 2042 as Berlin explained and DICE is looking to expand the scope of what it has delivered in the past. First and foremost it's doubling the number of players in its largest matches--up to 128 players up from 64 in the past. (It's worth noting though that previous-gen versions of the game will stick with 64-player matches with maps adjusted to accommodate.)

Those big battles will take place in the All-Out Warfare category of modes which is the 2042 evolution of classic big-team modes like Conquest and Breakthrough. The goal in both modes is to capture sectors on a map; in Conquest teams can attack any of the sectors at a time while in Breakthrough one team attacks and tries to capture sectors in sequence while the other team defends.

With more players in All-Out Warfare matches maps are also increasing in size to accommodate. DICE showed several maps that'll be available in the game which vary in size to make for different-sized battles. The largest was Breakaway a map set in Antarctica that includes ice fields bases and locations in between.

During the presentation Berlin said that while maps are huge DICE is thinking about ways to keep the action flowing. Maps are designed around the idea of ""clustering"" pushing you toward locations where you're likely to run into other players and get into different kinds of battles. The maps might be big but Berlin described them as being like several smaller maps stitched together. The clustering idea allows you to zero in on sections of the map that'll offer different kinds of engagements--whether they're tight infantry fights or larger vehicle-based skirmishes.

""We're building these massive massive maps this time around"" Berlin explained. ""So if you just took a classic Battlefield map and a classic size and you just said like yeah we're just going to scale this up almost just take it and you just expand it that doesn't necessarily turn out to be a good gameplay experience. Talking from experience we tested it it didn't really play well. So we lean into this concept of the clustering right? And this is a way for us to control the pacing and really let players choose their own pacing in a sense.""

The customization of your loadout plays into that idea of clustering as well since you'll be moving around the map based on what objectives you want to take and which battles you want to fight. Battlefield 2042 introduces a new interface DICE calls the Plus system which allows you to quickly change the attachments on your weapon on the fly. It gets its name from a holographic interface that spreads out from your gun in the shape of a plus allowing you to quickly swap through all your attachments. So if you're heading into a close battle you can swap for a short-range scope a suppressor and an underbarrel shotgun; if you're headed out into a bigger field you can quickly pop on longer-range attachments so you're ready for what's ahead.

Maps are big but you'll have an easier time getting around them. Players pack a tablet that lets them request air-dropped vehicles to their locations making it possible to get a vehicle much more often in Battlefield 2042--and for vehicles to be more plentiful in a match. Those vehicles have also been made more useful for squads with passenger seats offering more opportunities for shooting spotting enemies and helping your group survive while they travel.

There's something else that DICE is bringing to its maps beyond additional scope more players and more vehicles though. They'll also see some extreme weather events and other elements that can change the battle. The ""levolution"" concept is back with maps such as Orbital which has players fighting over a rocket launchpad potentially changing based on player actions--like causing that rocket launch to fail with catastrophic results. DICE's presentation also included footage of a tornado ripping through an urban area throwing players and vehicles around and creating chaos. Another map set in Qatar called Hourglass includes a massive sandstorm that sweeps through and blots out visibility. DICE showed off seven maps with a range of sizes and features and all of them look as though they'll offer a lot of variety in the fights and situations they create.

Berlin explained that while there's a lot going on with any given map given their sizes vehicles and even weather the clustering approach allows DICE to combine those elements in smart ways. Because players zero in on specific locations on a given map the sandbox elements are forced to work together in specific ways. As Berlin described it DICE is looking to take players on a ""journey through the map"" hitting hotspots where intense and exciting things can happen without it all devolving into chaos.

Battlefield is a multiplayer-focused game but that doesn't mean you'll be forced to play with other people. At least with Conquest and Breakthrough modes (we haven't heard much about what else Battlefield 2042 offers) you'll have the option to play in battles against AI-controlled bots. You'll have both AI-controlled enemies and friendly AI on your side of the battle and it sounds like you'll even be able to bring friends in to join your squad and take on a bot army.

""We are really leaning into the AI for this game I think it's a really important aspect of it"" he explained. ""When we're building this game we really want to lean into when we create a sandbox environment that has all the cutting-edge technology and the tools and everything we want to really push that far. And to be able to give access to that space and give access to that experience to players that don't feel necessarily comfortable in a multiplayer setting I think that's the outlook here. So we've been working with the AI since the start of the project to really make sure that they balance and they play well. But in that regard when you play against the AI we want you to also feel a little bit like you're the hero right?

Berlin also said the single-player mode is a great way for newer players to learn Battlefield's ropes like piloting vehicles and understanding maps.

""It's a great space for new players to just come in and be like hey I'm just going to mess around in a helicopter at my own pace"" he said. ""No one is going to get bothered by me. Or even for someone like myself who plays a s---ton of Battlefield in my spare time in the evenings and stuff I hop in and I just shoot some AI. Because it's just a more relaxed almost a very social environment you can be in with your friends. You'll kick it back and play against some AI. And [a] very important thing here as well is if you play against the AI you still progress in the game.""

There's a lot more information about Battlefield 2042 we still don't know however. DICE is planning to announce more in July during Electronic Arts' EA Play event which includes another portion of its multiplayer experience that's being worked on by DICE LA. It's described as a love-letter to the Battlefield franchise that fans will appreciate--but again we don't really know much about it.

Apart from that DICE mentioned another portion of the experience called Hazard Zone. We didn't get much information on it with DICE only teasing the mode a bit during our presentation explaining that it's squad-focused and completely new to Battlefield--while also emphasizing that it is not battle royale. In fact DICE said there won't be a battle royale mode in the game at launch.

But we do know when Battlefield 2042 will come out: October 22. So expect a lot more information about what the game will be like how its live-game systems will work and what its full multiplayer suite will entail. Battlefield 2042 is slated to release on PlayStation 4 PS5 Xbox One Xbox Series X|S and PC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvcG9yc2NoZS05MTEtZ3QyLXJzLWRyYWctcmFjZXMtcG9yc2NoZS10YXljYW4tdHVyYm8tcy1odW1pbGlhdGlvbi1lbnN1ZXMtMTYzMTUxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Porsche 911 GT2 RS Drag Races Porsche Taycan Turbo S Humiliation Ensues,"kWh

EV

Tested by racing driver Daniel Abt and his buddy Tobias Aberle the GT2 RS and Taycan Turbo S couldn’t be more different under the skin. On the one hand we have a twin-turbocharged boxer with 700 PS (690 horsepower) and 750 Nm (553 pound-feet) on tap a PDK a curb weight of 1470 kilograms (3241 pounds) and a sticker price of €285000 (just around $345000).In the white corner the four-door electric sedan is a little more affordable at €186336 ($225600) and more potent as well at 761 PS (751 horsepower) and 1050 Nm (774 pound-feet) of torque with the overboost function turned on. The zero-emissions challenger is quite a bit heavier as well at 2370 kilograms (5225 pounds) because of the 93.4-battery pack which should give the Neunelfer a significant advantage over the quarter-mile.The first drag race ends in victory for the which crosses the finish line in 10.34 seconds. The internal combustion-engined car makes do with 10.67 seconds but the force-fed mill and the dual-clutch transmission show their worth in the pull from 100 to 200 kilometers per hour (62 and 124 miles per hour). The GT2 RS also hits 273.51 kph (169.95 mph) on the runway while the all-electric interloper is rated from the factory at 162 mph (261 kph).Second time out on the blacktop the Neunelfer launches a little better thanks to warmer tires although the Taycan Turbo S is much quicker off the line. On this occasion the Porsches recorded 10.36 and 10.53 seconds respectively. The GT2 RS eats the electric vehicle’s dust from a 65-kph (40-mph) roll due to a sloppy gearshift but the six-cylinder sports car eventually takes the win.On that note which of these two incredible cars floats your boat the most?"

Today Deary takes readers on a journey to Entergy Park.

We live in a fast-paced world. And I think it would be safe to say that pretty much everybody who is reading this article faces the same dilemma from time to time.

Yep I'm talking about having too many irons in the fire when there simply are not enough hours in the day to get everything done. And of course such times have an adverse effect on our opportunities to get out and enjoy a much-needed stint in the midst of Mother Nature.

Personally I find my time in the outdoors as therapeutic. It's an atmosphere where I can take refuge from the hustles and bustles of everyday life reflect and unwind.

That all being said I feel blessed beyond measure to live in a small town nestled in a beautiful forested setting in lieu of a big city surrounded by towering buildings.

Yep we are fortunate that one does not have to travel far to get a taste of the wonderful outdoors. In fact those residing in Hot Springs do not even have to leave the perimeters of the city limits to experience the beauty of a natural setting. We are privy to several miles of trails winding through beautiful scenery and opportunities galore to enjoy our favorite water activities.

Of course I would far rather be miles from town bushwhacking through the heart of the national forest. However I certainly appreciate these aforementioned outdoor opportunities awaiting at my backdoor. In fact they have been a true blessing during the past few months as I have hardly had time to stray far from home.

When time is of the essence I often sneak a few miles down the road to one of my favorite outdoor destinations situated in the beautiful city that I call home.

Of course Entergy Park's close proximity to my house lends to one of the reasons I often choose it as a destination. However I suppose I would be drawn to this particular spot regardless of where I might reside.

The park is situated in a beautiful setting on the banks of Lake Hamilton. And I truly cannot think of another facility within the perimeters of town that has more to offer.

Of course one can simply sit on a bench take in the fresh air and listen to the soothing sounds of nature. Or the family can take advantage of the picnic area and the playground.

And let's not forget the fishing pond that is located on-site. The small reservoir is stocked on a fairly regular basis. In fact a fella recently shared a photo of an impressive largemouth bass that he coaxed from its waters. One would expect most of the fish in the pond to be on the small side. But this particular fish probably weighed in the neighborhood of 5 pounds and lent to memories that the fella would not soon forget.

Entergy Park also supports a trail system consisting of a series of short interconnecting loops that lends to nearly 3 miles of designated path.

The Water Tower loop is my favorite. The trail winds three-quarters of a mile following natural terrain through a wooded area. Of course hiking is welcomed along all of the trails but this section also lends to a pleasurable bike ride as well.

The Fenceline Trail is accessible via the Water Tower Loop Trail and is yet another section that I always experience from the seat of my mountain bike. This particular half-mile route also makes its way along natural terrain and winds through a peaceful wooded setting.

Of course avid mountain bikers would not find these routes a challenge and would likely grow bored with the ride. But it's a fun ride for those of us who are not as hard-core as are avid biking enthusiasts.

The Fenceline Trail Ties in with the Lakefront Trail lending to even more riding opportunities. In fact I would consider this the most scenic route throughout the entire facility.

The path travels a half-mile while running along a shelf overlooking Lake Hamilton. I have noticed a few wildflowers growing alongside the path during the spring and summer months. And I have actually stopped and watched schools of fish breaking in the bay on a couple of occasions.

I also take in the pavilion on the Point Trail as it makes a short loop to the end of a point and returns to and crosses an impressive bridge spanning a pocket and ties in with the Sunnybrook Connector Trail. A fishing pier is also located alongside the route providing an opportunity for one to try their hand at wetting a hook in Lake Hamilton.

The Sunnybook Trail then ties in with the Eagle Scout Trail which stretches a tenth of a mile before tying in with the playground Connector Trail and returning to the parking area.

A large portion of the route I just covered makes its way along natural terrain. But that's no indication that those with physical limitations will lack opportunities to experience a pleasant stroll through a beautiful setting as well.

The Sunnybrook and Playground Connector trails are both accessible. But there are a couple more routes that are also paved and designed with those who have physical limitations in mind.

The North Loop Trail is paved runs along level terrain and makes a quarter-mile loop prior to returning to the parking lot. This particular path also can be accessed via the Lakefront and Fenceline Trails.

The Wildlife Observation Trail stretches two-tenths of a mile and runs alongside an observation deck overlooking Lake Hamilton. This route can be accessed via both of the parking areas within the facility.

Of course the park can be accessed via road. But a courtesy dock is also located just off of the Sunnybrook Trail lending to an opportunity for boaters to access the premises as well. In fact the dock is designed to accommodate three boats.

A bridge also spans a narrow pocket and leads to the Sunnybrook Landing boat ramp. This is a very popular launching spot and sports ample parking for several trucks and trailers.

But one does not have to be a boat owner to benefit from the landing as an impressive covered pier is located hardly a stone's throw from the launching ramp.

Although unsure of their success I have noticed people fishing from the structure on a consistent basis throughout the warmer months of the year. And I have been known to utilize the covered structure while photographing lightning after dark.

Yep Entergy Park is a real jewel located right here in our backyards. It is a location I have visited many times throughout the past. And I suspect it is a destination where I will continue to return in the future.

To get to Entergy Park from Malvern Avenue turn onto Carpenter Dam Road travel approximately 2 miles and make a right hand turn onto Entergy Park Crossing Road. Travel 100 feet and turn right onto Lake Park Drive. Go 250 feet and the entrance will be on the left.",,,,,,,,,,,,

While there are already ways to put luxurious amenities and electric powertrains in the multi-purpose Sprinter and the V-Class the Mercedes-Benz EQT elevates itself from the two by being solely marketed under the premium segment of the three-pointed star brand. It combines all the sensual appeal and technology found in the luxury cars and SUVs of its maker in the shell of a small van.

Like most Mercedes models the production version of the EQT will likely differ a bit from its concept. That’s because concept vehicles mostly focus on aesthetics over practicality to generate a lot of hype. On the other hand the production version is where the manufacturer tries to establish a balance with its overall features.

Based on its concept TopElectricSUV.com rendered what the EQT production version will most probably look like. The source combines the elements of the prototype with the design of the current EQ cars and SUVs and the Renault Kazoo ZE that shares the same platform as the next-gen Citan.

With that the EQT rendering now adopts the standard door handles radio antenna side mirrors roof rails fender badges wipers headlamps front bumper with a wide air intake and alloy wheels. The output of the graphic artist provides a more accurate look at the showroom spec of the Mercedes-Benz EQT production model when it finally rolls out.",,,,,,,,,,,,

According to a Wall Street Journal report BlackRock – led by billionaire Laurence Fink – is purchasing entire neighborhoods and converting single-family homes into rentals; while in cities like Houston investors like Fink account for one-quarter of the home purchasers.

On ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" Chronicles journalist and associate editor Pedro Gonzalez said that BlackRock's actions are leading 40% of American renters to believe they will never be able to purchase a home.

""Homeownership gives people a stake in a society. It’s a way to build generational wealth. It’s the foundation of the middle-class and part of the American dream"" he said.

Meanwhile ""permanent capital"" like that from firms like Fink's are ""killing the dream and giving us a nightmare of dispossession.""

The impetus for firms to mass-purchase housing is to underwrite pensions and pad their books by spiking housing prices.

But Gonzalez warned that these reckless actions will only accelerate the next housing bubble to burst – as it did a decade ago.

""The same institutions also promote progressive [political] policies like environmental policies that also raise the price of housing – and they push for more immigration like JPMorgan Asset Management"" Gonzalez reported.",,,,,,,,,,,,

“Adut is one of fashion’s biggest and most influential stars. We believe her incredible story personality and beauty will help us continue to inspire and connect with our consumers and establish her as a beauty icon of her generation” Stéphane de la Faverie group president Estée Lauder Companies said in a statement.

Akech will feature in makeup and skincare campaigns across digital in-store TV and print. Her first campaign will begin in July 2021 according to a release.

“Estée Lauder has such an amazing heritage and the story of Mrs. Estée Lauder continues to be an inspiration to women around the world” said Akech of her new ambassadorial role. “I hope to inspire girls everywhere to never give up on following their dreams.”

Born in a refugee camp in South Sudan Akech grew up in Kenya’s Kakuma refugee camp. The role model and change-maker later emigrated to Adelaide Australia. She joined a modeling agency as a student. Her big break came in 2016 when she got the opportunity to work on a global exclusive for Anthony Vaccarello’s debut Yves Saint Laurent show.

Since then she has become one of the fashion industry’s ‘It girls’. Akech has walked across runways modeling for some of fashion’s biggest names such as Alexander McQueen Calvin Klein Miu Miu and Prada. She is a regular face in the spread of luxury magazines worldwide including British Vogue Italian Vogue Vogue Australia Japanese Vogue Vogue Paris i-D and Vogue Korea according to Marie Claire.

The 21-year-old has become a muse for Valentino’s Pierpaolo Piccioli and Chanel’s late Karl Lagerfeld and has had features in campaigns for Chanel Fendi Versace Valentino Marc Jacobs and Saint Laurent as well.

With her unique story of growing up in Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya after fleeing unrest from South Sudan Akech is currently working with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to promote causes that support refugees around the world.

The winner of the coveted Model of the Year honor at The Fashion Awards in 2019 and the 2019 TIME100 Next list honoree has navigated her career in a time where people are now becoming more accepting of dark-skinned models even though she has had her fair share of struggles.

She hopes to use her platform to show little dark-skinned girls that they do not need to dim their lights for others.

“All my hard work has led me to moments like this” Akech said of her new role with Estée Lauder. “Long story short growing up in the western world I didn’t really see a representation of myself in the fashion and beauty world on television or magazines until I got into the fashion industry.”

“To now be the representation in the fashion and beauty space I didn’t have growing up means everything to me. My little sisters will now also see their faces in my beauty ads and campaign billboards. Little black girls in South Sudan Africa and all around the world will now see themselves” Akech shared on Instagram celebrating her endorsement deal with Estée Lauder.",,,,,,
ETSY,Etsy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpbXBsZW1vc3QuY29tL2dlZXMtYmVuZC1xdWlsdHMtc2FsZS1ldHN5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gee's Bend quilts for sale on Etsy,"The iconic quilts designed and hand-sewn by the artists at Gee’s Bend are now for sale on Etsy making it easier than ever to shop for one of these storied works of fiber art.

Though the geometric pattens are unique and almost spontaneous when you spot one of these boldly colorful quilts you likely know exactly where it came from: the rural community of Boykin Alabama where African American women have been handing down this traditional art form through the generations since the 19th century.

The Gee’s Bend quilts for sale come from quilt-makers in Boykin — the location of a cotton plantation owned by Joseph Gee on a big hook in the Alabama River then known as Gee’s Bend. The artists began quilting out of necessity: staying warm in winter. The enslaved women sewed bedcovers from whatever bits of fabric they could pull together. Their daughters and granddaughters and nieces carried the tradition on through Reconstruction and Jim Crow creating quilts from scraps and old clothes that would keep their families warm in shacks without heat or running water. Sewing was a matter of survival.

Fiber artist Arlonzia Pettway shared stories from the history of Gee’s Bend with Smithsonian magazine a few years before her death in 2008. Pettway learned to sew from her mother and grandmother; her great-grandmother Dinah Miller was brought to the U.S. on a slave ship in 1859.

In the early 20th century many Gee’s Bend families were tenant farmers and during the Depression when cotton prices tanked the lender foreclosed on them Pettway said.

“They took everything and left people to die” Pettway told Smithsonian. She said her mother sewed shirttails into a sack so members of her family could gather what produce they could from the farm to hide in a ditch.

When Pettway’s father died in 1941 her mother made a quilt from his clothes.

“Mama said ‘I’m going to take his work clothes shape them into a quilt to remember him and cover up under it for love'” she told Smithsonian.

That gray white blue and red quilt was one of the pieces included in the first exhibition of Gee’s Bend quilts that traveled to art museums around the country in the 2000s when they were finally recognized for the works of art that they are.

Other Gee’s Bend quilts have hung in museums in the meantime including the National Gallery of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art which tweeted an image of a gorgeous quilt made by Annie Bendolph in Gee’s Bend around 1930.

In 2015 the National Endowment for the Arts honored three Gee’s Bend quilters in this lineage — Mary Lee Bendolph Loretta Pettway and Lucy Mingo — with NEA National Heritage Fellowships.

Where To Find Gee’s Bend Quilts For Sale

Though Gee’s Bend quilts have been for sale previously this is the first time they’ve been on Etsy which through partnerships supporting Black artists and handworkers is making them widely accessible to a broader audience.

The Gee’s Bend quilts for sale on Etsy were launched on Feb. 1 the start of Black History Month. At first Etsy featured nine quilters giving a short bio of each woman and showing their work plus a link to their individual Etsy shop. More quilters from Gee’s Bend have since joined them on the site with shops of their own.

The hand-sewn quilts range in price from a few hundred dollars to several thousand.

This floral-patterned 90-by-83-inch quilt by Lue Ida from her Etsy store Quilts By Lue is $3280.

This Gee’s Bend quilt for sale on Etsy at Emma’s Lovely Treasures Emma Pettway’s shop in pretty pink purple and peachy shades is $650.

The quilts come in a range of sizes and some of the artists make other items as well. Sharon Williams’ Etsy shop Sha’s Shop Gee’s Bend has $7000-plus gorgeous hand-stitched quilts as well as colorful $47 tote bags.

This 21-by-20-inch wall hanging quilt from Kristin Pettway’s Etsy shop At The Door Quilts is $300.

By the way you’ve probably noticed that quite a few Gee’s Bend quilters are Pettways. Smithsonian reported that one in three residents of the town of 700 bore that name after slave owner Mark H. Pettway.

As Etsy promised back in February other fiber artists from Gee’s Bend have joined the initial nine they featured including Gee’s Bend Place helmed by Claudia Pettway Charley where she has a quilt for sale made from the back pockets of jeans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9mZW1hbGUtbWFwbWFrZXJzLWRldGFpbGVkLWFycm93aGVhZC1iYWNrLWluLTE5MjkvNjAwMDY3NTgxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Female mapmakers detailed Minnesota's Arrowhead back in 1929,"On a mission to warm up a cinnamon roll Paul Gilje descended the stairs of the Cascade Lodge near Grand Marais on a recent visit to the North Shore of Lake Superior.

""I was using the microwave in the basement when I noticed on the wall partly obscured by the microwave a framed map of the Arrowhead"" said Gilje 84 a retired nonprofit executive who'd made the trek with Judy his wife of 61 years from their home in Apple Valley.

With two dozen panels chronicling the Arrowhead from the ""Age of Stone to the Age of Steel"" the colorful meticulously detailed map is packed with stories of Native American lore French Canadian explorers and some fun facts and sketches.

Below a hard-trudging draft animal the map reads: "" 'Babe' Paul Bunyan's ox runs away. For every footprint a lake — 10000!"" It includes the line that starts ""By the shores of Gitche Gumee"" from Longfellow's ""The Song of Hiawatha."" Duly noted is the 1679 peace conference between Dakota and Ojibwe leaders orchestrated by French-born explorer Daniel Greysolon Sir du Lhut.

Curious to learn more Gilje conferred with lodge owner Thom McAleer who took over the resort in 2017. With an internet search the story quickly emerged.

In 1929 two Hibbing librarians and three schoolteachers researched and created the map which was printed off copper plates as a scholarship fundraiser for the local branch of the American Association of University Women (AAUW). Members financed the project with donations of $10 roughly $154 today.

About 10 years ago the map was scanned reprinted and put up for sale online at Etsy for $20 (tinyurl.com/1929Arrowheadmap). Proceeds still benefit college-age Iron Range women.

""I'm most impressed that a group of young women in Hibbing 92 years ago took the initiative to prepare such a fascinating map"" said Gilje who ordered one along with a pamphlet the women had prepared on regional history.

RareMaps.com a California-based website calls the Arrowhead map ""one of the better pictorials from the Upper Midwest that we have encountered and rare to boot."" The back story behind the five mapmakers is equally fascinating.

Directing the project was Dorothy Hurlbert a Hibbing librarian from 1915 to 1933 who was president of the Minnesota Library Association when the map was made in 1929. A year earlier she had resigned and was quickly reinstated during what the Minneapolis Star called a ""heated controversy"" among library board members over an unsubstantiated charge that she was uncooperative.

Hurlbert is remembered today for more than those squabbles and a cool map. She's widely credited with creating perhaps the nation's first bookmobile in 1919. Hoping to reach book-hungry Iron Range miners and loggers Hurlbert packed 1200 books on a 2-ton 35-horsepower truck chassis that covered 160 square miles.

In its first year the mobile library delivered nearly 50000 volumes. Within a decade it was serving 11 schools 10 rural communities and 16 mining locations.

The 1930 census records Hurlbert as 46 single and living on 4th Avenue in Hibbing with her younger sister Nina and a household ""partner"" fellow librarian Irma Walker. As the map's chief researcher Walker scoured hundreds of books for months.

Hibbing High School art teachers Irene Anderson and Katherine Arnquist provided artwork for the map's border. Nothing could be found on Anderson but Arnquist died in 2001 at age 97 in St. Paul. She graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1926 and married Charles Bane a college psychology and philosophy instructor. Outliving him by 38 years she spent much of her time at Birch Point on Lake Vermilion.

Ethel Stewart president of the Hibbing branch of the AAUW was in charge of the map's printing. Born Ethel Hall in New York in 1879 she moved as a child to St. Paul where her father ran a furniture factory. She attended Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts and married her childhood sweetheart Clarence Stewart an electrical engineer who worked on Iron Range schools and the power plant in Hibbing.

In the 1920s Ethel worked as a substitute teacher in Hibbing spending her leisure time doing historical research. Just after she printed the map Ethel returned to St. Paul where she's credited with preserving the Gibbs Farm as a historical museum — and in the process helped convert St. Anthony Park's historical association into the Ramsey County Historical Society according to historian Steven Trimble's article in a 2012 issue of Ramsey County History magazine (tinyurl.com/EthelHallStewart).

The Arrowhead map ""is really something"" said Barbara Wojciak who coordinates fundraising for the AAUW group in Hibbing. Proceeds from map sales and a massive used-book sale raise about $10000 in annual scholarship funds she said.

""To think those women in 1929 each kicked in $10"" Wojciak said. ""That was pretty exorbitant in those days.""

But lately there's also been a rise in fun and colorful fruit and vegetable decor.

We're not just talking about those fancy Fortnum & Mason cabbage leaf bowls (although we wouldn't say no) or those quirky pineapple table lamps.

We're talking bold and beautiful orange and lemon patterned fabrics and wallpaper mushroom pillows and framed anatomical fruit prints that reflect confident no-holds-barred design choices.

(Image credit: Pooky Nellie lamp in Orange glaze £105 with 45cm straight empire shade in Acid Yellow Jute with Pink lining £68)

Our zest for the bright colors and natural forms of fruit and veg must come down to the newfound lighthearted approach to interiors that we've developed over the last year.

We asked Etsy trend expert Dayna Isom Johnson for her take on the popularity of fruit and vegetable decor. 'Shoppers are increasingly embracing the Friluftsliv trend which offers them a connection to nature and its calming grounding effects' says Dayna.

Friluftstliv (pronounced ""free-loofts-liv"") is closely related to hygge and roughly translates as 'open-air living' in Norwegian. Rather than getting cozy by the fire with candles and blankets Frilufstliv embraces the outdoors.

'Additionally Etsy has seen a 34% increase in searches for citrus decor* as consumers look to brighten up their homes in time for summer' Dayna says. 'This trend is sure to add bold brights by bringing the fresh and vibrant colors of citrus fruits indoors.'

It was then 114 years ago the location of Jenkins’s and Kerr’s wharves. Nearby were the Lacy Iron Foundry the Baltimore Chrome Works and Baltimore Pulverizing Co.

Brady’s coal yard also was close by as was something called Patapsco Storage. Lumber yards filled many streets.

Over the past two years a $117 million mixed-use office and hotel building project has arrived. It’s called Wills Wharf. Any comparison to its once-gritty industrial antecedents is lost. Don’t look for any creosote-soaked wharf pilings and sheds.

A Central Avenue bridge leads into Harbor Point the 27-acre neighborhood that seems to grow on an annual basis office building by office building. Wills Wharf has taken its place among the Exelon headquarters and a Central Avenue neighborhood hub the Whole Foods market in the Liberty Harbor East tower.

Harbor Point sits between Fells Point and Harbor East but bears little resemblance to the diminutive streets of nearby Little Italy or the labyrinth of tiny thoroughfares off South Broadway.

Harbor Point has a corporate ambience of polished steel and aluminum towers. The sidewalks have no out-of-place bricks and there is an overriding sense of precision. It’s spotlessly clean and shows all the engineering work that went into creating a whole new neighborhood literally at the harbor’s edge the very edge.

For sheer magnificence of old Baltimore harbor views this is the place to have an office or apartment.

Wills Wharf brings a hotel too the Canopy by Hilton. Cindy Lou’s Fish House fills a space on the brick promenade that wraps around the contours of the harbor. The restaurant appears well-tailored trim and bearing all the grace notes of contemporary interior design standards. Do not envision a quaint Kent Island crab house.

Other tenants in Wills Wharf include Jellyfish a digital marketing agency Transamerica Ernst & Young and a child care provider Bright Horizons.

Next door is a public space called Wills Park which faces the harbor. You don’t expect the quiet green oasis here between two office buildings. Its landscape designers have trained Virginia creeper and native plants along the perimeters.

It’s a spot to take a breather and sends a message that whoever designed this did not want to fill up every inch with steel and windows.

The spot overlooks Locust Point and the Domino Sugar factory which feel so close you might try (on a good day) swimming over. There’s a water taxi should that impulse strike.

Harbor Point has attracted other corporate Baltimore tenants. T. Rowe Price has signed up for a new headquarters due in 2024 on one of the unbuilt parcels.

The city of Baltimore granted the developer a $107 million subsidy to get the Harbor Point project moving in what had been an old brownfields. The whole project is now in its 11th year.

What is admirable about the new Will’s Wharf component of Harbor Point is the way it fits so hand-in-glove with the rest of this corporate campus.

One minute you are traveling along Harbor East’s Lancaster Street and then via the Central Avenue Bridge you have crossed into this spacious unhurried quiet district surrounded by the Patapsco.

There is no underpraising the majesty of Baltimore’s harbor and the distinctive way it wraps around thoroughfares such as Thames Street and Key Highway.

Harbor Point thanks to a blessing of geography places a visitor in a kind of downtown crow’s nest. Tide Point and the old sugar plant have never looked better. On a humid day you can smell the sweet scent of the sugar cane and the baking bread at the Paterakis bakery a few blocks away.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJuZC5jb20vbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy1nb3Zlcm5tZW50L2FydGljbGUyNTIwNjkyODMuaHRtbNIBQmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmJuZC5jb20vbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy1nb3Zlcm5tZW50L2FydGljbGUyNTIwNjkyODMuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IL lawmakers to vote soon on bill that may close Prairie State other coal plants,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bnd.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Special to USA TODAY

Think back to your first cellphone. Beyond making calls and playing Snake there wasn’t much to do. Today you carry a full-fledged computer everywhere you go.

Of course now we're all on our phones more than ever. Hackers know that and pump out fake apps and clever scams in hopes of infecting your phone. Tap or click for a list of fake apps that mimic real ones. They’re super convincing.

New tech means a lot more storage space too. I'd be surprised if much of yours isn't taken up with photos. You can't replace those precious pictures if your phone bites the dust unexpectedly. Tap or click for the best ways to get them off your phone and into safer storage.

If your storage is full or close to it you can expect a marked slowdown. Here's how to remedy the problem:

Freeing up space on iPhone

If you have a newer iPhone it comes with ample storage space. Still you could eventually get that annoying message that you are approaching the limit – especially if you don’t pay for extra storage.

What’s eating up all your space? Certain apps may be to blame.

Security tip: 6 apps you need to delete from your smartphone now

The Messages app for example keeps copies of attachments like photos videos or content shared with you. If you have a long text thread or group chat full of memes and videos that’s a lot of space gone.

To see what is using the most storage space on your iOS device tap Settings > General. Scroll down and tap on iPhone Storage. A bar will show you the content on your device that’s taking up space. You will also see a list of apps that take up space. The list will be displayed in descending order from most storage used to least.

One trick you might not know about is the simple act of deleting and reinstalling an app.

For example the Facebook app stores tons of information. All you need to do to free up that space is deleting Facebook from your device. Then reinstall it and sign into the app. It will look and function just like before but all that clutter in the background will be gone. Voila!

Next you can clear those bulky attachments from Messages. Open the app and tap on a conversation. Tap on the contact icon and select Info. Scroll down to see the attachments the contact has sent you. Tap See All and select the ones you want to delete. When you’re done tap Delete.

Quick privacy fix: Stop iPhone apps from tracking you

Amazon Sidewalk:Here's how to opt out

Cleaning out attachments on Android

This problem isn't limited to iPhones and depending on how much storage your phone has you might be dealing with the ""storage full"" message more than you like. Even if not cleaning things up will give you a nice performance boost.

First get rid of any apps you’re not using. Start by going to your Settings. Select Apps or Apps and notifications then tap on an app that you want to delete. Just tap Uninstall. (Note: The specific steps may vary depending on what brand of phone you use.)

Next you can tackle all the extra junk files eating up space. There’s a super simple way to do that using the Files app. You may not realize it’s on your phone. This Google app is a file manager that makes it easy to wipe out find and share files.

To get rid of attachments:

• Open the Files app then hit Browse.

• Scroll down and tap Images or Videos.

• There is a bar across the top with different sources. Scroll to the left to find the Messages folder. Tap it.

• From there tap on any images that you want to delete and hit the trash icon. You’ll be asked to confirm your selection by tapping Delete.

You can also clean up temporary app files old screenshots messaging service media and large files through Files. Here’s how:

• Open the Files app then hit Clean at the bottom.

• Scroll through the options here to remove junk files screenshots downloads and more.

• Tap a category and you can delete individual files or select All items.

• Make your selection then confirm to delete.

Use Google Photos? If you’re worried about storage space go in and clean out the junk there too. Tap or click for the steps you need to take.

Google Photos alternatives:Google Photos accounts now have 15GB limit

By most measures stocks have had a good year in 2021 even though the pace of the market's gains has slowed compared to their frantic pace in late 2020.

But there is always room for improvement and Jefferies says its analysts are offering one path forward with their Franchise Picks list of best ideas.

""As of 5/31/21 the Franchise Picks list has outperformed the SPX by ~400 bps on a total return basis"" the firm wrote in a note to clients. The S&P 500 posted a total return of 9.5% over the first five months of the year so that implies a total return of about 13.5% for the Jefferies stocks.

Walt Disney World is home to dozens of hotels and resorts and there are options at all price points. If you’re in need of somewhere budget-friendly but also close to the action with great transportation options look no further than Disney’s Pop Century Resort!

We recently booked a stay at this Value Resort and we took TONS of photos to share with all of you!

So without further ado here’s our full tour of a Standard Room so that you can know exactly what you’re getting before you choose this hotel for your next vacation.

Pop Century Resort Standard Room Tour

For our visit we stayed in a Standard Room. The doors open to the outside located along the shared balconies and walkways of the building. Each room gets a window and you can upgrade to get a Pool View if you’d like.

There are two sets of curtains so you can decide how much light you’d like to let in. Keep in mind that other guests will be walking directly in front of your window throughout the day.

Directly across from the door there’s a coffee station with shelving and a mini-fridge. There’s not a great deal of storage here but it’s enough for a few snacks and drinks.

The mini-fridge has three shelves and a door with a window so you can see what all you have inside without having to open and close it. (There’s also a small luggage stand stored next to the fridge.)

The coffee maker is a small cup-at-a-time model from Cuisinart. Disney provides a few disposable portable coffee cups that you can use in the morning (or whenever you make your coffee!).

There are a few different hot beverage options to choose from with an Artisan Roasted and a Decaf blend both from Joffrey’s. There are also a few packets of Twinings tea some creamers and various sweeteners.

The coffee station is also home to an ice bucket but you’ll have to go fill it up yourself at the ice machine.

Next to the coffee station our room had two cans for disposing of your trash — one for regular trash and the other for recyclables.

As far as the main section of the room goes one bed is traditional while the other is a Murphy bed that folds up into a dining table. There’s also a dresser with a TV mounted on the wall above.

The dresser comes with three drawers and a cabinet and there’s plenty of counter space on top to place your belongings. The TV was automatically playing the park hours and important information when we arrived including details on the day’s weather forecast.

Inside the cabinet you’ll find a few important things. There’s a safe in each room for guests to store their personal belongings. We also found an extra set of linens in ours.

When the Murphy bed is in the upright position there’s more room to move around and there is a small table surface for dining work or storage. The table comes with two chairs so if you have more than two people in your room you’ll have to get creative with your seating arrangement.

All the pillows for both beds were stored on the one regular bed and it was made up with simple white sheets pillowcases and bedspread. There are two floating nightstands on either side of the bed for easy storage.

As part of the recent renovations to the Pop Century rooms we got some new Mickey Mouse artwork! It’s fun and modern and adds just the perfect touch of Disney to the room. Your kids will love it!

There’s also plenty of storage room underneath the bed — a great place to put your suitcases if you’re the kind of person who unpacks them during your trip.

The nightstand in-between the two beds was a little smaller but it was home to the room’s phone as well as the light switches for this side of the room. Also there were two regular outlets and two USB plug-ins which is very useful if you have multiple devices to charge.

The nightstand on the wall side was a little more spacious with a large cubby underneath. This one also had a light switch and four outlets (two regular two USB). We really like how many plugs are in this room!

Now let’s check out the Murphy bed! You’ll want to make sure you move those chairs out of the way first.

It pulls down easily into another bed doubling the number of people who can sleep in the room.

And speaking of fun artwork this space is home to an adorable graphic of a sleeping Pluto. Fans of Mickey and friends are going to love this new design!

Once both beds are down they take up a significant amount of room space so keep in mind that you may want to put the Murphy bed away when getting ready in the morning.

Moving over to the bathroom Disney made sure to fit plenty of storage options in here! One side is home to the sink and a closet area.

There’s an ironing board hanging on the wall and a small cubby with hangers for clothing that’s more delicate.

There are several cubbies spread throughout some with extra towels and toiletries stored inside.

Inside the cabinet we found the hairdryer and the iron.

Connected to the sink room is the rest of the bathroom and it can be closed off for privacy with the sliding door.

The sink is a decent size and there’s a fair amount of counter space on either side. You’ll also find some storage underneath.

As we move into the shower/toilet room there are several towel rods hanging on the wall with towels for the room.

The toilet is located on the opposite wall. This room isn’t very large so you’ll want to be careful when navigating around in here.

The shower has a sliding door instead of a curtain and the glass is frosted.

There are two showerheads inside one that is mounted to the wall and one that can be removed and handheld — easier for washing children.

The toiletries are Disney’s H2O+ brand and they come in refillable bottles mounted to the shower wall. There should be a plastic cover over the pumps to let you know that they’ve been cleaned.

Above the soaps you’ll find a little wall cubby for any additional toiletries that you need. There isn’t a ton of storage in here so you’ll either have to sit your necessities in this cubby or on the shower floor.

The shower floor is flat with a drainage area at the front.

Located elsewhere around the bathroom we found more H2O+ products namely a facial soap. This is the only individually-packaged toiletry item that was in our room.

There was also a magnifying mirror mounted to the wall by the sink. This bathroom is full of amenities!

Extra toilet paper and tissues could be found above the cabinets. The toilet paper is Scott brand while the tissues are Surpass.

And then around the room there were some other features that you’ll likely want to know about. We were given a brochure detailing the cleaning procedures in our room noting that cleaning protocols have been enhanced since the pandemic. Included in this was an individually-packaged TV remote that had been sanitized!

And as we previously noted there are several outlets around this room both regular and USB. In this age of tech you won’t have any problems getting all your devices charged — even with four people in one room!

There’s also a digital thermostat to adjust the temperature of your room. Ours was set at 64 degrees but it’s fairly simple to change.

And the view out of our window gave us a glimpse at the rest of the resort. We didn’t get a room with a special view but we could still see some of the whimsical Pop Century theming all around!

This resort is so colorful and fun! Keep in mind that with this outdoor room setup your resort may be a little louder than if you were staying at a hotel with an indoor hallway.

All in all we really enjoyed our stay at Disney’s Pop Century Resort and we can’t wait to come back! We hope this room tour gave you a better idea of what to expect on your next vacation.

XOM,ExxonMobil,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXRpb25vZmNoYW5nZS5vcmcvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9leHhvbi1pcy10ZWxsaW5nLWludmVzdG9ycy1pdHMtcGVybWlhbi1mcmFja2luZy1wcm9qZWN0cy1hcmUtd29ybGQtY2xhc3MtdGhlLWRhdGEtc2F5cy1vdGhlcndpc2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon is telling investors its Permian fracking projects are ‘world class’. The data says otherwise.,"A new report finds that the productivity of ExxonMobil’s wells in the Permian basin declined in 2019 raising “troubling questions about the quality” of its assets.

ExxonMobil’s production numbers in the Permian basin in West Texas and New Mexico appear to have deteriorated in 2019 according to new analysis calling into question the company’s claims that it is an industry leader and that its operations are steadily becoming more efficient over time.

Chastened by years of poor returns and rising angst among its own shareholders ExxonMobil narrowed its priorities in 2020 to just a few overarching areas of interest focusing on its massive offshore oil discoveries in Guyana and its Permian basin assets two areas positioned as the very core of the company’s growth strategy.

Exxon has long described its Permian holdings as “world class” and the company prides itself on being an industry leader in both size and profitability.

“For our largest resource which is in the Delaware Basin we’re only just about to unleash the hounds” Neil Chapman the head of Exxon’s oil and gas division said at its March 2020 Investor Day conference. The Delaware basin is a subset of the Permian basin stretching across West Texas and southeastern New Mexico.

But while the pandemic and the oil market downturn forced cuts in spending the company’s belief in the Permian and its assurances about its quality remain unshaken.

This is despite ExxonMobil’s wells in the Permian producing less oil on average in 2019 than they did in 2018 according to a new report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). The decline raises “troubling questions about the quality” of those assets the report states and the company’s “ability to sustain the industry-leading production that the company has been touting to investors.”

IEEFA used data from IHS Markit an industry analysis firm the same data that Exxon itself uses in its presentation to investors. The data show that Exxon’s average first-year production per well in the Delaware portion of the Permian basin fell from 635 barrels per day in 2018 to 521 barrels per day in 2019. The slip in performance came as the company drilled twice as many wells over that timeframe.

“[A]s ExxonMobil drilled more Delaware Basin wells the performance of its wells deteriorated year-over-year both absolutely and in comparison with peers” IEEFA analysts Clark Williams-Derry and Tom Sanzillo wrote in their report. Data for 2020 is not complete but so far the numbers suggest a further deterioration.

Over in the Midland basin an oil-rich area in West Texas Exxon was much more active drilling over 630 wells between 2016 and 2020 the third most of any company in the region over that period. But its performance was even worse compared to its peers with the oil major ranking eighth in per-well production out of the top 20.

ExxonMobil’s rankings in per-well production in the Delaware and Midland basins take another dip once the length of the well is taken into account. Over the past decade the industry has steadily increased the horizontal length of each well as longer wells tend to produce more oil. When the IEEFA analysts adjusted Exxon’s numbers to look at production per 1000 feet of length – a common industry metric to compare apples to apples – Exxon’s ranking in the Midland basin fell from eighth to 12th.

The “middling” performance as IEEFA described it stands in stark contrast to rhetoric from the company about how it sits at the very top of the industry and continues to strengthen its position and achieve efficiencies.

In their annual investor presentation in 2020 the company said it had the best per-well performance out of all companies operating in the Delaware basin. In 2021 they single-out their “industry-leading performance at Poker Lake” a large drilling project in New Mexico.

But the same chart shows their ranking in per-well production fall behind other companies a quiet admission that suggested something was amiss. Still an accompanying chart claims average production improving in each year between 2018 and 2020.

“They say ‘we’re getting better every year.’ And yet their first-year production is falling. It makes no sense” Clark Williams-Derry told DeSmog. “Something doesn’t add up.”

The spin around the company’s Permian production is not isolated to PowerPoint slides. Constant and steady improvement is how the company consistently frames its operations in the Permian.

“What we’re seeing in the Permian … is the progress at the improvements that that business is making” ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told investors and analysts on an earnings call in March 2021. He added that the company’s performance was “impressive” and that “we would see significant improvements with time.” Three months earlier Woods told investors that the “value proposition continues to grow” for its Permian basin assets.

Williams-Derry said that the middling drilling performance would not raise as much alarm if the company was leading the industry on costs and profitability – as Exxon routinely claims to be. If the company was producing a modest amount of oil but making a ton of money on it investors would likely be pleased.

But Exxon has produced a decade of poor returns for its U.S. upstream unit which has lost a combined $10.5 billion since 2014 dragging down company-wide earnings. The Permian is considered its crown jewel out of its U.S. holdings.

“If Exxon is blowing smoke there must be fire somewhere. They are kind of blowing smoke about this. It raises questions – is there a fire? We don’t know” Williams-Derry said. The company does not delineate earnings by particular projects that would allow for a clear look at how its Permian wells perform financially. Instead it provides headline earnings numbers for the whole enterprise.

In February DeSmog reported that a former ExxonMobil employee-turned-whistleblower filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging that Exxon was overvaluing its assets by roughly $41 billion at the end of 2020. And in January the Wall Street Journal reported that a separate whistleblower filed a complaint last year alleging that Exxon was overvaluing its Permian assets specifically.

ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.

The production missteps and the seeming obfuscation said Williams-Derry “calls for greater transparency and greater scrutiny from a more active and more engaged board that’s not just a rubber stamp for the management that has been actively failing its investors for more than a decade.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWVyaWNhbmNoZW1pc3RyeS5jb20vY2hlbWlzdHJ5LWluLWFtZXJpY2EvbmV3cy10cmVuZHMvYmxvZy1wb3N0LzIwMjEvYWR2YW5jZWQtcmVjeWNsaW5nLWlzLXByb3BlbGxpbmctdGhlLXVzLWVjb25vbXktdG93YXJkLWEtc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtZnV0dXJlLWJ5LWN1cmJpbmctcGxhc3RpYy13YXN0ZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Advanced Recycling is Propelling the U.S. Economy toward a Sustainable Future by Curbing Plastic Waste,"Earlier this year a colleague predicted that “2021 will mark a significant turning point for advanced plastics recycling” citing multiple announcements from some of the biggest names in plastics.

Why is this important? Because advanced recycling makes it possible to recover large volumes of plastics that currently go unrecycled and convert them into new products that can be recycled again and again. In this way advanced recycling is harnessing the power of science and technology to help curb waste and propel us toward a more sustainable future. Together with traditional recycling advanced recycling will be key to combatting the plastic waste problem which must continue to be a top priority.

As we approach mid-year I’m happy to report that momentum in advanced recycling is accelerating. Globally recognized corporations and mature recycling enterprises are making significant commitments. States are passing legislation to update their laws so companies are more appropriately regulated in their deployment of advanced recycling technologies. And a first wave of advanced recycling enterprises is achieving third-party validation through international certification.

Here are some recent highlights.

First company commitments. We’re seeing a much greater magnitude of new products plans and ventures (listed in no particular order):

LyondellBasell announced availability of polymers made from plastic waste using advanced recycling.

Amsty and Agylix announced plans to explore development of a jointly owned advanced recycling facility at AmSty’s styrene facility in St. James LA adding to the companies’ existing joint ventures.

Chevron Phillips Chemical (CPChem) signed a long-term agreement with New Hope Energy for its certified renewable chemical feedstocks produced through pyrolysis.

And Chevron Phillips Chemical (CPChem) and Braven have reached a long-term supply agreement whereby Braven will convert mixed difficult-to-recycle plastics into a feedstock for making new circular plastics.

ExxonMobil is partnering with Plastic Energy on an advanced recycling facility in France – expected to be one of Europe’s largest – to convert plastic waste into feedstocks for virgin-quality polymers.

Eastman Chemical Company announced plans to build one of the world’s largest plastic-to-plastic “molecular” advanced recycling facilities at its site in Kingsport TN.

Pyrolysis company Agilyx announced circularity goals to “deliver technology for partners to build new commercial-scale advanced recycling facilities that enable the conversion of at least 1500 tons per day of post-use plastic annually by 2030” and to divert post-use plastic through advanced recycling by 300000 tons by 2025… and 3000000 tons by 2030.

These are some of the latest in a string of commitments that add up to billions of dollars in projects to accelerate our ability to reuse plastics as raw materials in new products. Existing and planned advanced recycling facilities in the United States have the potential to divert at least 7 billion pounds of waste from landfills annually. That’s the weight of 28000 Statues of Liberty.

Next state policies.

Many states have outdated policies that could regulate advanced recycling as “waste disposal” rather than manufacturing. Doing so sends entrepreneurs down the wrong regulatory pathway for siting a facility making it more difficult for companies to invest in new projects which deploy advanced recycling technologies.

Thankfully bipartisan leaders in multiple states (blue red and purple) are responding to a widespread desire to recycle more plastics. To date 13 states (Arkansas is the latest) have passed laws confirming that advanced plastics recycling = manufacturing. These laws will enable greater adoption of advanced recycling help create new jobs and divert post-use plastics away from landfills and into valuable new materials. And several more states are considering similar legislation.

Of course advanced recycling facilities are well-regulated and subject to federal state and local regulations. Research has shown air emissions from advanced recycling facilities were the same or lower than other manufacturing facilities and major institutions like universities hospitals and food producers.

Finally certification.

The International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) System is a leading global certification system (its words) for multiple sustainability issues such as deforestation biodiversity and greenhouse gas emissions.

For example ISCC tracks materials through supply chains to verify sustainability claims. For advanced recycling ISCC physically inspects the operations of advanced recycling operators. And it tracks inputs (used plastics) and outputs (multiple valuable products) throughout the process verifying that materials are recycled.

When an advanced recycling company obtains certification through the ISCC+ process (or a similar certification system) its customers (e.g. brand owners) have confidence that sustainability requirements have been met. Certification systems such as ICSS+ reinforce that the recycled material is just that… and it’s helping drive greater deployment of advanced recycling technologies.

Multiple plastic makers already have received ISCC+ certification related to advanced recycling technologies and the number continues to grow.

So… commitments helpful state policy certification. All good news for advanced recycling and the environment.

More good news? There’s a lot more material available to explain what advanced recycling is and why it’s so important. Here are links to three of my favorite recent videos that help explain advanced recycling:

The heavy trucking division of FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) began notifying select manufacturers retailers and logistics companies on Friday that it will stop picking up their goods as of Monday leaving them virtually no time to make alternative shipping arrangements. Other LTL carriers are also operating at maximum capacity and may not be able to absorb more freight in the near-term.

“Starting June 14 2021 and until further notice FedEx Freight will begin implementing customer specific actions to control capacity and avoid backlogs in the most capacity constrained freight service centers” the company told Trividia Health a medical device manufacture in Fort Lauderdale Florida in a suspension notice that was obtained by FreightWaves.

A top executive and consultant with years of LTL experience speaking on condition of anonymity told FreightWaves that FedEx Freight is suspending outbound shipping to thousands of facilities operated by 1400 customers in regions experiencing the most congestion.

Other companies on the termination list include Invacare Corp. a maker of medical equipment based in Elyria Ohio; Sports South a firearms and ammunition distributor in Shreveport Louisiana; and Airgas a supplier of medical and industrial gases as well as welding equipment supplies and safety products headquartered in Radnor Township Pennsylvania.

Messages were left with each of the companies but none responded by press time.

North America’s largest LTL carrier by revenue confirmed it was paring customer rolls because it has more freight than it can handle but didn’t say how many companies were involved.

“FedEx continues to keep commerce moving and deliver critical shipments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the virus has generated elevated volumes and we continue to experience high demand for capacity and increased operating costs across our network” FedEx spokesperson Jim Masilak said in a statement to FreightWaves. “As a result . . . FedEx Freight will begin implementing certain volume control actions to help balance capacity with demand” in areas with the highest shipping density.





The decision appears to impact Economy and Priority shipments but FedEx likely is focusing on the latter because they are more difficult to service and more costly.

It’s common for trucking companies to cull accounts that represent less profit or make trucks wait for loads to restore network fluidity during busy periods but the FedEx move stands out for being applied with extremely short notice — less than one business day — heading into a weekend.

“Shipper memories are like elephant memories. People don’t forget” the source who has seen the lFedEx list said. “You’re setting yourself up for future angst. All it takes is a seven-day notice not a 24-hour notice.”

For shippers getting the sudden news “it’s mass panic because there’s no available capacity to service them to begin with” the executive said. As shipments pile up it will become more difficult to manage work flows in distribution centers and truck yards.

Weeding out customers follows last week’s public announcement that FedEx Freight is adding a new surcharge to high-density areas something parcel carriers frequently do to deal with volume issues.

Peak LTL

A flood of industrial and retail shipments is inundating less-than-truckload networks.

With LTL customers only pay for the space that their freight takes up compared to truckload in which they are responsible for the entire trailer regardless of how much is shipped. Freight is picked up and taken to a local terminal where it is mixed and put on another truck heading towards the final destination often stopping at multiple terminals until it reaches the final hub which puts it on a local truck for final delivery.





Both LTL and truckload companies have been operating at near-peak season levels since last summer. Analysts see no relief in sight with companies still working to restock depleted inventories robust manufacturing growth strong home sales leading people to purchase goods for their new living spaces and a spike in consumer savings that means more room to spend on products as COVID restrictions dissipate and the economy reopens.

There hasn’t been a new asset-based LTL carrier since 1984 because the large amount of infrastructure needed is a barrier to entry. With little new capacity in the market LTL carriers are experiencing their best pricing environment in more than 20 years.

Old Dominion (NASDAQ: ODFL) for example said year-over-year tonnage increased 31% and 28% in the first two months of the second quarter respectively with May revenue per day up 47.6%. Yield was up 15.3%.

ArcBest (NASDAQ: ARCB) reported the increase in yield between April and May and sequential revenue growth was its best in 10 years driven by higher prices. Tonnage jumped 29% and 21% each of the previous two months. Saia (NASDAQ: SAIA) said tonnage per day was up 30.5% in April and 22.5% in May.

“I’ve never seen the LTL networks in general like they are today. Never. Not even one-time spikes” the consultant said.

With so much volume crossing their docks LTL carriers have become increasingly selective in accepting business to make sure they can maintain service levels. The pruning typically occurs on imbalanced traffic lanes where shipments tend to move in one direction with little booked on the return leg. Running empty significantly increases the cost of operating a round trip.

Savvy carriers typically use price hikes to rid themselves of unfavorable accounts which gives customers more time to find alternative transport providers.

FedEx is reacting abruptly because of the intense volume pressure and to catch up with peers that were quicker to make strategic pricing changes to improve yield the industry source suggested.

The volume controls are similar to the shipping caps parcel carriers placed on certain retailers during the holiday shopping season to help manage flow and prevent network jams. The allocations were intended to force shippers to do a better job planning demand rather than dumping extra packages in the system at the last minute.

“That’s a reasonable strategic program. This program is the same thing at the barrel of a shotgun” the consultant said.

Delivering for good means standing in solidarity with our communities in India and FedEx is proud to be part of this relief effort.’’

FedEx is also a member of the Global Task Force on Pandemic Response a public-private partnership organized by the US Chamber of Commerce and supported by the Business Roundtable. It provides a unified platform for businesses to mobilize and deliver resources to assist Covid-19 efforts in areas of the highest need around the world. FedEx President and COO Raj Subramaniam is one of the business leaders serving on the steering committee for the task force.

Since the start of the pandemic FedEx has transported more than 90 tonnes of personal protective equipment including more than 2.3 billion masks worldwide. FedEx will continue to deliver lifesaving medicine personal protective equipment and other critical supplies until this pandemic is over.

The delivery of the lifesaving supplies is consistent with the company’s FedEx Cares 50 by 50 goal to positively impact 50 million people around the world by the company’s 50th anniversary in 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9uYXNodmlsbGUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA2LzEzL2FtYXpvbi1sZWJhbm9uLXNwZWVkd2F5LWluZHVzdHJpYWwtcGFyay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon.com Inc. snags second distribution building next to Nashville Superspeedway - Nashville Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2021/06/13/amazon-lebanon-speedway-industrial-park.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9uYXNodmlsbGUvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA2LzEzL2FtYXpvbi1sZWJhbm9uLXNwZWVkd2F5LWluZHVzdHJpYWwtcGFyay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGx0b2RheS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9pbGxpbm9pcy9jb3VydC10by1kZWNpZGUtZmF0ZS1vZi1kb2dzLXRoYXQtc2V2ZXJlbHktaW5qdXJlZC1zdC1sb3Vpcy1mZWRleC1kcml2ZXIvYXJ0aWNsZV81Zjc5YTRjMi1lZDZiLTVhODYtOTNiYS1jOThiMGViYjllOWMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Court to decide fate of dogs that severely injured St. Louis FedEx driver,"An Illinois judge on Tuesday is expected to decide the fate of two American Bulldogs that severely injured a FedEx driver from St. Louis an Illinois sheriff said.

The driver Paul Gmoser was bitten on the arms legs and torso and was so severely injured he had to be flown by helicopter to a hospital in St. Louis Calhoun County Sheriff William Heffington said Saturday.

“Pretty much most of his limbs were seriously injured” he said.

Gmoser’s brother Michael Gmoser told The Riverbender that his brother’s hand and wrist had to be amputated.

Michael Gmoser set up a GoFundMe for his brother Friday and was more than halfway to the $10000 goal Saturday. “He has a long road ahead of him” Michael Gmoser said on the GoFundMe page.

The attack happened June 4 at a home in Kampsville Illinois about 80 miles northwest of St. Louis.

Heffington said the homeowners were away at the time and the dogs were somehow able to open a porch door perhaps by hitting the screen door’s push button with their paws.

The owners came home to find the injured driver and called for help.

The dogs are currently “detained” at the home as no veterinary clinics would take them the sheriff said.

He said the dogs have no history of violence and have been “out and about” before including to The Pavilion an open-air restaurant in Kampsville on the Illinois River.

“I know there have been FedEx drivers there before and neighbors have been there” he said adding that the driver was new.

John Haus let it rip on the run between the legs of Nick Marrocco one minute into overtime to secure the 15-14 victory and the Whipsnakes’ tenth consecutive win.

“We always love John Haus with a shorty on him” Jim Stagnitta said. “He came through for us.”

Reece Eddy intercepted a Whipsnakes pass that led to a smooth downfield transition finding Andrew Kew alone on the lower left wing. Kew slung it between the legs of Kyle Bernlohr to equalize the score at 14 with 46 seconds left to play.

Zed Williams then countered with a strong top-right shot that Marrocco saved. Bernlohr responded with a Thompson-back-hand save to send the game into overtime. Both goalies felt the ice in their veins. Marrocco came up with 16 saves and Bernlohr 21.

The Whipsnakes’ last loss was in 2019.

Michael Ehrhardt credits the Whipsnakes success to trust.

“The biggest thing for us is trust” Ehrhardt said. “We trust each other and we got a great faceoff guy best in the league in Joe Nardella. We trust that he's going to get the ball along with our wing play. God forbid we lose it; we have a great defense that we trust.”

After a slow start the Whipsnakes went on an 8-1 run and owned the first half.

“We trust each other” Joe Nardella said. “Everyone’s competing for every ground ball. We’re going to back up shots. It’s those details that build that trust.”

Drew Simoneau came out the gate with two faceoff wins and momentum for the Cannons which unloaded the same number of shots (15) on Kyle Bernlohr in the first half than he saw in all of Week 1. A scrappy rebound-goal from Jay Carlson to equalize the game at 2 would light a match under the Whipsnakes the Cannons couldn’t put out.

The Cannons didn’t make it easy on themselves either. The Boom Squad served four penalties in a half of undisciplined defense and were out-scrapped on groundballs. Thompson was quiet and Andrew Kew missed an empty-net shot with minutes left in the half that could’ve brought the game within two possessions.

In the second half that all changed.

“We went into the locker room and these guys set the score to 0-0 going into the second half” Cannons LC head coach Sean Quirk said. “The biggest thing was just playing with a lot more consistency and a little more composure on both sides of the ball.”

The Cannons came up with rebounds and fought for the ground balls.

“We did a better job cleaning up defense in the second half” Quirk said. “The game plan going into it was to play great team defense a lot of communication and win one-on-one matchups.”

The third quarter was dominated by offense. Paul Rabil and Lyle Thompson put in one apiece to close the gap 8-6. Zed Williams then responded with two of his own in eight seconds to claw it open to 10-6.

Ryan Drenner trickled it in for his second lefty goal of the game and Thompson ripped it mid-shelf to bring the game back within two. Then again to bring the Cannons within one. Thompson scored three goals in the third and four goals on the day. Drenner added a hat trick.

The second half was a back-and-forth matchup. Williams responded – again – with two back-to-back goals before Deemer Class ripped a two-bomb to make it 13-12. Williams responded – again again – with a top-shelf rip to open it back up at 14-12. Stephen Rehfuss brought it within one.

The Whipsnakes had six players put one in net and the Cannons five.

Rabil finished with two goals and one assist.

“Paul [Rabil] is playing at the top of his game right now” Ehrhardt said. “He’s a menace on the field and a tough cover and obviously you got Lyle [Thompson] down there. Our defense stuck with it and Kyle [Bernlohr] made some great saves and we trusted each other.”

It was a hard-fought battle but the Whipsnakes stay on top.

“For us not that it’s easy but it’s familiar territory” Nardella said. “We’ve been in some stressful situations with this group before and we’ve come through.”

Despite the Cannons’ loss two-time Super Bowl champion Chris Hogan is excited for the future with his new franchise. In his Premier League Lacrosse debut Hogan wrote “Undrafted” on his gloves: A reminder of how he got to both the NFL and PLL.

“I've been looking forward to this opportunity to be out there and trying to compete and help our team try to find a way to win games” Hogan said. “There’s not one guy in that locker room holding his head down. We held our heads high walking off that field. We fought until the last second.”

The Whipsnakes look to continue the victory tour on June 25 against Atlas.

Los Alamos N.M. June 10 2021 - For the first time the boundary of the heliosphere has been mapped giving scientists a better understanding of how solar and interstellar winds interact.

Video link: https://youtu.be/w__vzNXSFoI

""Physics models have theorized this boundary for years"" said Dan Reisenfeld a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and lead author on the paper which was published in the Astrophysical Journal today. ""But this is the first time we've actually been able to measure it and make a three-dimensional map of it.""

The heliosphere is a bubble created by the solar wind a stream of mostly protons electrons and alpha particles that extends from the Sun into interstellar space and protects the Earth from harmful interstellar radiation.

Reisenfeld and a team of other scientists used data from NASA's Earth-orbiting Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) satellite which detects particles that come from the heliosheath the boundary layer between the solar system and interstellar space. The team was able to map the edge of this zone -- a region called the heliopause. Here the solar wind which pushes out toward interstellar space collides with the interstellar wind which pushes in towards the Sun.

To do this measurement they used a technique similar to how bats use sonar. ""Just as bats send out sonar pulses in every direction and use the return signal to create a mental map of their surroundings we used the Sun's solar wind which goes out in all directions to create a map of the heliosphere"" said Reisenfeld.

They did this by using IBEX satellite's measurement of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) that result from collisions between solar wind particles and those from the interstellar wind. The intensity of that signal depends on the intensity of the solar wind that strikes the heliosheath. When a wave hits the sheath the ENA count goes up and IBEX can detect it.

""The solar wind 'signal' sent out by the Sun varies in strength forming a unique pattern"" explained Reisenfeld. ""IBEX will see that same pattern in the returning ENA signal two to six years later depending on ENA energy and the direction IBEX is looking through the heliosphere. This time difference is how we found the distance to the ENA-source region in a particular direction.""

They then applied this method to build the three-dimensional map using data collected over a complete solar cycle from 2009 through 2019.

""In doing this we are able to see the boundary of the heliosphere in the same way a bat uses sonar to 'see' the walls of a cave"" he added.

The reason it takes so long for the signal to return to IBEX is because of the vast distances involved. Distances in the solar system are measured in astronomical units (AU) where 1 AU is the distance from the Earth to the Sun. Reisenfeld's map shows that the minimum distance from the Sun to the heliopause is about 120 AU in the direction facing the interstellar wind and in the opposite direction it extends at least 350 AU which is the distance limit of the sounding technique. For reference the orbit of Neptune is about 60 AU across.

Shanghai Electric announced positive results of the first molten salt tank hydro test for the Parabolic Trough Plant-II which forms part of the 1GW Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai. The test was carried out on May 9 and its success laid a crucial foundation for the next phase of the molten salt system commission. The test was followed by finalized molten salt pipeline installation inside the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) tower marking another key milestone in construction progress.

The fourth phase of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park is the largest single-site Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) project in the world which uses world-leading hybrid solar energy technologies to generate 950MW of clean energy including a 100 MW CSP tower plant three 200 MW parabolic trough CSP plants and 250 MW of photovoltaic (PV) capacity.

The solar tower standing 260m-high at the center of the CSP tower plant site will also be the world’s tallest structure of its kind. Upon completion the combined thermal energy storage of the solar tower and parabolic trough plants will allow for 24/7 energy availability with each parabolic trough CSP plant possessing an energy storage capacity of 13.5 hours and the tower boasting up to 15 hours.

Nitrate the heat storage medium for the Parabolic Trough Plant-II is stored in eight tanks with each one measuring 45 meters in diameter and 25000 cubic meters in capacity. The harsh desert environment presented a massive challenge to the test and labor shortages during Ramadan added another layer of uncertainty to overall progress. The test was eventually completed on time with the help of water trucks which transported and unloaded the water to provisional water tanks through which the water was pumped into the molten salt tanks.

“I extend my appreciation to all the on-site workers for their dedication and hard work to ensure the test was completed at speed and on time despite the tremendous difficulties caused by a labor shortage and local high-temperatures” said Zhao Hui Project Manager of Dubai CSP Project of Shanghai Electric Power Generation Engineering Co.

“Their outstanding performance also guaranteed the smooth progress of the CSP central tower pipeline installation which is the core and one of the most important parts of the structure. The space in the tower is extremely small given the total length of the central tower internal pipes is over 500 meters. To make sure the work could be done on time the project team formulated well-thought-out installation plans and overcame all unseen problems without causing any delay” he added.

The molten salt tank system is the answer to the challenges of thermal energy storage. Thermal energy storage realized by molten salt systems enables power generation on cloudy days or long night after sunset with high operating efficiency and low capital costs per kilowatt-hour. During the daytime the molten salt is circulated to a heat exchanger from a cold tank to absorb heat from the high-temperature oil. The heated molten salt can then be stored in an insulated hot tank which can later send the liquid to power steam turbines at night or during unfavourable weather conditions.

In 2018 Shanghai Electric was appointed as Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor for the fourth phase of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai after signing the agreement with DEWA (Dubai Electricity and Water Authority) and ACWA Power to undertake both the 700 MW CSP and 250 MW PV projects. Financed by China’s Silk Fund and ACWA it is a landmark project of China’s Belt and Road Initiative as well as a significant milestone of Shanghai Electric in participating in renewable energy utility construction in the Middle East and its shift of focus from coal-fired energy to renewables.

In 2021 Shanghai Electric ranks 17th in the list of top 100 international contractors 5th in the field of electric power engineering according to the latest evaluation released by the China International Contractors Association. In addition the Company has also been granted “A-level international contractor” the highest rating by the association.

Chris Saucedo/Getty Images for SXSW

Elon Musk said Tesla would accept Bitcoin payments again once ""mining"" uses 50% renewable energy.

Validating Bitcoin transactions requires lots of computers to use vast amounts of energy.

Tesla started accepting Bitcoin in March then stopped in May citing environmental concerns.

Tesla will resume accepting bitcoin payments for its cars once miners of the cryptocurrency can show they are using roughly 50% clean energy CEO Elon Musk said in a tweet on Sunday.

""When there's confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions"" he said. This is the first time Musk has detailed the conditions where the company would start accepting Bitcoin again.

Musk announced in March that Tesla would accept payment in Bitcoin then reversed this position in May when he said the company would no longer accept Bitcoin because is was too environmentally costly to mine the cryptocurrency. He said at the time that Tesla intended to use Bitcoin again in future ""as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy.""

Musk's Sunday tweet caused the price of Bitcoin to jump to almost $40000. His tweet was a response to a Cointelegraph article that contained quotes from Magda Wierzycka the CEO of asset manager Sygnia. Wierzycka said Musk had deliberately pumped up the price of Bitcoin so Tesla could sell off a big chunk of it. Musk disputed this.

""This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market"" Musk said. He said in April that Tesla had sold 10% of its Bitcoin holdings to prove it was a viable alternative to cash.

The electric-car maker bought $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in February.

Bitcoin uses a ""proof of work"" computing process to validate transactions on its blockchain which requires lots of computers to use vast amounts of energy. Estimates on how much renewable energy Bitcoin miners use to power their computers vary widely but according to Cambridge University 65% of Bitcoin mining takes place in China where coal is the most common type of energy production.

Luxembourg has joined the list of European partners that have signed political agreements with Denmark within the framework of the current project including Germany Belgium and France. The energy islands one in the Baltic Sea on the island of Bornholm and another artificial island to be constructed in the North Sea off the Danish coast will be connected to hundreds of offshore wind turbines and are expected to supply 5GW of power enough to meet the needs of 5 million households in Denmark. That will eventually increase to 12GW for export to neighboring countries as part of the green transition envisaged beyond borders. 3GW is already expected around 2030.

The project is expected to cost about kr. 210bn or €28bn. However “It is not yet known how much Luxembourg will invest in the project"" a ministry spokesperson told Delano.

The agreement reached on 10 June is a milestone in Luxembourg-Denmark cooperation and is an essential step towards achieving the European goal of climate neutrality by 2050 which the European Commission estimates will require around 300GW to accomplish with the industry experts estimating approximately 150GW in the North Sea and approximately 80GW in the Baltic Sea. Renewable energy production and green hydrogen will be promoted and subsequently decarbonize sectors such as heavy transport and industry in large parts of Europe says Dan Jørgensen Danish minister for climate energy and utilities.

""Offshore wind will play an important role in the security of supply of the Western European electricity grid"" said Luxembourg minister of energy Claude Turmes (Déi Gréng). ""I am pleased that Luxembourg as a landlocked country has the opportunity to actively participate in the development of the world's first offshore wind islands and can thus contribute to this important development for energy transition. This cooperation with Denmark is meant to be complementary to the national strategy which aims at accelerating the development of renewable energies in Luxembourg"" he added.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Antetokounmpo gave the rim an extra pump for effect then gave Griffin and the home crowd a flex.

The dunk that gave the Bucks a 60-50 lead with just under nine minutes to go in the third quarter was the bolded exclamation point in a 107-96 victory over the Nets on Sunday afternoon that tied the Eastern Conference semifinals series 2-2.

""It goes without saying — you've got to come home you gotta win keeping your mind in a good place be ready to compete an play "" Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer said. ""So we gotta stay there we gotta stay in that same mindset.""

Game 5 will be in Brooklyn on Tuesday night with Game 6 back at Fiserv Forum on Thursday.

That dish to Antetokounmpo was Holiday’s sixth assist and the veteran point guard finished with nine handouts while the Bucks as a team got back to moving the ball and incorporating all players on the court. Of the Bucks' 39 baskets 27 came on assists.

Milwaukee also finally hit three-pointers. After making a combined 20 threes through the first three games of the series they hit 16 of their 47 attempts (34%) from distance Sunday.

The starters were pulled with 3:20 left and the Bucks up 101-86 and Antetokounmpo finished his night with 34 points on 14-of-26 shooting in 38 minutes. He was 5 for 10 from the free-throw line and 1 for 5 from behind the three-point line. He led the Bucks with 12 rebounds.

Khris Middleton (19 points eight assists) Holiday (14 points) and P.J. Tucker (13) all finished in double figures. Brook Lopez added six points 11 rebounds and three steals. Bryn Forbes had 10 points and Pat Connaughton added eight points four steals and three assists.

A postgame fire alarm meant only Budenholzer and Connaughton were made available to the media but after the game Antetokounmpo told the television broadcast ""I’m really proud of this team. We keep playing together.

""We come in every night and put ourselves in a position to win. You know leaving Brooklyn we know that they took care of business so we say we’re going to go back to Milwaukee we’re going to try and take care of business and we put ourselves in a position to win two games.

""We’re very happy but we gotta to keep getting better keeping playing together rand hopefully we can go in Brooklyn and take one.”

The Nets could not weather the loss of star guard Kyrie Irving who turned a right ankle with six minutes left in the first half.

Brooklyn scored just eight points after that point in the second quarter and just nine points in the first nine minutes of the third when the Bucks took as much as a 17-point lead. Without Irving (and with James Harden sidelined since Game 1) Durant shouldered a heavy load for Brooklyn. He played 42 minutes and scored 28 points on 9-of-25 shooting. He also pulled down 13 rebounds and had five assists.

Jeff Green (foot) played for the first time in the series for Brooklyn and had eight points but the supporting role players could not get untracked as the Bucks could focus on making life difficult for Durant. Joe Harris and Blake Griffin were each 3-for-8 from the floor scoring eight points.

The Bucks opened the second half with a 13-2 run to take a 66-50 lead and eventually led 74-57 on a Forbes three-pointer with 3:37 to go in the third quarter. Durant single-handedly cut the lead to 78-69 with six seconds left with 12 straight points but Middleton hit a three with one second left to give the Bucks an 81-69 lead going into the fourth.

That seemed to take the air out of the Nets and the legs out from Durant as he didn’t score in the fourth quarter before he and the rest of the starter were pulled with 4:24 left in the game down 15 points.

Milwaukee could not immediately capitalize on Irving’s sudden departure in the second quarter taking a 53-48 lead into halftime. Irving limped to the locker room after severely turning his right ankle on Antetokounmpo’s foot following a basket that made it 44-40 Bucks with 6:04 to go in the second half. The teams traded turnovers fouls and missed shots over those final minutes as the Bucks could not stretch the margin any further.

A key moment to the half the Bucks came when coach Mike Budenholzer challenged an offensive foul call on Antetokounmpo with 49.8 seconds left. It would have been his third foul of that variety in the half but the call was reversed. It not only removed the foul but he had made the basket so it turned into a three-point play and broke a Bucks scoreless streak of nearly 2 ½ minutes.

Tucker had a big first half for the Bucks offensively scoring 11 points on 4-of-7 shooting including 3 for 6 from behind the three-point line. He had scored a total of nine points over the first three games. Antetokounmpo led all scorers with 16 points while Middleton had nine. Seven different Bucks scored and the team had 16 assists on 20 of its baskets. Bobby Portis came off the bench to record two blocked shots.

Tucker continued to harass Durant and the Nets star scored 12 points on 4-of-10 shooting.

The Bucks did however prevent the Nets from running away early in the second quarter following an 8-0 Nets run that gave them a 34-23 lead. After a Mike James basket made it 36-25 Nets Middleton converted a four-point play and Tucker hit back-to-back threes for 10-0 run. Antetokounmpo emphatically erased the deficit with a massive dunk to make it 37-36. The Bucks would push the lead to 44-38 before Irving’s basket and injury.

Irving exited after 13 minutes of game play scoring 11 points on 5-of-11 shooting. He also handed out two assists and had five rebounds.

A police officer has reportedly confirmed that there is a fire somewhere inside the building.

NBA's Jared Greenberg reported a cop said there was a confirmed fire inside the building.

Confused fans and media personnel were seen gathering outside of the stadium.

Law enforcement officers moved the crowds away from the building.

The blaze reportedly got underway shortly after the Bucks won Game 4 in the series.

Twitter reports indicate the fire started in the office area of the Forum just minutes after the game.

The Milwaukee Bucks and Brooklyn Nets didn't have much time to digest their Game 4 showdown inside Fiserv Forum.

Malika Andrews of ESPN noted the building was evacuated shortly after Nets head coach Steve Nash spoke to reporters following the Bucks' 107-96 victory. After the players and staff were allowed back into the building the Bucks confirmed the alarm was triggered by a mechanical issue and that there was no fire:

On the court Milwaukee evened the series at two games apiece as the pattern of the home team winning every game continued.

Both teams will be back at Fiserv Forum for Game 6 on Thursday regardless of what happens in Tuesday's Game 5 in Brooklyn. The Bucks have all the momentum at this point following their second straight win thanks in large part to the overall play of Giannis Antetokounmpo.

The two-time MVP finished Sunday's game with 34 points 12 rebounds and three assists while Khris Middleton (19 points eight assists four rebounds two steals and two blocks) and Jrue Holiday (14 points nine assists and three rebounds) provided critical secondary contributions.

The biggest storyline though was the status of Kyrie Irving.

Tucker during a confrontation between the Milwaukee Bucks forward and Nets star Kevin Durant on Thursday night.

NBA officials said the security guard would not be assigned to any of the remaining games in Milwaukee during the second-round playoff series between the Bucks and Nets. He won't be assigned to the court area for the second-round games in Brooklyn.

Although NBA officials didn't provide the name of the security guard a person with knowledge of the situation identified him as Antjuan Lambert. Another person with knowledge of the situation said the security guard was Durant's personal security guy before being hired by the Nets.

The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because those details weren't announced. The Athletic first reported Lambert's name.

The situation stems from an incident that occurred in the third quarter of the Bucks' 86-83 Game 3 victory.

Tucker appeared to be complaining after getting called for fouling Durant. Tucker and Durant then started jawing at each other as they got face to face. The security guard went on the court during this confrontation and put his hands on Tucker.

Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said Saturday that he wasn't aware of the Bucks contacting the league to look into the matter but he added that he didn't think it would be right for a security guard to put his hands on a player.

""If it's a Nets security guy and he's bumping our player and things like that it doesn't seem like that's the protocol and that's kind of what we would expect from any type of security whether it be Bucks or Nets or Fiserv or Barclay's Center or wherever you may be playing"" Budenholzer said. ""I don't think you want to bump and escalate things.""

The Nets lead the best-of-seven series 2-1. Game 4 is Sunday in Milwaukee.

A sign is unveiled at General Motors Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly on Oct. 16 2020 introducing the facility's new name: Factory Zero Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center. GM

After years of come-and-gone predictions that battery-powered sedans pickups and SUVs would replace gas-guzzling emissions-spewing models the shift to electric vehicles is revving up. Beyond EV pioneer and market leader Tesla  virtually every major auto manufacturer is lining up to flip the e-switch and it is not just a big deal for consumers but the thousands of auto dealerships across the country that will need to embrace the electric future. General Motors has said it's aiming to produce only EVs by 2035 with 30 new plug-in models arriving by 2025 marking a $27-billion investment. Ford  which previously committed $22 billion to EV development just announced that 40% of its vehicles will be electrified by 2030. Toyota Volkswagen Daimler Hyundai Fiat Chrysler Honda and other automakers are making similar pledges. In preparation for this onslaught of new models franchise car dealers in the U.S. — many of them longtime small businesses located in suburban and rural communities — are gearing up. Salespeople are getting ready to put you in an EV today. And because EVs have fewer moving parts service technicians are being trained to maintain them. ""EVs are the big issue right now"" said Mark Paladino general manager of Colonial Ford in Danbury Connecticut and a 40-year veteran in the business. He was still excited about Ford's debut of the F-150 Lightning pickup an all-electric version of the best-selling vehicle line in the nation for four decades running.

Ford F-150 Lightning 'beyond expectations'

Paladino's excitement is warranted considering that Ford.com tallied 70000 reservations for the Lightning within the first week of its official release on May 19 with $100 deposits plunked down for each said Jason Mase Ford's cross vehicle marketing manager. That followed the successful introduction of Ford's Mustang Mach-E electric vehicle where 70% of initial customers were new to Ford. For the F-150 Lightning Mase said ""90% ordered the highest trim level and 80% ordered the extended-range battery. ... It was beyond our expectations."" Colonial is one of 2300 Ford dealers among a total of roughly 3000 that have volunteered to become EV-certified an investment that entails training sales and service personnel upgrading battery-charging stations and purchasing special equipment parts and tools. The remaining third have thus far opted out of spending nearly $50000 for the certification. Other manufacturers are asking for upwards of $300000 for the designation.

watch now

""We were all in right away"" Paladino said adding that the family-owned dealership was previously trained on several gas-electric hybrid models as well as Ford's first-ever EV the 2021 Mustang Mach-E SUV introduced in December. ""We see EVs as a part of our business that will only get larger and we want to be in that world."" EVs comprise less than 3% of overall new-car sales in the U.S. Tesla has dominated the market making up about about 55% of it according to Credit Suisse — though that's down from 72% a few months ago reflecting the growth in competition. Although EVs now represent only a fraction of the U.S. automotive fleet they ""are eventually going to become a significant part of a car retailer's business"" said Chris Sutton vice president of automotive retail for market research firm J.D. Power.

A Bloomberg New Energy Finance report estimated that by 2040 EVs will account for 58% of worldwide passenger vehicle sales with China Europe and the U.S. respectively leading the pack. ""By providing their sales and service expertise and as an education resource for customers they add value to automakers"" Sutton said of dealerships. Though he added that because EV sales to date have been concentrated in coastal states Michigan and Texas many dealers elsewhere remain in wait-and-see mode.

Two-thirds of car consumers interested in EVs

In addition to manufacturers' ambitious targets the Biden administration has proposed spending nearly $42 billion to build out the nation's EV battery-charging infrastructure gas prices have inched up and ExxonMobil's shareholders elected three climate-friendly directors supported by an activist investing group to its board. Support for Biden's infrastructure spending plan however to which EV infrastructure spending is tied remains uncertain.

Car dealers are focused on the here and now. They should be heartened then by a Cars.com survey that reveals two-thirds of Americans are interested in buying an EV despite barriers such as higher sticker prices than internal combustion engine (ICE) models and the paucity of charging stations. Plus some EVs still qualify for a $7500 federal tax credit while states such as California New Jersey and New York offer additional rebates up to $5000. These data help explain why the 17000 members of the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) ""can't wait for EV products to get here"" said NADA President and CEO Mike Stanton. ""Dealers are in the business of selling cars and making customers happy so why wouldn't they want to sell EVs?"" he said dismissing reports of lackluster enthusiasm among dealers. Political support for climate change policies vary across the nation and in the past year support has been dropping among Republicans for the federal government making action on clean energy a top priority according to a recent survey conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason Center for Climate Change Communication. But considerable support remains among conservatives for providing tax rebates to people who purchase energy-efficient vehicles or solar panels: 78% of moderate Republicans and 60% of conservative Republicans. It was the only ""climate-friendly energy policy"" in the survey which a majority of both moderate Republican and conservative Republican registered voters support.

EV service will definitely evolve and won't be exactly the same. ... No one is panicking about it but we know it's going to change over time so we're working with our dealers on that. Travis Hester GM's chief electric vehicle officer

One genuine concern for dealers however is the fact that EVs don't require oil changes transmission repairs and other service owners of ICE vehicles routinely bear — and that account for 50% of dealers' gross profits. A 2019 report from AlixPartners estimates that dealers could see $1300 less revenue in service and parts over the life of each EV they sell. Even though 70% of aftermarket service of ICE vehicles is handled by independent shops franchise dealers don't want to cede EVs to them especially as consumers familiarize themselves with battery charging and other peculiarities. ""The EV owner might trust the dealers more to perform service than the aftermarket shops earlier in their ownership period"" Sutton said. The service element doesn't necessarily worry Rita Case CEO of Rick Case Automotive Group in Ft. Lauderdale which represents VW Hyundai Honda Audi Mazda and other brands at its dealerships in south Florida and Atlanta. ""EVs need tires brakes batteries lights and some steering and drivetrain maintenance"" she stated. Rick Case Auto is already selling and servicing a limited number of EVs and hybrids but ""within the last six months we've ramped up EV training for our salespeople and technicians and purchased new charging equipment"" in anticipation of increased consumer demand for new electric models Case said.

GM has been readying its 4100 franchise dealers over the past year not only for the refreshed Chevrolet Bolt — an early EV entrant that has gone through a recent design — but also the upcoming electric GMC Hummer and the Cadillac Lyriq. ""Service is critical to what our dealers do today and will be in the future"" said Travis Hester GM's chief electric vehicle officer. ""EV service will definitely evolve and won't be exactly the same"" compared to that for ICE vehicles he said noting that some EV parts may last 10 to 15 years. ""No one is panicking about it but we know it's going to change over time so we're working with our dealers on that."" Meanwhile Paladino can't keep up with Colonial Ford's conventional service demands. ""We're booking and servicing every vehicle we can"" he said. ""Right now I'm three weeks out in servicing your car.""

It's too early to tell if the trailblazing pickup will resonate with buyers.

Its $20000 base price and hybrid engine could make it a home run industry analysts told Insider.

See more stories on Insider's business page.

Nearly every new pickup truck you see rumbling down the road today is a pricey behemoth that's roughly the size of a small house. But it wasn't always that way.

Ford is looking to resurrect the small-but-mighty pickups of decades past with the new 2022 Maverick revealed Tuesday. The truck delivers on compact size and an enticing starting price of around $20000 but Ford is entering uncharted territory - and it's not a certainty that customers will bite.

""We still need to see if there's a real market for these kinds of lifestyle pickups"" Augusto Amorim a senior manager of sales forecasting at the research firm LMC Automotive told Insider. ""It's so much smaller than what we are used to when you think about a truck. It'll be interesting to see how customers react.""

2022 Ford Maverick. Ford

While the Maverick isn't exactly pint-sized it's significantly smaller than mid-size pickups like Ford's Ranger or the more popular Toyota Tacoma. Ford's thinking here is to target nontraditional more urban truck buyers with a vehicle that's easier to maneuver and park than other pickups but still offers similar functionality. But it's a gamble Amorim says given that it's an untested segment.

LMC is forecasting that Ford will sell between 40000 and 50000 Mavericks per year. That's peanuts compared with the number of F-Series trucks it moves annually - usually 800000 or more - but it's about in line with sales of the Honda Ridgeline another car-based pickup. It's about double what LMC is expecting from the Hyundai Santa Cruz which goes on sale this summer as the Maverick's only true rival in the compact truck space.

2022 Ford Maverick. Ford

Still the Maverick could be a home run given its bargain-bin pricing and selling points distinct from other pickups says Michelle Krebs an executive analyst at Cox Automotive.

""Trucks have never been more popular but what has happened is they've gotten bigger and bigger and more expensive"" Krebs said in an interview. ""So there's a huge white space for people who don't want a truck that big and certainly don't want to pay that kind of money but they want a truck.""

The average price paid for a new car has ballooned to above $40000 and pickup trucks the second most popular vehicle type after crossovers are partially to blame for that trend. The average transaction price for an F-150 is in the $50000 range while Rangers typically sell for roughly $40000 Krebs said. A top-trim Maverick Lariat can be had for $25000 plus destination fees while a fully-loaded model comes in around $35000.

2022 Ford Maverick. Ford

Importantly though the Maverick isn't just a shrunk-down F-150 or Ranger and offers more than just a small size Krebs says. It's its own thing with features uniquely catered to the recreational buyer and the only standard hybrid engine in any US pickup. That powertrain which Ford says delivers 40 mpg could be key for attracting a younger more environmentally conscious or less affluent crowd that has traditionally been put off by gas-guzzling trucks.

The Maverick's $19995 entry price - which makes it Ford's new entry-level offering and the cheapest pickup truck on the market - was very much a deliberate move Ford vice president Jim Baumbick told Insider. The automaker hopes that a combination of a low sticker price and high versatility will steal customers away from a host of different segments including sedans a market it abandoned in 2018.

Analysts who spoke to Insider agree that the trailblazing truck could snag some unexpected customers. Plus it wouldn't be the first time that a novel type of vehicle took off at around this price point. Not too long ago subcompact crossovers were virtually nonexistent in the US but now tiny cheap SUVs like the Kia Seltos Hyundai Kona Honda HR-V and Subaru Crosstrek are huge sellers for their respective companies.

""Those vehicles really helped bring a more price-sensitive consumer to the crossover segment so we can clearly see that happening to trucks"" says LMC's Amorim.

2022 Ford Maverick. Ford

People ended up loving the increased ride height visibility and cargo space that small crossovers provided over sedans says Ivan Drury senior manager of insights at Edmunds. A Maverick-sized pickup with arguably even more functionality than a little crossover could be a logical next step for those people he said.

The Maverick could very well spark a deluge of new compact pickups from General Motors and others especially if it does well.

But competitors will likely find it hard to enter the market with a product as compelling and attractively priced as Ford's pickup Drury said. One key advantage Ford has as it rolls out the Maverick is its vast network of commercial and government customers something Hyundai can't leverage with the Santa Cruz Cox Automotive's Krebs said.

2022 Ford Maverick. Ford

The little pickup's debut is just the latest sign that Ford and its new CEO Jim Farley are turning things around after years of lackluster profits.

In the last year Ford launched the electric Mustang Mach-E crossover Bronco Sport and a new generation of the F-150. Last month it showed off its debut battery-powered pickup the F-150 Lightning which hits streets next year. And after years in decline Ford's share price has shot up more than 70% in 2021 - even outpacing Elon Musk's Tesla.

The Maverick and those other well-received vehicles may be just what Ford needs to win back some of the customers it's lost over the years Drury said.

""By having these products that are perfectly suited for the market it's really changing peoples' opinions of the brand"" he said. ""I think for anyone who used to have a Ford and strayed from it this might bring them back into the fold.""

Save articles for later Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Not long ago the only pressure for oil and gas companies to clean up their act came from the protests outside their office towers. Next it was at their investor meetings from activists taking over question time or lobbying for larger emissions cuts. These too could often be ignored. But now the winds of change are blowing in boardrooms. Last month – in May 2021 – Big Oil’s climate reckoning made history. It was “potentially a watershed moment” UBS Australia’s energy analyst Tom Allen says. At America’s ExxonMobil the $US265 billion ($343 billion) behemoth that for many years was the most valuable company on Earth activist investors ousted three directors deemed out of step with necessary climate action and installed green-leaning replacements instead. At Chevron the same day shareholders defied the board and supported demands for the company to take account of its customers’ carbon emissions footprint. And in Europe a Dutch court ruled in favour of environmental groups in forcing Shell to commit to a vastly stronger decarbonisation plan by 2030. It’s proving to be a watershed year for Big Oil as energy producers are facing the end of the fossil fuel era. Credit: AP “Black Wednesday” as some are calling it had been approaching for a while. Governments investors and the public have become increasingly attuned to the risks posed by global warming focused on hitting net-zero emissions targets by 2050 and demanding of producers to accelerate change. Australia’s Woodside Petroleum and Santos felt the force of this last year with huge shareholder uprisings in support of climate activist motions. But May 26’s thumping boardroom and courtroom defeats for three of the so-called “super majors” from Houston to The Hague showed how far further things have come. The shock is reverberating industry wide. And for Australia – as one of the world’s biggest exporters of liquefied natural gas – the implications could be severe. “They are different jurisdictions but it is amazing how these things have coincided” says Greg Bourne the former president of oil giant BP’s Australian operations. “Things are ratcheting up.”

In essence what the events marked was a rebuke of the industry’s long-held mantra: that the world will need lots of oil and gas for a very long time and that its traditional business case is iron-clad. The immediate fallout says global ratings agency S&P may be pressure on producers’ core cash engines from stakeholders including their own investors. “Anyone who tries to go for a final investment decision on a new field in this year 2021 needs their head looked at.” Greg Bourne former president of BP Australia But there is also a bigger picture. Just recently the International Energy Agency determined the world should avoid funding any new oil and gas fields in order to achieve the Paris agreement’s aspirational goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. And lying just ahead there is the prospect of even more ambitious climate action being announced at the next UN summit in Glasgow in November. “Anyone who tries to go for a final investment decision on a new field in this year 2021 needs their head looked at” Bourne says. “There are too many things monotonically taking us toward a geopolitical effort to decarbonise really fast.” While a dark cloud hangs over the long-term outlook the threat to oil and gas is far from immediate. Ironically there appear to be some decidedly good years ahead especially as supply is more likely to take the hit from climate pressure rather than consumption. As countries emerge from the worst of the coronavirus pandemic the world is ravenous for oil and gas.

Already pent-up demand is combining with a curtailment in supply after new drilling was halted last year and some wells shut in. Benchmark Brent crude which last year suffered its steepest and fastest demand crash in decades is now trading back above $US70 a barrel its highest level since January 2020. Loading Some investors like big superannuation funds that hold stocks long-term are rethinking oil and gas holdings just as they have done with thermal coal amid historic pressure to confront climate change. Others however are staying loyal or buying them up in what they say could be a lucrative opportunity before the electric vehicle revolution and wider decarbonisation efforts start to bite harder and eventually drown out fossil fuels for good. If the industry truly is seeing the beginning of the end asks Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic could it be a “very profitable last hurrah?” In the Californian city of San Mateo fund manager Franklin Templeton’s vice president Fred Fromm lives and works at the centre of the electric vehicle boom and the transition to a low-carbon world.

Here the local community has benefited from the state’s aggressive policy to reduce emissions Fromm says with cleaner air meaning schools are no longer shut down because of the city’s smog. “The fact of the matter is oil and gas is probably the number one thing that has improved living conditions around the world since the history of humankind.” Franklin Templeton investor Fred Fromm While he has noticed more Tesla electric cars on the roads Fromm who manages more than $886 million in a global resources fund says this has not translated to falling demand for oil. He believes politicians and some business leaders have become prone to exaggerating the speed of the transition overlooking the complexities at play by calling the end of an era without thinking about the implications. “The fact of the matter is oil and gas is probably the number one thing that has improved living conditions around the world since the history of humankind” he says. ” While there are more Teslas on the roads it doesn’t seem to have translated into falling demand for oil. Credit: Bloomberg While he is well-aware the energy transition is on foot it will likely be at a “slower pace than the more aggressive estimates” he predicts.

In Australia investment firm Allan Gray holds shares in Woodside the ASX’s biggest producer of LNG While oil and gas companies have become increasingly taboo to own the fund’s chief investment officer Simon Mawhinney believes current share prices are out of joint with their value. He says there has been a “buyers’ strike” on oil and gas where the number of sellers has outstripped buyers which has pushed down share prices further accelerated by the fossil fuel divestment movement. But he has doubled down on the stocks incrementally increasing his exposure in anticipation of a rally. Investor Simon Mawhinney is buying into energy stocks hit by a “buyers’ strike”. Credit: Brook Mitchell “[Oil and gas] have a future ... I think the question is how bright is that future?” he says. “Most people would acknowledge it’s not bright at all but I think the share prices of these companies say the future is completely dire.” Ausbil Investment Management’s global resources manager Luke Smith agrees and is seeking to cash in on an expected rebound as the COVID-19 vaccine is rolled out. “Clearly the commodity is structurally challenged on a longer-term basis there is no question about that whatsoever” he says. “But in the near time we see one last bull cycle.”

By most measures stocks have had a good year in 2021 even though the pace of the market's gains has slowed compared to their frantic pace in late 2020.

But there is always room for improvement and Jefferies says its analysts are offering one path forward with their Franchise Picks list of best ideas.

""As of 5/31/21 the Franchise Picks list has outperformed the SPX by ~400 bps on a total return basis"" the firm wrote in a note to clients. The S&P 500 posted a total return of 9.5% over the first five months of the year so that implies a total return of about 13.5% for the Jefferies stocks.

They are so clueless.So... first of all the dashcam is crippled because the developers don't realise they do not need to STOP recording in order to save the footage. All they need to do is MOVE the files to another directory on the USB rather than stop recording and COPY the file across and lose 1-2 minutes of recording time.So... today knowing that saving footage means I have disabled the dashcam for 1-2 minutes while driving today I wanted to save some footage. I waited until I got to my destination which was less than two minutes away. When I arrived I hot the save button on the screen. It saved the footage but it has holes in it including missing the part that I wanted (a bunch of cyclists that wanted to become organ donors by riding in the middle of the road rather than sticking to their dedicated cycle lane in early morning where motorists are unable to see because of the sun).The footage was saved at 7:21:04 according to the file stamp but only includes the following files:So I'm missing Front from 7:09 all from 7:10 7:11 7:12 7:14 7:17 7:19 The footage I wanted was from 7:14.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpbmtiaWtlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JvdW5kLXVwLTE0LXhjLXdvcmxkLWN1cC1jb2NrcGl0LXNldHVwcy1wYXN0LWFuZC1wcmVzZW50Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Round Up: 14 XC World Cup Cockpit Setups Past & Present,"Mathieu van der Poel:

Nove Mesto 2021

Mathieu van der Poel runs an interesting setup for his cockpit with a 720mm integrated bar and stem combo. The CP0008 from Canyon has a claimed weight of around 322 grams for the full setup and Mathieu runs this with the dedicated Garmin mount. On MVDP's bike this measures a huge 115mm in length with a -22 degree stem angle.

Carter Woods:

Nove Mesto 2021

For his cockpit setup Carter Woods opted for the handmade in Germany Beast carbon bars. According to the brand's website these have a claimed weight as low as just 147 grams. For grips he is running WTB Wafel lock-ons rather than the light foam grips we often see equipped on XC World Cup riders' bikes.

Victor Koretzky:

Nove Mesto 2021

For this year he is running a full FSA KFX cockpit with some very bright orange foam grips. Victor Koretzky likes to have his brake levers all the way out and set up to grab immediately.

Pauline Ferrand Prevot:

Albstadt 2021

To take on the first World Cup this year in Albstadt the current World Champion Pauline Ferrand Prevot was running a full BMC carbon cockpit. For her bars Pauline chose a 700mm width paired to a -5 degree negative rise stem with a 50mm length.

Nove Mesto 2020

Closing out the season in Nove Mesto last year on her previous Canyon Lux race bike Pauline was still running a fairly wide for XC 700mm bar although she opted for a longer 70mm stem with a slightly bigger -6 degree negative rise stem.

Anne Terpstra:

Albstadt 2021

Anne Terpstra was running an integrated bar and stem combo for Albstadt this year that we are told is also from Bike Ahead Composites although it doesn't look to be available to the public just yet. Anne has switched hers up with a lockout lever for suspension duties and a Blip device on the right side of her bars for the AXS dropper post.

Nadine Rieder:

Albstadt 2021

Nadine Rieder's cockpit is more conventional with a Bike Ahead Composites carbon bar and a short Tune Geiles Teil 4.0 stem in gold. Nadine has opted for a RockShox TwistLoc to adjust her suspension lockout with a standard AXS remote for the dropper.

Kate Courtney:

Albstadt 2021

For Kate's cockpit setup she is running Syncros' lightweight carbon Fraser IC SL integrated bar and stem with a computer mount. The Fraser IC SL weighs just 220 grams at its uncut 740mm width in the past Kate has run these bars as narrow as 680mm. Kate is also running her custom dropper post Blip device that is mounted inside her grips for easier control.

Manuel Fumic:

Nove Mesto 2020

For the two round race in Nove Mesto last year Manuel Fumic was running an XC wide flat Enve 730mm bar with 9 degrees of sweep. Manuel added this to an 85mm -10 degree negative rise Enve stem.

Maxime Marotte:

Nove Mesto 2020

When Maxime Marotte was with the Cannondale Factory Racing team he was running the narrowest bar on the team for Nevo Mesto in 2020. At 700mm wide with a -10 degree rise Maxime paired this to a carbon Enva stem.

Henrique Avancini:

Nove Mesto 2020

Henrique Avancini was using the widest bars of the Cannondale team at the two-round World Cup series last year. Henrique's Enve bars sat at 735mm wide with an 80mm -6 degrees negative rise stem.

Nino Schurter:

Nove Mesto 2020

Also for the doubleheader in Nove Mesto last year Nino Schurter was running his signature integrated Syncros bar and stem combo. For the races he was running a 680mm width and a -30 degree rise.

Mathias Flueckiger:

Nove Mesto 2020

Mathias Flueckiger opted for a 710mm wide Bike Ahead flat bar with an 11-degree backsweep for the 2020 Nove Mesto XC World cups. Mathias used a long 90mm negative -17 degree rise stem from Newmen. He was running this setup fully slammed for Nove Mesto but sometimes he will raise it by around 5mm depending on the course.

Lenzerheide 2015

Although we don't have the exact numbers on Mathias Flueckiger's setup here for Lenzerheide in 2015 he decided to run a negative rise stem and handlebars mounted upside down to get a really low front end.

Catharine Pendrel:

Mont-Sainte-Anne 2019

For the World Champs in Mont-Sainte-Anne 2019 Catharine Pendrel was running a full RaceFace cockpit with bright blue foam grips. Interestingly to make space for her bike's remote lockout system she has mounted the dropper lever on the right side of the bars.

Sam Gaze:

Vallnord 2019

The rider who has run some of the wildest cockpit setups over the years is Sam Gaze who always seems to be running long stems. For the 2019 World Cup in Vallnord he ran Specialized bars with a massive 130mm long stem with a -24 degrees negative rise stem.

Every rider has their unique setups for their race cockpit and in XC racing there are some very interesting quirks to some of the top riders' race machines. We looked back through our collection of bike checks from World Cup XC races to find some of the bar and stem combos that are being run by some of the world's top riders.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyYWRlbnRvbi5jb20vc3BvcnRzL291dGRvb3JzL2Zpc2hpbmctYm9hdGluZy9hcnRpY2xlMjUyMDQ3NzkzLmh0bWzSAU9odHRwczovL2FtcC5icmFkZW50b24uY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9vdXRkb29ycy9maXNoaW5nLWJvYXRpbmcvYXJ0aWNsZTI1MjA0Nzc5My5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fishing Column | Red snapper season gives anglers plenty of fish to catch in Gulf of Mexico,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.bradenton.com', port=443): Read timed out.

(NYSE:IT) A Top Quality Stock?,"Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Gartner Inc. (NYSE:IT) by way of a worked example.

ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.

View our latest analysis for Gartner

How Is ROE Calculated?

ROE can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So based on the above formula the ROE for Gartner is:

40% = US$356m ÷ US$892m (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2021).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity the company generated $0.40 in profit.

Does Gartner Have A Good ROE?

By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However this method is only useful as a rough check because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below Gartner has a better ROE than the average (16%) in the IT industry.

roe

That is a good sign. With that said a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . To know the 2 risks we have identified for Gartner visit our risks dashboard for free.

How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?

Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares retained earnings or debt. In the first two cases the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case the use of debt will improve the returns but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE even though the core economics of the business stay the same.

Gartner's Debt And Its 40% ROE

It's worth noting the high use of debt by Gartner leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.30. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.

Summary

Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books the highest quality companies have high return on equity despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity and one has a higher ROE I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.

But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price must be considered too.

Miss Teen Crypto a cryptocurrency influencer who started investing her pocket money into bitcoin when she was 16 told Insider she believes Gen Z could be the catalyst to take crypto and NFTs into the mainstream if someone would just explain the benefits and how they work.

The 18-year-old who has tens of thousands of followers across the major social-media platforms believes her digital-native generation could easily understand the digital side of crypto but not the financial side – but more education could fix that.

""I think that Gen Z — we're a little behind in terms of the financial aspect but we're not behind in terms of technology"" she told Insider in an interview.

""We've been on Snapchat since it came out we've been on the internet our whole lives. So we know the concepts of digital property we understand how to use this technology"" she said. ""We just have to be educated on why we should and how we could.""

Her first investment at 16 was around $200 saved up from her pocket money and birthday gifts. Her dad had got involved with bitcoin and crypto five years before that when she was 13 — but at that time she paid no attention to his passion.

""I was just tuning out. I was like 'This is boring I don't want to hear about it'"" she said. ""But then a few years after he actually showed me how a bitcoin transaction worked.""

When the New Yorker saw that bitcoin transactions were easily carried out on her phone she recognised bitcoin's potential both in terms of investing and changing the world she explained.

The crypto HODLer — who grew up Randi Hipper but is known by @MissTeenCrypto on Twitter her podcast and Instagram — has seen others have the same experience when she has talked to them about crypto and bitcoin. Her high-school peers knew as little as her teachers about the assets and 95% of the people she has talked to at Times Square have never heard of them.

Non-fungible tokens or NFTs are a great way for young people to realise crypto's potential the influencer believes. These are unique digital assets — such as image video or audio files — that are built and stored on blockchain technology. As they cannot be duplicated so they can be Collectable and hold value.

The key advantages she said are that anything can be turned into an NFT — from digital art to music to ""your high school diploma"" — and everything is documented on blockchain. There are also no age limits to creating them.

""Especially with Gen Z we could take the space and run with it"" the crypto fan said. ""It's just amazing. I think NFTs could be everything"" she added.

All that is needed for a wider adoption of crypto assets is more education she argues. That could spark a digital revolution that goes beyond finance she said bringing changes to not just the financial system but also to the way people interact and make transactions work.

""We have to be able to reach more people and educate more people which is what my mission is""she said. ""I'm trying to use social media and I'm trying to make more educational content just to reach more Gen Z — because it really is the education that matters."""

1. Solar Energy



Dutch solar energy is among the fastest growing renewable energy sources in Europe. In 2018 the Netherlands reached 4400 megawatt of installed solar energy capacity growing the installed capacity by 1500 megawatt relative to the prior year (50% year-on-year).

Historically residential rooftop solar was the main source. In 2018 almost 2300 MW of installed capacity related to residential rooftop solar. However commercial rooftop solar is gaining momentum. Out of the 1500 MW increase in 2018 almost 530 MW was installed on commercial and utility roofs.

Discover more about Rooftop Solar Energy.

2. Wind Energy

The wind industry’s frontiers are expected to increasingly move offshore in 2021. As utilities focus on decarbonization and create net-zero targets offshore wind holds great promise for many thanks to its high capacity factors and deployment potential.

In 2021 the industry is expected to continue to boost efficiency with larger

turbines taller towers and longer cables. Wind turbine manufacturers are using

higher-capacity turbines to boost efficiencies. Oil and gas companies are poised to make significant investments in both fixed and floating offshore wind thanks to their vast experience in offshore environments. Some large oil and gas companies are shifting their focus toward a new consistent revenue source in an emerging low-carbon business.

3. Hydrogen



Many industry stakeholders are considering hydrogen production and storage projects in addition to wind and solar to find ways to cut carbon emissions. Power-to-gas involves producing green hydrogen through electrolysis using renewable-sourced electricity. This could reduce renewable energy curtailment support renewable energy integration provide long-duration seasonal electricity storage and aid gas decarbonization.

In 2021 as renewable penetration on the grid increases green hydrogen

development is expected to follow because of its potential to act as seasonal

storage of fuel available on demand to generate power for grid balancing.

What would happen if the US Navy’s latest destroyer the USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) fought against the Navy’s last battleship the USS Wisconsin (BB-64)? Fireworks.

Let us not tarry on the question of how the 2020 edition of USS Zumwalt would encounter and engage the 1991 version of USS Wisconsin. We will assume that neither ship is receiving external support; although both were designed to operate as part of a system each will fight this battle alone. We’ll also assume that each is operating in a configuration (including weapon load) optimized for ship-to-ship combat. Finally we’ll assume that the technologies key to the DDG-1000 class are both functional and available.

The Missile Volley:

The battle between the two ships will begin with missiles. Since we’re assuming that neither ship is receiving outside assistance the beginning of the encounter depends on how each ship identifies and targets its opponent. Since Zumwalt and Wisconsin used roughly comparable helicopters (and drones) we’ll assume for the ease of calculation that they identify each other at roughly the same time at a range of about 200 nautical miles.

Zumwalt has a lot of missiles to throw at Wisconsin. Zumwalt carries 80 VLS cells and while Tomahawk missiles will not fill all of these cells (Zumwalt needs to defend itself with Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles fired from the same system) we can assume that Tomahawks will occupy no fewer than half of the arsenal. Zumwalt will carry modern Block IV Tomahawk missiles that can be retargeted in flight toward moving ships at sea giving the Zumwalt a huge advantage especially as Wisconsin lacks sufficient anti-aircraft weapons to knock down Zumwalt’s helicopters or drones.

Wisconsin would reply in kind. The BGM-109B Tomahawk Anti-Ship Missile (TASM) was retired in the early 1990s but Wisconsin could have carried 32 of the missiles in any kind of anti-shipping configuration. Wisconsin also carried 16 Harpoon anti-ship missiles. The TASMs could reach a range of 300 miles while the Harpoons were limited to about 70.

The problem would have been targeting. The Navy retired the TASM in part because its range exceeded that of available sensors meaning that the missile needed to use internal radars to discern between targets at the end of its flight. Assuming the TASM found its way to the general vicinity of Zumwalt (likely even if Zumwalt manages to shoot down loitering helicopters or drones) it might struggle to find and target the low-radar cross section of the huge destroyer. Zumwalt’s active defenses would have provided an even bigger problem. Recalling our assumption that Zumwalt would devote 40 VLS cells to Evolved Sea Sparrows it can allocate four missiles to destroying every incoming Tomahawk and still have a few left over for contingencies.

What happens then? If a TASM manages to hit Zumwalt nothing good. Despite its large size the Zumwalt is not designed to survive hits from cruise missiles. Even a single hit has the potential to sink or (more likely) disable the warship. It is possible that the Zumwalt could continue the fight but very hard to predict what would happen after taking extensive battle damage.

We have somewhat better sense of what would happen on Wisconsin. The Tomahawk is not an ideal weapon for killing battleships; it lacks the size warhead and especially the supersonic speed of the world’s more deadly anti-ship missiles. Its subsonic speed also makes it a better target for Wisconsin’s air defenses (although good luck hitting a Tomahawk with 5”/38 gun mount). Still Wisconsin will likely take more than twenty hits doing very serious damage to the unarmored parts of the ship including the bow stern and superstructure. Wisconsin will find her sensor and communications capabilities hampered and her speed reduced.

To the Guns!

Assuming that both ships remained afloat and interested after the missile exchange the next step would be to draw within gun range for the kill. USS Zumwalt can probably use this opportunity to escape (especially with the battering that Wisconsin took) but it’s not obvious that Zumwalt’s captain will make that decision.

In order to hurt the Zumwalt Wisconsin would need to close within visual striking distance. At such ranges the nine 16”/50 guns of the battleship would quickly disable and destroy the stealth destroyer. It would not take long and it would not be pleasant for Zumwalt. But odds are Wisconsin will never reach firing position.

With its two 155mm Advanced Gun System turrets the Zumwalt can begin hitting Wisconsin at a range of around 80 nautical miles with the Long Range Land Attack Projectile (as we’re assuming that Zumwalt is fitted out for naval combat these will constitute the entire armory). This weapon reputedly has a circular error probability of around 50 meters meaning that we can expect roughly 125-150 of the 700 or so shells fired by the Zumwalt over the course of half an hour will hit the battleship.

No one has ever hit an Iowa class battleship with 150 6” shells over the course of 30 minutes. However World War II offers some experience; the German battleship Bismarck underwent an even more vicious storm of fire and steel and the Japanese battleship Hiei suffered something similar. Both ships survived the initial onslaught but were disabled and later sank. Undoubtedly Wisconsin’s armor would provide a great deal of protection from 6” shells armed with fragmentation (rather than armor piercing) warheads. The Wisconsin is armored against 16”/45 shells which are much heavier and have much greater penetrating power than the land attack munitions fired by Zumwalt. Nevertheless the sheer number of hits would leave Wisconsin’s lightly armored ends and unarmored upper works devastated and in flames.

Even assuming Wisconsin remained afloat it is unlikely that she would be able to continue combat with her superstructure and decks in flames and her ends riddled with holes. The onslaught would almost certainly destroy her advanced sensors and communications equipment as well as the Harpoon missile launchers. This would leave the battleship blind deaf and slow making any effort to close with Zumwalt almost completely hopeless.

The USS Zumwalt is going to win this battle in almost any conceivable scenario. This is not surprising; Zumwalt will enter service over seventy years after Wisconsin. If we start the fight with different assumptions (without Zumwalt’s long range munitions or without the Tomahawk Block IV) then things look rather better for the battleship but the destroyer probably still inflicts serious damage and escapes. It is nevertheless remarkable to imagine that Wisconsin could possibly survive the fight even in battered condition.

New leadership at the Duncan Dynamics Gymnastics Club is aiming at expanding the number of programs offered by the longstanding organization.

Mary Morice was hired as general manager — the first GM in the club’s history — in January and has brought on an experienced new head coach in Karl McPherson but that’s the start of the changes she is establishing.

Morice has been coaching in B.C. for 35 years at various levels. She is the vice chair of the board for Gymnastics BC as well as Gymnastics for All (GFA) chair. Gymnastics for All includes all non-competitive GBC programs offered by clubs including those for community recreation and schools. It’s important to Morice that her club offer programs for athletes of all abilities.

“I am very inclusive and the board has come up with a strategic plan for this year in line with my ethics and values and having an inclusive place for everyone” Morice says. “Kids can come in and participate — if not at a high level they can come in and have support and enjoyment.”

The club will still have a strong competitive program but its mandate is to have programs for every child to be competitive and successful at whatever level they choose.

Morice still does some coaching but her role at this point is mostly mentoring. She certifies coaches for the National Coaching Certification Program and in that role she has worked with coaches from Duncan in the past.

“I have lots of desire to have quality coaches a quality mentorship program and an environment where children can develop confidence and be successful” Morice says.

Like any other sports organization the Duncan Dynamics have had to deal with restrictions due to COVID-19. There have been some struggles Morice says but they have pushed forward and some government grants have helped out.

The club has followed protocols set out by Gymnastics BC and viaSport including a check-in station and hand sanitizer at the front door and three-metre distancing emphasized by velcro dots on the floor. The equipment is cleaned constantly and they fog the gym with child-safe sanitizing agents at the end of each day. Classes have been smaller because they can’t have as many kids in the gym at one time as they used to and drop-in sessions and birthday parties have been cancelled entirely.

“Every class has to have quite a bit of structure to make sure the kids don’t get too close” says Morice noting that this creates new challenges with regard to learning new skills as there is no hands-on coaching.

“Because there is no contact we have to break it down more and some skills have to wait” Morice admits.

The Dynamics’ competitive team has been active and competing virtually through the winter and spring. To compete they submit videos for judging and get ribbons in the mail that are handed out in a small ceremony in class so their teammates can cheer for them.

“It’s a very different experience but they still get nervous” Morice notes. “They know they’re still being filmed so there is a level of anticipation. It’s challenging but as long as the kids can participate and socialize and learn new things we’re happy to be able to do that for them.”

Another aspect of GFA that Morice wants to introduce to the Duncan club is performance gymnastics — also known as “gymnaestrada” — which is an exhibition event open to all levels. Clubs can send teams to provincials each year and there will be nationals in 2022 and worlds in Amsterdam in 2023. The events include workshops as well as mass group routines. Training is just two hours a week as opposed to the 12 hours a week expected of a competitive and can include parent and child participation and even seniors.

Joining Morice at the club is new head coach Karl McPherson who has 40 years of experience coaching in Ontario Quebec and B.C. and most recently worked in Terrace. His biggest priority he says is developing “happy athletes” who are active for life and he views gymnastics as a “foundation sport.”

“The skills and tools they learn here can transfer to other things” he explains.

The option is still there for athletes to want to contend at a provincial level.

“If they want to compete at a higher level we can give them the resources to do that” McPherson says.

In addition to Morice and McPherson the club has several other coaches many of whom grew up training in the Dynamics’ own gym.

The club is currently taking registration for summer camps and classes and anyone who missed team tryouts can still contact the club for an assessment. For more information visit www.ddgc.ca",,,

We really needed some strategy and some extra muscle in figuring out how to communicate who we are and what our products are.”

A team of marketers from General Mills including Jen Smith a senior Brand Experience planner for Cheerios and two-time GoodWorks volunteer dedicated their time and skills to help Maazah over a 12-week period.

“Maazah already had a really compelling brand story with a delicious product to match” says Smith. “Our team helped by introducing some strategy frameworks that helped their brand put a stake in the ground on what they stand for.”

“It was really great to have General Mills step up in this way because it’s important for entrepreneurs to have thought partners in doing this work” adds Yasameen. “Being able to find people in your community to help you make better business decisions is invaluable.”

The General Mills GoodWorks team was able to provide a clear road map for how Maazah could best show up for their consumers in the digital space.

“Having partners that know food so well has helped us pave the way for our next endeavor in this company” says Sheilla.

“My favorite part of the GoodWorks program was helping a local company led by BIPOC women who are in those very exciting stages of brand development” says Smith. “I hope we made an impact on the trajectory of this brand and I’m excited to watch all of their successes in the future.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi3AFodHRwczovL3BvZXRzYW5kcXVhbnRzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzEyLzIwMjEtYmVzdC1icmlnaHRlc3Qtb25saW5lLW1iYXMtbmljb2xlLW5lbHNlbi11bml2ZXJzaXR5LW9mLW1pbm5lc290YS1jYXJsc29uLz9wcS1jYXRlZ29yeT1iZXN0LWJyaWdodGVzdC1vbmxpbmUtbWJhcyZwcS1jYXRlZ29yeS0yPW9ubGluZS1tYmEtc3R1ZGVudC1mZWF0dXJlcyZwcS1jYXRlZ29yeS0zPXN0dWRlbnRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2021 Best & Brightest Online MBAs: Nicole Nelsen University of Minnesota (Carlson),"Nicole Nelsen

Where are you currently working? General Mills Zone Sales Leader – Convenience

What achievement are you most proud of in your professional career? It was developing the 10-year long range plan and strategy for the Walmart bakery that led to R&D invention within our high speed cut dough portfolio. The organization made a 5 year investment to discovering the technology to bring true invention to one of our best plants – Team Joplin. So proud of this group to creating the technology that could insulate our business for the long haul vs. innovating within flavor/format.

Why did you choose this school’s online MBA program? It was the flexibility to meet the demands of my full-time job and responsibilities to my family at home. I desired the ability to work where and when I was ready to learn and also when the other demands on my time would allow. The Online MBA program gave me the room to effectively prioritize each and every day and sometimes down to the hour or minute.

What was your favorite part of being in an online MBA program? I really enjoyed the ability to watch lectures more than once. I would initially absorb the information and then watch again before a test or quiz or even while I was doing a homework assignment to ensure that I was doing the work precisely the first time. The online program had really neat virtual engagement tools and I’ve brought those tools and additional ideas to my professional workplace to streamline our efforts for the most effective and efficient ways of working possible!

What was the most surprising thing about an online learning environment? It was the interaction and engagement with my classmates and professor. Between group projects office hours and discussion boards – I was able to connect in a meaningful way with several people and each professor in each of the courses that I took.

How did your online experience compare with your in-the-classroom experience as an undergraduate student? I did a mix of synchronous and asynchronous learning as a part of my online program which was a nice blend of flexing to my work and home schedule alongside in person engagement and learning. The biggest benefit of the online program was acknowledging when I was ready to learn and choosing to do my work in those moments. This enabled me to leverage times when I had higher engagement to internalize the information vs. attending at a specific class time. I also found the material and information more applicable to my day-to-day life and I was able to immediately apply the concepts to my professional career and team.

What is your best piece of advice to an applicant for thriving in an online MBA program? You will enable your best experience through Internal motivation and the rigor to schedule learning time at your peak learning hours. Your entire family is a part of this program so make them aware early and often that you will have carved out time for learning that needs to be dedicated and uninterrupted for you to maximize your investment in your learning.

What would you change about an online MBA Program? Getting more elective courses online. I was limited by the courses that were available online and it would have been great to include some of the more peripheral courses in the online format. Additionally some professors do/did a better job of creating and updating their online content. Auditing the online experience for students is critical to improve less-than-engaging courses for future semesters. The best professors created terrific materials and videos one time that can be used for several years to come.

How has your online education helped you in your current job? I have applied the softer skill courses directly to my management and leadership journey and continue to put rigor behind becoming the best engaging leader that I can be. The Finance and Accounting courses are helping me articulate across other functional areas of my company to broaden my impact increase my strategic effectiveness and enable my long term success at higher levels of the organization.

Number of Hours Per Week Spent On Online MBA: 10-20

What is your ultimate long-term professional goal? I want to be an officer at a Fortune 500 company.

A sign is unveiled at General Motors Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly on Oct. 16 2020 introducing the facility's new name: Factory Zero Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center. GM

After years of come-and-gone predictions that battery-powered sedans pickups and SUVs would replace gas-guzzling emissions-spewing models the shift to electric vehicles is revving up. Beyond EV pioneer and market leader Tesla  virtually every major auto manufacturer is lining up to flip the e-switch and it is not just a big deal for consumers but the thousands of auto dealerships across the country that will need to embrace the electric future. General Motors has said it's aiming to produce only EVs by 2035 with 30 new plug-in models arriving by 2025 marking a $27-billion investment. Ford  which previously committed $22 billion to EV development just announced that 40% of its vehicles will be electrified by 2030. Toyota Volkswagen Daimler Hyundai Fiat Chrysler Honda and other automakers are making similar pledges. In preparation for this onslaught of new models franchise car dealers in the U.S. — many of them longtime small businesses located in suburban and rural communities — are gearing up. Salespeople are getting ready to put you in an EV today. And because EVs have fewer moving parts service technicians are being trained to maintain them. ""EVs are the big issue right now"" said Mark Paladino general manager of Colonial Ford in Danbury Connecticut and a 40-year veteran in the business. He was still excited about Ford's debut of the F-150 Lightning pickup an all-electric version of the best-selling vehicle line in the nation for four decades running.

Ford F-150 Lightning 'beyond expectations'

Paladino's excitement is warranted considering that Ford.com tallied 70000 reservations for the Lightning within the first week of its official release on May 19 with $100 deposits plunked down for each said Jason Mase Ford's cross vehicle marketing manager. That followed the successful introduction of Ford's Mustang Mach-E electric vehicle where 70% of initial customers were new to Ford. For the F-150 Lightning Mase said ""90% ordered the highest trim level and 80% ordered the extended-range battery. ... It was beyond our expectations."" Colonial is one of 2300 Ford dealers among a total of roughly 3000 that have volunteered to become EV-certified an investment that entails training sales and service personnel upgrading battery-charging stations and purchasing special equipment parts and tools. The remaining third have thus far opted out of spending nearly $50000 for the certification. Other manufacturers are asking for upwards of $300000 for the designation.

watch now

""We were all in right away"" Paladino said adding that the family-owned dealership was previously trained on several gas-electric hybrid models as well as Ford's first-ever EV the 2021 Mustang Mach-E SUV introduced in December. ""We see EVs as a part of our business that will only get larger and we want to be in that world."" EVs comprise less than 3% of overall new-car sales in the U.S. Tesla has dominated the market making up about about 55% of it according to Credit Suisse — though that's down from 72% a few months ago reflecting the growth in competition. Although EVs now represent only a fraction of the U.S. automotive fleet they ""are eventually going to become a significant part of a car retailer's business"" said Chris Sutton vice president of automotive retail for market research firm J.D. Power.

A Bloomberg New Energy Finance report estimated that by 2040 EVs will account for 58% of worldwide passenger vehicle sales with China Europe and the U.S. respectively leading the pack. ""By providing their sales and service expertise and as an education resource for customers they add value to automakers"" Sutton said of dealerships. Though he added that because EV sales to date have been concentrated in coastal states Michigan and Texas many dealers elsewhere remain in wait-and-see mode.

Two-thirds of car consumers interested in EVs

In addition to manufacturers' ambitious targets the Biden administration has proposed spending nearly $42 billion to build out the nation's EV battery-charging infrastructure gas prices have inched up and ExxonMobil's shareholders elected three climate-friendly directors supported by an activist investing group to its board. Support for Biden's infrastructure spending plan however to which EV infrastructure spending is tied remains uncertain.

Car dealers are focused on the here and now. They should be heartened then by a Cars.com survey that reveals two-thirds of Americans are interested in buying an EV despite barriers such as higher sticker prices than internal combustion engine (ICE) models and the paucity of charging stations. Plus some EVs still qualify for a $7500 federal tax credit while states such as California New Jersey and New York offer additional rebates up to $5000. These data help explain why the 17000 members of the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) ""can't wait for EV products to get here"" said NADA President and CEO Mike Stanton. ""Dealers are in the business of selling cars and making customers happy so why wouldn't they want to sell EVs?"" he said dismissing reports of lackluster enthusiasm among dealers. Political support for climate change policies vary across the nation and in the past year support has been dropping among Republicans for the federal government making action on clean energy a top priority according to a recent survey conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and George Mason Center for Climate Change Communication. But considerable support remains among conservatives for providing tax rebates to people who purchase energy-efficient vehicles or solar panels: 78% of moderate Republicans and 60% of conservative Republicans. It was the only ""climate-friendly energy policy"" in the survey which a majority of both moderate Republican and conservative Republican registered voters support.

EV service will definitely evolve and won't be exactly the same. ... No one is panicking about it but we know it's going to change over time so we're working with our dealers on that. Travis Hester GM's chief electric vehicle officer

One genuine concern for dealers however is the fact that EVs don't require oil changes transmission repairs and other service owners of ICE vehicles routinely bear — and that account for 50% of dealers' gross profits. A 2019 report from AlixPartners estimates that dealers could see $1300 less revenue in service and parts over the life of each EV they sell. Even though 70% of aftermarket service of ICE vehicles is handled by independent shops franchise dealers don't want to cede EVs to them especially as consumers familiarize themselves with battery charging and other peculiarities. ""The EV owner might trust the dealers more to perform service than the aftermarket shops earlier in their ownership period"" Sutton said. The service element doesn't necessarily worry Rita Case CEO of Rick Case Automotive Group in Ft. Lauderdale which represents VW Hyundai Honda Audi Mazda and other brands at its dealerships in south Florida and Atlanta. ""EVs need tires brakes batteries lights and some steering and drivetrain maintenance"" she stated. Rick Case Auto is already selling and servicing a limited number of EVs and hybrids but ""within the last six months we've ramped up EV training for our salespeople and technicians and purchased new charging equipment"" in anticipation of increased consumer demand for new electric models Case said.

GM has been readying its 4100 franchise dealers over the past year not only for the refreshed Chevrolet Bolt — an early EV entrant that has gone through a recent design — but also the upcoming electric GMC Hummer and the Cadillac Lyriq. ""Service is critical to what our dealers do today and will be in the future"" said Travis Hester GM's chief electric vehicle officer. ""EV service will definitely evolve and won't be exactly the same"" compared to that for ICE vehicles he said noting that some EV parts may last 10 to 15 years. ""No one is panicking about it but we know it's going to change over time so we're working with our dealers on that."" Meanwhile Paladino can't keep up with Colonial Ford's conventional service demands. ""We're booking and servicing every vehicle we can"" he said. ""Right now I'm three weeks out in servicing your car.""

GM will make only 1000 of the championship edition cars; production starts later this year. The cars come in two colors gray and yellow. They start at $87085 for the coupe and $94085 for the convertible both prices include destination fees.

They will resemble the No. 3 and No. 4 Corvette C8.R race cars which are a grand tour racing car built by Pratt & Miller and Chevrolet for competition in endurance racing said GM spokesman Kevin Kelly.

Corvette at Detroit Grand Prix

Last year was the mid-engine Corvette C8.R's inaugural season and Corvette Racing swept IMSA’s sports car championship series taking the Manufacturers Drivers and Team titles. Since 2001 Corvette has won 13 Manufacturers titles.

“Racing has been part of the Corvette’s DNA from nearly the beginning” said Laura Klauser General Motors Sports Car Program manager. “Both the Corvette Stingray and C8.R have seen tremendous success capitalizing on the benefits of a mid-engine platform — and we’re just getting started.”

The C8.R will race in Detroit for the first time Saturday. The Chevrolet Sports Car Classic will air live at 5 p.m. on NBCSN.

A Championship Edition

Here is what you get in the 2022 Corvette Stingray IMSA GTLM Championship Edition.

It is based on the 3LT trim with a Z51 Performance Package which includes Corvette Racing-themed graphics packages.

The No. 3 version comes in Accelerate Yellow and features gray graphics. The No. 4 is in Hypersonic Gray and features yellow accents.

Additional exterior content (varies by market):

High-wing spoiler in Carbon Flash which is a black paint finish.

Yellow brake calipers

Black Trident design wheels with the “Jake” logo on the center caps and black lug nuts

Exterior mirrors in Carbon Flash

Black side rockers the panels that connect the front of the car to the rear.

Splash guards.

Inside is either a Strike Yellow and Sky Cool Gray cabin that mimics the exterior yellow and gray racing theme with standard GT2 seats. GT2 seats are premium and provide more support for occupants over longer distances compared with the base GT1 seat.

Kelly said competition sport seats are available too those are engineered to provide more support for track or high-performance driving. The cars have yellow seat belts and a C8.R Special Edition numbered plaque.

Each car comes with a custom-fitted indoor car cover rendered to the appearance of the No. 3 or No. 4 Corvette C8.R race car and matches each car’s color and graphic scheme. So the No. 4 car has the gray cover for example and looks like the race car when it covers the car.

2022 Corvette

For those who want the regular 2022 Corvette Stingray it will come in three new exterior colors: Hypersonic Gray which is a dark gray Caffeine which is a dark brown and Amplify Orange Tintcoat which is a burnt orange.

The 2022 Corvette Stingray starts at $62195 for coupe and the convertible starts at $69695 both prices include the delivery fee. They are priced $1200 higher than the starting price for a 2021 model. But the 2022 model comes with a new low-profile rear spoiler and on the Z51 performance package it includes a front splitter which is a trim piece that will improve aerodynamics.

The 2022 Corvette Stingray’s LT2 6.2-liter V-8 engine has an upgraded direct injection fuel system improved engine calibration and an enhanced Active Fuel Management range. It remains rated at 490 horsepower or 495 horsepower with the performance exhaust system.

The eight-speed dual-clutch transmission is standard. A Z51-equipped model can go from 0-60 mph in 2.9 seconds Kelly said.

The mid-engine Corvette Stingray is offered in coupe and convertible models in 1LT 2LT and 3LT trims with the Z51 Performance Package available on all trims.

Coupes include a removable roof panel that stores in the trunk and convertibles include a power-retractable hardtop. The trunk is large enough for two sets of golf clubs.

Consumers can build and price a 2022 Corvette and see a visualization of it on chevrolet.com.

GM will be taking orders for the 2022 Corvette Stingray starting on July 1. Production of the cars will begin at GM's Bowling Green Assembly plant in Kentucky late in the third quarter Kelly said.

Add Willow Run Airport to the mix. And it has hot airplanes to go with the cool cars.

The third annual Detroit’s Invitational Wings and Wheels at Historic Willow Run is back this Sunday with historic cars and planes from the 1930-1969 era. Willow Run itself made history during the same period as Ford Motor Company used its hangars to crank out over 8000 B-24 Liberator heavy bombers from 1942-45 as part of US industry's “Arsenal of Democracy” effort to help win World War II.

“Everyone will enjoy this show” said Yankee Air Museum President Kevin Walsh. “There are cars and planes here that are simply legendary like an immaculate North American F-86 Sabre jet fighter and — imagine seeing this — a General Motors Futurliner one of only nine in existence.”

Arranged on the ramp of the Yankee Air Museum the exhibit includes the event’s “poster car” Darrin Packard — a well as rare birds like the single-seat Douglas AD-1 Skyraider and a Grumman C-1 Trader cargo plane.

The Wings and Wheels committee which includes ex-GM product guru Bob Lutz and Wings and Wheels chairman Peter Deloof scooped up cars from private owners as well as the GM Heritage Center Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum Stellantis/Chrysler Nicola Bulgari Car Collection and Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum.

“The vehicles must be totally original no ‘resto-mods’ no lowering kits no late model alloy wheels” said Lutz. “We want cars that were actually common and owned by normal people so no Pierce Arrows Marmon 16s or Duesenbergs. We even have a 1932 Ford Model A fuel truck in Standard Oil livery.""

Owners will be on hand to chat about their toys. Gates open to the public at 10:00 a.m. Sunday June 13 on the west side of Willow Run. Tickets are available here

Seven months later in April we exclusively reported that Inteluxe would be become the new name for leatherette seating upholstery on future Cadillac models starting with the 2022 Cadillac XT4 crossover.

And now we can confirm that the Inteluxe name will make its way to all the 2022 model year versions of all Cadillac crossovers namely the Cadillac XT4 Cadillac XT5 (including the hearse and limousine Professional Vehicles) and the Cadillac XT6. The Cadillac Escalade full-size luxury SUV is unlikely to use the Inteluxe brand since leather upholstery is standard on all trim levels.

It’s highly likely that the remaining models – the Cadillac CT4 and CT5 sedans – will also adopt the Inteluxe name to replace leatherette for the 2022 model year.

As of this writing it is unclear if Inteluxe-branded leatherette will be used for the upcoming Cadillac Lyriq all-electric crossover or whether Cadillac EV will use leather as standard. Alternatively it’s also unclear whether the Inteluxe brand will remain a Cadillac-specific name or if it will end up being used more widely among other GM brands namely Buick Chevrolet and GMC.

In the case of Cadillac the Inteluxe name is likely to feature only on base models since leatherette is not used in higher trim levels where actual leather upholstery is (nearly) universal. This applies not only to Cadillac but to all of its rivaling rivals from Germany – BMW Mercedes-Benz and Audi.

As far as we are aware none of this implies a change in the actual material used. It could be that the change is being implemented simply because Inteluxe has a 21st century feel to it whereas “leatherette” is more redolent of 1950s New Look fashion and watching Hopalong Cassidy TV programs on a black-and-white set.

Finally it’s worth noting that GM has also filed a trademark for the term Earthluxe with the USPTO. Like Inteluxe the term applies to vehicle upholstery and seat covers. However there is no news at present regarding when – or if – General Motors will use it on a production vehicle.

By most measures stocks have had a good year in 2021 even though the pace of the market's gains has slowed compared to their frantic pace in late 2020.

But there is always room for improvement and Jefferies says its analysts are offering one path forward with their Franchise Picks list of best ideas.

""As of 5/31/21 the Franchise Picks list has outperformed the SPX by ~400 bps on a total return basis"" the firm wrote in a note to clients. The S&P 500 posted a total return of 9.5% over the first five months of the year so that implies a total return of about 13.5% for the Jefferies stocks.

Government-led efforts in driving cashless economies have been a key factor with countries such as Singapore or the Philippines seeing their central banks driving the adoption of contactless payments during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result usage rates for digital payments platforms have recorded promising growth even as high as 5000% in the Philippines alone.

This unprecedented rise in cashless payments is also paving the way for the broader adoption of crypto with the number of crypto users worldwide hitting around 106 million in January. While this marks an impressive 15% month-on-month growth it is still just a drop in the ocean when compared to the 4.7 billion people who have access to the internet.

But as crypto continues to command headlines what will it take for mass adoption to happen?

A new model of financial accessibility

Today billions of people worldwide are unable to access even the most basic financial services via traditional means and thus are unable to save or manage their money securely. In times of economic devastation such as this past year in which global economies have been staggered by the impact of COVID-19 the vast gap between rich and poor has become abundantly clear. The global pandemic has only perpetuated the absence of inclusive financial infrastructure which has led to approximately one-third of the global population having no financial safety net to fall back on.

With crypto wallets however anyone can transfer their crypto internationally without needing to maintain a minimum balance in their account as long as they have an internet connection. As crypto applications are built on decentralised blockchains transactions are performed on a peer-to-peer basis in the absence of traditional intermediaries such as bankers or brokerage houses. This results in significant savings in transaction costs as traditional cross-border remittance fees for small amounts can be as high as 7% after taking into account intermediaries’ fees on both the sender and recipient side. Meanwhile the same fees for cryptocurrencies are often less than 1 percent — regardless of transaction amount.

Furthermore highly decentralised platforms are permissionless meaning that anyone with a crypto wallet and internet connection can lend remit or trade their crypto without validation by a central authority or intermediary. Instead transactions are executed by smart contracts which automate them as long as pre-encoded conditions are met. Beyond the cost savings consider the time savings as well. Remittance transactions can take several days to be processed whereas cryptocurrencies can be transferred in mere minutes.

However most crypto platforms still ask for some form of formal identification as part of their identity verification and Know Your Customer (KYC) process. This can range from a phone number to photo ID to proof of residential address. Some platforms adopt a multi-tier approach in which the more information that users provide the more services they can access. While necessary for KYC and Anti-Money Laundering compliance this poses barriers to users who do not own any formal identification documents.

Having said that some decentralised exchanges or DEXs still honour the principles of anonymity and trustless working by not enforcing KYC on their users. The elimination of account verification and waiting time for approval has drawn many towards these types of DEXs — such as PancakeSwap Uniswap and DeFiChain’s DEX — and has made finance truly accessible and inclusive for all.

Beyond simple transactions recent innovations in the crypto space promise a much more equitable financial system where the unbanked and underbanked can access more means to build wealth. While DeFi products such as token holding and staking on a DEX might be a little too advanced for this group of users at the moment simplified centralized decentralized finance (CeDeFi) services and improvements in financial literacy over time will help to open the door to these inclusive wealth creation opportunities.

Education is key to crypto adoption at scale

Widespread adoption of digital payment technologies such as QR codes and biometrics is definitely a promising sign that consumers have become more digitally savvy than ever before. In the Asia Pacific more than 90% of surveyed respondents said they would consider at least one new payment method in the next year.

In addition to new payment technologies the proliferation of retail investing has led to a paradigm shift in the investment landscape with trading activities doubling over the past year. User-friendly platforms such as Robinhood and their well-known crypto counterparts — such as Coinbase — have made investing much more accessible to non-institutional investors.

Related: Mass adoption of blockchain tech is possible and education is the key

This historic rise in cashless payments and retail investing saw the public gain more exposure to different asset types. However in the United States a staggering 84% of adults are either uninterested in cryptocurrencies or have never heard of them. While this could be attributable to the seemingly intimidating technicalities involved we are now in a good place to gradually transition towards a more crypto-forward society.

For now there’s much more to be done to help mainstream consumers gain a better understanding of crypto. Crypto projects for one would do well to invest more resources towards creating educational content to bridge the knowledge gap — whether through guides or detailed explainers. Meanwhile taking on a more transparency-focused approach that looks to debunk misconceptions and ensure that users are aware of the risks associated with crypto will enable those users to navigate their entry into the space with greater ease and confidence.

Crypto is the MVP in the cashless drive

As conversations on cryptocurrencies evolve governments are taking note. While cash will not be eliminated any time soon as many as 86% of central banks around the world are looking into central bank digital currencies in their quest to go cashless. The world’s first central bank digital currency (CBDC) — the Sand Dollar — was announced by the Central Bank of the Bahamas way back in 2018 and officially launched in October last year. The technology team behind this project was led by U-Zyn Chua who went on to co-found DeFiChain.

Although CBDCs will be regulated by a central authority their adoption will send a profound message to market participants on the legitimacy of digital currencies. The introduction of CBDCs is thus a much-needed springboard to catalyse large-scale crypto adoption.

In the short term crypto is not going to replace the existing financial system but will instead carve out its own ecosystem that is fit for a new generation of digital-first financially savvy users. While it will take some time for consumers to warm up to crypto the nascent technology will prove its worth in due time by offering cheaper safer and more inclusive financial services for all.

The websites are run by a Barbados company called Hyuna International and offer users access to movies books and music.

Users were lured to those sites through false promises and misleading advertising set up by subcontractors collecting commissions from AdCenter a web marketing company run out of sleek and modern offices in downtown Montreal the investigation by the disinformation-busting program Décrypteurs found.

The investigation revealed that both AdCenter and Hyuna International are linked to a Canadian businessman Philip Keezer. This network uses a complicated web of hundreds of nearly identical websites and offshore shell companies to evade scrutiny according to sources and experts cited in the report.

AdCenter is an affiliate marketing company a legal and widespread practice. In this type of marketing partners called affiliates promote goods and services and receive a commission every time a client they refer makes a purchase. Affiliates are not employees but rather subcontractors.

Unlike other affiliate marketing companies AdCenter has only one client: Hyuna International. Its affiliates are only paid when they convince someone to use their credit card information to sign up to one of Hyuna's sites.

Automatic billing begins after 5-day trial period

The misleading ads published by AdCenter's affiliates mostly appeared in Google results when people searched for free movies live sports or e-books.

These sites contained bogus video players or download buttons that fooled users into thinking they were getting what they wanted but instead led them to a signup page the investigation found. All users had to do — or so they were made to think — was provide their credit card information to begin a free trial to access all the content they could ever want.

Buried in the fine print though is a catch: after the five-day trial period if users forget to unsubscribe they are automatically billed $49.95 US per month. Although most rescind their membership upon noticing that the site's library is actually filled with B movies and public domain works some forget to cancel and are billed for months or even years according to former employees.

WATCH | A misleading ad sends a user to a site that does not have the content: Misleading ad Duration 0:20 In this example of a misleading ad set up by an AdCenter affiliate a fake player seems to begin playing the movie Wonder Woman 1984 but asks the user to create an account to continue watching and then sends them to a site run by Hyuna International which does not have this film.

They say these forgotten subscriptions are at the heart of the network's business model which nets it tens of millions of dollars per year at the very least.

""Basically [we were] just making money off people who don't notice"" said one of more than 15 former employees Radio-Canada spoke to and who asked not to be identified because they fear getting sued by their former employer for talking to journalists.

""There's no way people are paying a monthly fee for that content. Just picture a really shitty Netflix ... but the movies are things you've never heard of things you wouldn't even find at the back of a Blockbuster like really weird things.""

LinkedIn posts by multiple former executives within the network's various companies flaunt annual revenue of $100 million a figure confirmed by a number of ex-employees.

""A lot of people just pay their credit card bills and don't really look at them"" said Steve Baker the Better Business Bureau's international investigations specialist. ""Sometimes it's months and months before they go: 'What the hell is this? I didn't even realize I've been paying this.'""

Baker who authored a report on subscription scams in 2018 said many successful scams based on free trial offers rely on this very tactic.

The Montreal connection

Using DomainTools a web analysis service Décrypteurs was able to piece together a network of more than 1100 websites created by Hyuna International.

According to data from Similarweb a website that analyzes web traffic these websites generated on average 32.4 million visits per month in 2020. That's close to 10 per cent of the 331 million visits to Disney+ in March 2021 according to Similarweb's estimations.

Philip Keezer left and an associate at the 59th annual Grammy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles in 2017. (Twitter)

Thousands of complaints about these websites have been posted online over the years.

Décrypteurs examined 642 reviews posted on Trustpilot from 2015 to 2021 of five of Hyuna International's websites: Geeker Lilplay Tzarmedia Iceboxfun and Funmanger.

Almost half contain variations of the words ""scam"" ""fraud"" or ""steal"" and the vast majority of people posting mention they received unwanted charges on their credit cards. More than 95 per cent of them gave a one-star review the worst rating.

Without referring specifically to the thousands of negative reviews of Hyuna's streaming sites Keezer decried the existence of anonymous complaint websites in a blog post about ""complaint scams"" on his personal website.

In it he said that ""the abundance of online channels through which consumers and competitors can vent their frustrations have created a breeding ground for fraud"" and alleged that competitors and dissatisfied customers sometimes turn to these websites to publish ""fraudulent accusations and outright smear campaigns.""

Using open source investigation techniques Décrypteurs found that the false advertisements sending users to these sites were created by subcontractors for AdCenter called affiliates. These affiliates operating out of countries such as Bangladesh Indonesia and Pakistan make a commission every time they convince someone to sign up.

Hyuna International’s headquarters are in Christ Church Barbados. (Facebook)

In an effort to recruit subscribers these affiliates also create fake social media accounts to promote contests and events that aim to lure users to Hyuna's websites. For example a fake celebrity profile will advertise a contest for a $10000 jackpot and users who try to participate will be told they need to register for a free trial on one of Hyuna's sites in order to be eligible.

In March CBC reported that dozens of Indigenous artists and businesses in Canada and the U.S. had their identity stolen online by scammers. Décrypteurs found that AdCenter affiliates are behind at least two of these cases.

Company denies allegations

Over the past years similar scams run by AdCenter affiliates have been reported in various countries such as the U.S. and Norway. Celebrities such as talk show host Ellen Degeneres and basketball star Lebron James have been among those impersonated.

On paper AdCenter prohibits its affiliates from using deceptive practices to drive traffic.

However Décrypteurs found numerous instances where AdCenter employees tacitly encouraged affiliates to resort to these tactics.

In fact our reporters were unable to find a single instance in which affiliates promoting Hyuna platforms did so by promoting films that were actually available in the company's multimedia library.

In one case a company representative from Montreal gave affiliates a list of movies still playing in theatres telling them to ""push"" these movies to ""make sales"" in a Facebook live video published in the summer of 2019 on AdCenter's page.

In another an affiliate manager from Indonesia published a Facebook post telling affiliates to promise users they could watch live pro sports events by signing up to Hyuna's sites — and even included a link to a fake video player and a bogus streaming site template they could use to dupe them.

Keezer and the various companies linked to him did not answer interview requests from Décrypteurs.

A lawyer representing Action Media another corporate name for AdCenter called the allegations in the Décrypteurs story ""false and bluntly defamatory.""

What the law says

Experts told Décrypteurs that Canada's Competition Bureau is well-equipped to investigate the companies linked to this scheme on the basis of the Competition Act which prohibits false and misleading advertising.

""The law says that merchants are not allowed to make false or misleading representations. So if you're lured by your favourite superhero movie after being told you can watch it by signing up and that in the end all that's given to you is a ton of movies that have nothing to do with what was promised I think that that is suspicious"" said Sylvie De Bellefeuille a Quebec-based lawyer for consumer advocacy group Option Consommateur.

When I heard that the Dodgers’ annual pride night occurred the same weekend the Rangers were in town I knew I had to scramble to arrive. I came out publicly as part of the LGBTQ+ community about 363 days ago (Sunday will mark the one-year anniversary) for those that don’t know. From what people told me Dodgers’ Pride Night is fantastic in itself.

“It’s an exciting atmosphere” Chris Woodward told me when I asked about anything that stands out during Dodgers’ Pride Nights. “When you look around its colors you’re not used to seeing. Usually it’s all Dodger blue and white and all of this sudden you see different colors.”

Friday also became the first time Chris Woodward returned to Dodger Stadium since the 2018 World Series loss to Boston. Unfortunately for the Rangers the night on the field was a disaster that started with a six-run first for Los Angeles. It didn’t get better as the night went on (from the field’s perspective) and ended with a 12-1 Rangers loss although Charlie Culbreson pitched a scoreless eighth.

The Dodgers went all out Friday night ranging from Billie Jean King on the field to an excellent National Anthem rendition by Vincent. Pride flags waved with the California State flag and the Dodgers’ flags Friday night. Each in-between inning activity had a pride theme from dancing cap shuffle and rainbow gear showcased on the jumbo Tron all night long. Yes Los Angeles added Kiss Cam Friday night too. The Dodgers’ reputation of going all out on Pride Night was delivered with flying colors and ended with a fireworks show.

20220 here on #Dodgers Pride Night 🌈🏳️‍🌈. It's a sellout and a season high in attendance for the Dodgers. — Alex Plinck🏳️‍🌈 (@aplinckTX) June 12 2021

For many of the Rangers’ players it was their first experience playing on a Pride Night.

“I think we were supposed to have one scheduled last year in Anaheim but that was the only place” Isiah Kiner-Falefa told me. Nick Solak and Joey Gallo also said they haven’t been on the field on a pride night.



For Charlie Culberson he recalls a Dodgers’ Pride Night when he was a visitor with the Colorado Rockies.

“I was here one night when I was with the Rockies as a visitor and it was a big ordeal in a good way” Charlie told me. “In the outfield a lot of people on the field enjoying themselves. I got some relatives that are gay. Just love everybody enjoy every day [and] treat everybody with respect.”

While the Rangers will witness two Pride Nights on their current road trip (Wednesday at Houston) the Rangers themselves will again turn their backs the other way leaving them as the only team without a Pride Night (as of June 16th).

“It’s a tough conversation. “I don’t make the decisions so I’m not going to comment if we should or shouldn’t” Chris Woodward vocalized.



“I’m just here to focus on baseball. I’m not trying to step on anybody’s feet. If they tell us it’s a certain night it’s a certain night” Joey Gallo said.

Has Major League Baseball done an excellent job to promote diversity and inclusion?

“Internally we’re extremely inclusive who represents our organization we do not discriminate against anybody” Chris Woodward said.

For Nick Solak he feels the league is heading in the right direction regarding diversity and inclusion.

“I think the league is getting better and doing a good job of promoting it” Nick told me.

Isiah Kiner-Falefa meantime talked to me about Asian Pacific Islander Month and what Major League Baseball did to honor that in May.

“It’s pretty cool to have the Asian Pacific Islander month. That’s something I’ve never had before” Isiah said. “Being very few normally it’s overlooked especially the players’ alliance. I feel like they’re doing a great job with African American players. [So] having that for a guy like me who misses out on events like that it was nice to have that last month as well as this month.”

For Charlie Culberson he doesn’t overthink it because he’s always learned to be inclusive to everyone.

“I don’t try to single people out single groups out. I have best friends that are gay best friends that are black Asian Mexican all of the above” Charlie expressed. “I grew up with everybody and I wasn’t taught anything different. [So] for me I haven’t looked at it in that light. Everybody is the same to me.”

For the themed jerseys that the San Francisco Giants used on Saturday June 5th against the Cubs it pegged an idea that I bounced off of from Isiah and Joey. Is that something teams should use to promote diversity and inclusion?



“Teams should do whatever they can to get more fans and to be out with the community. If that’s what the community wants and the community needs then I like it” Kiner-Falefa said.

“It’s always cool to have the special hats and special jerseys” Joey Gallo told me. “It spreads awareness and what not to whatever that day is or cause is. It’s always cool to come into the locker room to have a different jersey.”

While my first Pride experience ended with the Rangers shellacked by the Dodgers it was great to witness and be a part of. One thing Chris Woodward noticed in Dodgers’ Pride nights is the atmosphere.



“There’s a ton of energy in the building probably more so in those nights. Obviously in Dodger Stadium you’d get 50000 fans a night but those nights there seem like there was a buzz because it was different.”

Now if only a Pride night existed at Globe Life Field. Unfortunately it doesn’t appear in any future Rangers’ promotion plans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYm9pbmdib2luZy5uZXQvMjAyMS8wNi8xMy9vcmJvb3QtZWFydGgtdGFrZXMta2lkcy1vbi1hLWJyaWxsaWFudC1hci10b3VyLWFyb3VuZC10aGUtd29ybGQuaHRtbNIBamh0dHBzOi8vYm9pbmdib2luZy5uZXQvMjAyMS8wNi8xMy9vcmJvb3QtZWFydGgtdGFrZXMta2lkcy1vbi1hLWJyaWxsaWFudC1hci10b3VyLWFyb3VuZC10aGUtd29ybGQuaHRtbC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Orboot Earth takes kids on a brilliant AR tour around the world,"It's no wonder so many adults are fascinated by world travel.

(Bloomberg) — BlackRock Inc. became the first foreign asset manager allowed to start a wholly owned mutual fund business in China a step toward winning a slice of one of the fastest-growing wealth markets.

The world’s largest asset manager was granted a license from the China Securities Regulatory Commission to start selling onshore investment products to Chinese investors the company said Friday in a statement.

The approval comes a month after BlackRock won the nod to pursue a joint venture asset management business along with China Construction Bank Corp. and Singapore’s Temasek. Together the two entities give BlackRock an edge to reach more investors in China as it competes with a slew of global institutions going after an asset pool estimated by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to surpass $70 trillion by the end of the decade.

“China is taking significant steps in opening up its financial markets” BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said in the statement. “We can support more Chinese investors to access financial markets and build portfolios that can serve them throughout their lives.”

The string of approvals are a positive sign for other asset managers including Fidelity International Ltd. and Neuberger Berman Group LLC which are still waiting for permission for their fully controlled operations in the country.

For BlackRock being first “gives it a head start among global managers” said Sun Guiping an analyst with Shanghai Securities Co. The investment giant will also benefit China’s mutual fund industry by bringing in more product offerings and expertise he said.

More wholly foreign-owned or controlled mutual fund providers will emerge as China’s opening up continues Sun said. Their joint ventures already occupy 11 spots among the top 20 largest fund managers in China excluding money-market funds he said.

New York-based BlackRock’s strategy in China stands in stark contrast with Vanguard Group Inc. which ditched plans in March for a wholly owned mutual fund license. Vanguard is taking a different path by working with Ant Group Co. and building a robo advisory service.

BlackRock oversaw more than $9 trillion globally as of March 31.

PSU President Stephen Percy announced June 11 that campus patrols will be unarmed by Sept. 1.

“I’m pleased to announce that Chief [Willie] Halliburton has committed to beginning fully unarmed campus patrols no later than Sept. 1 prior to the start of the fall term” Percy wrote Friday. “New policies to reflect the change to unarmed patrol have been created reviewed by the University Public Safety Oversight Committee and are now in place. I appreciate the leadership of Chief Halliburton and members of the CPSO team for their commitment to innovation in campus safety.”

The Friday afternoon announcement was hard-won.

For at least seven years a student group called Disarm PSU has pressured the university’s administration to remove guns from campus police. That demand intensified following the 2018 shooting of a Black man named Jason Washington by campus police called to break up a fight outside a sports bar called the Cheerful Tortoise.

Washington reached to the ground to pick up a handgun that had dropped out of his holster. Police shot him nine times. A grand jury declined to indict campus officers but PSU paid Washington’s family $1 million to avert a lawsuit.

Percy attempted a compromise in 2019—10 armed officers 10 unarmed—but that idea was rebuffed by the student group.

A Disarm PSU spokesperson expressed skepticism June 14. “This is the third time President Percy and Chief Halliburton have announced that they will not have armed patrols” the spokesperson said “but we have not seen any of these announcements turn into action.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRvd250YWxrLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvMDYvMTMvZHJlc3Nlci1sYXdzdWl0cy10aW9nYS1hcmVhLXJlc2lkZW50cy1zYXktaW5mby1rZXB0LXRoZW0teWVhcnMvNzU4MzgyNDAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dresser lawsuits: Tioga-area residents say info was kept from them for years,"Residents and businesses surrounding the former GE-Dresser plant in Tioga began getting notices in early 2020 about contamination from the shuttered facility. Although it was a revelation to them it wasn't news to company and state officials.

A flurry of lawsuits filed both last year and this year show many plaintiffs believe the plant was contaminating soil and groundwater on-site and off before a fire hydrant was broken on Nov. 23 2011 while Dresser employees made repairs to fire and water suppression system components.

The lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. District Court Western District of Louisiana in Alexandria. Those filed in district courts in Grant and Rapides parishes have been moved to federal court because the defendants and some plaintiffs are scattered across the United States.

One seeks class-action status. Others allege deaths from cancer and other health issues including the loss of an unborn child. Some contend there's been an active effort to mislead residents about health threats.

All concerned have experienced decreased property values in the northern southern and eastern areas around the plant — in Grant and Rapides parishes — where contamination has been found in soil and groundwater.

A history and 'the 2011 contamination event'

The facility which made pressure relief valves for the oil and gas industry opened on Oct. 30 1961 as Manning Maxwell & Moore according to Town Talk archives. It stayed in business under changing ownership for more than 50 years before closing for good in 2017.

Dresser Industries merged with the Halliburton Co. in 1998 but Halliburton sold it off the Dresser units in 2001. It then was bought in 2010 by General Electric Oil & Gas.

In November 2011 the fire hydrant break happened. Water filled an area excavated for the repairs and as some of the lawsuits state a ""hydrocarbon sheen was observed on standing water"" at the excavation site.

By 2015 almost 300 employees at the Tioga plant learned of a restructuring that might close it. By the next year they learned GE-Dresser would lay off more than 90 percent of its workforce according to Town Talk archives.

According to at least one of the lawsuits Baker Hughes Co. merged with GE in 2017 the same year the plant closed completely.

But by then the damage already had been done. Company officials and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality knew it too according to the lawsuits.

GE-Dresser notified DEQ about the spill in June 2012. DEQ installed monitoring wells so that soil and groundwater samples could be analyzed. Various testing continued into 2014 and as one lawsuit alleges the department first learned about contamination in the Aurora Park subdivision in December 2019.

The public notices began going out the next month in January 2020 although some residents said they weren't notified until months later.

The notices stated the contamination was from trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE).

Officials involved with the ongoing cleanup have said drinking water found hundreds of feet below ground is safe. TCE has been found in groundwater closer to the surface though.

What does create a danger is a volatilization which happens when the chemicals move as vapors through the soil and into the air. It will dissipate outdoors but it can and has gotten into buildings in the contamination area.

When that happens it lingers and can be a health concern.

""Defendants knew for many years that they were disposing storing discharging and otherwise releasing toxic poisons and pollutants onto and into the ground groundwaters and surface waters on or near plantiffs' property"" reads the lawsuit of several individuals.

""Yet defendants failed to inform or warn plaintiffs concerning the extent nature cause and origin of this pollution.""

What are TCE and PCE?

Both are clear liquids with a ""chloroform-like"" smell that can be used to remove grease from metal parts according to the Centers for Disease Control. Neither occurs naturally and both can be harmful to humans.

TCE can irritate eyes and skin but also can cause other health issues if someone is exposed to higher concentrations. The CDC says it can ""cause dizziness headaches sleepiness confusion nausea unconsciousness liver damage and even death.""

In addition TCE can cause kidney cancer and possibly liver cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma according to the National Cancer Institute.

PCE is listed as a possible carcinogen according to the CDC. It can irritate the eyes skin nose throat respiratory system and can cause liver damage.

More than lower property values

Lawsuits began popping up just months after people in the area started to be notified by DEQ.

The lawsuit that seeks class-action status was filed in federal court on Jan. 6. The list of plaintiffs stretches for two pages. Another initially filed in the 35th Judicial District Court in Grant Parish includes 44 individuals and four limited liability companies as plaintiffs.

Others count couples or individuals as plaintiffs. At least 14 lawsuits have been filed.

They allege their property values have been damaged and some seek to have the environmental damage done to their properties repaired. One initially filed in East Baton Rouge Parish alleges that Dresser intentionally drained fluids from the plant onto his property which has been in his family since the 1920s.

But some also detail what they contend are adverse health consequences of the contamination. For example:

One couple living on Champions Way with their granddaughter who became pregnant with twins. All were exposed according to the lawsuit and the granddaughter ""lost one unborn child and the other ... was born with one or more developmental abnormalities including a cleft lip and palate.""

Another lawsuit details what happened to four people who lived on Titleist Drive Deerbrook Trail and Shreveport Highway. One man was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma while one woman died from the same disease. Another woman died from liver cancer while a Dry Prong resident was diagnosed with kidney cancer.

A married couple living on W. Medalist Drive alleges the contamination is responsible for the wife's cancer diagnosis in 2018.

A resident of Aurora Drive blames the contamination for her seizures headaches and mental anguish.

What's next?

None of the lawsuits are ready to move forward to trials yet. And some of the responses highlight the tough time plaintiffs will have recovering damages from DEQ.

""First contrary to plaintiffs' contentions LDEQ does not owe plaintiffs a general duty to investigate in any particular way and remediate purported contamination of their property"" reads part of a filing on behalf of Haliburton Energy Services Inc. in one of the lawsuits.

On June 9 U.S. District Judge David C. Joseph granted motions filed by multiple defendants to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims in that lawsuit for failure to state a claim.

A status conference via video is set in other lawsuits for June 15.

Meanwhile cleanup continues in the area as some residents debate whether to try to sell their properties.",,,,,,,,,

Rediscovering the Origins of Connecticut Women Artists',"The exhibition featuring Connecticut Women Artists opened at The Art Museum at the University of Saint Joseph in West Hartford on June 10 and runs through Aug. 21.



Submitted

The Art Museum University of Saint Joseph features “WHERE ARE THE WOMEN? Rediscovering the Origins of Connecticut Women Artists” which opened on Thursday June 10 2021. The exhibition will run through Aug. 21.

WHERE ARE THE WOMEN? is the first historical survey of works by the earliest members of The Society of Women Painters and Sculptors of Hartford (now Connecticut Women Artists). The Society was founded with the encouragement of A. Everett (Chick) Austin Jr. Director of the Wadsworth Atheneum who surely noted that women artists were frequently absent from exhibitions in Hartford’s male-dominated arts community. As a result two accomplished painters Jessie Goodwin Preston (1879-1973) and Helen Townsend Simpson (1886-1977) established an organization of women artists with the promise of annual exhibitions at the Atheneum.

The Society of Women Painters and Sculptors of Hartford opened its first groundbreaking exhibition in 1929 offering women a new opportunity to display and sell their work professionally.

WHERE ARE THE WOMEN? features highlights from the work of 23 founding members and early exhibitors rediscovering individual artists’ achievements and revealing the significant role these women and their new Society played in the life of early 20th century Connecticut. It brings together more than 70 works many of which have descended in the artists’ families and have never been seen by contemporary audiences.

Preston and Simpson had a community of professionally trained artists from which to draw members of their new Society and attract exhibitors to their annual shows. Among them were Evelyn Longman [Batchelder] a sculptor who contributed to the Lincoln Memorial and was the first woman elected to the National Academy of Design; several women who studied in Hartford and New York with famed early 20th century artists and teachers Robert Henri and William Merritt Chase; and several founding members of Hartford’s Town and County Club formed by women from the city’s most prominent families.

WHERE ARE THE WOMEN? has been organized in collaboration with Connecticut Women Artists Inc. and is supported in part by the Edward C. and Ann T. Roberts Foundation an Anonymous Foundation and Friends of the Art Museum.

The Art Museum University of Saint Joseph is located in Bruyette Athenaeum on the University’s main campus at 1678 Asylum Avenue West Hartford. It is open Wednesday through Saturday 11 a.m.-4 p.m.; closed Monday Tuesday and Sunday. Admission is free. For more information visit www.usj.edu/artmuseum.

After seeing all of the new LEGO Infinity Saga sets go live the folks at Hasbro are now getting in on the action with the launch of three new Marvel Legend props from the MCU. Ranging from the iconic Iron Man Nano Gauntlet to a Doctor Strange’s signature pendent you’ll want to heads below for all of the details and info on locking in pre-orders.

Hasbro expands Marvel Legends lineup with three new releases

With three new relics from the MCU Hasbro is now bringing the same attention to detail as the rest of its Marvel Legends lineup to some new collectibles. Across the lineup you’re looking at full 1:1-scale recreations to showcase up on display or don for some authentic cosplays.

Iron Man Nano Gauntlet

A fitting place to start is the end at least in the context of Tony Stark. Arguably the most memorial moment in all of the MCU so far Endgame wraps up with the snap of Iron Man’s fingers and now you can recreate that at home. Debuting later this year on November 1 the new Iron Man Nano Gauntlet arrives complete with all six of the Infinity Stones. Pre-orders have now gone live with a $124.99 price tag.

Winter Soldier Stealth Shield

Following the Falcon and the Winter Soldier hype Hasbro is also expanding its Marvel Legends lineup to give fans yet another version of Captain America’s shield. Straight out of The Winter Soldier the Stealth Shield spans 24-inches in diameter and is complete with a slick blue and silver color scheme. Those wanting to add it to their collection can lock-in a pre-order at $120.99.

Eye of Agamotto

Hasbro’s final addition to the Marvel Legends collection delivers yet another iconic item from the MCU this time centered around the Sorcerer Supreme’s magical talisman the Eye of Agamotto. Playing a pretty crucial part in Infinity War the relic comes with a display stand to showcase the internal Time Stone in your collection.

Alongside a light-up function there’s also a cord to wear it around your neck. Slated to be released on October 1 pre-orders are now available for Amazon. It enters as the most affordable of the new Marvel Legends props at $49.99.

9to5Toys’ Take:

While Hasbro’s Black Series has long been synonymous with highly-collectible figures so too has the Marvel Legends been at the forefront of display-worthy props. The latest three releases definitely seem to be continuing that legacy with some exciting new releases. While the Stealth Shield isn’t the biggest fan-favorite in terms of iconic items from the MCU the Iron Man Nano Gauntlet and Eye of Agamotto are certainly mainstays that at long last. have joined the Marvel Legends collection.

If you’re unfamiliar with the Chella Toys Wrestling Megastars wrestling figure toy line it’s a recently released independent toy line that’s UK based. They’ve been taking pre-orders for Hasbro/Retro-style figures for wrestlers like Ethan Page Dynamite Kid Bryan Clark and many others! They also released a limited Nick Aldis figure which you can see here.

If you’re not based in the UK you can get them from Figure Collections. Figure Collections is an official partner with Chella Toys and will be carrying all future products including the Wrestling Megastars and Uncensored Collection! You can order and pre-order items today at shop.figurecollections.com!

The Packaging

The packaging of this set much like the Nick Aldis is very reminiscent of the old WWE Hasbro figures from the 90s. The size and card style as well as the illustrations on the back. The figures as well look very much like the old ones and will scale just fine with them too. These however do not have any action sequences.

The Figures

Blue Meanie was a guy I grew up watching and always wanted a figure of. It’s crazy we never really got one of him until much later from Figures Toy Company and now Chella Toys in this scale. A very colorful character to say the least was very deserving of a figure in my opinion. That being said looking at Meanie he is super detailed for his scale. His arms swivel up and down as well. You can see the detail on his shirt his face paint and even the laces on his boots.

If you’re a fan of Meanie I recommend it as it’s a cool collectible to have especially if you love the old Hasbro and Mattel Retro style figures!

Next up we have Josh Shernoff and I believe this is his very first action figure. It of course has the cartoon style look than a realistic look but his figure is still awesome as well. His arms swivel up and down too and he even comes with a microphone that removes from his hand. You can see the detail in his attire especially the minor details with the logos on his suit and tie. Not to mention the logo on the microphone as well.

Overall

Overall this is a very fun set and it’s cool Chella did a 2-pack for collectors. The packaging is awesome and the figures honestly are really fun too. I was very excited to get my hands on these and appreciate Chella Toys giving me the opportunity to review them. If you’re interested in their future releases be sure to head over to Figure Collections and grab them while you can! Some of these are very limited and they also revealed their new 7-inch action figure line too!

But Knight’s wound while requiring about 30 stitches wasn’t life-threatening. Hospital records called it ""mild."" The people in white coats quickly scattered he remembered and he went home about three hours later.

""Basically it was just a gash on my arm"" said Knight 71. ""The emergency team that they assembled didn’t really do anything.""

Nevertheless Chippenham owned by for-profit chain HCA Healthcare included a $17000 trauma team ""activation"" fee on Knight’s bill which totaled $52238 and included three CT scans billed at $14000. His care should have cost closer to $3500 total according to claims consultant WellRithms which analyzed the charges for KHN.

HCA Healthcare’s activation fees run as high as $50000 per patient and are sometimes 10 times greater than those at other hospitals according to publicly posted price lists. Such charges have made trauma centers once operated mainly by established teaching hospitals a key part of the company’s growth and profit-generating strategy corporate officials have said. HCA’s stock has doubled in three years.

The biggest U.S. hospital operator along with the Department of Veterans Affairs HCA has opened trauma centers in more than half its 179 hospitals. It operates trauma centers at 11 of its more than 40 Florida hospitals and says it runs 1 of every 20 such facilities in the country.

And it’s not slowing down.

HCA ""has basically taken a position that all of their hospitals should be trauma centers"" said Dr. Robert Winchell describing conversations he had with HCA officials. Winchell is a trauma surgeon and former chairman of the trauma evaluation and planning committee at the American College of Surgeons.

Average HCA trauma activation charges are $26000 in states where the company does business — three times higher than those of non-HCA hospitals according to data from Hospital Pricing Specialists a consulting firm that analyzed trauma charges in Medicare claims for KHN.

The findings are similar to those reported by the Tampa Bay Times in 2014 early in HCA’s trauma center expansion. The Times found that Florida HCA trauma centers were charging patients and insurers tens of thousands of dollars more per case than other hospitals.

Trauma patients are typically those severely injured in automobile accidents or falls or wounded by knives or guns.

State or local regulators confer the designation ""trauma center"" often in concert with standards verified by the American College of Surgeons. The status allows a cascade of lucrative reimbursement including activation fees billed on top of regular charges for medical care. Trauma centers are mostly exempt from 1970s-era certificate-of-need laws enacted to limit excessive hospital spending and expansion. The bills for all this — reaching into tens of thousands of dollars — go to private insurers Medicare or Medicaid or patients themselves.

""Once a hospital has a trauma designation it can charge thousands of dollars in activation fees for the same care seen in the same emergency room"" said Stacie Sasso executive director of the Health Services Coalition made up of unions and employers fighting trauma center expansion by HCA and others in Nevada.

HCA’s expansion into trauma centers alarms health policy analysts who suggest its motive is more about chasing profit than improving patient care. Data collected by the state of Florida analyzed by KHN shows that regional trauma cases and expensive trauma bills rise sharply after HCA opens such centers suggesting that many patients classified as trauma victims would have previously been treated less expensively in a regular emergency room.

Patients admitted to HCA and other for-profit hospitals in Florida with a trauma-team activation were far more likely to be only mildly or moderately injured compared with those at not-for-profit hospitals researchers have found.

HCA is ""cherry-picking patients"" said Ed Jimenez CEO of the University of Florida Health Shands which runs a Level I trauma center the highest designation. ""What you find is an elderly person who fell and broke their hip who could be perfectly well treated at their local hospital now becomes a trauma patient.""

HCA’s trauma center expansion makes superior care available to more patients providing ""lifesaving clinical services while treating all critically injured patients"" said company spokesperson Harlow Sumerford.

Richmond’s population ""is booming"" said Chippenham spokesperson Jeffrey Caldwell. ""This increase in demand requires that the regional health care system keep up.""

Trauma is big business

HCA’s trauma center boom picked up speed in Florida a decade ago and has spread to its hospitals in Virginia Nevada Texas and other states. It has sparked fierce fights over who handles highly profitable trauma cases and debates over whether costs will soar and care suffer when rival centers go head-to-head competing for patients.

""There’s no question it’s a money grab"" by HCA said Jimenez who was part of a largely unsuccessful effort to stop HCA’s trauma center expansion in Florida. ""It was clear that their trauma activation fees were five or six times larger than ours.""

In a process shielded from public view in Virginia Chippenham recently applied for and won the highest trauma center designation Level I providing the most sophisticated care — and putting it squarely in competition with nearby VCU Health. VCU has run the region’s only Level I facility for decades. In October Chippenham announced a contract for its own helicopter ambulance which gives it another way to increase its trauma business by flying patients in from miles away. The Virginia Department of Health rejected KHN’s request to review HCA’s Chippenham trauma center application and related documents.

""This is a corporate strategy"" by HCA ""to grow revenue maximize reimbursement and meet the interest of stockholders"" said Dr. Arthur Kellermann CEO of VCU Health who says his nonprofit state-run facility is sufficient for the region’s trauma care needs. ""Many people in the state should be concerned that the end result will be a dilution of care higher costs and poorer outcomes.""

Chippenham’s Caldwell said the ""redundancy"" with VCU ""allows the region to be better prepared for mass trauma events.""

Studies show trauma centers need high volumes of complex cases to stay sharp. Researchers call it the ""practice makes perfect"" effect. Patients treated for traumatic brain injuries at hospitals seeing fewer than six such cases a year died at substantially higher rates than such patients in more experienced hospitals according to a 2013 study published in the Journal of Neurosurgery.

Another study published in the Annals of Surgery showed that a decrease as small as 1% in trauma center volume — because of competition or other reasons — substantially increased the risk that patients would die.

By splitting a limited number of cases a competing cross-town trauma center could set the stage for subpar results at both hospitals goes the argument. The number of VCU’s admitted adult trauma patients decreased from nearly 3600 in 2014 before Chippenham attained Level II status to 3200 in 2019 VCU officials said.

Chippenham was the only Level I center in Virginia that declined to disclose its trauma patient volume to KHN.

""People are trying to push the [trauma center] designation process beyond what may be good for the major hospitals that are already providing trauma care"" said Dr. David Hoyt executive director of the American College of Surgeons speaking generally. Local authorities who make those decisions he said can be ""pressured by a hospital system that has a lot of economic pull in a community.""

Unlike regular emergency departments Level I and Level II trauma centers make trauma surgeons neurosurgeons and special equipment available around the clock. Centers with Levels III or IV designations offer fewer services but are still more capable than many emergency rooms with round-the-clock lab services and extra training for example.

Hospitals defend trauma team activation fees as necessary to cover the overhead of having a team of elite emergency specialists at the ready. At HCA hospitals they can run more than $40000 per case according to publicly posted charge lists although the amount paid by insurers and patients is often less depending on the coverage.

""Fees associated with trauma activation are based on our costs to immediately deploy lifesaving resources and measures 24/7"" said HCA spokesperson Sumerford adding that low-income and uninsured patients often pay nothing for trauma care. ""What patients actually pay for their hospital care has more to do with their insurance plan"" than the total charges he said.

There is no standard accounting for trauma-related costs incurred by hospitals. One method involves multiplying hourly pay for members of the trauma team by the potential hours worked. Hospitals don’t reveal calculations but the wide variation in fees suggests they are often set with an eye on revenue rather than true costs say industry analysts.

Reasonable charges for Knight’s total bill would have been $3537 not $52238 according to the analysis by WellRithms a claims consulting firm that examined his medical records and Chippenham’s costs filed with Medicare. Given his minor injury the $17000 trauma activation fee ""is not necessary"" said Dr. Ira Weintraub WellRithms’ chief medical officer.

Often insurers pay substantially less than billed charges especially Medicare Knight’s insurer. He paid nothing out-of-pocket and Chippenham collected a total of $1138 for his care HCA officials said after this article was initially published. But hospitals can maximize revenue by charging high trauma fees to all insurers including those required to pay a percentage of charges say medical billing consultants.

VCU Health charges up to $13455 for trauma activation according to its charge list.

Average HCA trauma activation charges are $26000 in states where the company does business — three times higher than those of non-HCA hospitals according to data from Hospital Pricing Specialists a consulting firm that analyzed trauma charges in Medicare claims for KHN.

Treating trauma patients in the ER is only the beginning of the revenue stream. Intensive inpatient treatment and long patient recoveries add to the income.

""We have more Level I Level II trauma centers today than we have ever had in the company history"" HCA’s then-CEO Milton Johnson told stock analysts in 2016. ""That strategy in turn feeds surgical growth. That strategy in turn feeds neurosciences growth it feeds rehab growth."" Trauma centers attract ""a certain cadre of high-value patients"" Dr. Jonathan Perlin HCA’s chief medical officer told analysts at a 2017 conference.

Patients at HCA’s largely suburban hospitals are more likely than those at an average hospital to carry private insurance which pays much more than Medicare and Medicaid. More than half the company’s revenue in 2020 came from private insurers regulatory filings show. Hospitals in general collect a little more than a third of their revenue from private insurers according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

HCA’s trauma cases can fit the same profile. At Chippenham in south Richmond trauma cases are ""90% blunt trauma"" according to the hospital’s online job posting last year for a trauma medical director. Blunt-trauma patients are generally victims of car accidents and falls and tend to have good insurance analysts say.

VCU and other urban hospitals on the other hand treat a higher share of patients with gun and knife injuries — penetrating trauma — who are more often uninsured or covered by Medicaid. About 75% of VCU’s trauma cases are classified as blunt trauma hospital officials said.

The 90% figure is ""not accurate today"" Caldwell said. ""Chippenham’s current mix of trauma type is aligned with that of other trauma centers in the region and we treat traumas ranging from motor vehicle accidents to gunshots stabbings and other critical injuries regularly.""

‘Trauma drama’ in Florida and beyond

HCA’s growth strategy is part of a wider trend. From 2010 to 2020 the number of Level I and Level II trauma centers verified by the American College of Surgeons nationwide increased from 343 to 567.

Nowhere has HCA added trauma centers more aggressively or the fight over trauma center growth been more acrimonious than in Florida. The state’s experience over the past decade may offer a preview of what’s to come in Virginia and elsewhere.

In the thick of the controversy legislators stepped in to broker a 2018 truce — but only after the number of HCA trauma centers in the state had grown from one to 11 over more than a decade and helped spark an explosion in trauma cases according to Florida Department of Health data.

News headlines called it ""trauma drama."" Hospitals with existing centers repeatedly filed legal challenges to stop the expansion with little effect. Florida’s governor at the time was Rick Scott former chief executive of Columbia/HCA a predecessor company to HCA.

After launching Level II centers across the state HCA officials urged Florida regulators not to adopt CDC guidelines recommending severely injured patients be treated at the highest level of trauma care in a region — Level I if available.

HCA ""kept on working working working working for 10 years"" to gain trauma center approvals over objections said Mark Delegal who helped broker the legislative settlement as a lobbyist for large safety-net hospitals. ""Once they had what they wanted they were happy to lock the door behind them.""

HCA hospitals ""serve the health care needs of their communities and adjust or expand services as those needs evolve"" said Sumerford.

As HCA added trauma centers trauma-activation billings and the number of trauma cases spiked according to Florida Department of Health data analyzed by KHN. Statewide inpatient trauma cases doubled to 35102 in the decade leading up to 2020 even though the population rose by only 15%. HCA’s share of statewide trauma cases jumped from 4% to 24% the data shows.

Charges for trauma activations also known as trauma-alerts for HCA’s Florida hospitals averaged $26890 for inpatients in 2019 while the same fees averaged $9916 for non-HCA Florida hospitals the data shows. Total average charges including medical care were $282600 per case in 2019 for inpatient trauma cases at HCA hospitals but $139000 for non-HCA hospitals.

HCA’s substantially higher charges didn’t necessarily result from patients with especially severe injuries public university research found.

Over three years ending in 2014 Florida patients with sprains mild cuts and other non-life-threatening injuries were ""significantly more likely"" to be admitted under trauma alerts at HCA hospitals and other for-profit hospitals than at nonprofit hospitals according to research by University of South Florida economist Etienne Pracht and colleagues. HCA hospitals have admitted emergency department Medicare patients at substantially higher-than-average rates since 2011 suggesting that at other hospitals many would have been sent home new research by the Service Employees International Union found.

""What’s going on with HCA is the Wall Street model they’re following"" said Pracht who provided KHN with additional Florida Department of Health data showing soaring trauma cases. ""And Wall Street’s not happy unless you’re expanding. They’re driven by the motive to keep the stock price high.""

Lobbying and Campaign Dollars

In Virginia health care organizations need to go through a lengthy and public application process to add something as basic as a $1 million MRI imaging machine.

But to open or upgrade a trauma center all that’s needed is the approval of the health commissioner after a confidential qualification procedure. Chippenham did not seek or obtain Level I verification from the American College of Surgeons before getting Level I approval from the state. It is ACS-verified as a Level II center and Caldwell said is seeking Level I status with ACS.

Virginia requires an ""extensive application"" and ""in-depth"" site reviews by experts before a hospital gains status as a trauma center Dr. M. Norman Oliver the commissioner said in an email. ""Chippenham Hospital met the requirements"" to become a Level I center he said.

Nearly 80% of HCA’s Level I and Level II trauma centers have been verified by the American College of Surgeons ""and the others currently are pursuing this verification"" said HCA spokesperson Sumerford.

As in other states HCA invests heavily in Virginia in political influence. Eleven Virginia lobbyists are registered with the state to advocate on HCA’s behalf. One lobbyist spent more than $5000 from December 2019 through February 2020 treating public officials to reception spreads and meals at posh Richmond restaurants such as L’Opossum and Morton’s the Steakhouse lobbying records submitted to Virginia’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Advisory Council show. HCA’s political action committee donated $160000 to state candidates last year according to the records.

Like other hospital systems HCA hires former paramedics for ""EMS relations"" or ""EMS outreach"" jobs. HCA’s EMS liaisons are expected to develop a ""business plan driving service line growth"" according to its employment ads.

Chippenham’s decision to start a helicopter-ambulance operation last year to compete with others in transporting trauma patients surprised some public officials. HCA and its contractor had filed paperwork for the operation to be reimbursed by insurers when Richmond City Council members learned about it. Members ""were not up to speed on this matter"" councilwoman Kristen Larson told a May 2020 meeting of the Richmond Ambulance Authority according to the minutes.

Chippenham’s air ambulance partner private equity-owned Med-Trans has been the subject of numerous media reports of patients saddled with tens of thousands of dollars in out-of-network surprise bills. It’s not unusual for air ambulances to charge $30000 or more for transporting a patient from a highway accident or just across town according to news reports.

Last year 85% of Med-Trans flights for Virginia patients with health insurance were in-network said a company spokesperson. But Med-Trans is out of network for Virginia members of Aetna and UnitedHealthcare two of the state’s biggest carriers said spokespeople for those companies. Med-Trans is part of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield’s network an Anthem spokesperson said.

HCA runs trauma centers ""really well"" said Winchell who runs the Level I trauma center at NewYork-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center.

But ""there are clearly areas of oversupply"" for trauma centers generally he said.

Instead of letting a drive for profits dictate trauma center expansion health authorities need ""objective and transparent metrics"" to guide the designation of trauma centers Winchell recently wrote in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons.

Free-market advocate ""Adam Smith might have been a good economist"" he wrote ""but he would have been a very poor designer of trauma systems.""

By Sharon Aron Baron

University Hospital and Medical Center a 317-bed hospital and a leader in breakthrough orthopedic care and joint replacement surgery in South Florida has acquired another robotic system for minimally invasive surgery.

The new addition of a da Vinci Xi robotic system will complement their state-of-the-art existing da Vinci XI and MAKO orthopedic robotic systems to support more precise surgical procedures and shorter recovery periods.

“These devices further demonstrate our commitment to providing state-of-the-art equipment and world-class care to our community” said Ben Harris Chief Executive Officer for University Hospital.

Robotic surgery combines the human touch of highly trained surgeons with the precision of today’s most advanced technology.

These systems can be used across various specialties in gynecology general surgery colorectal surgery urology and orthopedics.

“Just 18 months ago we went from having limited robotic surgical capabilities to now – our third DaVinci robot – which will complement our Mako robotic joint replacement program” said Harris who added the addition was a big milestone for the facility and a large investment in their patients physicians and community.

University Hospital focuses on minimally invasive surgical offerings which means that patients can experience less blood loss shorter hospital stays faster recovery and less scarring.

“We are proud to further our commitment to being a regional destination for advanced robotic surgery offering high-quality care and surgical options to both patients and physicians” said Harris.

University Hospital is part of HCA East Florida the largest healthcare system in Eastern Florida and an affiliate of HCA Healthcare. The health system announced 13 new surgical robots that include da Vinci Xi Mako CORI Ion Rosa and Monarch systems. The company is now home to 42 total surgical robots one of the largest robotic fleets in the region.

“This robotics acquisition speaks to the scale and strength of our HCA East Florida network as well as our commitment to driving innovation and safety across our hospitals” said Charles Gressle HCA East Florida Division President. “We are committed to offering our patients the most sophisticated industry-leading surgical procedures.”

It comes amid growing pressure for the immigration and home affairs ministers to use their discretion to allow the family to live freely in Australia after four-year-old Tharnicaa Murugappan was admitted to Perth Children’s Hospital last week with a blood infection caused by untreated pneumonia.





In an open letter to Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews on Sunday the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) and eight other medical bodies said they were “extremely concerned” by the family-of-four’s ongoing detention which has now surpassed three years.





The Murugappan family have been the only family detained on Christmas Island since August 2019 when an urgent court injunction blocked their imminent deportation to Sri Lanka. Prior to that they had been detained in Melbourne’s Immigration Transit Accommodation. The family has been in detention since 2018. Source: Supplied “Being held in detention presents an extreme and unacceptable risk to children’s health development and mental health. These risks are particularly high for infants and toddlers. If detention is prolonged the consequences may be long term or permanent” the letter read.





“As medical experts we believe that immigration detention is not an environment in which children can thrive and it is not appropriate to continue to hold children in detention.”





The signatories - including President-Elect of RACP Jacqueline Small president of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine John Bonning president of Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine Sarah Chalmers and president of the Australian Primary Health Care Nurses Association Karen Booth - said it was time the family were urgently released.





The letter follows an ongoing campaign by the Australian Medical Association to see the family released into the community .

Tharnicaa was medically evacuated from Christmas Island with her mother Priya on Monday after more than 10 days of high fever vomiting and diarrhoea.





Her condition has stabilised but on Saturday she celebrated her fourth birthday in hospital separated from her father Nades and sister who were forced to remain on the remote island.





The situation has bolstered long-running calls for the family to be released into the community after spending more than three years in immigration detention.





Pressure is also building within the government’s own ranks after Coalition MPs have come forward to express their desire to see the family released.

Liberal backbencher Katie Allen was the latest politician to add her voice to the growing chorus of support tweeting on Sunday that the family’s detention had “gone on for too long”.





""We urgently need a timely resolution to a situation that is endangering the health and well-being of innocent children” she wrote.





It follows comments from Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman and Nationals MP Ken O’Dowd whose electorate takes in Biloela. They have both contacted Immigration Minister Alex Hawke to express support for the family to remain in Australia.





“I think it is time we put this to an end and bring them back to the mainland” Mr Zimmerman said on Saturday.

However not all Coalition MPs agree with Acting Prime Minister Michael McCormack saying that ""what we don't want to see is the boats return"".





""Trent was not in parliament when some of those ships were lost at sea some of those leaky boats were dashed up against rocks and all lives lost"" he said.





""I was. I remember the heartache I remember the loss.""





Mr Hawke is currently reviewing a file on the family’s situation and it is understood a decision on the family’s future could be expected within days.





He declined to comment to SBS News as the matter was still before the court.

Speaking to ABC’s Insiders on Sunday Greens leader Adam Bandt said Australia’s detention system had led to Tharnicaa being transferred to hospital “in a very serious condition”.





""What this particular case has shown is Australia's refugee policy backed by Liberals and Labor is based on putting people like this in effective prisons” he said.





""If they came here again today both Liberal and Labor would send them offshore and we would be back having this debate time after time after time again and we need to end mandatory detention.





“We need a broader rethink.”





A protracted legal battle currently hinges on Tharnicaa’s right to apply for protection after the other three family members exhausted their appeal options.

READ MORE These two children have now been in Australian immigration detention for three years

The parties are now applying for the matter to be heard in the High Court.





The Department of Home Affairs has repeatedly said the family do not meet the criteria for protection visas.

Part of childhood is chocolate but part of adulthood is chocolate too. Whether you're looking for a dark chocolate bar to enjoy with your afternoon cup of coffee during a long work day or you need to indulge in a few bite-size pieces of milk chocolate during your latest Netflix marathon you certainly aren't alone — as a matter of fact the average American consumes 11 pounds of chocolate each year (via The Chocolate Store).

Hershey's has long cashed in on the choco-craze and it has been a staple for the brand for decades. Without Hershey's there would be no Reese's no Kisses and honestly no Halloween worth the trick-or-treating. There would also be no Bliss which was a bag of high-quality chocolates that came in melt-in-your-mouth milk dark and white varieties.

But in 2016 Hershey's lovers were left heartbroken (and in need of some chocolate to heal said heartbreak). The brand unexpectedly pulled Bliss off the shelf without so much as an explanation and it hasn't been seen since.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZXNhLmZtL2VkdWNhdGlvbi8yMDIxLTA2LTEzL3NvbGQtb24tdGhlLXByb21pc2Utb2YtYS1jb2xsZWdlLWVkdWNhdGlvbi1zb21lLWZvcm1lci1taWx0b24taGVyc2hleS1zY2hvb2wtc3R1ZGVudHMtZW5kZWQtdXAtd2l0aC1kZWJ0LWhhcmRzaGlwc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sold On The Promise Of A College Education Some Former Milton Hershey School Students Ended Up With Debt ...,"When Dayshawn Carroll graduated from the Milton Hershey School in 2011 his goal of college seemed firmly within his grasp. He had lived for six years at the nation’s wealthiest private school his days tightly scheduled around studying sports and chores. The school’s manicured campus about 15 miles from the impoverished Harrisburg neighborhood where he had grown up was a world apart — “like Hogwarts” he said referring to the boarding school in the Harry Potter novels.

The school located in Derry Township Pennsylvania requires students to live on campus and Carroll wondered at first if his mom was punishing him by sending him away. But she told her 11-year-old son that the school which only admits children from low-income families was not only free but would pay for his college education too.

The tens of thousands of dollars in college funds though an unusually generous scholarship would turn out to bring new problems.

Charles Fox / Philadelphia Inquirer For Dayshawn Carroll who graduated from the Milton Hershey School 10 years ago the college scholarship money would turn out to be more burden than benefit.

With more than $17 billion in assets the Milton Hershey School is richer than Penn State and the University of Pittsburgh combined. The boarding school educates and houses about 2100 low-income and at-risk children pre-K through high school. In recent years half have come from families with histories of substance abuse around 40% had a family history of mental health problems and about a third had a family member who was incarcerated. According to its tax records MHS spent $91095 per child on academics sports trips mental and physical health care scholarships and living expenses in the 2018-19 academic year — intended as a glide path to the middle class.

The school is unlike almost any other in the U.S. It accepts no government aid and charges no tuition or fees. Nearly $180 million in stock dividends flows tax-free into the school’s coffers each year derived from the high-margin profits from chocolate candies and snacks made by the huge for-profit Hershey Co.

But the institution has struggled for decades to reconcile its runaway financial growth with its founding mission to “break the cycle of poverty.” While school officials point out that enrollment has almost doubled over the past 20 years the institution has faced criticisms that it is not spending enough of its vast wealth on helping poor children. As a private school it is not subject to oversight from the state education department. Besides its board the only body empowered to ensure that the school fulfills its mission is the state attorney general’s office.

The Philadelphia Inquirer Spotlight PA and ProPublica set out to understand how well MHS is fulfilling its mission laid out by chocolate company entrepreneur Milton S. Hershey and his wife Catherine when they founded the school 111 years ago. Reporters analyzed Hershey financial records; reviewed court documents; talked to state officials education experts and child care providers; and interviewed more than 50 former students who graduated between 1940 and 2020 about the school’s impact on their lives.

Many of the alumni interviewed told us they valued their time at the school; as a student body they score highly on standardized tests and many said the school set them up to succeed. But 20 graduates also described the difficulty of the transition to life after high school away from the school’s regimented environment with some comparing life on campus to a “snowglobe” or a “bubble.” Ten former students said they accepted the school’s exacting discipline and the anguish of being away from their families as the price of having college paid for.

Four out of five MHS graduates start post-secondary education immediately after high school enrolling in a certificate program trade school or two- or four-year college. While there is no perfect yardstick for assessing how they fared once they got there we found decidedly mixed results.

Charles Fox / Philadelphia Inquirer The Hershey Industrial School as it was originally known was a place where orphans would milk cows cut hay and learn a trade. Today most graduates of the Milton Hershey School enroll in a post-secondary educational program.

Between 2006 and 2015 about half of those who enrolled in college or another educational program graduated within six years slightly below the national average; administrators say reaching the national average is their goal.

MHS graduates who don’t make it through college though are left with an additional burden: debt. That’s because the school offers high-stakes scholarships earned with good behavior and grades during students’ time at MHS that can backfire for those who start college but don’t finish. Each year they use the scholarship money MHS alums must first take out $2500 in subsidized federal loans personal debt that the school promises to pay off only if they graduate.

This system which was introduced starting with the class of 2011 means that students who start college but don’t finish must pay back the loans on their own leaving them weighed down with debt as they start their adult lives.

The news organizations were in contact with the school throughout the investigation via email exchanges phone calls and a five-hour visit to the campus in April. Before publication we presented MHS with detailed accounts from the students whose stories are told in this article. MHS spokesperson Lisa Scullin initially said the school could not comment on specific students past or present due to privacy laws. We asked five students featured in this article if they would sign broad waivers provided by the news organizations that would allow the school to comment on their accounts. They did but the school again declined to comment claiming that the waivers insufficiently protected students. However when the news organizations provided updated waivers signed by the students that addressed the specific concerns expressed by the school Scullin said: “MHS would never comment publicly on issues that could make it difficult for specific students to succeed either personally or professionally.” She went on to say that the reporting was being done in a way “that failed to protect privacy. The result is an incomplete and misleading story that does not match the truth.”

More broadly the school said that such individual stories were not representative of students’ experiences and the school’s larger pattern of success. And administrators said they had not heard complaints from alumni about the debt requirement.

But the news organizations’ interviews with former students found that the policy caused serious problems for some. In interviews Carroll said he considered skipping college altogether. But not wanting to give up the scholarship money he enrolled at the Harrisburg Area Community College in 2011 and took out the subsidized federal loan newly required by Hershey for his graduating class.

Away from the structure and support of his elite high school Carroll felt adrift. When he didn’t have money for the bus he’d spend almost an hour walking to campus writing rap music in his head and often arriving late. Crushed to discover he was failing several classes he dropped out within five months.

“I just said ‘Screw it’” he recalled. At age 19 and still adjusting to life beyond the confines of the MHS campus he said he didn’t make payments on the loan or realize that failing to pay it off would haunt him for the next decade.

But it did: He worked at a series of convenience stores and then for a debt collection agency — switching jobs to dodge the debt collectors threatening to garnish his wages. By the time he knew what a credit score was his had dropped to “very poor.” Three years ago he said an income tax refund he’d been counting on for rent money was seized to pay back part of the debt.

Carroll remembers his years at MHS playing football and wrestling as some of the best of his life. But when it came to the scholarship program he said the school didn’t take into account how hard the transition to college could be. Now 28 he lives in the neighborhood where he grew up and works at a McDonald’s making $11.25 an hour. Ten years after taking out the loan he still owes just over $950.

In a court hearing last year administrators testified that the school had more money than it could spend having amassed a $1.2 billion surplus. “If you have too much money why are kids taking out loans?” Carroll asked when told about the surplus funds. “Why would you leave them in debt because they’re failing out?”

Milton and Catherine

Milton Hershey had a clear idea of what he wanted when on Nov. 15 1909 he and his wife Catherine signed the 26-page legal document that would be the basis of their charity. The deed reflected the idiosyncratic wishes of its founders: to create the Hershey Industrial School controlled by Milton Hershey’s bank and located on Hershey-owned farms in Derry Township south of Harrisburg where orphans would milk cows and cut hay. Only “poor healthy white male orphans of … ages between four and eight years” would be admitted.

Hershey who himself had dropped out of school to apprentice wanted the boys to be able to earn a decent living right away.

Milton Hershey School Milton Hershey and the early students of the school that bears his name in 1913.

“[T]he main object in view” the Hersheys wrote in the deed “is to train young men to useful trades and occupations” so that once a student left the school “he may be able to support himself.”

The deed added other restrictions: The school would be “permanently” located in Hershey Pennsylvania Milton’s company town and its leaders could spend only the income from the endowment on the school’s students and operations. And the deed spelled out what was expected of students. “If any orphan admitted to the school should be incompetent to learn or master a trade … or become insubordinate or guilty of vice or crime … or become an unfit companion for the others … he may be removed or expelled.”

By the early 1920s 120 boys were enrolled; by the late 1930s that number had grown to around 1000. But by then the nation’s orphanage era was already passing. Child care reformers called for orphans to live with foster parents or advocated for cash payments so disadvantaged children could live at home instead of in institutions.

Catherine passed away in 1915 Milton in 1945. Under the deed control of both the chocolate company and the orphanage passed to individuals who sat on the board of Milton Hershey’s bank. They elected themselves each year to those positions which automatically also made them members of the school’s board — a complex governance structure still in place.

Over time board members modernized the institution breaking with some restrictions in the original deed. Nonwhite orphans were admitted starting in the late 1960s; girls and at-risk children who were not orphans in the next decade. In the 1990s the school moved away from the farm programs and trade-school shops that Milton Hershey had envisioned as the pathway out of poverty and upgraded its academics.

And that academic emphasis shows: In 2019 93.4% of students tested proficient or advanced in literature on the state’s standardized tests compared with the state average of 56.7%. The same year MHS students scored an average of 1091 on the SATs above the national average of 1059. In recent years most MHS graduates have started post-secondary education the fall after high school enrolling at higher rates than the national average and on par with students from wealthier backgrounds.

Not everything has changed with the times. Although its assets have ballooned the school has not changed its financial structure and still spends only the income from the Hershey estate to run the school limiting its annual spending to an average of 2.2% of its assets over the last 20 years.

The board has also kept the school’s residential structure. And its early-20th-century orphanage origins are still reflected in its culture. Many families who begin the application process drop out after realizing they don’t want to be separated from their children the school told us. School officials maintain though that requiring students to live on campus offers them a stable home life; one requirement for admission written into the deed is that a child “is not receiving adequate care from one of his or her natural parents.”

The MHS system can be life-changing. Many graduates are fiercely loyal to the school and say it not only gave them an excellent education but also cared for them when their families could not. They remain lifelong friends with their fellow “Milts” as alums and students call themselves and look back fondly on weekend trips to amusement parks or the Baltimore waterfront. Some said their time at MHS molded them into responsible adults; others still make their beds each morning scrub their floors or line up their toiletries the way they were taught in their student homes.

Anna Marhefka recalled waiting to collect her diploma debt-free during her college graduation ceremony from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania in 2018. She thought back on the day when at the age of 13 she had left her family in Massachusetts to enroll at the Milton Hershey School.

Marhefka was the first in her family to graduate from college. Her eyes welled up. She saw that her mother up in the stands was crying too. “It was like a profound movie moment” she said. “Out of all the kids MHS could have selected I was given that shot and here I am walking across the stage.”

Asked about the school’s success in preparing kids for college MHS officials pointed to cases like Marhefka’s. They said students now receive extensive support after they graduate from high school and noted that MHS alums earn bachelor’s degrees at higher rates than low-income students nationwide based on a recent three-year average. This is perhaps unsurprising given the school’s unparalleled resources and the fact that it screens all children who apply and accepts only those whose health and intelligence (as measured through IQ tests) meet its standards. School officials also consider applicants’ character and leadership ability.

Administrators reiterated that the school’s own surveys of its alumni found that they have household incomes slightly higher than the national average and are less likely to be unemployed.

Interviews with other students however present a different picture. They made clear that the bargain they had made to attain their education had backfired.

Scholarships with strings

Ask MHS graduates what drew them to the school and the overwhelming answer is “college.”

The school is in fact unique in this regard: The current $95000 scholarship could cover most of the various costs of obtaining a bachelor’s degree at a Pennsylvania state-run college. Nationally only 3% of all undergraduate scholarship recipients receive more than $2500 in scholarship funds per year.

Scullin the school’s spokesperson said families rarely identify the chance to earn a college scholarship as a top reason for sending their children to MHS. But 16 former students said in interviews that the promise of money for college was one of the main reasons they enrolled or stayed at the school.

As seniors MHS students live in dorm-style apartments to prepare them for the freedoms of college and adult life. One longstanding ritual for MHS seniors is a school-financed shopping spree to get ready for life outside the Hershey campus which has strict rules about students’ clothes including what they wear outside of the classroom.

But the scholarship money comes with strings part of a culture of strict discipline and penalties for misbehavior. While in high school students earn the funds each year through good grades and behavior: 5% as a freshman 10% as a sophomore 30% as a junior then 50% senior year. If a student’s grades slip or they misbehave they can lose tens of thousands of dollars of their scholarship.

Taylor Bost a 2011 MHS graduate grew up in a one-bedroom apartment in public housing in Wilmington and attended public schools. But his mother — who was suffering from kidney disease and was on dialysis — wanted something better for him. A nurse told her about MHS and Bost enrolled in 2004 as a sixth grader he said. He remembers seeing the student home where he would live for the first time “Just like ‘Wow’ just like a little kid.” Then came the student handbook laying out the rules and expectations for a Milton Hershey student — “Bigger than a hoagie” he joked.

Charles Fox / Philadelphia Inquirer Taylor Bost 28 enrolled at the school as a sixth grader. He was in awe of the beautiful campus but he also remembers the rulebook as being “bigger than a hoagie.”

Students live in group homes of eight to 12 cared for by MHS staff known as “houseparents” who under school rules must be married couples. Among their responsibilities: to monitor and rate student behavior as the front-line enforcers of the school’s disciplinary program a tiered system of merits and demerits.

In their MHS homes alums said they were ranked by how well they did their chores and followed rules. Among the behaviors that graduates told us affected their ranking: gossiping being late not eating all their dinner having a bad attitude and failing to vacuum and dust properly. A higher ranking would lead to more privileges like being able to watch TV or having a later bedtime. The system meant that students could share a house but effectively live in separate worlds Bost said.

Alums also described tiers of infractions that led to demerits: Accumulating enough demerits can cost a student thousands of dollars of their scholarship. According to the 2019-20 student handbook for instance a student who accrues more than 50 demerit points in a year risks earning less than the full scholarship amount for that year. More serious misbehavior could lead to a student losing the entire scholarship they would have earned that year.

And a dozen former students said the disciplinary system is not applied evenly. An offense that one set of houseparents might shrug off could result in demerits in another student home.

This system of earning scholarship money based on “good behavior character and proficiency” is written into the deed. School officials said they believe it teaches accountability. So long as a student has decent grades and is “trending in the right direction” they will earn the money each year said Tanya Baynham vice president of Graduate Programs for Success the division of the school that supports students after they finish high school. Since 2010 the majority of students have graduated with the full scholarship amount she said but she declined to specify how many students lose some of the money. Although the penalties for specific infractions have shifted over time Scullin the school’s spokesperson said “minor behavioral infractions never put scholarships at risk.”

When it comes to discipline MHS has its own distinct systems. But perhaps the closest parallels are “no excuses” charter schools which in the past two decades have cropped up across the country and have argued that their exacting rules are critical to helping low-income students succeed academically and prepare for college.

More recently however some schools that once touted this approach have promised a softer touch. Last year the president and the CEO of Uncommon Schools which runs 55 charter schools across the Northeast publicly apologized for the group’s disciplinary policies after students posted criticisms on social media. The largest network of charter schools in Chicago ended a demerit system that cracked down on small infractions and in a letter to alumni apologized for its harsh discipline policies. “We were disguising punishment as accountability and high expectations” officials wrote earlier this year according to WBEZ.

And in 2013 a Brooklyn network of charter schools loosened its rigid discipline and scrapped its color-coded rankings of students’ behavior. The “ceaseless structure” the network’s founder wrote several years later “was doing little to prepare our students to function autonomously in college and beyond.”

At MHS because discipline is tied to college funding the stakes are even higher. Eight former students told the news organizations that they lost some of their scholarship money as a result of disciplinary infractions.

The school wouldn’t comment on the specific disciplinary actions or how they were applied in the student homes. Scullin said that since 2014 the school has “evolved our approach to student behavioral response” to focus on character development and empathy. But she said the tiered system where students earn an increasing percentage of their scholarship each year is still in place.

And that system can have real consequences for students who struggle. After Bost’s mother died of kidney failure his freshman year he stopped caring about chores and kept to himself. “I was detached from everything” he said.

His houseparents that year talked through his feelings and didn’t give him demerits he said. But in his junior and senior years he couldn’t shake his grief and apathy toward the rules governing school and home life and he was tagged with infractions that ate away at his scholarship.

Bost said he wasn’t a troublemaker so much as hapless failing to make his bed or do chores as thoroughly as his houseparents wanted. Of the four behavioral rankings at the time — “Novice” “Brown” “Gold” and “Spartan” the highest — he was repeatedly ranked as “Novice” the lowest. Falling behind in school he’d often stay up late to study then oversleep the next day. He also remembers receiving demerit points for breaking a door and cursing at one of his houseparents. By graduation Bost said he was eligible for only $15000 of the $79000 in total scholarship money that was available to each student in the class of 2011. The school declined to comment on Bost’s account.

Now living in Hazleton Bost works for DoorDash and wonders how things might have gone if he hadn’t lost so much of the scholarship — would he have landed a better job perhaps or be running his own business.

“They don’t give you a chance to live a regular life and make mistakes without taking away your future” he said.

‘The real student debt crisis’

Despite their rigorous high school education and thousands of dollars in college scholarship money MHS graduates still face major obstacles to earning a degree. Low-income students are less likely to graduate may take longer to finish their degrees and are more likely to stop and restart at multiple institutions research shows.

MHS administrators say they understand these challenges. In 2016 the school created a new department to support students after they leave high school with regular check-ins and campus visits. Administrators say that since the program’s launch the number of students staying on for their second year of college has increased by 6 percentage points from 73% to 79% exceeding the national average.

Low-income students are also at risk of financial trouble when they take on debt to pay for their education. Nonetheless starting with the class of 2011 administrators made a change that would have serious repercussions for students who don’t make it through college. Under the policy in order to access their scholarship funds students are required to first take out $2500 per year in subsidized federal loans although the required loan can be for a smaller amount under certain circumstances. If they graduate within six years they can use their scholarship money to pay off the debt. But if they do not they have to pay the loans back on their own.

While the policy was intended to encourage graduates to stay in school it has risks.

Borrowers with student loan debt but no degree are roughly five times more likely to default on their loans than those who graduate with a bachelor’s federal data shows even though they tend to owe smaller amounts. Those who owe $5000 or less have the highest default rates. And defaulting adds extra fees to the amount owed and can wreck someone’s credit score for years. Nationally among borrowers who started college in 2011 — the first year MHS students were required to take out loans — 41% of those who left without a degree or certificate had defaulted within five years according to a report from the Center for American Progress a think tank. In a book on financial aid Temple University professor Sara Goldrick-Rab calls borrowers who drop out without a degree “the real student debt crisis.”

The school discourages graduates from borrowing more than the required $2500 per year. Asked why Baynham who oversees the MHS scholarship program acknowledged that additional student loans are “not a great idea” for MHS students. But school officials said the required loans are “an intentionally low amount.” Baynham said the school believes students see them “as an investment in their future and I would hope that would be motivating and inspiring to them.”

Taylor Robinson who graduated from MHS in 2015 and later from Penn State remembered learning about the loan requirement during a ninth-grade class. She recalls being told that school officials made the change because students in previous years hadn’t taken college seriously enough. “It was to hold us accountable.” Seven other former students recalled hearing similar explanations.

The three news organizations spoke with 11 higher-education experts who said the design of the scholarship program was highly unusual and had not seen research to suggest that the prospect of debt would give students an incentive to complete college. They said the overall benefits of such a policy were murky while the risks of requiring low-income students to take out loans were clear.

Mark Kantrowitz a financial aid expert and former publisher of a website about college financial aid said some low-income students would inevitably drop out of college because of factors beyond their control and that taking on debt would put some of them at a permanent financial disadvantage. “I don’t think of that kind of policy as being morally defensible” he said.

In fact recent trends have gone in the opposite direction. In the past 20 years roughly 75 colleges most highly selective and wealthy have adopted “no-loan” policies offering students financial aid via grants or work-study positions rather than loans.

The Gates Millennium Scholars Program which offers scholarships to low-income students of color who excelled academically in high school also advises students not to take out loans said Larry Griffith senior vice president for programs and student services at the United Negro College Fund which runs the program.

“We did not want our students to worry where dollars were coming from” Griffith said. “Just like a student from a well-to-do household by not having them work or worry about loans the weights were off and they could perform to the best of their abilities” he said.

“The idea that borrowing student loans provides skin in the game is common but there is no evidence to support it” said Jackie Bright executive director of the National Scholarship Providers Association.

“I find it very strange for an organization that’s got money to burn to be encouraging students to take on debt” said Eddy Conroy a researcher at Temple University’s Hope Center for College Community and Justice.

MHS officials said the loan policy is part of a longer history of requiring graduates to contribute to the cost of college. To support the loan requirement which started with the graduating class of 2011 Scullin the school’s spokesperson pointed to a 2013 academic paper that found that college students who received any financial support from their parents had slightly lower GPAs than those who didn’t. Those findings she said “suggest that the students least likely to excel are those who receive essentially blank checks for college expenses.”

Laura Hamilton the paper’s author and chair of the sociology department at University of California Merced called this a “pretty severe misreading” of her work. “The paper says nothing about debt motivating low-income students” she said echoing other experts’ concerns about the loan requirement. “I can’t see any scholarly basis for this policy.”

In interviews with 19 MHS alumni who started college after the school began requiring students to take out loans nine said they had to pay off the loans themselves after dropping out for a variety of reasons: academic struggles unexpected pregnancy difficulty in adjusting to life on their own. Some were steadily paying the loans off or had already finished. Others had stopped making payments altogether and were facing a cascade of financial consequences.

None said the debt had been an incentive to stay in school.

And although MHS officials said the school provides extensive training in financial literacy many of the former students said they didn’t fully understand the consequences of failing to keep up with payments. Several were confused about how much in loans they had taken out or still owed. Only a few said they knew about repayment options for borrowers experiencing financial hardship; federal studies have repeatedly found that many eligible borrowers miss out on these protections.

John Muerdler who graduated from Hershey in 2011 dropped out of community college after only a few weeks. “It was like the biggest failure ever for me” he said. He borrowed the $2500 required to tap into his scholarship money — plus he estimates another $1200 to pay for expenses the scholarship did not cover.

Muerdler now lives in South Carolina caring for his grandfather working at Target and still dealing with the fallout from his student debt which grew when he tried to go back to school several years later. His grandfather wants to add him to the mortgage for the house they live in so Muerdler can own it one day. But after defaulting on his student loans his credit score is too low. He’s trying to improve it but when letters from debt collectors arrive he only glances at them before throwing them away. “The numbers are just too big” he said. “My anxiety is literally like: ‘Don’t look at it.’”

Other students were confused by the details of the scholarship’s rules.

Kearasten Jordan another 2011 graduate visited Wilkes University with a van of other MHS students and an MHS staffer in her senior year. She borrowed more than the required $2500 per year to be able to afford the private college in northeastern Pennsylvania. Jordan said she didn’t worry about being in debt; she says she thought the school would pay off all her loans if she graduated on time. And she figured of course she would graduate: She thought that the school had prepared her for what was to come.

At Wilkes however Jordan soon began to feel that she didn’t fit in. Milton Hershey had been full of kids who looked like her; at Wilkes she was one of only a handful of Black students. And while other students’ parents would do their laundry for them or whisk them away to vacation homes for the weekend Jordan had to balance classes with working and paying for basic necessities. Jordan said her grades were good but she became depressed. She withdrew after three semesters intending to go back and returned home with $17500 in debt.

Almost nine years later she has defaulted on the loans and her credit score is too low for her to rent her own apartment. She said she still doesn’t fully understand the details of the financial aid package she signed at age 18.

Jordan knows other Milts who dropped out of college. She said many are too ashamed to talk about it. At the school she said students are told over and over they have no reason to fail. Then “they are being shoved into a system that is not prepared for them and does not care for them.”

An MHS lifer’s journey

For former students like Stormy Eny-Edy attending MHS was a trade-off: The generous college scholarship would make the sacrifice of living away from family worth it.

She was a “lifer” there taken in by the school after her mom died when she was 3. She’s thankful for the good times like the summer programs for gifted students she participated in at Johns Hopkins University in seventh and eighth grade. There were some awkward times as well: Over her 14 years there Eny-Edy shuttled between seven student homes and 10 sets of houseparents.

At times she longed to go live with family. Her father aunt and sister urged her not to pass up the chance to go to college. “I stayed for the scholarship” she said.

By the time of her high school graduation in the summer of 2011 the school had put hundreds of thousands of dollars into Eny-Edy’s education and upbringing. She had earned a $75000 college scholarship — she said she lost several thousand dollars her freshman year for consistently failing to tuck in her shirt — to carry her forward to a degree from West Chester University.

At college though she felt lost. “It has its own dress code. It has its own culture” Eny-Edy said of MHS. “You are assimilated into that culture and then you leave and that culture doesn’t mean anything.”

At MHS she had never skipped classes. But now there was no one to make sure she didn’t sleep through her 8 a.m. Spanish class. Nothing seemed to make sense in physics so she stopped going altogether. And when her grades started slipping she didn’t lose privileges or have to do extra chores until she got them back up. In her first semester Eny-Edy earned a GPA below 1.0 and her MHS scholarship was suspended.

Jimena Horta Ballesteros Stormy Eny-Edy 28 spent 14 years at the boarding school. When her grades slipped in her first year in college MHS suspended payments on her scholarship and she had to leave school.

She emailed an MHS official to ask for another chance. “It was a tough transition from MHS to college and I feel strongly that I am comfortable enough now in the college environment to find success in the next semester” she wrote. She told the news organizations she never heard back. MHS declined to comment.

Unsure where things stood Eny-Edy returned to campus for her second semester only to find out on her first day of classes that her balance hadn’t been paid. The college told her she needed to pay it herself or leave the next day she said.

She remembers standing in front of a walk-up window in the registrar’s office crying pleading for more time. Then she went back to her dorm room and packed her things. The next day her dad drove her home.

She spent a year waiting tables in Ohio depressed and isolated not wanting to tell anyone what had happened. “I had worked for 14 years to earn this scholarship and I finally got to the mountaintop and I failed” she said.

By early 2017 older and wiser and ready to give college another try she sent a Facebook message to her seventh grade English teacher at MHS Tanya Baynham asking if her scholarship could be reinstated. Baynham — who was by then overseeing the scholarship program — said there was nothing she could do Eny-Edy recalled. According to another school rule students in her class had five years to use the money. Eny-Edy was a year too late.

It was the largest stockyard east of Chicago and operated from 1895 to the end of the 20th century.

With thousands of steers occupying a 25-acre site near the rail line through Lancaster tons of manure were generated that had to be removed from the pens usually by local farmers to fertilize their fields.

A vintage manure wagon used at the stockyards — dating to somewhere in the mid-20th century — has been restored by Mount Joy farmer Steve Hershey his son Phil and son-in-law Alex.

The restored vehicle is a hybrid of an early 20th-century wooden manure bed built for a horse team and re-mounted probably by a farmer in the 1940s on a Ford Model A chassis for work at the stockyards. It was eventually retired to a Mount Joy farm.

The restored vehicle debuted in early June during the Ford Nationals at the Carlisle Fairgrounds.

But for the marriage of Hershey’s daughter Emily to Alex Koser the Ford Model A wagon may never have been restored. It’s a labor of love and quite a story really.

Koser a Mount Joy native married Emily Hershey his school classmate in 2019. Alex is a 2018 Pennsylvania College of Technology graduate with a degree in auto restoration. He not only loves Emily but also has a strong feeling about restoring vintage vehicles.

“It certainly was a marriage made in heaven” father-in-law Steve Hershey said “as Alex was happy to take the lead in getting the vehicle and chassis ready to hold the manure bed to complete the restoration that Phil and I had been working on off and on for several years.”

So with Alex’s help the vehicle — which sat for decades in a building at Bridge Valley Farm not far from some 400000 chickens — has a new life.

A Labor of Love

The story really started in 2008 when Steve and his wife Heidi traded a career in dairy farming for one in poultry and acquired Bridge Valley Farm from Heidi’s father.

The farm at one time could house as many as a million laying hens in seven buildings. Bridge Valley with nearly a half-million chickens today is still a large operations with the hens producing 30000 dozen eggs daily that are distributed under the R.W. Sauder brand throughout the Northeast.

So how did the old horse-powered manure wagon find its way to the chicken farm?

“Well all the details of the story are somewhat elusive” Hershey said “but we have pieced together much of it as best we can.”

When the Hersheys bought the farm they learned the manure wagon which had been stored in one of the barns by Heidi’s dad for a friend came along with the sale.

Their research traced the old wooden wagon and Model A Ford frame back to the 1940s when it was probably sold by R. M. Brubaker a farm equipment dealer in Landisville. The wagon when Hershey found it was sitting on a 1928 Ford Model A chassis.

“The wagon is a ground-driven manure spreader and the mechanism (web and beater) were driven by the axle of the spreader that turned when being pulled by the horse team” he said. “Similar units can still be bought today and are used on Plain Sect farms either pulled by horses or hitched to a tractor.”

Hershey and son Phil thought it would be fun to do what they described as a “farm restoration” and to use the Model A wagon for parades and fairs.

“We thought it would be neat” Hershey said “and got the manure wagon back into presentable shape but we stalled on the engine as neither of us had much experience in Model A Ford engines that were made between 1927-1931.”

The manure wagon and truck sat where they put it for about a decade.

“We didn’t really have much time to or a plan on how to finish it” Hershey said.

The solution to finish the restoration was closer than they realized and began to come together in 2018 when they asked Koser to take the lead.

“It was either a big coincidence or fate but either way it was great” Hershey said. “Alex loved the idea and while employed at Wissler Motors in Mount Joy began to work on the engine and chassis supplementing what he learned at PCT with online research and conversations with other Ford Model A enthusiasts.”

Emily and Alex settled into a home in Mount Joy in 2019 with a stand-alone three-bay all-season garage where Alex was able to rebuild the Model A engine and restore the chassis over the last 18 months as he prepared to open his own vehicle restoration business.

“It was both intensive and a labor of love and I was fortunate to work on such a historic vehicle right out of school” Koser said. “I networked with a number of Model A enthusiasts along the way and one of the people I worked with has brought his 1929 Model A Sport Coupe to me to work on at my new business.”

Hershey said the wagon and the Model A chassis were assembled Memorial Day weekend and the vehicle received its final tweaks before being exhibited at the Ford event in Carlisle.

“Don’t you love it when a story has a happy ending?” Hershey said as he talked over the putt-putt-putt of the Model A engine with a smiling son-in-law settled on a temporary seat behind the steering wheel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEzbWVtcGhpcy5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9oYXBweS1uYXRpb25hbC1jYW5keS1tb250aC9hcnRpY2xlX2M0NWZkNzE4LTQ3MjctNTVlYS04YzExLTdmZmM3YTg4NzI1Ny5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Happy National Candy Month! | Entertainment | fox13memphis.com,"Memphis TN (38111)

Apple has been the subject of multiple antitrust probes alongside other tech giants including Google.

It seems that Japan will be adding its own investigation to the pile soon one that will affect both the iPhone maker and the search giant.

A government panel will apparently launch this month to look into tightening antitrust regulations according to sources of Nikkei in a report seen by the Mercury News.

The panel will discuss the dealings of Apple and Google with Japanese smartphone producers including whether they handle domestic companies fairly compared to overseas vendors.

It is believed that iOS and Android make up more than 90 per cent of the Japanese smartphone market according to the report.

An analysis by IDC in February pointed to Apple selling nearly half of all mobile phones in the country for the entirety of 2020.

The alleged Japanese probe will become the latest in a long line of similar activity by governments and regulators around the world seeking to curtail the power of tech giants like Apple.

The financing was led by Saudi based Emkan Capital with the participation from Impact46 Seed Fund Taya Group and other strategic investors.

Founded in 2017 by former Barclay’s banker Janardan Dalmia Trukkin is an aggregator that digitises the process of matching shippers with truckers to bring about transparency reliability and efficiency to the logistics industry.

Trukkin also works towards building fintech solutions for payments insurance and financial services. These solutions lay the groundwork for more financial inclusion for the unbanked and increase much needed transparency and efficiency for suppliers.

Janardan Dalmia Founder and CEO of Trukkin said: “I’m immensely proud of the team and the growth we’ve achieved over the course of the last year as we expanded into Pakistan and grew revenues despite the difficult environment presented by COVID.

“We are excited to close the round with strategic investors like Emkan Capital and Impact46 it confirms our vision of creating a world-class regional aggregation platform to enable logistics for the shippers and transporters.”

Since its launch in Pakistan Trukkin has continued to invest in technology and expand its services to newer markets while deepening their presence further in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Ghassan Aloshban GP at Emkan Capital said: “Trukkin has exhibited incredibly efficient use of capital and we’re impressed with what they’ve been able to achieve in such a short time frame. Its core team with over 200+ years of combined industry experience have showcased their expertise in not only navigating but driving growth during the pandemic.”

The Impact46 team added: “The Trukkin team has shown its unique ability to build businesses across multiple geographies in three years while retaining the strong culture of the company. We are confident in their ability to build manage and scale the business.”

“We see enormous growth potential in the logistics industry in the MENAP (Middle East and Pakistan) region the size of the market is considerable at over USD50 billion. Currently local fragmented players dominate the market in the region and we are working to be an enabler that brings this fragmented market together on an integrated world-class platform to showcase collective growth” Janardan said while commenting on the platform’s future.",,,,,,,,,

The airline industry’s recovery from the pandemic passed a milestone as more than 2 million people streamed through U.S. airport security checkpoints on Friday for the first time since early March 2020.

The Transportation Security Administration announced Saturday that 2.03 million travelers were screened at airport checkpoints on Friday. It was the first time in 15 months that the number of security screenings has surpassed 2 million in a single day.

Airline bookings have been picking up since around February as more Americans were vaccinated against COVID-19 and – at least within the United States – travel restrictions such as mandatory quarantines began to ease.

The recovery is not complete. Friday's crowds were only 74% of the volume compared to the same day in 2019. However the 2.03 million figure was 1.5 million more travelers than the same day last year according to the TSA.

The 2-million mark represents quite a turnaround for the travel industry which was hammered by the pandemic. There were days in April 2020 when fewer than 100000 people boarded planes in the U.S. and the CEO of Boeing predicted that at least one major U.S. airline would go bankrupt.

Most of the airlines are still losing money. Southwest eked out a narrow first-quarter profit thanks to its share of $64 billion in federal pandemic relief to the industry and others are expected to follow suit later this year.

The fear of large-scale furloughs has lifted. United Airlines which lost $7 billion and threatened to furlough 13000 workers last fall told employees this week that their jobs are secure even when the federal money runs out in October.

That's because airlines like United are upbeat about salvaging the peak summer vacation season. International travel and business trips are still deeply depressed but domestic leisure travel is roughly back to pre-pandemic levels airline officials say.

The airlines are recalling employees from voluntary leave and planning to hire small numbers of pilots and other workers later this year.

Hotel operators say they too have seen bookings improve as vaccination rates rise.

Mike Gathright a senior vice president at Hilton said the company's hotels were 93% full over the Memorial Day weekend. He said the company is “very optimistic” about leisure travel over the summer and a pickup in business travel this fall.

“The vaccine distribution the relaxed travel restrictions consumer confidence — all of that is driving occupancy and improvement in our business” Gathright said.

Prior to the pandemic TSA screened on average 2 million to 2.5 million travelers per day. The lowest screening volume during the pandemic was on April 13 2020 when just 87534 individuals were screened at airport security checkpoints.

By the middle of last month TSA's average daily volume for screenings was approximately 65% of pre-pandemic levels.

As the summer travel season approaches TSA is advising passengers to arrive at the airport with sufficient time to accommodate increased screening time as traveler volumes are expected to approach and in some cases exceed pre-pandemic levels at certain airports.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXJ5bGF1bmNoZXMuY29tL2hvdGVsc19hbmRfcmVzb3J0cy9oaWx0b24taG90ZWwtb24tdGhlLW1vb24ucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Complete with a nuclear powered kitchen push button cocktail dispensers and gorgeous views of the Earth.

While the world is grappling to come to live with the new norms set by the outbreak of the COVID19 pandemic last year individuals and businesses are finding ways to stay afloat if not survive this Armageddon. Ways that are out of this world even. Quite literally.





In a matter of weeks we learned that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos will become the first billionaire to make it to space if and when things go as planned and as early as July. Then we read about Richard Branson dropping possible hints that he could be joining the race too with his Virgin Galactic spaceflight perhaps making a maiden trip to space on the July 4th weekend.

And here we have something even more fascinating; the first space hotel is all set to open in 2027. The initial plan by Gateway Foundation was to open the Voyager Station in 2025 but COVID made them change plans to a later date.

The construction will begin sometime in 2026 by construction company Orbital Assembly Corporation – claimed to the first large-scale space construction company in the world. The hotel a rotating facility will be a 50000 sqm facility and will be able to accommodate some 450 people.



This sounds fabulous and even a bit surreal doesn’t it? A hotel in space! Well the idea used to float around from as far behind as some 70 years ago when the Hilton head honcho at the time Barron Hilton referred that there would be a Hilton hotel in outer space and he would live to see the opening.



Unfortunately I couldn’t live up to that dream but people had taken notice. The idea had first been seeded into the curious minds when the hotel chain during a stage show in 1958 unveiled the Lunar Hilton – a Hilton on the moon.

Mad Men – Hilton Pitch from Paulo Silva on Vimeo.

The news died out slowly afterward but it sprung back up in 2009 on the sets of TV series Mad Men when Don Draper and his team are working on a fictional campaign for a Hilton Hotel on the moon. In the series a character named ‘Connie Hilton’ says “I want a Hilton on the Moon; that’s where we are headed.” Connie could be the reference to the founder of the hotel chain Conrad Hilton.



However it was his son Barron who was the actual dreamer. In 1967 Hilton announced a grand plan at an American Astronomical Society conference including orbiting and lunar hotels. This was two years before Neil Armstrong step foot on the moon even.



The Lunar Hilton was to be an underground hotel on the moon. It would have three levels – the bottom one where the equipment would be kept the engineering happened the middle level with q00 guest rooms and the top level would be a public space with a cocktail lounge. Guests would be able to order a drink and enjoy it with a background of the earth and other space objects.



Another fascinating feature is how the bartenders would prepare the drink. They press a button a pre-measured pre-cooled mixture of pure ethyl alcohol and distilled water will come out. A tablet will be added into this – a capsuled or solidified form of the alcoholic spirit of preference – and voila. As well as the hotel the plan also included the Orbiter Hilton which would have been a space lab with 14 levels and which could accommodate 24 people. This was intended for short trips in space where guests can have ‘stopovers.’



The whole plan was no joking matter for Hilton. He went far and beyond to speak with experts in the aviation and engineering industry. He consulted with Don Douglas chairman of the McDonnell Douglas aircraft manufacturer at the time. He got a feasibility study done by students from the Cornell University who prepared complete sketches and props.



They must humor the space enthusiast at the time – but look who the joke is on now! It is fascinating (yes that word again – an absolute understatement) how a dream and some nudge from technology man can achieve anything ANYTHING he dreams and wishes for. Meanwhile if people plan to get out of this world for survival or leisure it could mean that mother Earth can take a long much-deserved break. One can dream no?

Home Depot contracted its own container ship as a safeguard,"Home Depot is one of the largest importers in the country. Yet with congested ports container shortages and Covid-19 outbreaks slowing shipments the company made a decision: It was time to get its own boat.

""We have a ship that's solely going to be ours and it's just going to go back and forth with 100% dedicated to Home Depot"" President and Chief Operating Officer Ted Decker said in an interview. It marks the first time that the company has taken such a step.

Decker said the contracted ship which will begin running next month is just one example of the unusual measures that the company is taking as it copes with challenges that have ricocheted across the global supply chain.

On rare occasions Home Depot has also flown in power tools faucets electrical components fasteners and other ""smaller higher value items"" by air freight he said. In other cases it has opted to buy items on the spot market — even though it can cost as much as four times more than contracted rates.

Other retailers have also had to go to great lengths to try to stock stores and distribution centers and keep up with consumer demand as the economy recovers from the pandemic. For shoppers retailers' logistical woes are playing out in the form of out-of-stocks long delays before a purchase's arrival and higher prices.

The global shipping snafus come during an important time for the industry said Jonathan Gold vice president of supply chain and customs policy for the National Retail Federation a trade group. Retailers are heading into peak season for shipping holiday merchandise which usually begins in August.

""Right now they are all trying to figure out 'How do we mitigate that risk to make sure that we've got the product here in time for when those holiday season sales start?'"" he said. ""That could mean moving up timing for when you bring your product in which could further lead to additional congestion and delays.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndzYnJhZGlvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL21hbi1raWxsZWQtZHVyaW5nLWFyZ3VtZW50LWhvbWUtZGVwb3QtamFzcGVyLzZLNFVOTVdZVlpCRjdCWDZWQzZVV0dGVVZZL9IBe2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndzYnJhZGlvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL21hbi1raWxsZWQtZHVyaW5nLWFyZ3VtZW50LWhvbWUtZGVwb3QtamFzcGVyLzZLNFVOTVdZVlpCRjdCWDZWQzZVV0dGVVZZLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man killed during argument at Home Depot in Jasper,"We’re Sorry!

Results from the 2023 spring electrofishing survey indicated a 25 percent decrease in the overall catch rate compared to 2021. Anglers should notice a decrease of 12-inch bass captured and improvement in the catch rate of bass at least 15 inches long. Several bass anglers reported catching bass over 18 inches long. Anglers are still encouraged to harvest bass up to their daily limit of six bass less than 12 inches long to continue to improve the size structure of the population. Bluegill fishing should be fair with a slight improvement of bluegill greater than 8 inches when compared to 2021. Anglers in 2023 reported decent catches of bluegill 8 to 9 inches. Redear sunfish will be fair compared to previous years with a majority being 7 inches or less. Black crappie are also abundant but will average 8 to 9 inches in length. Catfish angling (both channels and blues) will continue to be good. Several blue catfish exceeding 30 pounds are caught in the lake each year by rod-and-reel often with a balloon rig.

To protect Hunnewell Hatchery private boats and bait transported or held in containers with water are prohibited. Boats and oars are provided free of charge on a first come first served basis.

Irish lessor Avolon has made a massive commitment to take up to 500 Vertical Aerospace VA-X4 electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft subject to certain conditions. The arrangement inclusive of options is valued at $2 billion. American Airlines has also inked a pre-order for up to 250 of the type. And Virgin Atlantic expects to take up to 150 VA-X4 aircraft.

“Avolon will join Microsoft Rolls-Royce Honeywell and American Airlines as equity investors in Vertical” said Vertical in a statement last week.

Virgin Atlantic which will be a VA-X4 launch airline customer in Europe said: “The goal is to enable sustainable price competitive regional connectivity across the first and last 100 miles of the customer journey. For example reducing the 56-mile journey from Cambridge to London Heathrow to just 22 minutes in comparison to a 1 hour 30 drive by road.

“With 37 towns and cities with populations over 100000 within 100 miles of London Heathrow Airport the VA-X4 offers huge potential to support zero emissions short haul transfers for 7.7 million customers outside of London for flights to and from the UK’s main hub airport.”

The VA-X4 is expected to travel over 200mph with a range of over 100 miles and capacity for four passengers and a pilot.

With billions of dollars in potential commitments the eVTOL aircraft could be certified as early as 2024. Deliveries to Avolon are slated to commence in late 2024.

“Our order with Vertical will also accelerate the inevitable commercial roll out of zero emissions aircraft. Before the end of this decade we expect zero emission urban air mobility enabled by eVTOLs to play an increasingly important role in the global commercial aviation market” said Avolon CEO Dómhnal Slattery.

Derek Kerr CFO at American said: “For years American has led the industry in investing in newer more fuel-efficient aircraft. Today’s partnership is another example of that commitment and an investment in the future of air mobility. We are excited about the prospect of what this could mean for our customers and our company.”

Latin America Hotel Investors Gain Interest in International Brands

The supply of hotels affiliated with international brands across Latin America has historically been low but investors now have growing interest in conversions as more owners understand the importance of branding according to executives speaking at the recent Hotel Opportunities Latin America conference.

""In the region there's a lot of small independent owner-operators that have their own brands with 30 or 35 hotels. They always thought their brand was more important than an international brand"" said Ricardo Mader Rodrigues CEO of Colliers Market Intelligence and Advisory. ""They see now the difference of how a strong brand [and] all the benefits they bring [can make a difference].

""We're seeing a lot of owners finally understanding the value of the brand"" he said. ""It's a great moment for franchising. It's a big change and I believe that the next few years are going to see an increase of brands in the region to franchise.""

In Host's first-quarter 2024 earnings call Risoleo called Nashville the ""market of the future. It's the No. 2 convention market in the United States behind Orlando.""

New Aimbridge CEO Details Company Strategy

In the first few months of Craig Smith taking over as CEO of global-third party management company Aimbridge Hospitality he's focused on meeting with hotel owners brand representatives and corporate teams on what can be improved.

In an exclusive virtual fireside chat with Hotel News Now Smith said some of the feedback he's heard is that the company isn't using its scale to its full advantage.

""We've got to think like a small third-party management company and less like a large company"" he said. ""In other words we use our scale for things that are important to us but our [thinking] has to be like almost a small company that's really dedicated to each owner and each hotel.""

Prior to joining Kyndryl as Chief Marketing Officer Maria had a 25-year career at IBM most recently as the tech giant’s CMO where she oversaw all marketing professionals and activities across North America Canada and Latin America. She has held senior global marketing positions in a variety of disciplines and business units across IBM most notably strategic initiatives in Smarter Cities and Watson Customer Engagement as well as leading teams in services business analytics and mobile and industry solutions. She is known for her work with teams to leverage data analytics and cloud technologies to build deeper engagements with customers and partners.

With a passion for marketing business and people and a recognized expert in data-driven marketing and brand engagement Maria talks to Business Chief about her new role her leadership style and what success means to her.

You've recently moved from IBM to Kyndryl joining as CMO. Tell us about this exciting new role?

I’m Chief Marketing Officer for Kyndryl the independent company that will be created following the separation from IBM of its Managed Infrastructure Services business expected to occur by the end of 2021. My role is to plan develop and execute Kyndryl's marketing and advertising initiatives. This includes building a company culture and brand identity on which we base our marketing and advertising strategy.

We have an amazing opportunity ahead at Kyndryl to create a company brand that will stand apart in the market by leading with our people first. Once we are an independent company each Kyndryl employee will advance the vital systems that power human progress. Our people are devoted restless empathetic and anticipatory – key qualities needed as we build on existing customer relationships and cultivate new ones. Our people are at the heart of this business and I am deeply hopeful and excited for our future.

What experiences have helped prepare you for this new opportunity?

I’ve had a very rich and diverse career history at IBM that has lasted 25+ years. I started out in sales but landed explored opportunities at IBM in different roles business units geographies and functions. Marketing and business are my passions and I landed on Marketing because it allowed me to utilize both my left and right brain bringing together art and science. In college I was no tonly a business major but an art major. I love marketing because I can leverage my extensive knowledge of business while also being able to think openly and creatively.

The opportunities I was given during my time at IBM and my natural curiosity have led me to the path I’m on now and there’s no better next career step than a once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity to help launch a company. The core of my role at Kyndryl is to create a culture centered on our people and growing up in my career at IBM has allowed me to see first-hand how to prioritize people and ensure they are at the heart of progress in everything Kyndryl will do.

How would you describe your leadership style?

I believe that people aren't your greatest assets they are your only assets. My platform and background for leadership has always been grounded in authenticity to who I am and centered on diversity and inclusion. I immigrated to the US from Chile when I was 10 years old and so I know the power and beauty that comes from leaning into what makes you different from other people and that's what I want every person in my marketing organization to feel – the value in bringing their most authentic self to work every day. The way our employees feel when they show up for themselves authentically is how they will also show up for our customers and strong relationships drive growth.

I think this is especially true in light of a world forever changed by the pandemic. Living through such an unprecedented time has reinforced that we are all humans. We can't lead or care for one another without empathy and I think leaders everywhere have been reminded of this.

What’s the best leadership advice you’ve received?

When I was growing up as an immigrant in North Carolina I often wanted to be just like everyone else. But my mother always told me: Be unique be memorable – you have an authentic view and experience of the world that no one else will ever have so don't try to be anyone else but you.

What does success look like to you?

I think the concept of success is multi-faceted. From a career perspective being in a job where you're respected and appreciated and where you can see how your contributions are providing value by motivating your teams to be better – that's success! From a personal perspective there is no greater accomplishment than investing in the next generation. I love mentoring younger professionals – they are the future. I want my legacy as a leader to include providing value in work culture but also in leaving a personal impact on the lives of professionals who will carry the workforce forward. Finding a position in life with a job and company that offers me a chance at all of that is what success looks like to me.

What advice would you give to your younger self just starting out in the industry?

I've always been a naturally curious person and it's easy for me to over-commit to projects that pique my interest. I've learned over years of practice how to manage that so to my younger self I’d say… prioritize the things that are most important and then become amazing at those things.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvd2VsbHN1bi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9wYXBwYXMtcnVubmluZy1mb3ItdHluZ3Nib3JvLXNlbGVjdG1hbi_SAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb3dlbGxzdW4uY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMTIvcGFwcGFzLXJ1bm5pbmctZm9yLXR5bmdzYm9yby1zZWxlY3RtYW4vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pappas running for Tyngsboro selectman,"TYNGSBORO – Ken Pappas is one of four candidates running for a seat on the Board of Selectmen in Tuesday’s town election. He is a nearly 40-year resident of the town.

Two seats are available. One seat is currently held by incumbent David R. Robson who is seeking re-election. The other seat is open because Steven Nocco is not seeking re-election

Pappas has a long record of involvement in town business and activities including serving as a firefighter an EMT a member of the Finance Committee the Capital Planning Committee and the Library Board of Trustees. He’s also coached and mentored youth sports and the Boy Scouts.

Pappas is an IBM executive nearing retirement. He wants to give his time to help solve challenges the town faces he said.

He is particularly committed to letting the town’s professionals — town administrator police chief and fire chief — do their jobs and having the Board of Selectmen set policies.

“I have extensive background in finance strategic planning contracts acquisitions and most importantly I respect people. When I tell you I am going to do something I do” he said.

The issues facing the new board include school building a central fire station and the need for a code of conduct and ethics according to Pappas.

Pappas raised the issue of a code of conduct and ethics at the recent candidates’ forum. “We’ve lost our moral compass” he said regarding the recently troubled relationship the board has had with the police chief.

“No more do I want to hear some residents claim that they were ‘born’ here and make you feel less of a town resident. We are all town residents.”

In an apparent criticism of Robson Pappas said “I am not a candidate that needs to excuse himself from a town issue because of a conflict with a family member in town.” Robson has recused himself on a number of occasions in the last year because his father David E. Robson has caused controversy in his role as animal control officer.

Pappas sought election to the board a year ago. He finished fourth behind two incumbent selectmen and a last-minute write-in candidate. In the interest of “transparency and accountability” he said he would continue his effort by filing suits on complaints of ethics violations and Open Meeting Law violations.

In addition to Pappas and Robson Eric Eldredge and Katerina Kalabokis are seeking election to the board.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzEzL2F1dG8tb3duZXJzLWluc3VyYW5jZS1lbWJhcmtzLWRpZ2l0YWwtdHJhbnNmb3JtYXRpb24tam91cm5leS10aGluazIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Auto-Owners Insurance embarks on digital transformation journey,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://siliconangle.com/2021/06/13/auto-owners-insurance-embarks-digital-transformation-journey-think2021/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzEzL2F1dG8tb3duZXJzLWluc3VyYW5jZS1lbWJhcmtzLWRpZ2l0YWwtdHJhbnNmb3JtYXRpb24tam91cm5leS10aGluazIwMjEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9sYXB0b3BzL2hvdy1hLXRveS1pbnNwaXJlZC10aGUtYnV0dGVyZmx5LWtleWJvYXJkLWRlc2lnbi1vZi10aGUtaWNvbmljLWlibS10aGlua3BhZC03MDFjLTczNTY3NDEv0gGTAWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2xhcHRvcHMvaG93LWEtdG95LWluc3BpcmVkLXRoZS1idXR0ZXJmbHkta2V5Ym9hcmQtZGVzaWduLW9mLXRoZS1pY29uaWMtaWJtLXRoaW5rcGFkLTcwMWMtNzM1Njc0MS9saXRlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How a toy inspired the ‘butterfly’ keyboard design of the iconic IBM ThinkPad 701C,"Every laptop is not the same and every laptop is not the IBM ThinkPad 701C. Arguably the most fascinating ultraportable computer ever made the IBM ThinkPad 701C’s unique full-size butterfly keyboard — designed by John Karidis and inspired by his daughter’s toy — in the compact laptop was something unheard of at the time.

“The biggest reason the butterfly keyboard came out was [these] business laptops were obviously very popular with business folks and the biggest complaint that we got from customers was the competing laptops were too small” Dilip Bhatia Chief Customer Experience Officer and Vice-President of User & Customer Experience at Lenovo remembers the IBM ThinkPad 701C and how it changed the market for ultraportable business laptops.

The ThinkPad 700 series concept was introduced by International Business Machines Corporation (Lenovo acquired IBM’s PC business and the iconic ThinkPad brand in 2005) to create a new category of business laptops that’s easier to carry and use. The challenge for the team was to fit a full-sized keyboard alongside a 10.4-inch LCD colour display into the next ThinkPad 701C portable laptop.

To solve the unique design problem Dr. John Karidis an IBM distinguished engineer took on the challenge to develop the “Butterfly” keyboard. Bhatia explains that Karidis a mechanical engineer with IBM’s Personal Computing Division at that time got the idea of a foldout butterfly keyboard by observing his three-year-old daughter who was building shapes out of her toy blocks. Observing his daughter play with wooden blocks Karidis thought of cutting the board across the number 4 T H and M keys. That way the board was broken into two distinctive movable parts. That was how the “Butterfly” keyboard came about.

“At that time the only screen available was a 10.4-inch screen. The problem statement was how do we integrate a full-size keyboard in a sub-notebook form factor which was the 700 series at that time. So the design started in 1993 and the product came out in early 1995 “ Bhatia sheds light on the development of the ThinkPad 701C.

Perhaps the most distinctive thing that made the ThinkPad 701C so different from other notebooks was its fold-out keyboard. (Image credit: Lenovo) Perhaps the most distinctive thing that made the ThinkPad 701C so different from other notebooks was its fold-out keyboard. (Image credit: Lenovo)

From the outside the ThinkPad 701C was an ordinary-looking IBM laptop all back and solid and a boxy right-angled external case design. But when you open the lid the real magic happens. Karidis had figured out a way to fit a full-sized keyboard into a 9.7-inch laptop chassis by dividing the keyboard into two interlocking pieces that folded in and out as you opened and closed the laptop’s lid. So the lid is closed both pieces lie flat in the case. As and when the laptop lid is opened it lifts the two pieces and stretches the keyboard beyond the case just like when a Butterfly opens its wings.

“There were other debates within IBM at that point. Should we call this the IBM ThinkPad butterfly? There was a lot of back and forth. Eventually we decided not to come out with a new brand name” says Bhatia who joined IBM in 1999 and had the opportunity to work with Richard Sapper the industrial designer behind the original ThinkPad introduced in 1992.

“The marketing team did a fantastic job around 1995 when they would place these little ads in newspapers and with just a picture of a butterfly. There was a lot of buzz and excitement around the ThinkPad 701C something the industry had not seen in 1995” he added.

Bhatia remembers John Karidis and his fellow team members including Sam Lucente Richard Sapper and Robert P. Tennant started working on the ThinkPad 701C in 1993. “This project was codenamed Butterfly when John Karidis and the team designed what they almost thought of as wings of an airplane like the Top Gun movie” he said.“We had Yamato Lab we had our designers at Research Triangle Park in Raleigh North Carolina and Richard Sapper himself a German-based in Milan” says Bhatia. “So it truly was a global product development even back in the day.”

The impressive foldout butterfly keyboard had a promising and game-changing concept to tackle the real-life problem of stuffing a full-sized keyboard into a portable laptop though the launch of notebooks with larger displays soon made the need for such a keyboard redundant. “When the butterfly keyboard was created it was there to solve a problem” Bhatia says. “The number one complaint from our customers back then was the cramped keyboard and what the 701C did was really solve that customer problem.”

When IBM released the ThinkPad 701C in 1995 it was an instant hit among business travellers and made the company cool again. As a matter of fact this laptop holds a spot in MoMA’s permanent collection in New York City. The ThinkPad 701C also made countless appearances in Hollywood’s biggest movies released at the time including GoldenEye Pierce Brosnan’s debut film as James Bond and Mission Impossible starring Tom Cruise.

While many don’t remember the ThinkPad 701C after 26 years of its release Bhatia says the laptop is still in hot demand among the collector community. In fact he says a lot of Lenovo’s industrial designers have the ThinkPad 701C. “When we talk about the top 10 ThinkPads this definitely shows up as the number one or probably the top two or three as one of the most popular products ever.”"

With trance his go to genre Parnassvs real name Angelo del Carmen has been residing in Manila Philippines for the best part of the pandemic where he has taken the opportunity of “hitting the ground running with productions and clocking in at least three to four projects per month.”

With new releases on the Dutch based label Serendipity Muzik (Black Hole Recording) Parnassvs has set his goals towards a new direction and in turn has seen his music supported by some of the biggest names within the trance scene such as Artento Divini Ferry Corsten Paul van Dyk Dennis Sheperd Dash Berlin and trance legend himself Armin van Buuren whilst his tracks have also been featured on ASOT and Transmission radio shows.

With his sound traversing in the melodic and energetic rhythms of tech trance and the dark pulsating drum of techno Parnassvs has been able to combine the two in his latest tracks ‘Night City’ and ‘Illumina.’ With inspiration taken from the action role-playing video game Cyberpunk 2077 ‘Night City’ is a location within the game with Parnassvs himself stating;

“’Night City’ was created with inspiration from the game “Cyberpunk”. I notably wanted the track to have the feel of being in a metropolis packed with its chaos and beauty especially during the breakdown leading into the main melodies.”

On the other hand the second track of the EP ‘Illumina’ was created in hope that the current situation in the world will no longer be seen as the ‘new normal’ with Parnassvs also stating;

“Illumina” I envisioned as a big anthemic track with the sense of finally being able to go to a place of refuge full of bliss and serenity straight from being in quarantine for a year.”

With the overall goal of creating dance music that upholds the beauty of trance and techno Parnassvs has set out to reach his audience via the production of tracks that he feels resonate the most with a current climate in time. The producer/DJ also goes by a different alias “Luis del Carmen” where he releases more hard and peak hour techno tracks.

May–August 2021

Exhibition Parcours

September 10–October 3 2021

Biennale für Freiburg (BfF) is a new platform for the presentation development and mediation of contemporary art in Freiburg Germany. It dedicates itself to artistically approaching urgent sociopolitical matters through means of varying thematic and conceptual frameworks. The aim is to establish a continuous connection to the city of Freiburg and to provide a lasting contribution to the cultural and artistic life of the city.

The curatorial concept of BfF #1—the inaugural edition—explores the various modes of artistic production and how they manifest both inside and outside of the studio space. BfF #1 understands the studio as a non-fixed place—the absence of classical studio spaces serves as the key starting point for the curatorial framework. During BfF #1’s runtime artistic processes and activities are transferred from the traditional setting of an artist’s studio towards a number of collective contexts and situations. The public space is thereby converted into a place of production and becomes a subject of debate.

The merging of studio and urban space will consequently reflect and shape the content of the program. The focus is on Freiburg in particular and on the city in general; taking a look at methods through which the urban can be perceived developed and utilized for the creation of a cityscape. There will be a chance to ruminate on the role of the surrounding Black Forest as a healing moisture-retaining cabinet. Or to learn more about the dual nature of the public space which can manifest in both the prominent representation of historical events or in the erasure of lesser-known stories from the collective consciousness. The program will make way for voices that skillfully and openly report on private matters simultaneously understanding that this precious information is best protected through the obfuscation of fiction.

The first iteration of Biennale für Freiburg is conceived and organized by Artistic Director Leon Hösl together with a Curatorial Advisory Board consisting of Christoph Chwatal Aziza Harmel Fanny Hauser Magdalena Stöger and Fritz Laszlo Weber. Project assistance is provided by Catherin Schöberl.

Studio Program and Exhibition Parcours

BfF #1 will unfold in two phases: a Studio Program that started in early May lasting until the end of August and a resulting Exhibition Parcours that will be on view in Freiburg from September 10 to October 3 2021.

Conceived as a four-month-long phase for production discourse and mediation the Studio Program lays the groundwork for the subsequent Exhibition Parcours. Between May and August the contributing artists will visit Freiburg extensively providing insights into their production processes organize workshops and develop new works during their stay many of them in collaboration with other artists and local participants. The majority of events during the Studio Program will take place at changing locations throughout Freiburg’s environs. A marble statue with missing body parts for example becomes the catalyst for a conversation. Or the audience is invited to participate in two distinct walks exploring diary writing and the sound of key locks respectively. The concept of the public sphere itself will be examined in a symposion that is equal parts artistic interpretation and scientific precision. Titled “’A Commonplace is not a Cliché’: Perspectives on Public Spheres Asynchronous Commonplaces and Infrastructural Intimacies” the symposion and its accompanying workshops will take place on July 9 and 10 2021. All program points converge in an intermediate area where intimate situations of production and public moments of presentation meet. An overview of all public events of the Studio Program can be found here.

In September the Exhibition Parcours will unfold throughout Freiburg with a rich program of installations video works painting photography and performance. Allocated at art institutions off spaces and other venues the parcours guides the visitors through the themes and various artistic approaches of the Studio Program and refers these ephemeral processes back to the realm of the exhibition. More than a mere presentation of final results the exhibition functions as an insight into networks of artistic collaboration multilayered sets of thematic reference points and offers potential points of departure for future editions of the Biennale für Freiburg.

Try it today to view our site ad-free multi-page articles on a single page and more while the proceeds allow us to write more Linux hardware reviews. At the very least please disable your ad-blocker.

The independently-developed ""Crocus"" driver providing a Mesa Gallium3D implementation for Intel Gen4 ""i965"" through Gen7 ""Haswell"" graphics has now been merged into Mesa 21.2 for ultimately aiming to improve the open-source OpenGL support for these aging Intel integrated graphics generations.Intel has in recent years developed the Iris Gallium3D driver providing great support for Broadwell graphics and newer. The ""i965"" classic driver meanwhile was left for supporting Intel Haswell graphics and older. The i965 classic driver doesn't see much activity these days and with Mesa developers talking of possibly dropping classic drivers from mainline David Airlie and Ilia Mirkin along with others developed this driver called Crocus.



Crocus supports hardware going back to the Intel 965 series integrated graphics.

Again it's just about a Gallium3D driver for old Intel graphics hardware and if you are using Broadwell or newer this isn't of relevance to you since on that front is the excellent Iris Gallium3D driver already.



There still are at least a number of Intel Haswell Linux users out there given the popularity of those processors from eight years ago.

Crocus has been getting into shape over the past few months and earlier this month the WIP merge request opened for this Gen4 to Gen7 driver. The driver in its current state is considered ""pretty fully functional Gallium driver"" but for now the default build continues to be the i965 classic driver.Mesa 21.2 will be out next quarter with this driver and many other improvements. The merge of Crocus adds around 28.5k lines of code.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2ludGVsLW51Yy0xMS1leHRyZW1lLWJlYXN0LWNhbnlvbi13aXRoLWNvcmUtaTktMTE5MDBrYi1jcHUtdGVzdGVkLWp1c3QtYXMtZmFzdC1hcy1hbnktZGVza3RvcC1nYW1pbmctcGMv0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2ludGVsLW51Yy0xMS1leHRyZW1lLWJlYXN0LWNhbnlvbi13aXRoLWNvcmUtaTktMTE5MDBrYi1jcHUtdGVzdGVkLWp1c3QtYXMtZmFzdC1hcy1hbnktZGVza3RvcC1nYW1pbmctcGMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel NUC 11 Extreme ‘Beast Canyon’ With Core i9-11900KB CPU Tested Just As Fast As Any Desktop Gaming PC,"Intel's NUC 11 Extreme 'Beast Canyon' PC featuring the Core i9-11900KB CPU has been tested. The latest performance numbers come from within the 3DMark database (via Benchleaks).

Intel Core i9-11900KB CPU Powered NUC 11 Extreme 'Beast Canyon' PC Tested As Fast As A Standard Gaming PC

The difference between the Intel NUC 11 Extreme and a standard gaming PC is nominal. The NUC comes within a small 8L chassis which means it has lower cooling potential than say a gaming PC that's been configured in an M-ATX or standard ATX chassis. The extra heat can definitely affect the performance of the hardware and throttle it down to lower clocks. Furthermore the components are all tightly cramped and you can't expect the top-of-the-line CPU cooling solutions as you'd get on a standard gaming PC.

With that said we have the first performance benchmarks of the Intel NUC 11 with the Core i9-11900KB chip and things are definitely looking great for the small form factor PC. The NUC was configured with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card 16 GB DDR4 memory & a 1 TB SSD. Performance was measured within 3DMark Time Spy and 3DMark Firestrike benchmark. In Time Spy the PC reported a score of 8420 (overall) 8098 (graphics) & 10872 (CPU) points while in the 3DMark Firestrike test the PC reported a score of 19020 (overall) 20523 (graphics) 25571 (CPU) points.

A comparison between the NUC 11 PC and a standard Gaming PC featuring a similar hardware configuration by Tomshardware shows that there's almost no difference between the two setups. The other test setup included similar specifications but since the Core i9-11900KB is BGA only the tech outlet relied on the Core i9-11900 (Rocket Lake) CPU and reports that despite better cooling and high clock speeds the Core i9-11900KB ended up literally on par and sometimes faster than the i9-11900 Desktop chip. Following are the results (Source: Tomshardware):

Core i9-11900KB + GeForce RTX 3060 Core i9-11900 + GeForce RTX 3060 Time Spy 8420 9089 Time Spy | CPU 10872 11064 Time Spy | GPU 8098 8812 Fire Strike 19020 19898 Fire Strike | GPU 20523 22002 Fire Strike | Physics 25571 25260 Fire Strike | Combined 9837 9777

The benchmarks above clearly show that the NUC 11 Extreme could be about as good as any PC for desktop gamers. It offers similar performance in a very small package.

Intel has stated during its Computex 2021 presentation that the NUC 11 Extreme 'Beast Canyon' will feature 11th Gen Core i9 Core i7 and Core i5 H-series processors. However it looks like the company also plans to launch its flagship NUCs with Tiger Lake KB series chips. This will also be Intel's first NUC to support full-length discrete graphics from AMD NVIDIA & also Intel's own Xe-HPG graphics cards when they launch later this year.

Intel Core i9-11900KB 10nm Tiger Lake Desktop CPU

As the fastest Intel Tiger Lake B-Series offering the Core i9-11900KB rocks 8 cores and 16 threads. It has a base clock of 3.30 GHz and a boost clock of up to 5.30 GHz (Velocity Boost). The CPU carries 24 MB of total cache and a TDP of 65W (PL1). The CPU features a BGA1787 package & pricing is not mentioned but will be based on the specific designs in which this chip features inside. One thing to notice is that the standard boost speeds are slightly slower compared to the Rocket Lake parts due to a more mature 14nm process node.

All 10nm Tiger Lake B-Series Desktop CPUs feature support for up to 128 GB DDR4-3200 memory and feature Iris Xe onboard graphics. You can pretty much expect all the modern features of Tiger Lake onboard these chips and we look forward to the designs that come up with these especially the SFF stuff which will include next-gen NUCs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlcnZldGhlaG9tZS5jb20vc3VwZXJtaWNyby1zeXMtNTEwcC13dHItMXUtMXAtaW50ZWwteGVvbi1zZXJ2ZXItcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Supermicro SYS-510P-WTR 1U 1P Intel Xeon Server Review,"The Supermicro SYS-510P-WTR is a single-socket Intel Xeon “Ice Lake” generation server. In this generation Intel’s newest processors offer a lot more for single-socket systems and Supermicro is taking advantage of the advancement. At the same time this is designed to be a “cost-optimized” platform for Supermicro while retaining expandability due to its WIO design. If “WIO” is not recognizable we will show why this is important in our review.

Supermicro SYS-510P-WTR Overview

As we have been doing recently we are going to split our review into the external overview followed by the internal overview section to aid in navigation around the platform.

Supermicro SYS-510P-WTR External Overview

The system itself is a 1U server that is 25.6″ or 650mm deep. Practically that makes the server short enough that it will fit into almost any rack. At the same time it is also deeper than the very short-depth platforms so we still get a lot of expandability.

Starting with the front of the system we get four 3.5″ hot-swap bays. These may be 3.5″ bays that one immediately may think of as being designed for hard drives. While the bays themselves can handle SATA and SAS3 (with a SAS HBA/ RAID controller installed) they can also take NVMe SSDs by installing optional NVMe cables.

On the rear of the system we have a number of features. First we have the redundant 500W 80Plus Platinum power supplies. Those will work for the single-socket platform since we do not have a second high-power CPU.

The rear I/O is a serial port a dedicated IPMI port two USB 2.0 and two USB 3.2 Gen1 ports. There is also a legacy VGA port.

On the rear of the system the two RJ45 LAN ports are actually dual 10Gbase-T ports. Using the Intel X550 controller we get 10GbE built-in.

Something we will quickly note is that the rear expansion slots are relatively plentiful for a 1U short-depth system. There are two full height/ length slots that are PCIe Gen4 x16. We also get a PCIe Gen4 x16 low profile slot.

Two quick items of note here. In the previous generation we would have been limited to PCIe Gen3 on these slots so we get around twice the bandwidth. Also 3 x16= 48 PCIe lanes which is the total amount one has available on a second-generation Intel Xeon Scalable platform. With the newer 3rd generation Ice Lake platform we have enough PCIe lanes to drive this type of configuration whether it is for 100GbE/ 200GbE NICs DPUs accelerators or even for external storage controllers.

Next we are going to get to the internal overview where we will see what is inside and even how Supermicro is able to fit all of those expansion slots.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9pbnRlbC00dGgtZ2VuLXhlb24tc2NhbGFibGUtc2FwcGhpcmUtcmFwaWRzLWNwdS1kaWUtc2hvdC1sZWFrc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Intel 4th Gen Xeon Scalable ""Sapphire Rapids"" CPU die shot leaks","Sapphire Rapids die shot shows 60 cores but only 56 will be active on top SKU

YuuKi_AnS has been leaking Sapphire Rapids (aka Intel 4th Gen Core Xeon Scalable) details for quite a while now. He was the first to publish photos of the new CPU and even made a deliding video.

After removing the integrated heat spreader and sanding down the CPU he was able to capture the first photos of the Sapphire Rapids’ die. The CPU features four compute dies in total each physically carrying 15 cores but the end product will not feature 60 cores. Such a complex design requires some cores to be disabled to keep good yields and ensure availability even of the top Sapphire Rapids SKU. According to leaked information the 4th Gen Xeon will top at 56 cores which means that at least four core will be nonfunctional on the whole CPU package.

Intel Sapphire Rapids Die Source: YuuKi_AnS

Yuuki revealed the specifications of this particular CPU sample which carries a QVV5 code (early ES0 sample) with frequency locked to 1.3 GHz. This CPU will also feature up to 64GB of HBM2e memory which was actually confirmed by Intel just recently through Linux kernel update:

The Sapphire Rapids architecture will be a major change for Intel in the high-performance HPC market. The series will not only feature more cores and onboard HBM2e memory but also PCIe Gen5 interface and DDR5 memory support. Both are major upgrades over Intel’s latest Ice Lake-SP series.

Intel’s 10nm Enhanced SuperFin architecture latest interface standards and high-speed memory will certainly pose a thread to AMD’s EPYC 7003 “Milan” series based on Zen3 architecture.

Multi-socket implementations could offer enterprise customers a new Xeon option with higher IPC better temps at 10nm scaling up to 3-digit core counts.

4 Reviews

Tipster @AnsYuuki released what appear to be die shots for an upcoming Intel Sapphire Rapids Xeon chip. We're looking at what's likely the top-end variant with 56 out of 60 cores enabled - 14 out of 15 on each of the 4 MCM chiplets.

Utilizing the Golden Cove architecture with 10nm lithography the new Xeon chips will feature significantly higher IPC and lower power consumption thanks to a redesigned architecture and the die shrink. This means Intel could have a competitive part to go head to head with AMD's upcoming Zen 4-based EPYC Genoa.

While the Golden Cove-based Xeon tops out at 56 cores far less than EPYC Genoa Intel does have a trick up its sleeve: better support for multi-socket configurations. A dual-socket EPYC Genoa configuration could feature 192 cores nothing to sniff at.

However high-end enterprise users could stack up to 8 4th-gen Sapphire Rapids chips in a multi-socket config for a far higher core count per server rack. Apart from the move to 10nm the new chips will feature support for the upcoming DDR5 RAM memory standard along with PCIe 5.0"

This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.03 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

International Flavors shares have added about 7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.5%.

What's Next for International Flavors?

While International Flavors has underperformed the market so far this year the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

Future of drone delivery may be happening in this small Irish town

ORANMORE Ireland -- Staring upward Fiachra Quigley watched his coffees slowly descend 80 feet onto his driveway lowered at the end of a string. Above him a drone about the size of a go-cart hummed closed its cargo doors and then flew off over his house.

Coffee delivery by drone has become a common sight in Oranmore a town of 8000 on Ireland's west coast and the unlikely spot that has become one of the only places in the world where drone food deliveries happen regularly.

""There was massive novelty value at the start"" said Quigley a 48-year-old self-employed entrepreneur. ""[But] it just something that becomes habitual. It becomes part of your day-to-day.""

The town -- with its one street of pubs and restaurants and a castle perched by the sea -- was chosen as the site for a trial program by the Irish startup company Manna. The company is offering local eateries and a supermarket to use two drones to reach their customers.

The trial puts Manna among a handful of companies doing regular deliveries just as the market for mass commercial drone delivery looks increasingly close to finally taking off. Regulations are gradually falling into place in Europe and the United States and some experts believe drone delivery could start to become mainstream within the next few years.

That potential has helped Manna attract $25 million in investment reflecting the growing excitement around the industry that's value by some estimates could grow by billions of dollars by 2030.

""They're at such an early stage in this business that has so much potential that they're really in an amazing position"" said Miriam McNabb editor in chief of DroneLife a site covering the industry.

""Anybody who's performing drone delivery is really helping to move the ball forward for the entire global industry"" she said.

There are an expanding number of drone delivery trial schemes around the world some accelerated by the pandemic as deliveries boomed during lockdowns. Alphabet's drone subsidiary Wing is running trials in Virginia Finland and Australia. UPS has delivered medical supplies during the pandemic and Walmart is partnering with several start ups to trial deliveries. Amazon is also experimenting at several test sites.

Since December Manna's two light gray drones with their pod-like bodies and four propellers have been seen zipping over Oranmore. The launch pads are based on the roof of the local Tesco supermarket that sits conveniently by a main street of takeout restaurants.

A half dozen Manna technicians run the trial loading deliveries -- that can weigh up to 2 kilograms -- into a white paper bag which is placed into a removable cargo bay inserted into the drone. Set to fly at 50 mph the drones cruise at 260 feet to reach their destination and can reach anywhere in the town within two minutes. Once over a delivery house the drone lowers to 80 feet before a hatch on its belly opens and the bag gently spirals to earth at the end of a thin rope.

The drones fly autonomously. At their cruise altitude of 260 feet they are essentially silent to people on the ground though they sound something like a neighbor's leaf blower for the 40 seconds or so when they lower. The drone is able to reach any house in the town in about two minutes.

Most of the restaurants in Oranmore have signed onto the trial. Anne Forde owner of the Poppy Seed Cafe said they were sometimes sending around between 10 and 20 deliveries by drone each day.

""The majority of the people I know are using it"" Quigley said. He said his family now orders at least once a week but often more turning to it for last-minute impulse buys like ice cream for movie nights.

On the day in May when ABC News visited Manna received around 30 orders in four hours but had to suspend service after one of the drone's engines suffered a malfunction. The company said it was normally doing between 30 and 100 deliveries a-day and it has reached around 30% of the town's households. The current delivery charge being trialed in around 4 euros (about $5).

Manna's CEO Bobby Healy said the company plans to expand to cover 150000 customers in the next 18 months before launching commercially in two European countries in 2023.

""I think the next stage for us is to go to a bigger town"" he said in an interview with ABC News. ""So whereas now we're doing about a hundred deliveries a day at peak we'll go to a town and do between 500 to a thousand deliveries a day at peak.""

Healy is the founder of CarTrawler one of Ireland's most successful startups. To serve 150000 customers he said Manna would need around 10 drones saying a single human operator could manage 20 drones.

The trial in Oranmore is for now still operating under some more earthbound constraints.

The Manna team has to collect the food by car or foot from the restaurants before launching it from the roof. Under the trial regulations the drone must remain within line of sight of a Manna observer and company technicians accompany every delivery by car to monitor it. A pilot able to take control in an emergency also watches from the supermarket roof.

For now the drones also only fly in calm skies although the company says they are capable of handling the daunting weather common to Ireland's west coast.

The obstacles Manna is working through are those confronting drone delivery generally. While the technology is increasingly ready regulation has been an enormous hurdle.

Promises that drone delivery is around the corner have been circulating for about a decade but the development of rules for mass flight have been a distant prospect. Increasingly though experts in the industry believe they might be within sight.

The European Union is making deliberate strides toward establishing the regulation. In December the bloc instituted the new European Drone regulation that for the first time introduces uniform drone rules for every member country and creates a Europe-wide license for commercial drone operators a crucial step toward large-scale deliveries. Manna rapidly received the license this year.

In the U.S. the Federal Aviation Administration released two key new rules in April -- establishing remote identification for drones and also allowing flights over people and at night under certain conditions. A final set of rules is likely to take years more but the time frame of two to three years is now plausible said McNabb.

Healy said in Europe the regulations are already essentially in place for the company to launch commercially in 2023. The company has hired a head of U.S. operations and Healy said he expected the American market would likely be only a year or so behind Europe.

""If you look at this compared to any other sort of developing of new regulations you know for automobiles or manned aircraft it's actually moving incredibly rapidly"" McNabb said. ""I think we're definitely getting close to establishing a standard.""

Drone delivery has also faced uncertainty around public perception in particular worries around noise privacy and the threat to wildlife.

But McNabb said there was evidence that experiencing the delivery programs often shifted those concerns.

""If you ask people who have experienced drone delivery what they think about drone delivery it's overwhelmingly positive"" she said. A survey by Virginia Tech from a 2019 Wing trial in Christiansburg Virginia found 87% of respondents were positive about the service.

That has not always been the case. Alphabet's Wing trial in Australia in 2019 was found by the government to be exceeding noise limits after an outcry by the local community in Canberra.

Quigley said noise wasn't an issue for him during the trial in Oranmore adding that the drones couldn't be heard from inside and even on the street it was little different than a delivery truck.

""I don't see why the same success that they have in Oranmore wouldn't be replicated anywhere"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcGVybWFnLmNvbS9idHMtZWlnaHQteWVhcnMtY29uY2VydC1zb3dvb3pvb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"BTS Celebrates Eight Years With ""2021 MUSTER SOWOOZOO""","It's been eight years since BTS began their journey into international superstardom. From 2013 to 2021 the RM Jin Suga J-Hope Jimin V and Jungkook have come such a long way in terms of their music performance and reach. And to celebrate this huge milestone they held one of their most visually stunning concerts to date.

Like their past few concerts 2021 MUSTER SOWOOZOO — which was named after the Korean title of their song ""Mikrokosmos"" — had to be an online-only event due to the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic is still affecting much of the world. But it's clear that BTS and their streaming partners have mastered the art of the socially distant show.

""BTS constantly pushes the envelope when it comes to delivering engaging and innovative shows and the virtual stage has given them a new platform to showcase their talents"" VenewLive CEO John Lee told PAPER in a statement.

The space-themed concept made for amazing intermission videos that translated well IRL too. The whole thing began with the boys in an RV of sorts driving on the surface of another planet. From there they went from the screen to the massive infinity symbol-shaped stage riding on their space vehicle. This time around everything was set outdoors which is something they haven't been able to do for their previous concerts in the past year.

""Artists and fans are now aware of the benefits of live streaming and we believe it will continue to play an integral role in the future of music and entertainment"" Lee told PAPER. ""We expect to see many adopt a flexible hybrid model in which artists can perform in a physical venue while also streaming to fans all over the globe.""

Select members of the ARMY were shown on small screens with glowing ARMY bombs atop laid out where audiences would have stood during an actual physical concert in the moshpit and orchestra areas. The boys even went down from the stage to dance sing and greet the faces of their fans. But what was most exciting for BTS themselves were the voice recordings of ARMY singing along to their songs.

And because SOWOOZOO is meant to be a celebration of their eighth birthday as a band the setlist was made up of some of their greatest hits. The first day included oldies but goodies like their 2016 bop ""Fire"" and also their Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping singles ""Dynamite"" and ""Butter."" The highlight was the group's performance of Suga's single ""Daechwita.""

The song is typically something that Suga — also known by his rap name Agust D — performs solo though the music video features cameos from Jin and Jungkook. But for this performance he brought the whole group in each of them making the original artist proud with their delivery of his verses.

BTS' MUSTER SOWOOZOO show is a two-day event streaming on June 13 and June 14 at 5:30 AM EST. Encores will be available for viewing at 9:00 PM on June 18 and 19.",,,,,,

In a breach notification letter sent to affected customers earlier this month the company said that this was not a ""systemic data breach of Intuit.""

In account takeover attacks cybercriminals gain access to their victims' accounts using credentials stolen from other online services following past data breaches.

This type of attack works incredibly well against targets who use the same login credentials for multiple sites or services.

""We have more than 100 million customers and see billions of transactions per year with ATO notifications going to less than .0003% of customers and some of those confirmed by the customer after the fact as their activity (not an ATO)"" Rick Heineman Intuit Corporate Communications Vice President told BleepingComputer.

TurboTax accounts hacked using reused credentials

Intuit discovered during a security review that an undisclosed number of TurboTax accounts was breached and customer info was exposed.

The company's investigation revealed that the threat actors used credentials (usernames and passwords) obtained from ""a non-Intuit source"" to gain access to the accounts.

""By accessing your account the unauthorized party may have obtained information contained in a prior year's tax return or your current tax return in progress such as your name Social Security number address(es) date of birth driver's license number and financial information (e.g. salary and deductions) and information of other individuals contained in the tax return"" Intuit explained.

""We deeply regret that this incident may affect you. Intuit has taken various measures to help ensure that the accounts of affected customers are protected. We are notifying you so you can take steps to help protect your information"" the company added.

After discovering the attacks Intuit temporarily disabled the breached TurboTax accounts. Users who had their accounts deactivated must contact Intuit's Customer Care department at 1-800-944-8596 and say ""Security"" when prompted.

Afterward Intuit employees will walk them through an identity verification procedure designed to help reactivate the accounts.

Previous alerts of TurboTax account takeovers

This is not the first time attackers have successfully hacked into TurboTax users' accounts and stole financial and personal information.

TurboTax customers were previously targeted in at least three other series of account takeover attacks in 2014/2015 and again in 2019.

Just as after the previous three incidents Intuit provides one year of free identity protection credit monitoring and Experian IdentityWorks identity restoration services to impacted customers.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Asset management firm Invesco (IVZ 0.74%) doesnʻt get the same attention given to some of its peers but over the past decade it has quietly gained market share from them. The company has had a breakout year so far with its stock price up 68% year to date through Friday's close beating its major competitors including BlackRock and T. Rowe Price.

While Invesco has enjoyed a great run this year it is still available at a very favorable valuation. Let's take a closer look at this company to see if it's the right value stock for you.

Growing market share through ETFs

Invesco has steadily gained market share over the past decade. At the end of 2009 it was the 35th-largest asset manager and by the end of 2017 it was up to No. 25. At the end of this year's first quarter Invesco had grown to be the 16th-largest with about $1.4 trillion in assets under management.

Invesco's gains have largely been driven by its success with exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs have enjoyed a meteoric rise over the past decade and are expected to grow exponentially over the next decade. Currently there's more than $5 trillion in ETF assets in the U.S. and some estimates suggest it could grow tenfold to $50 trillion by 2030.

As the fourth-largest manager of ETF assets Invesco is in prime position to grow with the market. At the end of 2020 it had about $294 billion in ETF assets behind only BlackRock Vanguard and State Street. Its Invesco QQQ ETF is one of the largest and fastest-growing on the market. It is the fifth-largest ETF with $160 billion in assets and in 2020 had the fourth-most net inflows with $16.7 billion coming into the fund. The QQQ is a household name among investors mainly because of its superior performance. Through March 31 the QQQ had a five-year annualized return of 25% and a 10-year annualized return of 20%.

Invesco had a strong first quarter with a record $24.5 billion in net inflows led by its ETFs which had $16.8 billion in net inflows. This drove net revenues 9.2% higher year over year to $1.25 billion and net income 104% higher to $316 million or $0.68 per share.

Low valuation and M&A?

For all its growth Invesco remains undervalued by the market. It is trading at about 19 times earnings but has a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 10. It also has a low price-to-book (P/B) ratio of just under 1.3 with a P/B value of around $22 per share. That has jumped significantly since mid-February when the stock was trading at about three-quarters of book value but it's still low.

Invesco has also been involved in persistent rumors that it could be part of a merger or acquisition. The asset management industry is in a period of consolidation with a number of deals in the past year as firms look to scale up. The name tied to Invesco is Janus Henderson which has struggled in recent years. The rumors persist because last year hedge fund manager Nelson Peltz of Trian Fund Management bought 10% stakes in both companies and Trian has a history of activism -- in 2019 the firm bought a stake in Legg Mason which was acquired in 2020 by Franklin Resources. The speculation has been well received by the market as it has helped juice Invescoʻs excellent performance this year.

Invesco has carved out a terrific niche in ETFs and as one of the leading managers in that space it is in a good position to ride the ETF wave. At its current low valuation and with speculation of M&A activity it looks like a good time to consider this value stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYXMtYW1jcy1zdG9jay1zdXJnZWQtYW4taW52ZXNjby1yZW9wZW5pbmctZnVuZC1zb2xkLXNoYXJlcy1vZi10aGUtbWVtZS1iZWNhdXNlLXRoYXQtaXMtaG93LXRoZS1zbWFydC1iZXRhLWV0Zi13b3Jrcy0xMTYyMzM0MTU3MdIBpQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2FzLWFtY3Mtc3RvY2stc3VyZ2VkLWFuLWludmVzY28tcmVvcGVuaW5nLWZ1bmQtc29sZC1zaGFyZXMtb2YtdGhlLW1lbWUtYmVjYXVzZS10aGF0LWlzLWhvdy10aGUtc21hcnQtYmV0YS1ldGYtd29ya3MtMTE2MjMzNDE1NzE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,As AMC's stock surged an Invesco 'reopening' fund sold shares of the meme because that is how the smart-beta ETF works,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-amcs-stock-surged-an-invesco-reopening-fund-sold-shares-of-the-meme-because-that-is-how-the-smart-beta-etf-works-11623341571 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYXMtYW1jcy1zdG9jay1zdXJnZWQtYW4taW52ZXNjby1yZW9wZW5pbmctZnVuZC1zb2xkLXNoYXJlcy1vZi10aGUtbWVtZS1iZWNhdXNlLXRoYXQtaXMtaG93LXRoZS1zbWFydC1iZXRhLWV0Zi13b3Jrcy0xMTYyMzM0MTU3MdIBpQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2FzLWFtY3Mtc3RvY2stc3VyZ2VkLWFuLWludmVzY28tcmVvcGVuaW5nLWZ1bmQtc29sZC1zaGFyZXMtb2YtdGhlLW1lbWUtYmVjYXVzZS10aGF0LWlzLWhvdy10aGUtc21hcnQtYmV0YS1ldGYtd29ya3MtMTE2MjMzNDE1NzE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuaW4vY3J5cHRvY3VycmVuY3kvbmV3cy93ZWVrbHktY3J5cHRvLXJvdW5kdXAtd2F6aXJ4LXVuZGVyLXNjcnV0aW55LWVsLXNhbHZhZG9yLW1ha2VzLWJpdGNvaW4tbGVnYWwtdGVuZGVyLWFuZC1tb3JlL3NsaWRlbGlzdC84MzQ3ODU3Ny5jbXPSAakBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmluL2NyeXB0b2N1cnJlbmN5L25ld3Mvd2Vla2x5LWNyeXB0by1yb3VuZHVwLXdhemlyeC11bmRlci1zY3J1dGlueS1lbC1zYWx2YWRvci1tYWtlcy1iaXRjb2luLWxlZ2FsLXRlbmRlci1hbmQtbW9yZS9hbXBfc2xpZGVsaXN0LzgzNDc4NTc3LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weekly crypto roundup: WazirX under scrutiny El Salvador makes Bitcoin legal tender and more,"Unsplash

Posted on 06/12/2021

As the COVID pandemic prompted the Federal Reserve to flood the country with U.S. dollars the price of single-family homes in the U.S. have increased as there remains a tight supply in single-family housing. Inflation has crept in and there is increased speculation in American real estate in 2020 and 2021. The Wall Street Journal issued a story on BlackRock and their activities in buying homes. Single-family homes are widely regarding among the populace as the American dream the idea of owning property. Furthermore Wall Street banks’ greed on underwriting risky loan products drove the housing bubbles in 2006 and 2007 which ended up as the global financial crisis of 2008. Then taxpayers bailout out Wall Street and other companies like AIG General Motors and Ally Financial. In the ashes of the financial crisis private equity firms like BlackRock created Invitation Homes to buy up cheap homes and rent them out. Other investors followed suit such as GI Partners backing Waypoint and the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation backing American Homes 4 Rent.



Note: Top of Twitter for search tag “BlackRock”.

The article by the WSJ is giving BlackRock substantial press attention its its single-family home investing strategies.

In a Fox News television interview Pedro Gonzalez an associate editor of Chronicles Magazine said “Homeownership gives people a stake in a society. It’s a way to build generational wealth.”

Single-Family Homes

According to data from Invitation Homes there are 128 million households and 62% are owned homes while 38% are rented. Out of the rental batch of 49 million units 35% are Single-family rentals 62% are apartments and 4% are mobile homes and others. In the investor presentation institutional owners are just at 300000 units for single-family homes vs. 16.2 million which are called “Moms and Pops”.

Major Players

Invitation Homes

Dallas-based Invitation Homes Inc. is a listed company with origins with the Blackstone Group Inc. In the first quarter of 2021 Invitation Homes acquired 696 homes for US$ 233 million worth of homes and is part of a US$ 1 billion acquisition target in 2021.

In November 2017 Invitation Homes acquired listed company Starwood Waypoint Homes to create largest single-family landlord company. At the time the merger created a company that owned approximately 82000 single-family rentals.

“Since launching our collaboration in December we have identified several opportunities to improve inclusion and sustainability that we are excited to ignite” Shelley Simpson J.B.

OTR Capital web series showcases trucking experience





OTR Capital a factoring company based in Georgia has introduced a new mini-series titled “Over The Road with OTR Capital” to its YouTube channel. The series gives the viewer an insider’s view of what it’s like to be a truck driver from the perspective of OTR’s clients.

In an interview with FreightWaves Grace Maher the vice president and director of OTR Capital explained why it was important for the company to highlight its clients and how they leverage the partnership with OTR Capital to sustain and grow their trucking businesses.

“I wanted to show the personal connection we have with our clients so we introduced this mini-series to share their stories provide education and to shine a light on the trucking industry.”

Maher rode along with driver Elbridge James for the first video. Despite having worked in the industry for a decade Maher said she was surprised by many elements of his job.

“The most surprising aspect for me was how little control he really has over so many aspects of the job like getting loaded traffic weather cancellations and unloading” she said. “The phone would ring off the hook by brokers trackers other drivers with his company. He was truly managing his business from his truck and I witnessed the stresses first-hand.”

After watching James handle these various scenarios Maher found there were company solutions that OTR Capital could focus on educating its clients about to make their days less hectic.

“We try to focus on those same things when improving services for our carriers” she said. “The recent redesign of our mobile app gives truckers the transparency to look into real-time data for their business. I was able to walk through the app with Elbridge to show him how easy it is to manage documents.”

Maher said OTR Capital will continue to add episodes to its “Over the Road” series along with the array of educational videos webinars and live streams aimed to help its clients manage and grow their businesses.





“What we hope to get across is that trucking is filled with stories and we hope to share the unique backgrounds of some of our clients” she said. “Truckers do so much for our country and they should be celebrated and appreciated. We want to shine a light on all of these stories and experiences and show what it’s really like being a truck driver.”

Tank truck driver of the year to be named at NTTC conference

The National Tank Truck Carriers’ (NTTC) annual conference is set to take place next week June 13-15 in Indianapolis to educate and raise awareness for the issues facing the transportation industry and highlight the drivers who are committed to safety on the road.

The NTTC represents over 500 companies that specialize in tanker transportation throughout North America. This sector of the trucking industry generates around 5.1% of all truck freight revenue and 30% of all truck freight tonnage.

The annual conference will also feature the selection of the next NTTC Professional Tank Truck Driver of the Year. In February 2020 8 drivers competed in a series of challenges to win the award and due the pandemic the selection was postponed until the in-person announcement at the conference on Monday.

Among the finalists is Ed Stasyshyn a 78-year-old from Edmonton Alberta who could become the first Canadian driver to win the award according to the CBC. Stasyshyn who drives for Trimac Transportation became a trucker in his 20s.

Besides two minor incidents on his record that he was found not responsible for Stasyshyn has been accident-free and his license has been demerit-free for over 40 years the CBC reported.

The conference will also highlight the association’s newest president and CEO Ryan Streblow and speakers including U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher of Indiana Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana and Seth Mattison founder and chief movement officer of Luminate Labs a media platform for innovators and influencers.

Waymo has a fully autonomous system. Tesla has semi-autonomous vehicles. Let’s look at the differences between the two.

Is Waymo better than Tesla? Waymo CEO John Krafcik thinks so. He recently said that Tesla was ‘no competitor at all’ to Waymo’s system in the autonomous and semi-autonomous market. Elon Musk countered saying Waymo is too expensive. Is that true? Let’s look at what the Waymo system has that Tesla doesn’t.

Tesla Model 3 | Tesla

What is Waymo Autopilot?

Waymo J.B. Hunt form partnership centered on self-driving big rigs https://t.co/e9fgyWEik1 pic.twitter.com/q1SY6a9i1P — Automotive News (@Automotive_News) June 10 2021

Waymo’s autonomous driving system began as a Google project. It calls itself an autonomous driving company. Unlike Tesla whose cars SUVs (and forthcoming trucks) come equipped with Tesla Autopilot Waymo doesn’t make its own cars. Instead it collaborates with car companies to put its driving system into vehicles.

Currently variations of Waymo semi-autonomous and autonomous driving systems are in Toyota Priuses Lexus SUVs Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans and Jaguar I-PACEs. In Phoenix Arizona Waymo has instituted driverless taxis in the form of the Chrysler Pacifica. These fully automated minivans can be accessed via Google Maps.

Waymo says that by developing autonomous driving systems they’ll be helping to save lives. Driverless cars don’t make the same mistakes that humans do. However the technology and capabilities to put mass amounts of driverless cars on the roads is still years away.

Currently they are working on making autonomous driving systems available in trucks which are responsible for a little more than ten percent of all fatal crashes each year. Waymo recently partnered with J.B. Hunt to operate in Texas.

How is Tesla Autopilot different?

While Waymo is working toward a fully autonomous driving system Krafcik believes that Tesla isn’t headed toward the same thing. Instead he believes that Tesla is only developing a good driver assistance program. Currently Tesla uses Tesla Autopilot which is a semi-autonomous driving system. Tesla drivers are still supposed to keep their hands on the wheel at all times (though not all do).

In an interview Krafcik said that Tesla only had a “really good driver assistance system” according to Business Insider.

People in the market for a Tesla can pay an extra $10000 for full self-driving (FSD) which despite its name doesn’t currently offer full autonomy. Musk says that he hopes one day it will. The only fully driverless option on Teslas right now is Summon. Summon allows a Tesla owner to call its car from up to 200 feet away.

https://twitter.com/Nnedi/status/1401747843644198916

Additionally Krafcik believes that Waymo’s sensors are better than Tesla’s. Waymo uses the same technology that most car manufacturers do: radar lidar and cameras. Tesla recently stopped making Model 3 and Model Y cars with radar sensors and instead relies only on Tesla Vision. Tesla Vision uses cameras to determine whether there are objects in the path of the vehicle and to judge distance.

In return to Krafcik’s statements Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk said that Waymo’s cars with autonomous driving would be too expensive starting at $100000. While it is possible to get a Tesla for considerably less than that at $38000 it’s worth noting that the newly debuted Tesla Model S Plaid starts at $131000.

The race to full automation continues. It will be interesting to see whether Tesla or Waymo has the biggest influence on fully self-driving cars.

Positive Points

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY Financial) reported a strong quarter with a 6% increase in total revenue and a 7% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

The company experienced robust growth in its core business segment with revenue up 7% for the quarter and an 8% increase on a non-GAAP basis.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY) achieved significant sales success including 11 competitive core takeaways and strong interest in new solutions like the Financial Crimes Defender.

The company's Banno Digital banking platform continues to grow now serving over 11.6 million users with approximately 200000 new users added per month.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY) maintains a strong sales pipeline keeping it near an all-time high which supports ongoing optimism for future performance.

Negative Points

Despite strong sales the actual revenue recognition from these sales is expected in future years indicating a lag between sales success and financial impact.

Jack Henry & Associates Inc (JKHY) faces increasing competition in the financial technology space with new entrants continuously emerging.

The company noted a decrease in deconversion revenue by approximately $5.3 million reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation among clients.

Increased regulatory scrutiny and changes in the banking sector could pose challenges to client operations and affect their technology spending.

Operational costs have risen including higher personnel costs and increased internal license and fees which could impact profit margins if not managed effectively.

The dove is an “edge” species. It likes a mix of dense cover and open space exactly the kind of habitat that humans have produced across North America. This has made the mourning dove much more abundant today than it was before European settlement.

RELATED STORIES:

Today it occurs from southern Canada into Mexico. In much of its range it occurs throughout the year. North Dakota winters are a match for mourning doves however. They don’t thrive in the cold and so they move south though not very far. Mourning doves are year-round birds in southern Minnesota.

The mourning dove is best known for its call a mournful cooing sound that supplied the bird’s common name. Mourning doves call throughout the day but they are especially vocal in early morning. At sunrise when I’m at work in the garden I can count on hearing mourning doves. There are several in the three acres or so enclosed by our shelterbelt. They call and respond from the corners of the lot so I know who’s home.

ADVERTISEMENT

The doves are far more often heard than seen. Males sometimes preen a bit but in general they are rather secretive. Nests are flimsy often just a few sticks laid across the branches of an evergreen. I’m sometimes startled by a mourning dove leaving a hidden nest.

These birds are not shy however. They come readily to seeds spilled on the ground. I’ve taken to presenting sunflower seeds on the driveway. There the mourning doves compete with grackles blackbirds several kinds of sparrows and another common summer bird the American goldfinch.

Mourning doves are fast and use diversionary tactics to avoid predators including human hunters. Hunters take more doves than any other game bird in the United States.

While humans have helped the mourning dove spread across the continent human greed destroyed its close relative the passenger pigeon which became extinct early in the 20th century. This happened to coincide with development of the Great Plains so the spread of mourning doves closely followed the disappearance of the passenger pigeon.

Passenger pigeons did occur in North Dakota; they were reported in Grand Forks County as late as the 1890s. They were never so numerous here as they were farther east however because passenger pigeons depended on acorns and consequently on extensive oak forests.

Doves generally raise two broods a year and of course this helps account for the large population of doves. They are certainly more abundant on the Great Plains now than ever before.

These birds are equally as likely to show up in urban parks and residential backyards providing there’s adequate cover. As a consequence this is a species that anybody who looks is likely to find.

Looking is not the only way to find doves. In the case of mourning doves hearing is believing. Take a bit of care though; another dove species has moved into our area. The Eurasian collared dove now occurs in towns around the Red River Valley. I occasionally hear them in Gilby and Larimore N.D. though I have never encountered the species in Grand Forks itself – but I am not much of an “urban birder” at this stage of my life. Nor has a collared dove shown up at our property west of Gilby.

ADVERTISEMENT

The calls though similar can be readily distinguished. The mourning dove issues fairly long cooing notes usually two but often more. These are often answered by nearby birds – the call and response I mentioned earlier. Collared doves have a three-note call with the final note noticeably shorter than the others.

The birds differ in appearance as well. Both are relatively slim long-tailed birds. The collared dove is larger and more monochromatic lacking the dark spotting on the back and wings that mark the mourning dove. The collar refers to a mark on the back of the neck which the mourning dove lacks entirely.

Unlike mourning doves Eurasian collared doves are tough enough to survive North Dakota winters. Any dove seen in winter is almost certain to be a collared dove.

Despite exiting Friday night's outing against the Padres due to right flexor tendinitis Mets pitcher Jacob deGrom isn't too concerned by his latest injury.

""I felt it this week in between starts"" said deGrom after his team's 3-2 victory on Friday night at Citi Field ""I'm not too concerned about it because it didn't get too much worse as the game went on (and) In the sixth inning I could feel it when I was warming up.""

Not only is his level of concern low but deGrom went on to express his optimism that he will be able to make his next start.

""Hopefully it's something we can treat and run it back out there five days from now"" he said ""I'm always testing my ligaments and I'm not too concerned about this.""

According to deGrom the tendon only bothered him when he started to fly open. When his mechanics were on par he did not have any issues.

It was actually pitching coach Jeremy Hefner who wisely advised on the decision to pull deGrom out of precaution after the two of them had a conversation about what he felt in his final inning of work.

Following his exit deGrom immediately received treatment and did some ligament testing with the training staff which involved flexibility and range of motion activities. Luckily everything checked out as normal for deGrom who knows his body well.

""I tried pitching with a torn ligament after I got drafted and this definitely isn't that"" said deGrom.

At the moment the plan is for him to make his next start. And he will do this by receiving extra treatment not by changing up his throwing routine.

Manager Luis Rojas echoed deGrom's confidence by expressing his trust in his pitcher.

""I'm not concerned either because Jake isn't"" said Rojas ""That's what we trust he knows his arm and body.""

Instead of taking the usual precautionary approach with his prized pitcher a fired up Rojas was fully on board with deGrom's attitude.

""I'm expecting him to make his next start"" he said ""I'm trusting my pitcher.""

Beyond deGrom two other Mets pitchers suffered injuries as well. First it was Miguel Castro who exited in the seventh with neck stiffness. According to Rojas Castro is feeling it in his trap area and is receiving treatment. They are not overly concerned there either.



As for left-hander Aaron Loup who was struck in the bicep with a liner in the eighth inning Rojas says he was coming out of the game anyway and that he should be just fine."

The vote to kill the effort was an overwhelming 359 to 43 with seven voting “present.” Democrats flocked to Mr. Johnson’s rescue with all but 39 of them voting with Republicans to block the effort to oust him.

Members of the minority party in the House have never propped up the other party’s speaker and when the last Republican to hold the post Kevin McCarthy faced a removal vote last fall Democrats voted en masse to allow the motion to move forward and then to jettison him helping lead to his historic ouster.

This time the Democratic support made the critical difference allowing Mr. Johnson who has a minuscule majority to avoid a removal vote altogether. While for weeks Ms. Greene had appeared to be on a political island in her drive to get rid of yet another G.O.P. speaker 11 Republicans ultimately voted to allow her motion to move forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL2hvdXNlLWNyaXRpY2FsLWRlY2lzaW9uLXNwZWFrZXItam9obnNvbi1vdXN0ZXItbWFyam9yaWUtdGF5bG9yLWdyZWVuZS1mb3JjZXMtdm90ZdIBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL2hvdXNlLWNyaXRpY2FsLWRlY2lzaW9uLXNwZWFrZXItam9obnNvbi1vdXN0ZXItbWFyam9yaWUtdGF5bG9yLWdyZWVuZS1mb3JjZXMtdm90ZS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,House squashes Marjorie Taylor Greene's motion to oust Speaker Johnson,"The House of Representatives squashed an effort by Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. and Thomas Massie R-Ky. to force a House-wide vote on Speaker Mike Johnson's R-La. ouster.

Greene appeared to catch most congressional watchers by surprise when she moved to force a vote on her motion to vacate the chair the procedural move that would allow for the vote. She noticed her resolution as ""privileged"" meaning House leaders had two legislative days to take it up.

But her bluff was called immediately when House Majority Leader Steve Scalise R-La. rose to call for a vote on tabling Greene's motion — which effectively kills it before the vote on Johnson's ouster itself.

Johnson got overwhelming Democratic and Republican support for the table vote which passed 359 to 43 averting a vote on her motion. Just 11 Republicans voted against tabling the measure along with 32 Democrats.

MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FILES MOTION TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON

On the Republican side Johnson won the support of 196 members while 163 Democrats also voted to shield him.

The House GOP side of the chamber erupted in cheers when her move was squashed.

""I want to say that I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort. That is certainly what it was"" Johnson told reporters after the vote. ""I've said from the beginning and I've made clear here every day I intend to do my job. I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing which is what I was elected to do. And I'll let the chips fall where they may.""

Greene declined to say if she planned to force another vote but accused Johnson of being aligned with Democrats after they helped save his job.

""That's not something that I've said"" she said when asked if she would try a repeat. ""I think today it has proven the uniparty is alive as well. And the Democrats now control Speaker Johnson. That was something that everybody suspected all along. They just voted to save him. And I think that's the message.""

Greene has been threatening to force a vote on taking Johnson's gavel since late March in protest of his handling of government funding and foreign aid.

Her resolution known as a motion to vacate the chair will now have to be voted on or tabled after Greene noticed it as ""privileged"" on Wednesday night — meaning House leaders have two legislative days to take it up.

The Republican side of the House chamber erupted in boos as Greene listed off her gripes against Johnson prompting Democrat Rep. Steve Cohen D-Tenn. to shout ""The House is not in order — and is about to fall into chaos"" prompting some sparse laughs from their side of the chamber.

The vote is expected to be close but ultimately fail with both Republicans and Democrats voicing opposition to a move that would effectively paralyze Congress until a new speaker is found.

The vote is a culmination of six months' worth of frustration from the most right-wing conservatives in Johnson's conference who have felt sidelined by him on nearly all critical legislation including foreign aid and government funding during which they demanded he leverage a government shutdown to force the Democrats who controlled the Senate and White House to pass Republican policies.

HOUSE DEMS SAY THEY’LL BLOCK MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FROM OUSTING SPEAKER JOHNSON

Greene's push got two more backers in Reps. Thomas Massie R-Ky. and Paul Gosar R-Ariz. after Johnson ushered a foreign aid bill along bipartisan lines that includes $61 billion for Ukraine.

But it's largely fallen flat among the House GOP where even Johnson's critics have shown little appetite for going through another three weeks of chaos like what followed the ouster of ex-Speaker Kevin McCarthy R-Calif. in October — particularly six months out from an election.

With just a razor-thin majority of two seats it would take little dissent for Johnson to lose the top House job if it fell along party lines. Eight House Republicans had voted with all Democrats to oust McCarthy in early October.

Unlike McCarthy's case however House Democrats have pledged to come to Johnson's aid by voting to table the resolution if it came up — a vote to table a measure which essentially kills it is a procedural hurdle that allows Democrats to block Johnson's ouster without having to actually vote on whether to fire him.

Johnson's critics seized on the left-wing support as evidence that the Louisiana Republican was not representing the interests of his own party.

""The entire Democrat Party is lining up behind Mike Johnson. First it was the entire leadership team for the Democrats. Now Nancy Pelosi who impeached President Trump TWICE has given Johnson her seal of approval. What deal has been made??"" Greene wrote on X on Monday along with a video of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. backing House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' decision to help Johnson.

The move could save Johnson's job but could also cost him some Republican support.

Massie told Fox News Digital last week when asked about how much GOP backing he expected ""I think it's a kinetic situation. And Hakeem and the entire Democrat leadership team endorsing Mike Johnson is going to cause a lot of people who weren't with us to be with us.""

Johnson for his part has repeatedly told reporters that he's not afraid of Greene's threats and has insisted his focus is on governing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOC9wb2xpdGljcy9ob3VzZS1yZWplY3RzLWdyZWVuZS1tb3Rpb24tdG8tdmFjYXRlL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L3BvbGl0aWNzL2hvdXNlLXJlamVjdHMtZ3JlZW5lLW1vdGlvbi10by12YWNhdGU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,House votes to block Greene’s effort to oust Johnson from speakership,"Washington CNN —

The House voted swiftly Wednesday evening to kill Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson from his leadership post.

The resounding vote in Johnson’s favor – which came with the help of Democrats – brings to an end the most serious challenge to the speakership the Louisiana Republican has faced at least for now.

As he navigates a razor-thin majority the failed ouster effort gives Johnson the opportunity to argue it is time to move on to other issues though support from Democrats may open him up to more criticism from his right flank.

Johnson spoke briefly with reporters following the vote calling Greene’s campaign against him “misguided” and thanking colleagues for a “show of confidence” in his leadership.

“I want to say that I appreciate the show of confidence for my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort” he said. “I’ve made clear here every day I intend to do my job I intend to do what I believe to be the right thing which I was elected to do. And I’ll let the chips fall where they may.”

Greene had dangled the threat of triggering a vote against the speaker for weeks a push that reopened bitter divisions within the House GOP conference as many members opposed ousting Johnson.

Johnson was elected speaker last year after conservative hardliners voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy a historic and unprecedented vote that sparked a tumultuous period of infighting as Republicans struggled to unify around a new leader before eventually coalescing around the Louisiana Republican.

The House on Wednesday voted to table – or kill – Greene’s push to remove Johnson by a tally of 359 to 43. Eleven Republicans voted against tabling.

In the wake of Johnson’s push to pass a major foreign aid package over the objections of hardline conservatives House Democratic leadership had announced that Democrats would help Johnson keep his job by voting to table.

On Wednesday evening Greene did not rule out forcing another vote against Johnson in the future and suggested that a statement from former President Donald Trump on Truth Social supports the potential for a motion to vacate at some point – despite the fact that he urged members to vote to kill her resolution.

Pressed by CNN’s Manu Raju on whether she would trigger a vote again this Congress Greene did not answer directly but said she is “thankful” for Trump’s support and pointed to the fact that he said on Truth Social that “at some point” Republicans may be in a position of voting on a motion to vacate.

“He also said in that statement that we may have to vacate and that’s something that I think people need to pay attention to” Greene said.

Asked whether she believes Trump was wrong to urge members to vote to table the congresswoman said “I stand with President Trump. I support President Trump. I’ve talked to him every day about this.”

House Republicans caught off guard

Greene and Johnson – as well as Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky – met over several days earlier this week where Greene outlined her concerns with Johnson’s leadership and her priorities. The House was on the verge of recessing for the week when Greene pulled up her motion to vacate the chair which started a two-legislative-day clock for GOP leaders to hold a vote on her measure.

House Republicans were completely caught off guard by Greene’s decision to trigger her motion multiple Republican sources told CNN. GOP leadership did not see this coming and thought after the two productive meetings between Johnson and Greene that there was at least more time before any next steps were taken the sources added.

“I was shocked” GOP Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia told CNN.

Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust Speaker Mike Johnson has officially failed.

But 11 House Republicans voted to at least allow debate on the matter.

Most lawmakers who voted with Greene were Democrats who are opposed to Johnson's politics.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to boot Speaker Mike Johnson has officially failed after the House voted by a 359-43 margin to table the Georgia Republican's motion to vacate on Wednesday.

11 Republicans sided with Greene voting against a procedural vote to table her motion. Basically they voted to allow a debate on Greene's effort rather than simply quashing it.

Just two other Republicans — Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Paul Gosar of Arizona — officially cosponsored her resolution.

Seven Democrats voted ""present.""

Greene's move was somewhat of a surprise with the congresswoman forcing the vote just one day after seemingly backing off of her threat.

Former President Donald Trump weighed in shortly after the vote saying that while he ""absolutely"" loves Greene he did not believe House Republicans were ""in a position to voting"" on the ouster bid.

The far-right congresswoman's effort was long expected to fail given Democratic leaders' decision to vote to table the motion. Ultimately 163 Democrats did so.

32 Democrats voted with Greene citing their opposition to Johnson's politics and their belief that Democrats should have asked for more in exchange for their votes.

I am not happy with where we are now but would not vote to vacate the speaker at this time. However I fought a lot to change Pelosi rules and have more accountability on the speaker in Congress so I voted not to table the motion consistent with my vote on McCarthy last fall. — Rep. Victoria Spartz (@RepSpartz) May 8 2024





""I'm not going to support MTG's silliness but I don't want to support the most homophobic speaker in American history"" Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan previously told BI referencing Johnson's opposition to LGBTQ+ rights.

It remains unclear whether Greene will continue to force votes on ousting Johnson.

Here are the 11 House Republicans who voted to advance the effort to oust Johnson:

Andy Biggs of Arizona

Eric Burlison of Missouri

Eli Crane of Arizona

Warren Davidson of Ohio

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia

Paul Gosar of Arizona

Thomas Massie of Kentucky

Alex Mooney of West Virginia

Barry Moore of Alabama

Chip Roy of Texas

The Prime Minister is expected to agree to put the final easing of controls on hold for up to four weeks when he meets senior ministers and officials on his return on Sunday from the G7 summit in Cornwall.

It could mean that lockdown lifting – which had been slated for June 21 under the Government’s road map – will be put back to July 19.

The move expected to be confirmed in a formal announcement on Monday will be a bitter blow for many businesses particularly in the hospitality sector which had been pinning their hopes on a full summer reopening.

Boris Johnson at the G7 in Cornwall said the Delta variant was a ‘serious serious concern’ (Leon Neal/PA)

However a poll by Opinium found significant public support for a postponement with 54% in favour and 37% against.

Scientists have been pressing for additional time to get more people vaccinated – particularly those in younger age groups – before controls are relaxed.

Public health officials believe a delay would also give more opportunity to control the spread using surge-testing techniques which proved successful in Bolton which was the first Delta variant hotspot.

Speaking in Cornwall on Saturday a downbeat Mr Johnson acknowledged that the rise of the variant was a matter of “serious serious concern”.

However in order to ensure the final lockdown lifting was “irreversible” he said that it may be necessary to give the vaccines “extra legs” in the race against the virus.

Some ministers however were reported to be even more pessimistic with one telling The Sunday Telegraph that they had a “very short window” in which to open up otherwise controls could have to stay in place until spring of next year.

“I am very worried the people who want to keep us shut down now want us to keep us shut down permanently and are aiming for ‘zero Covid’” the unnamed minister was quoted as saying.

(PA Graphics)

Scientists now estimate that 96% of all new cases of coronavirus are attributed to the Delta variant.

The latest figures from Public Health England (PHE) show there have been 42323 cases of the Delta variant confirmed in the UK up by 29892 from the previous week.

It estimates the strain is 60% more transmissible compared with the previously dominant Alpha or Kent variant and that cases are doubling every four-and-a-half days in some parts of England.

A team of experts from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and China concluded it was “extremely unlikely” the virus entered the human population as a result of a laboratory-related incident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

However US President Joe Biden has since ordered an investigation into the origins of the outbreak including the leak theory while the WHO has said it wants to do more work.

The head of the WHO Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters at the summit: “We believe that all hypotheses should be open and we need to proceed to the second phase to really know the origins.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

President Biden is expected to unveil a $1.5 trillion “human infrastructure” plan next week that will focus on education child care and paid leave for workers among other things. It would be paid for in part by new taxes on the rich including the end of a tax break that lawmakers have tried to eliminate for years.

The White House will propose a major change to capital gains taxes with people earning more than $1 million per year paying the top marginal tax rate on their investment gains. Mr. Biden wants to raise that rate to 39.6 percent.

The carried interest loophole might finally disappear. Profits earned from funds owned by real estate investors and managers of private equity and venture capital firms are taxed as capital gains at about 20 percent instead of as regular income which is taxed at more than double that rate when state levies and other taxes are taken into account.

Financial industry executives and their lobbyists have long asserted that carried interest merely represents a return on investment not income an argument that survived challenges as recently as 2017. (Here’s Andrew back in 2007 writing about how lawmakers were trying unsuccessfully to end the “longstanding but little understood practice.”)

In a 2015 DealBook Op-Ed the law professor Victor Fleischer a top proponent for raising taxes on carried interest estimated that such a move could raise $180 billion.

In a 2011 Times Op-Ed Warren Buffett decried the treatment of carried interest which allowed him to report a lower tax rate than his secretary. A minimum tax on millionaires was proposed shortly thereafter and dubbed the “Buffett rule.”

JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon has been a regular critic of carried interest even though it benefits many of the bank’s clients. In his latest letter to shareholders he said it could be seen as “another example of institutional bias and favoritism toward special interest groups.”

Other changes to the tax code could be in the works including to the estate tax. Private equity executives are also worried that the Biden administration may limit the tax deductibility of corporate interest payments which would be another hit to their business model.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzEyL2NpdGlncm91cHMtY2VvLXNheXMtdGhpcy1kaXZpc2lvbi1pcy10aGUtYmFua3MtY3JvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citigroup's CEO Says This Division Is the Bank's Crown Jewel. Will It Pay Off for Investors?,"Investors love Citigroup's treasury and trade solutions unit and would like to see it become a bigger part of the bank.

While its new CEO Jane Fraser is attempting to turn the bank around Citigroup (C 1.21%) is trading at a very cheap valuation compared to its peers and the broader industry. Not only does Citigroup need to address regulatory issues but Fraser is also looking to refresh the bank's strategy which has held it behind the other big U.S. banks for years.

A key part of that refresh will likely involve a heavier emphasis on Citigroup's treasury and trade solutions (TTS) division which Fraser recently called the ""crown jewel"" of the bank and a big driver of valuation going forward. Let's take a look at how this division currently fits into the broader bank and whether it can help Citigroup deliver for shareholders.

What is the TTS division?

Of the four largest U.S. banks by assets Citigroup is the most difficult to understand and analyze in my opinion. Its business model is more global than those of JPMorgan Chase Bank of America or Wells Fargo and it has the smallest lending operation of any of the four. But these two factors are likely why Citigroup has developed a world-class treasury and trade division.

The TTS division is part of Citigroup's larger institutional clients group but it essentially helps businesses all over the world run their operations. TTS solutions help clients carry out import and export operations manage liquidity and process payments using analytics to help them run more efficiently. The TTS group operates in 160 countries and 140 currencies and processes roughly $3 trillion in daily transactions.

At a recent conference Fraser said:

Having run Latin America I saw companies can't operate without us multinationals on the ground. So it really becomes this network we have in cash management in foreign exchange and trade and lending. ... Just given the dynamics in the world and you know the competitive position that the business has it's very hard to unseat this.

In 2020 TTS generated more than $9.5 billion of revenue for Citigroup. At the end of the first quarter of 2021 loan balances from the TTS group reached close to $71 billion while deposits from the division totaled $649 billion.

Does TTS drive valuation?

To a certain extent TTS has been a driver of valuation because it's a part of the bank that investors and analysts cite as a huge positive at Citigroup along with the bank's investment banking and credit card operations. But the $9.5 billion in revenue Citigroup made from TTS only made up about 13% of total revenue in 2020 and it hasn't been enough in recent years to overcome issues with other parts of Citigroup's operations such as parts of its global consumer bank.

Citigroup recently just exited its consumer banking operations in 13 global markets that were inefficient used too much capital and ran into credit quality issues during the pandemic. Investors overall seemed pleased with the move but there is still work to do in Citigroup's U.S. retail bank which in general does not have nearly the same scale as the other large U.S. banks like JPMorgan.

At the same conference where Fraser spoke analyst John McDonald of Autonomous Research noted that investors have told him it would be great to see TTS become a bigger part of Citigroup's business. Unfortunately since it only makes up a smaller portion of total revenue TTS has had a difficult time overcoming some of the pitfalls from the global consumer bank. Additionally Citigroup's profits from its credit card and other investment banking capabilities are still a larger piece of the pie so TTS does not really drive the bank's valuation right now although it contributes.

The good news is Fraser seemed to indicate that the bank recognizes this and will put more investment and effort going forward in order to create unmatched platforms and TTS capabilities in the future.

Can it drive valuation?

While TTS is clearly the ""crown jewel"" of Citigroup it still needs to scale further if it's truly going to drive the bank's valuation. If Citigroup does invest more in the unit and make it a larger portion of total revenue I am sure investors will reward Citigroup with a much more attractive valuation and stock price than it currently has. And with Citigroup refreshing its strategy and starting to exit businesses and geographies it either hasn't succeeded in or doesn't have the scale to compete in it should be able to focus more on areas like TTS moving forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLTA2LTEzL2ZlZC1kb3QtcGxvdC1zZWVuLXNoaWZ0aW5nLXRvLTIwMjMtcmF0ZS1saWZ0b2ZmLWVjb25vbWlzdHMtc2F50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fed Dot Plot Seen Shifting to 2023 Rate Liftoff Economists Say,"Sign up for the New Economy Daily newsletter follow us @economics and subscribe to our podcast.

In April Daniel Carraway founder of the polyhydroxyalkanoate start-up RWDC Industries found himself in an unusual forum for someone trying to sell plastic. Carraway was being interviewed by the Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr. on the FootPrint Coalition’s YouTube channel. The FootPrint Coalition is Downey’s venture capital firm and also an RWDC investor. The FootPrint Coalition’s other investments include a bamboo toilet paper company and an outfit developing mealworm protein.

Encouraged by Downey Carraway pitched his biodegradable biopolymer as the solution to the plastic waste crisis. “We have to clean up the mess we made” Carraway said. “But we also have to stop making the mess.” The plastic industry has been trying to establish a recycling infrastructure since the 1970s he noted but it “just doesn’t work.”

Carraway and other proponents are hyping polyhydroxyalkanoates known collectively as PHA as the next big thing but they are hardly new. Nature has used this class of polymers to store cellular energy for millions of years. Companies have been trying to commercialize them—via industrial fermentation—for several decades. But despite what should be a strong selling point—biodegradability in a wide range of environments—they haven’t taken off. The list of companies that have tried and failed to bring PHA to market keeps growing.

We have to clean up the mess we made but we also have to stop making the mess. Daniel Carraway founder RWDC

This time boosters of the polymer maintain will be different. The world has changed they say. Cities are banning plastic straws and take-out containers and PHA is a responsible alternative. Large consumer product companies are clamoring for biodegradable packaging. Indeed PHA Skittles bags and Bacardí rum bottles are due out in stores soon.

Danimer Scientific the firm responsible for those applications puts the addressable PHA market at 230 million metric tons (t) per year—more than half the world’s plastic demand. Meanwhile the PHA industry is still in its infancy with capacity of less than 1 million t.

Detractors however warn that it won’t be easy for PHA to compete with the likes of polyethylene and polypropylene. PHA’s biodegradability is overhyped they say. And the biopolymer is too expensive to compete with petrochemicals on a large scale. Regardless all eyes are on PHA.

The company leading the current charge for PHA is Danimer. The firm based in Bainbridge Georgia started as a polylactic acid compounder and bought its PHA fermentation technology from Procter & Gamble back in 2007.

Only recently has the PHA business begun to gain significant traction for Danimer. The company opened its first commercial plant in Winchester Kentucky last year. It can make 9000 t per year and is being expanded to about 30000 t by next year.

Danimer says it is struggling to keep up with forecast demand. The first plant it projects will be running at full capacity by the end of this year. Danimer is close to having the output for the expansion reserved by customers as well CEO Steve Croskrey says. “If you count pending contracts we’re there.”

The firm’s biggest-volume product right now Croskrey says is resin for drinking straws used in jurisdictions that have banned straws made from petrochemical plastic. Its sales may soon shift toward packaging. Mars Wrigley plans to start selling Skittles in PHA bags by early next year. Bacardi plans to introduce PHA liquor bottles in 2023 replacing 3000 t per year of conventional plastic. Danimer has also been working with PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay unit on snack bags.

Danimer went public last year through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. Such SPACs now trendy are shell companies that raise money in the stock market on the promise that they will buy a high-growth firm.

The SPAC transaction “gave us a little more certainty about the future and allowed us to focus on customers and construction and things like that as opposed to fundraising” Croskrey says. Flush with the $380 million it raised Danimer ratcheted up its growth agenda. It unveiled plans for a $700 million plant to open in Georgia by 2024 with more than 113000 t per year of PHA capacity.

But Croskrey quickly learned that going public has its downside. Danimer is now facing much more scrutiny than it ever did as a private company. Recent months have brought an exposé from the Wall Street Journal of its biodegradability claims and a series of reports from an investment firm alleging that Danimer executives are hyping the firm’s prospects.

The Wall Street Journal report published in March looks at claims such as the one Bacardí made of its PHA bottle: that it would biodegrade in 18 months. This claim was extrapolated the article states from laboratory tests on PHA sheet under ideal conditions. The article also spotlights a Danimer statement that PHA would biodegrade in landfills—not particularly an environmental benefit when garbage isn’t supposed to degrade in landfills.

A month later Spruce Point Capital Management targeted Danimer. Spruce Point is a short seller an investment firm that bets a company’s stock will decline. Short sellers will often issue reports designed to sour opinion about a company and push its stock price down.

Spruce Point combed through all the information about Danimer it could find. It even obtained Danimer’s production numbers through a Freedom of Information Act request for environmental records from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

It issued a report alleging for example that the company has financial ties to University of Georgia scientists who wrote complimentary studies about Danimer’s technology. It mentions that PepsiCo which had been a Danimer investor sold its shares in the company shortly after it went public.

The report chides Danimer for missing construction targets in Kentucky. It highlights Danimer’s admission made during an earnings call that only 10% of its planned production in Georgia is reserved under contract despite assurances that the new plant will be sold out. And from the Kentucky environmental figures Spruce Point gleans that Danimer is running at only 66% of capacity.

The report also compares Danimer to Metabolix a public company that has become a cautionary tale in PHA. A decade ago Metabolix seemed to have everything going for it including a 50000 t per year PHA joint venture in Iowa with Archer Daniels Midland. But the partnership struggled to sell even 1% of that capacity and ADM pulled the plug in 2012.

Metabolix sold its technology to CJ CheilJedang in 2016. The South Korean firm is now building a plant in Indonesia.

Spruce Point’s founder Ben Axler says he learned about Danimer from the Wall Street Journal story and decided it needed more attention. “We are trying to fill a gap in the traditional research that comes out of the Wall Street investment banks” he says adding that such analysts “tend to take management’s claims at face value.”

One prominent analyst covering Danimer Laurence Alexander of Jefferies Financial Group was bullish on the company when it went public and remains so after the Spruce Point reports. In his most recent note to clients for example Alexander writes that the coming shift toward commercialization “will be a positive one” for the company.

Short-seller reports can be influential. In 2019 the Italian company Bio-on was riding high. It ran a small plant in Bologna Italy that produced PHA from molasses and sugar beet by-products. It launched a line of sunscreens with Unilever that incorporate PHA micropowders. And it signed licenses for its technology in Italy Spain France Mexico and Tatarstan.

Then Quintessential Capital Management issued a report alleging that Bio-on was a “house of cards” that booked fictitious licensee revenue from its own shell companies. Bio-on declared bankruptcy later that year.

Danimer’s stock has lost nearly half its value since the Wall Street Journal article was published in March. However its market capitalization of nearly $2.3 billion is about what it was when it went public.

Croskrey says he often gets asked about the downside of being a publicly traded company. “And you know the downside is clearly this kind of situation where people can attack a company that’s trying to do good and save the world from plastic pollution” he says. “It should be criminal but it’s not unfortunately.”

Danimer released a three-page statement in May addressing the “misconceptions falsehoods and speculation that have been circulating.”

Responding to Spruce Point’s criticisms Danimer says the figures reported to the Kentucky government don’t reflect actual production because they measure polymer coming out of the fermenter before it is compounded with other ingredients and sent to customers. The firm also reiterates its projections for capacity expansions and its ramp-up in sales.

Croskrey adds that Danimer’s expansion plans were delayed to conserve cash during the pandemic a defensive maneuver a lot of companies used in 2020. He also notes that Danimer continues to work with PepsiCo which still has a seat on Danimer’s board.

Croskrey argues that Danimer has advantages Metabolix didn’t have. For instance Danimer starts with a medium-chain-length PHA which he says has more robust physical properties than the short-chain polymers Metabolix was developing. Moreover the company which has long been a major compounder of polylactic acid has more applications expertise than Metabolix did.

Croskrey is standing his ground on biodegradability as well. “PHA is nature’s recycling program” he proclaims. He says the polymer can degrade in landfills because most such facilities aren’t sterile. “PHA will go away in conditions where bacteria can thrive regardless of where that is” Croskrey says.

Industry watchers say PHA has traction in the marketplace though companies shouldn’t hype it. Ramani Narayan a chemical engineer at Michigan State University says the biodegradability of PHA has at times been “oversold” creating the impression that it will quickly disappear in the environment.

But Narayan notes PHA is one of the most biodegradable polymers on the market. A bottle that finds its way into the ocean “is going to last for several years before it’s going to be removed by microbial metabolism which is better than polyethylene and polypropylene which will keep on accumulating” he says. “So there is value.”

Jan Ravenstijn an independent biopolymer consultant and a veteran of Dow and DSM says PHA might indeed be on the cusp of a high-growth phase a transition many new polymers finally make after years of development. It took the polylactic acid maker NatureWorks 23 years to finally turn a profit he notes.

Evidence for PHA’s transition is the blistering demand coming primarily from Asia. “Prices have tripled over the past 9 months or so” Ravenstijn says. “They can sell much more than they can make at the moment.”

Ravenstijn says this demand is driving a raft of expansions from newer players like CJ Kaneka and a firm poised to become a US rival to Danimer: RWDC.

Carraway founded RWDC in 2015 with businessperson Roland Wee. Carraway was no newcomer to PHA having established Danimer in 2004 with his wife Meredith. Carraway sold most of his Danimer stake in 2014 and now has no connection to the company.

RWDC raised $133 million in financing last year. Its investors include Vickers Venture Partners and Flint Hills Resources a chemical arm of Koch Industries.

RWDC launched a 5000 t per year demonstration facility in Athens Georgia earlier this year on the site of a former Invista fiber plant. It has begun construction on a 25000 t unit that it hopes to open in 2023 also in Athens. It plans to build a similar-sized plant after that and possibly a plant in Singapore.

RWDC has a big customer lined up in Cove a California company that aims to bring a biodegradable water bottle to the market later this year. Cove signed an agreement to buy 160000 t over 5 years—most of the PHA that RWDC expects to make. Earlier this month RWDC announced a partnership with Kimberly-Clark a producer of diapers and other consumer products.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzEyL3NpZWdlci1tYXNjb3QtbmFtZXMtdGhhdC1uZWVkLXRvLWdvL9IBT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2LzEyL3NpZWdlci1tYXNjb3QtbmFtZXMtdGhhdC1uZWVkLXRvLWdvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sieger: Mascot names that need to go,"I understand the objections of Native Americans to certain team names.

Dan Snyder the owner of the Washington Football Team tried to defend the former Redskin name as denoting “honor respect and pride.”

Adrienne Keene a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and faculty member at Brown University’s American Studies and Ethnic Studies department responded “I would be honored and respected as a Native person if our treaties were honored if our sovereignty was recognized if our lands were taken back into Indigenous hands. Those are the type of things that honor me as a Native person not a stereotypical image combined with a racial slur.”

Any group of people gets to define what is disparaging to them and we need to respect that. So I get it.

But there are some team names out there that need to go not because they necessarily put down a particular group of people but just because they are ridiculous.

Here are a few:

The Jordan (Utah) High School Beetdiggers. The name was chosen due to the large areas surrounding the schools which were sugar beet fields. Up until about 1950 at harvest time classes were canceled during vacations of a week or two in October which allowed students to assist with the harvest. That’s a great explanation but as an Athlon Sports blogger noted “The nickname inspires fear. If you’re a beet.”

The Kimberly (Wis.) High School Papermakers. They play in Papermaker Stadium. The city of Kimberly and the surrounding area is home to many paper mills including Kimberly Clark. “With paper being such a large part of Wisconsin’s history” wrote Steven Okonek for On Focus “it is surprising that more schools do not take the Papermaker mascot.” Not so surprising to me. Is that a name you want on your jersey when you go to battle in the football trenches?

Grafton/St. Thomas (ND) High School Spoilers. As that Athlon Sports blogger put it “Isn’t the nickname ‘Spoilers’ a concession that you suck and can only hope to spoil a good team’s season?”

Cairo (Ga.) High School Syrupmakers. In 1986 ESPN named “Syrupmaker” the number one nickname for a high school sports team. Not sure if that selection was number one for weirdness or if ESPN was serious. During a driving rainstorm in the middle of a football game many years ago workers at the local syrup plant brought over their raincoats labeled “Roddenbery’s Syrup” to keep the players dry. Reflecting this heritage the football team was named the Syrupmakers. The school mascot is a syrup pitcher.

Mount Clemons (Mich.) High School Battling Bathers. Named after the mineral baths that used to be in the area. Former NFL defensive lineman Wally Chambers is an alumnus. I wonder how much teasing he received from his Chicago Bears teammates when they learned his high school’s nickname. Also what is their mascot? A guy or girl in a bathing suit?

Watersmeet (Mich.) Nimrods. As Athlon Sports pointed out “In the Bible Nimrod was a mighty hunter. Nobody knows their Bible anymore. Today a nimrod is merely a moron.”

Orofino (Idaho) High School Maniacs. Orofino is the home of a mental hospital State Hospital North. In 1993 the Idaho Alliance for the Mentally Ill wrote a letter to the school board requesting the mascot be abandoned because it stigmatizes and ”perpetuates the old stereotype attached to the mentally ill.” As it turns out the name “maniacs” was first coined in 1927 after a feverish basketball game with neighboring Kamiah and had nothing to do with the hospital. The mascot logo depicts a yelling jumping man with bushy black hair. The school board stated that the mascot “is not intended to depict a hospital patient enduring shock treatment as the alliance described.” The board decided to keep the moniker.

Teutopolis (Ill.) Wooden Shoes. In this small town southeast of Chicago the wooden shoe has been around for more than 150 years. Around 1860 George Dymann an immigrant from Germany came to the town and started making shoes out of wood. As Athlon Sports said of the team “They’re particularly loud on the basketball court. But slow.”

Freeburg (Ill.) High School Midgets. This name was also contested with the Little People of America urging the school district to change the nickname. The high school chose the mascot decades ago after a David-and-Goliath basketball game where Freeburg came out on top. The district elected to keep the name. “Once a Midget always a Midget” Board Secretary Kim Towers said. “Our community is happy to be Midgets and that’s where it’s at.” In 2013 the Huffington Post labeled the Midget name as among the “most tasteless” in the nation.

Scottsdale (Ariz.) Community College Fighting Artichokes. Born during a period of student unrest in the early 1970s Artie the Artichoke was adopted as the school’s mascot to express a difference of opinion concerning budget priorities. Originally intended to be a source of embarrassment Artie has been embraced by students athletes staff and the community as a beloved character. I would like to see them play the UC Santa Cruz Banana Slugs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaXN0b2xwb3N0LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYnJpc3RvbC1uZXdzL2JyaXN0b2wtcG9sbGVuLWNvdW50LXdhcm5pbmctaGF5ZmV2ZXItNTUyMzExONIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaXN0b2xwb3N0LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYnJpc3RvbC1uZXdzL2JyaXN0b2wtcG9sbGVuLWNvdW50LXdhcm5pbmctaGF5ZmV2ZXItNTUyMzExOC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bristol pollen count - warning to hayfever sufferers as pollen levels rocket,"We have more newsletters

Grass pollen is now in peak season according to the Met Office.

The service has a five-day pollen forecast for every region in the country and looking at the South West pollen levels will be very high for the next few days.

The Met Office pollen forecast for today (June 13) states: ""Grass pollen now in peak season.

""Fungal spores at medium risk. Lots of weed pollen mainly nettle.""

The forecast predicts that pollen levels in the region will be very high today tomorrow (June 14) and also Tuesday.

However pollen levels will reduce slightly on Wednesday (June 16) and Thursday (June 17) when they will drop to high.

The pollen count monitoring network combines Met Office weather data with expertise from organisations such as the National Pollen and Aerobiological Unit to produce pollen forecasts for five days ahead across the whole of the UK.

The news comes as the Met Office forecasts temperatures could reach 26C in the city today with the good weather being set to continue next week.

But according to the Kleenex pollen count forecast grass pollen levels in the city will remain high until Thursday (June 17).

With the severity of pollen level being measured by Pollen Grains Per Cubic Metre (PPM) the forecast predicts grass pollen levels could peak at 239PPM on Wednesday.

While tree pollen levels will this week be moderate or even low according to the Kleenex pollen count forecast weed pollen will be high or moderate - peaking at 122 PPM on Wednesday.

Hay fever is usually worse between late March and September especially when it's warm humid and windy explains the NHS as this is when the pollen count is at its highest.

Symptoms of hay fever include:

sneezing and coughing

a runny or blocked nose

itchy red or watery eyes

itchy throat mouth nose and ears

loss of smell

pain around your temples and forehead

headache

earache

feeling tired

Hay fever will last for weeks or months unlike a cold which usually goes away after 1 to 2 weeks.

Pollen tips

Amena Warner Head of Clinical Services Allergy UK has shared advice for hay fever sufferers on how they can manage symptoms when meeting friends and family in the garden pub or park:

Consider your wardrobe choices

Accessories like hats and wraparound sunglasses can stop pollen from reaching face hair and importantly eyes

Try using an allergen barrier balm

Some allergy sufferers find that applying an allergen barrier balm around the base of the nostrils and around sunglasses creates a barrier to airborne allergens

Schedule your daily outings carefully

Always check the Pollen Forecast before leaving the house. Monitoring pollen levels daily can help you plan ahead to manage your symptoms

Shower when you return home

Pollen can stay on your skin and hair after you’ve been outside so take a shower as soon as possible when you return home

Always carry a pack of tissues with you

Ori Ben Shai Vice President and Managing Director Kimberly-Clark UK said: “We know how unpleasant hay fever can be.

""The Kleenex Pollen Forecast offers unrivalled insight into local pollen levels and should be a big help for anyone struggling with allergies.

""We recommend that anyone with hay fever symptoms check pollen levels in their postcode daily to ensure they can prepare appropriately and need not hide inside while the sun is shining”.

But she was a student in Prishtina when Serbian forces slaughtered the family of Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) commander Adem Jashari between March 5 and 7 1998.

That massacre that saw 58 members of the Jashari family killed 28 of which were women and children was the moment when she decided to join the fight for the liberation of her country.

Knowing that there was fighting taking place in Drenica Mirvete managed to get to the operative zone making use of the connections of a friend of hers Arife Bajrami.

“I had this great determination. I did not sleep for a month before joining the KLA. I thought a lot about how I would cope with the war I was afraid I would run away if I saw something I could not cope with fully but fortunately I was there until the day of liberation” Hasani shares her memories with Exit News.

She first went to the village of Likovc where she found 18 other women who had just finished their military training. She joined the group and three days later she was given a weapon.

“When I joined the war and especially when I held the weapon for the first time it was the greatest joy I have ever felt in my life. Trust me it was an even greater joy than what I experienced when I held my first child for the first time” described Hasani who is a mother of three.

She recalls her first moments alongside National heroes Xheve Lladrovci and Fehmi Lladrovci a married couple who were killed while fighting in September 1998.

“Fehmi asked me ‘Hey you good girl do you know how to use a weapon?’ I actually didn’t but I said yes because I was afraid he would send me back home” she said.

Mirvete Hasani was 26 years old when she joined the Kosovo Liberation Army and her first time in the battlefield came very soon after when she fought in the village of Klecka then later in Prekaz and all the offensives that took place there.

“I used most [types] of weapons I also had a good sniper and a rifle” she recalls.

Hasani beams with pride when talking about the women who fought in the KLA uniform.

“I am very proud of our gender mine and our mothers’s. I don’t know of a single case where a woman dropped her weapon or deserted but I know of men who did and I understand [these men] because it had been a very difficult journey” she says empathetic.

“Women on the other hand there were women who cried if they were not sent to fight in the frontline” she stresses.

She recalls that the most dramatic moment that she experienced during the war happened when Xheve and Fehmi Lladrovci Fatime Hetimi and another soldier were killed.

“That day we were in Prekaz while they were on the other side in the village of Gllanaselle. When we were told they were killed I could not accept it I insisted they are alive” Hasani remembers.

Three days after she picked up the courage to ask a commander Sami Lushtaku—who today is her husband and the father of her children—if it was true that they had been really killed.

“He said yes and told me they had pulled out the corpses already. He said that Fatime’s face seemed to be smiling. So she died with a smile on her face while fighting. She was only 18 years old” Hasani mentions.

She adds that the moment she realized these fighters had died she could not help herself but howl at the top of her lungs.

“I heard my voice [resonate] in the sky but right away I told myself that we had to keep going because we were halfway there and we had to reach their goal and ours” she declaimed in reference to the force’s goal to liberate Kosovo.

Even today she has a hard time talking about what remains her most difficult memory of the war when her friend Ilir Lushtaku was killed.

Mirvete Hasani was injured when she happened to be visiting her family in the village of Shtitarice away from the war zone where she had been assigned to fight.

“On my way to my village I hoped there would be fighting so I could be part of it in my village” she said.

She spent her first night at home resting but the very next morning a large number of Serbian forces approached the village. She heard the news from her father.

“I had a very good sniper I told my dad that if I can’t break out of the village take the children away because I will move into a two-floors house nearby and will keep fighting as long as I have munitions” she recalls.

Following her father’s advice to not risk the lives of those children she made it out and joined a group of KLA soldiers nearby. Mirvete remembers that because the KLA fought them back the Serbian forces retreated.

“I arrived at the KLA’s trenches where I also saw my brother who had left earlier. We fought in that spot for three hours from 9 to 12 in the morning” she describes.

Around midday Mirvete the commander and another soldier were injured. They could only receive treatment after being carried for a long stretch of road by two KLA doctors Adem Ademi and Bajram Rexhepi the latter of whom would go on to become Prime Minister of Kosovo.

“But the next day there was fighting nearby and together with Drita Simnica we joined a group of soldiers. If I couldn’t hear any shooting I would get very worried that the KLA soldiers had stopped fighting before they had liberated the country.”

As the KLA kept fighting on the ground NATO forces bombed Serbian military bases during a large scale air campaign that lasted for 78 days.

On June 10 the Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces from Kosovo and two days later the NATO peacekeeping force KFOR entered the country.

Kosovo celebrates its Liberation Day on June 12.

Mirvete however remembers June 12 as a very sad day for her and her co-fighters.

“As we were walking towards the town of Skenderaj we were all sad because we knew how much the friends we had lost had loved the [idea] of freedom” she notes.

“I thought to myself how is it possible that I have made it and my friends have been killed. Maybe they wanted this freedom more than those of us who survived” Mirvete contemplates sorrowfully.

She remembers they were all very tired and emaciated.

“I can’t imagine how we were even able to walk. When I look at that uniform today it is so small. I remember that every week I had to open a new hole in my belt as I kept losing weight” she said.

The pain for the friends she had lost was greater than the joy of going back to her family after liberating the country. However the fight for her country’s freedom will always remain a story she is proud to share.

“I was very lucky to have lived in this time when I could participate in the war to liberate my country. I don’t think I will ever be this lucky again” she ends her tale.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 Largest Milk Producing Countries in 2021.

We all know the importance of milk in our lives. Milk contains some of the most important nutrients that we require especially for growing children including calcium and protein to strengthen bones and muscles. According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015 - 2020 adults should consume 3 cups or equivalent of low fat or fat-free dairy every single day to maintain a healthy diet. This includes not just pure milk but cheese yogurt and other milk products.

Milk contains a lot of calcium which is extremely important for the development of bones and it is also necessary to ensure strong teeth and nerve signals too. However despite milk being rich in calcium many adults across the world instead have to rely on their calcium supplements to overcome calcium deficiency. One of the reasons for this is lactose intolerance.

Lactose is the main carbohydrate in milk and lactose intolerance is the inability of the body to break down lactose which can cause different types of symptoms such as bloating vomiting or even diarrhea. Unfortunately this is not an uncommon condition; in fact the vast majority of adults (around 65% to 70%) are lactose intolerant with Europeans faring much better than everyone else.

Even though the consumption of pure milk is decreasing dairy-related products like chocolates ice cream cheese desserts and candies are causing the demand of milk to soar all over the world. Companies like Lifeway Foods Inc. (NASDAQ: LWAY) Oatly Group AB (publ) - ADR (NASDAQ: OTLY) and Kroger Co (NYSE: KR) which sell milk-related products are benefitting from this trend.

Amid the increase in demand for plant-based products different companies are striving to produce plant-based milk products. Last year it was reported that Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) rival Impossible Foods is developing plant-based milk to cater to an increasing customer base that prefers plant-based milk instead of milk of cows.

The global dairy market of which milk is the main raw material is worth more than $700 billion. Products have become safer and healthier over time due to greater oversight and regulations and some of the biggest dairy companies in the world in this industry include Unilever (NYSE:UN) and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC). Even profitability in the industry and in dairy farms is increasing because of the implementation of new technology which has helped herald greater efficiency.

20 Largest Milk Producing Countries in

While you might think that farms are everywhere globally and that milk production would be spread across evenly across the globe the truth is quite different. Just three countries are responsible for over 40% of total global milk production where at least two countries are located in Asia. Just the top 20 countries are responsible for the production of 77% of global milk production. Now it is true that these 20 countries are spread across the globe from North America to South America to Europe to Asia with Africa being the main continent not making any appearance.

This was originally scheduled as our “Mother’s Day at Lake Charlotte” paddle but more than a week ahead we could see that there was a good chance of having strong winds from the south which would cause rough conditions at Lake Charlotte. When that forecast continued to hold right on up through Friday we moved the venue for Sunday’s trip to Champion Lake which would still offer a great cypress swamp experience but with much more protection from a south wind.

We knew from Friday's scouting report that the water level would be quite high which would give us easy access to most of the lake. Indeed it was at 10.92 feet on the gauge at the Trinity River National Wildlife Refuge’s fishing pier adjacent to the boat ramp up a little from what the scouts had observed two days before. Our scouts had also told us to expect a thick mat of floating azolla fern plants. Rains farther upstream in the Trinity River watershed had caused the river to rise but not enough to reach flood stage at the Liberty gauge which would generally trigger closure of the Champion Lake Public Use Area. Just enough water was entering the lake from the north to push that mat of azolla fern slowly to the south and east toward the spillway in the Champion Lake levee.

For each year’s waterfowl hunting season the Trinity River National Wildlife Refuge conducts a drawing for hunters to obtain permits to hunt within specific numbered clearings in the Refuge’s forested wetlands at Champion Lake. Because these clearings can serve as landmarks I will use the Refuge’s hunting map to help describe where we went.

Our group which included paddlers in 3 tandem canoes 1 solo canoe and 8 solo kayaks met up at the Refuge’s boat ramp and got underway relatively quickly for a group of 15 people. Because our scouts had alerted us to a brisk flow along the levee to the northeast of the boat ramp we did not go in that direction. Even though the wind had not picked up much yet we headed north to the channel of Big Caney Creek which has a line of trees along its south side that serves as a windbreak.

To let everyone get the hang of how the directional signs along the paddling trails are set up we followed the markers leading to Sites #3 and #4 as we headed westward up Big Caney Creek. We enjoyed a brief and gentle rain shower that wasn’t accompanied by any thunder and helped to keep the temperature pleasant.

Near the Five Finger Tree we chose the northern branch of the paddling trail that leads on up to Site #5. Thanks to expert advance scouting advice from Joe Coker we took the exit for Site #5 and continued on into the forest for a little ways to the west of it to a perfect lunch spot. Even though the treetops were swaying somewhat overhead it was calm down at water level. This was just the right place for everyone to introduce themselves and to engage in some spirited conversations.

After the lunch break we explored more along the northern paddling trail then headed back down to Big Caney Creek for a short distance before cutting to the south along another branch of the paddling trail to Site #15. Continuing on down toward Site #16 we spied an egret in a nest up ahead of us. Being careful not to disturb the bird we reversed course back up to Big Caney Creek and took the alternative homeward-bound paddling trail that leads by Site #13. We encountered some wind on the final short leg to the east on the way back to the boat ramp but it was manageable and we weren’t exposed to it for very long.

Once that short rain shower during the morning had passed the day turned out to be really beautiful. In addition to all of the remarkable aquatic and forest vegetation members of the group saw or heard a number of bird species while we were on the water. Here is a listing thanks to Cindy Bartos and Rea Inglis: Mississippi Kite Northern Parula Yellow-throated Warbler Carolina Chickadee Tufted Titmouse Downy Woodpecker Black-bellied Whistling Duck Yellow-crowned Night Heron Green Heron Great Egret and Prothonotary Warbler.



Since we had kept the route for the trip relatively short at 4.9 miles we were able to reach the take-out by a few minutes before 2:00. Given the amount of poking around in the forest that we had done and the extra resistance to our forward progress that was offered by the floating mat of azolla fern in places this seemed just about right.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vMzI2NjcxL3RyYWRlci1qb2VzLWlzLWluY3JlYXNpbmctZW1wbG95ZWVzLXBheS1uYXRpb253aWRlLWhlcmVzLXdoeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trader Joe's Is Increasing Employees' Pay Nationwide. Here's Why,"Trader Joe's Is Increasing Employees' Pay Nationwide. Here's Why

In November 2020 Trader Joe's fessed up to the 1250 known cases of COVID-19 including two deaths among its nationwide staff between the start of the pandemic and the end of October (via Grocery Dive). The figures are dramatically lower than some of its retail competitors (Amazon's numbers during the same time hovered around 20000). But they nonetheless highlight the dangers workers on the frontline face.

While other stores (like Kroger) discontinued their ""hero pay"" programs early in the pandemic Trader Joe's has consistently offered its workers a $2.00 an hour ""thank you"" bonus (via ABC and CBS). As of Feb. 1 the grocery chain announced that it would double this hourly premium to $4.00 an hour.

The initiative isn't the company's own. It comes after Seattle's city council mandated a $4.00 pay hike for all frontline workers in large grocery stores (via The Seattle Times). Berkeley San Jose and Los Angeles are all considering similar wage mandates. Oakland Long Beach and Santa Monica already passed them (via East Bay Times).

An internal company letter acquired by The Seattle Times explained Trader Joe's decision to its employees as only ""fair"" considering such citywide mandates. Meanwhile in a statement sent to Mashed the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union applauded Trader Joe's decision pointing to the measure as an example of ""some companies ... stepping up to do the right thing for these essential workers.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53dGhyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvcGlwZS1idXJzdHMtaW4tZG93bnRvd24taW5keS1zZW5kaW5nLXN0ZWFtLWRlYnJpcy1za3ktaGlnaC81MzEtNzU1MGM5NDAtNzUxNi00MjQwLTg4NmEtOTFhZTM3YTM4ZjI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citizens Energy updates pipe burst in downtown Indy that sent steam debris sky-high,"An underground steam pipe burst at the intersection of Michigan Street and Senate Avenue Saturday.

INDIANAPOLIS — Citizens Energy said Monday a contractor for a telecommunications provider hit an AES Indiana power line near a Citizens facility Saturday that sent steam and debris into the air.

As a result the Citizen's facility experienced a power interruption that impacted steam supply.

Citizens said as they began to restore the steam supply the leak occurred.

Citizens said a leak is rare and did not occur due to lack of maintenance or corroded infrastructure.

Indianapolis firefighters went to the intersection of Michigan Street and Senate Avenue around 2:40 p.m. Saturday for an underground steam pipe that had erupted near a Kroger grocery store.

Firefighters urged the public to stay away from the area while Citizens Energy Group worked to shut down the pipe.

""STAY AWAY from area on foot bike or car"" IFD said in a tweet that featured a video of the pipe erupting Saturday.

By 3:43 p.m. the burst pipe was brought under control.

After one more push of heavy steam Citizens Energy Group was able to get the underground steam pipe shut down.

The system presented by Dynetics is called Enduring Shield and is a mobile ground-based weapon system designed to acquire track engage and defeat unmanned aircraft systems cruise missiles and rockets artillery and mortars.

Derived from Dynetics technology and modified around previous Army science and technology programs the Enduring Shield solution has been bid to meet the Army’s Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 program needs. The company said it redesigned the launcher reduced complexity and refined capabilities to create Enduring Shield.

The system is capable of firing a range of missiles while and has the ability to engage multiple targets simultaneously. It can also be integrated with the army’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System and offers both cyber resiliency and electronic warfare protections.

“The Enduring Shield solution leverages Dynetics’ experience with ground-based launcher systems for the Army including hypersonic missiles and other programs. We are eager to offer this all American solution to the Army’s cruise missile and other air defense needs” said Ronnie Chronister senior vice president for Weapons Technology and Manufacturing at Dynetics.

Dynetics is also working with the US Army on developing a directed energy weapon that will have its power increased from a 100 kW-class system to a 300kW-class system as part of the indirect fires protection capability – high energy laser (IFPC-HEL) endeavor.

Another known contender for the US Army’s IFPC program which held a shoot off event in April this year is the Rafael and Raytheon duo who are offering the Iron Dome solution with Tamir interceptors.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Technically it was more of a plea but it’s an important one. So we decided to help amplify Thomas’s concern with the lack of 2FA or two-factor authentication on smart home devices.

In Thomas’s case it’s the Flo by Moen Smart Water Security System. According to him Moen said it would bring 2FA support roughly a year ago which would add more protection to his Moen account. That hasn’t happened yet.

This means on the Flo by Moen and other smart devices without 2FA support consumers don’t have a second layer of account protection. While we often discuss IoT device exploits that require a network connection losing control of a device account doesn’t always require network access.

Think of it this way: If a smart device is configured for remote access as they often are it can be accessed from anywhere in a supporting mobile app. To use that app all you need is the account credentials. In theory then someone could get Thomas’s Moen account credentials and remotely disable the system monitoring without his knowledge.

With 2FA implemented any ill-intentioned hackers would have to get through the second level of access before modifying his device. And that’s harder. 2FA often relies on a second device dongle USB key or constantly rotating numeric code. Text messages are used for 2FA as well but they’re inherently insecure.

I personally use 2FA on all of my devices and support for it is now a factor in my purchase decisions for smart home gear.

Would I care if someone got my Wyze passwords and remotely accessed my smart bulbs? I wouldn’t be happy but it wouldn’t be earth-shattering. I could simply unscrew the bulbs and/or replace them in a worst-case situation.

In the case of connected devices that can control the water flow or temperature to my home though? That poses a potential danger and even worse destruction. Those are the devices that I would want 2FA support on the most so I can appreciate Thomas’s disappointment on this one.

To hear Thomas’s question in full as well as our discussion on the topic tune in to the IoT Podcast below:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vdHVjc29uLmNvbS9pbnN0YWdyYW0vaG91c2luZy1pcy1ib29taW5nLWluLXJlZC1yb2NrLW5vcnRoLW9mLXR1Y3Nvbi9hcnRpY2xlXzIxNjczYmRhLWJlN2UtMTFlYi04NDFkLWYzMDY4YWU4YWE1Ni5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Housing is booming in Red Rock north of Tucson,"A former cattle ranching community in Pinal County is experiencing a major influx of residents.

Red Rock is attracting homebuyers from both the Tucson and Phoenix markets and benefitting from new factories — and workers — in Casa Grande and Coolidge.

Hundreds of rooftops are popping up just north of Pima-Pinal County line where more than 3000 homes are planned in the community Seasons at Red Rock.

Aside from the major tech jobs recently announced in the Phoenix area Pinal County has landed some big employers.

Nikola Corp. an alternative-fuels heavy truck maker is building a factory in Coolidge and Lucid Motors which makes luxury electric sedans opened a plant in Casa Grande earlier this year.

The region was featured recently by the Wall Street Journal.

“Companies producing everything from steel to electric cars are planning and building new plants in Southwest states” the Journal wrote “far from historical hubs of American industry in the midwest and southeast.”

There are currently 865 occupied homes in Red Rock with a population of close to 2000 residents.

Sunbelt Holdings which bought the land in 2018 and is developing the new community hopes to build around 3000 homes said vice president Greg Mohl.

The 770-acre community features a 14-acre park with baseball diamonds a pool and water features for kids a pro-level skate park and walking/bike paths.

Richmond American Homes and Lennar Homes are building there and a third homebuilder is expected to come on board soon.

Sunbelt is also in talks with potential retail developments such as a convenience store/gas station and a small grocer Mohl said.

Currently the nearest gas stations are Marana to the south or Picacho to the north.

There may also be additional multifamily projects such as apartments or build-to-rent homes.

“Red Rock has huge potential to be an all-in-one community” Mohl said. “The new jobs in Casa Grande and Coolidge are really fueling the growth.”

Last year Richmond American Homes bought 220 home sites and has sold 40 said Andrew Gregory an association broker with Richmond American Homes.

“It used to be that urban sprawl was a detriment but not anymore” he said. “One couple from Tucson was stuck working from home and needed bigger space and didn’t mind being away from things.”

Another couple is relocating from California because their jobs are now permanently remote.

“We’ve also got a lot of folks where one spouse works in Tucson and the other in the Phoenix valley” Gregory said.

The drive from Red Rock to downtown Tucson is about 30 minutes.

The price point of about $281000 is also appealing as new-home prices in Pima and Maricopa counties start well into the upper $300000 range.

“It will boom”

A prominent ranching family arrived in what is now Red Rock in the 1860s.

The Aguirre Cattle Co. ran thousands of head of cattle from Red Rock to Oro Valley and hauled ore from the Silver Bell Mine to the railroad spur in Red Rock.

Mary Aguirre lives in the family home that once served as the cattle company’s headquarters on a lane of older homes just north of the new housing development between Sasco Road and the Interstate 10 frontage road.

She’s been watching the frenzied development underway in Red Rock.

“They’re moving fast now because the housing market is so limited” Aguirre said. “Once they put commercial retail in there it will boom.”

A Dollar General is the only store in the community stocked with household goods and basic groceries.

Most of the family’s ranch land has been sold except for a few acres around the original home on Aguirre Lane which was named after the family in the 1960s.

As she was feeding her lambs and goats Aguirre 77 said she’s not worried about potential congestion as Sunbelt is working with the state to add an exit that goes directly from I-10 to the new development.

She does however wish it was not so dense.

“They’re just jammed in there” she said of the new houses. “But I understand the economics.”",,,,,,,,,

SpaceX is gearing up for its third mission of June following Saturday’s successful Static Fire Test of the once-flown B1062 core stage on storied Space Launch Complex (SLC)-40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Fla. Liftoff of the veteran Falcon 9—in what promises to be SpaceX’s fourth consecutive month of 2021 to see at least three launches—is targeted to occur during a 15-minute “window” which opens at 12:09 p.m. EDT Thursday. Primary payload is the fifth Block III Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite for the U.S. Space Force destined for Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) at an altitude of about 12200 miles (20000 km) above the Home Planet.

As previously reported by AmericaSpace GPS III-05—named in honor of Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong the first man to set foot on the Moon—was delivered to the Space Coast Regional Airport in Titusville in early April aboard a C-17 Globemaster III cargo transport.

Built by Lockheed Martin at its customized GPS Block III facility near Denver Colo. it subsequently underwent several weeks of post-shipment functional testing and propellant loading. This culminated last Wednesday with the full encapsulation of the payload into its Falcon 9 fairing at Astrotech Space Operations (ASO). The bulbous fairing serves to protect GPS III-05 from the dynamic pressures and aerodynamic extremes endured during the violent climb to orbit.

As its name implies this is the fifth GPS Block III satellite (known as “Space Vehicle 05” or “SV-05”) in military parlance and the fourth to ride a Falcon 9. It follows hard on the heels of last November’s GPS III-04 mission—which went on to complete its on-orbit checkout in record-breaking time—and two previous flights: GPS III-03 in June 2020 and GPS III-01 in December 2018. Another satellite in the series GPS III-02 flew atop the final United Launch Alliance (ULA) Delta IV Medium booster in August 2019.

But whereas each of SpaceX’s three prior GPS Block III missions used brand-new Falcon 9 cores it was announced last September that GPS III-05 would employ a previously-flown booster. That booster turned out to be the “B1062” core which also provided the first-stage muscle to lift GPS III-04 on its way last November. Accordingly Thursday’s mission will be the first National Security Space Launch (NSSL) to fly a used rocket.

“The GPS III program continues to make strides in modernizing the GPS constellation for the United States Space Force maintaining the “gold standard” for position navigation and timing” said Col. Edward Byrne Medium Earth Orbit Space Systems division chief. “SV-05 is not only the first-ever USSF satellite launched on a previously-flown booster but also is the 24th Military-Code (M-Code) satellite introduced to our constellation the last needed to bring M-Code to full operational capability.”

Building upon a GPS Navstar heritage dating back to the 1970s Block III got underway two decades ago and the Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin a $1.4 billion contract in May 2008 to develop the first pair of Block III satellites in what will eventually comprise a 32-satellite network with the first launch initially targeted for 2014. However payload difficulties ultimately pushed the program’s maiden flight back by almost five years and it did not launch until December 2018.

Following a Request for Proposals (RFP) issued by the Air Force in June 2017 for the fourth fifth and sixth GPS Block III missions SpaceX received the $290.5 million contract in March 2018. Although SpaceX delivered two Block III satellites to orbit in December 2018 and June 2020 both flew under separate contracts.

The first satellite to fly under the $290.5 million contract was last November’s GPS III-04 with Thursday’s GPS III-05 set to become the second. The sixth GPS Block III satellite is currently targeted for launch sometime next year.

Contracts to procure long-lead-time components for GPS III-05 and GPS III-06 were awarded by the Air Force to Lockheed Martin way back in February 2013 and the firm was authorized to complete production on both satellites the following December. And when GPS III-05 arrived safely on the Space Coast in early April it became the third satellite to be delivered for launch in less than 14 months.

Weighing 8500 pounds (3900 kg) and capable of a 15-year operational lifetime these powerful satellites are built by Lockheed Martin at its customized GPS Block III facility near Denver Colo. They are based upon the tried-and-true A2100 “bus” whose modular framework produces 15 kilowatts of electricity via high-efficiency solar cells radiation-cooled traveling-wave tube assemblies and improved heat-pipe design.

The expansive operational lifetime of each Block III bird represents a 25-percent quantum leap over earlier GPS satellite capabilities as well as 500 times greater transmitting power improved navigational warfare abilities three times better accuracy and an eightfold enhancement in anti-jamming functionality.

All told this enables GPS Block III to shut off service to limited geographical locations whilst maintaining uninterrupted provision for U.S. and allied forces. It features a cross-linked command-and-control architecture which permits the entire “constellation” to be updated from a singular ground station. Furthermore the satellites showcase a “spot-beam” capability for enhanced Military-Code (“M-Code”) coverage and better resistance to hostile jamming. These enhancements are expected to lead to improved accuracy and assured availability for military and civilian GPS users worldwide.

In keeping with tradition the Block III birds are named for long-gone explorers with the first and second honoring “Age of Sail” navigators Amerigo Vespucci and Ferdinand Magellan. More recently the third satellite initially recognized Christopher Columbus but was later renamed for the early 20th-century polar pioneer Matthew Henson.

And last November’s GPS III-04 paid tribute to Sacagawea a Lemhi Shoshone woman of Idaho who at the age of just 16 aided the Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore the Louisiana Territory in 1803-1806. She traveled with Lewis and Clark from North Dakota to the shores of the Pacific Ocean and played an important role in establishing cultural ties with Native American populations along the route.

GPS satellite will join current 31-satellite operational constellation

BREVARD COUNTY • CAPE CANAVERAL FLORIDA – The U.S. Space Force’s Space and Missile Systems Center’s Lockheed Martin-built GPS III Space Vehicle 05 satellite was encapsulated within a SpaceX payload fairing at Astrotech Space Operations Florida facility on June 9 in preparation for its upcoming launch scheduled for June 17 2021 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.

The 15-minute launch window opens at 12:09 p.m. EDT.

Encapsulation of the satellite within the payload fairing protects the satellite from the impact of dynamic pressure and aerodynamic heating during its harrowing journey through the earth’s atmosphere and supports the ability to communicate with the satellite until separation from the launch vehicle on orbit.

“The GPS III program continues to make strides in modernizing the GPS constellation for the United States Space Force maintaining the ‘gold standard for the position navigation and timing” said Col. Edward Byrne Medium Earth Orbit Space Systems division chief “SV05 is not only the first-ever USSF satellite launched on a previously flown booster but also is the 24th Military-Code (M-Code) satellite introduced to our constellation the last needed to bring M-Code to full operational capability.”

GPS III SV05 will join the current 31-satellite operational constellation to continue to provide the gold standard in positioning navigation and timing services for more than four billion users worldwide.

Space and Missile Systems Center located at Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo California is the U.S. Space Force’s center of acquisition excellence for acquiring and developing military space systems.

Its portfolio includes the development of advanced space and launch capability and systems global positioning systems military satellite communications defense meteorological satellites space launch and range systems satellite control networks space-based infrared systems and space situational awareness capabilities.

Five members of President Iván Duque’s cabinet have stepped down or been replaced. Duque withdrew his regressive tax bill that sparked the protests as well as a controversial health bill and the proposal to pay billions for Lockheed Martin war jets in the midst of the worst health and economic crises Colombia has faced in decades. A movement has consolidated with a clear focus on the government’s sabotaging of the peace accords with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and continued overseeing of massive inequality which has become intolerable for large segments of the population.

Duque and his political party have shown their inability or unwillingness to respond to the protesters’ demands which reflect Colombia’s corruption and neo-feudal inequities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic. A third wave of the coronavirus claimed over fifteen thousand lives in May and kept ICUs at near 100 percent capacity in Colombia’s major cities. Security forces have catalyzed enormous shows of solidarity with the general strike through their vicious attacks on peaceful protesters.

More than forty demonstrators have been summarily executed by state and parastate armed forces with Human Rights Watch receiving sixty-three credible reports of deaths during the protests two of which were police. Human rights groups Temblores and Indepaz have reported more than 2000 documented cases of police brutality more than 1600 arbitrary detentions 25 confirmed sexual assaults 65 eye injuries and 346 forced disappearances of protesters since the general strike began with Indigenous Afro and poor communities the primary targets of repression.

Miguel Ceballos was the high commissioner for peace and government representative in pre-negotiations with the National Strike Committee until he resigned on May 22. Ceballos was widely criticized in the human rights community for undermining the peace process on behalf of the government. President Duque named Juan Camilo Restrepo to replace Ceballos as peace commissioner. Restrepo was the president of Augura a banana producer trade association when it donated $33 million Colombian pesos to the campaign against the 2016 peace accords. Augura is known for direct support of paramilitary groups and numerous board members are considered supporters or direct participants in paramilitary organizations operating in Antioquia.

The Duque administration has repeatedly sabotaged their own government’s pre-negotiations with the Strike Committee representing protesters refusing to provide guarantees of basic rights to protesters while ramping up the militarized crackdown — the continuation of a long tradition in Colombia of responding to social mobilization with state and parastate repression.

Lucía González a leading member of Colombia’s Truth Commission that was formed as part of the peace accords between the government and the FARC put it bluntly in late May when she spoke of

a state that is anti-reform that has criminalized every attempt to deepen democracy whatever the form eliminating union activists human rights leaders stigmatizing mobilizations criminalizing the leaders of the mobilizations with the goal of guaranteeing a status quo and avoiding any kind of reform that results from their demands. It is a state that protects the elites and the privileges of certain sectors against the rights of others. It is a state by the elites for the elites.

Cali has been the epicenter of state and parastate violence since the beginning of the general strike. A May 23 report released by the organization Justicia y Paz on the situation in Cali describes a particularly horrifying iteration of González’s analysis: on May 2 Cali’s Center of Municipal Administration was used as a center of clandestine operations and protesters were taken there and detained in basements before being transported elsewhere in trucks. The report described mass graves in two municipalities outside Cali the Mulaló area of Yumbo and the Guacarí area of Buga where bodies of disappeared protesters have allegedly been dumped from trucks used by police.

The reports from Buga describe executions of young protesters who were reported as disappeared. Some who survived the executions were later found in health centers with gunshot wounds and are now in hiding and facing death threats.

The report also describes the formation of armed paramilitary groups under protection of police operating out of the upscale Ciudad Jardín district in Cali. Ciudad Jardín was the site of armed attacks by wealthy neighborhood residents accompanied by police on unarmed Indigenous marchers. During the May 9 attacks at least eight participants in the march sustained gunshot wounds at the hands of the armed civilians.

There are now reports of casas de pique in Ciudad Jardín a term used to describe the clandestine centers used by paramilitary groups in the region to detain torture kill and often dismember the bodies of their victims. Currently 120 people are reported as disappeared from the Cali protests since April 28.

Alfredo Molano Jimeno reported in El Espectador on May 24 that medical brigades serving protesters in Cali are being targeted by professional assassins and security forces. Medical workers have reported that they are now removing the identifying marks that they traditionally wear in conflict zones to avoid being targeted. Numerous medical workers have reported that they were informed that a bounty had been offered for the murder of health volunteers caring for protesters in Cali and have described being targeted by police and civilians.

On May 25 Argentine human rights lawyer Juan Grabois who arrived in Colombia with the International Commission of Solidarity and Human Rights to monitor human rights abuses was denied entry detained and then deported later that day. Human rights observers already in the country have been targeted by police and armed civilians throughout the general strike. The Duque government denied or delayed the requests of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) to come to Colombia to monitor the human rights situation before finally capitulating this past week to pressure from international groups including the US government.

The IACHR has met with government and civil groups all week and Duque announced a superficial police reform bill the day the commission arrived in Bogotá. Temblores Indepaz and Paiis presented a devastating report to the IACHR commission detailing a long list of confirmed state-backed atrocities.

The Duque regime has embarked on a multipronged communications strategy designed to stigmatize the largely peaceful protests as acts of terrorism internally and to present a picture of rigorous institutional protocol to the international community. The campaign has produced mixed results thanks to the wide circulation of images and videos showing the scope of state brutality. The failure of both approaches does not seem to have deterred the Duque administration and their Centro Democrático Party from doubling down on the dirty war they have unleashed on the protests.

Álvaro Uribe Colombia’s former right-wing president and Duque’s political patron has used his Twitter platform to support violence against protesters and promote a neo-Nazi theory of “dissipated molecular revolution” that claims protest is inherently an act of civil war requiring a militarized state response. While Twitter removed a tweet of Uribe’s early in the general strike for “glorifying violence” the social media network has since allowed him to use it as his command center from which he sends messages invoking the language of terrorism and counterinsurgency to police and paramilitary groups that continue to maim torture rape and kill protesters.

A recent Invamer poll showed Uribe and Duque with disapproval ratings of 73 percent and 76 percent respectively underscoring the weakness of their political position in advance of next year’s general elections with center-left opposition leader Gustavo Petro leading presidential candidates by a comfortable margin in all recent polls. The moral and political bankruptcy of the Centro Democrático Party with its deep and well-documented ties to narco-paramilitarism stands in stark contrast to the youth-driven movement that has metastasized into the most significant and widespread social uprising Colombia has seen in the past seventy years.

On May 27 Duque appeared at the Wilson Center in Washington DC with former ambassador and former USAID director Mark Green claiming to respect peaceful protests and the rule of law and having zero tolerance for police abuses. At the same time he couldn’t resist echoing an English-language campaign-style faux-interview video released days earlier where he blamed the entire uprising and ensuing violence on Petro and shadowy subversive forces seeking to undermine his presidency.

The next day Marta Lucía Ramírez vice president and acting foreign minister met with US secretary of state Antony Blinken to continue the attempted charm offensive. (She was conspicuously unable to secure a meeting with Vice President Harris.) Meanwhile in the Siloé neighborhood of Cali an off-duty investigator for the investigative division of the attorney general’s office killed two young protesters at a roadblock from his motorcycle in a drive-by shooting. The shooter was then captured and killed by other protesters.

The human rights group Justapaz sent out an alert that evening denouncing plainclothes paramilitary shooters in Siloé targeting medical workers who were attending to the fourteen protesters already injured by gunfire that evening. That night Duque appeared across town in Ciudad Jardín — the same exclusive Cali neighborhood that has served as base of operations for paramilitary groups attacking protesters — where he greeted wealthy residents with hugs and announced for the third time in two weeks his intention to deploy maximum military force to retake Cali from the protesters. He has already militarized eight departments of the country — effectively a third of Colombia — in response to protests.

Duque fell out of US favor soon after members of his government meddled in the 2020 US presidential elections on behalf of the wrong guy. But Washington has long been forgiving of the transgressions of far-right narco-regimes considered strategic to US interests and the United States needs to shore up its foothold in Colombia more than ever in advance of a likely impending leftward political shift in current right-wing strongholds like Brazil and Chile. Given this week’s victory of socialist candidate Pedro Castillo in Peru’s presidential election it is conceivable that within a year or two the vast majority of South American countries will be led by left-leaning governments — a dramatic turnaround from the recent wave of extreme-right neoliberalism and protofascism that has ravaged the region.

The question is whether the United States will continue to support repressive Colombian governments like Duque’s regardless of their human rights abuses. Such support is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain in the face of mounting media focus on their recent atrocities. But the United States has never been afraid to support attacks on democracy in the region including in recent years in Bolivia Brazil Haiti Honduras and Paraguay.

If anything it would be a surprise to see the United States just sit by and let their number one South American ally slip into the sinister hands of social democracy. Conditions on the ground in Colombia however might leave them with no choice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5cmV2aWV3LmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2Rlbm5pcy1tLXN1dGhlcmxpbi03MC9hcnRpY2xlXzU4MjExZjUxLTk5Y2YtNTAzZC1iYTBmLWRhNWEwMWZhZTFkMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dennis M.

Many Lake Norman residents know that Josh’s Farmer’s Market a family-owned farmers market and community staple for 30-plus years specializes in locally sourced home-grown produce of the highest quality. But what many residents do not realize is that the popular open-air market moved across the street from its former location in April after the land was unexpectedly sold after having been in the family for four generations.

The new location of Josh’s Farmers Market is located at 170 Joe Knox Avenue just behind the Lowe’s YMCA main building.

“This is a temporary location until we can move to our permanent 4.5-acre site just a mile south at the intersection of Williamson and Sundown Roads hopefully by spring of 2022” said owner Josh Graham. “We’re really excited to be at the Y in the interim. Parking and access are much easier and we’ve doubled our space so we can represent and promote more vendors than ever before.”

The land that houses the Lowe’s YMCA used to belong to Josh’s great grandparents and grand-parents so in a sense he has “come home.”

Ashley Morgan executive director with the Lowe’s YMCA said providing space for the market reflects the Y’s mission to strengthen the community through collaborations.

“Our partnership with Josh’s Farmers Market creates a unique opportunity to expose our members to an assortment of locally-grown produce homemade goodies and many other great things as well as allows Josh’s customers to learn that the Y empowers everyone no matter who they are or where they’re from by ensuring access to resources relationships and opportunities for all to learn grow and thrive. This collaboration is truly bringing the community together at the Y” Morgan said.

With the additional space Josh has been able to increase the number of vendors providing his customers with a large and varied selection of unique offerings from craftsman-style sheds to Amish-built gliders swings rockers and picnic tables to homemade pizza Grampian farm grass-fed beef elderberry syrup pimento cheese ice cream BBQ sauces jellies jams preserves and honey to baked goods (fruit pies cakes cookies donuts and other pastries) to soaps pottery fresh cut and potted flowers pumpkins and mums in the fall and beautiful wreaths garlands and Christmas trees in the winter. The popular Seafood Connection (available every Friday through Sunday) features fresh in-season fish from the Carolina coast such as mahi swordfish shrimp grouper halibut tuna flounder clams Faroe Island salmon live jumbo softshell crabs and more).

Josh’s Farmer’s Market is open Monday-Thursday from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

In the 1980s Rob Lowe was an infamous member of the Brat Pack. All of a sudden drugs and alcohol became readily available at the drop of a hat. At the age of 26 the St. Elmo’s Fire actor decided to get sober. Though there were several factors that led him to make this decision there was one incident in particular that inspired him to seek help.

Rob Lowe’s Brat Pack days

The film that made Lowe a star The Outsiders was filmed in Tulsa Okla. He turned 18 while shooting.

“Every day when we would wrap we’d get in a van” Lowe told Variety. “The Teamsters would give us a carton of beer. This was a Warner Bros. movie — as mainstream as it gets.”

18th birthday on the set of The Outsiders. 57th on the set of 911 Lonestar. In between have been amazing gifts professionally and personally. I am a grateful man. Thank you for the birthday wishes. Means a lot. Love you all! pic.twitter.com/Z1A7TFqlJc — Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) March 17 2021

As Lowe’s career progressed he learned first-hand of the industry’s then-attitude toward illicit drugs particularly cocaine.

“This was just how the business was back then” he said. “Cocaine was the thing that successful people did. There was always that wonderful moment when as an active drug abuser you’d go on the set and figure out which department was selling the coke on the set. It was no different than craft services. Where are the Red Vines and where is the great Peruvian blow?”

“Those days are long long loooong gone” he added.

The decision to get sober

“Nothing can make you get sober except you wanting to do it” he said. “The threat of losing a marriage losing a job incarceration — you name the threat it will not be enough to do it. It’s got to be in you. The reason that people don’t get sober 100% of the time when they go into programs is that people aren’t ready when they go to use the tools.”

On May 10 1990 Lowe was ready.

Though the actor had previously faced legal trouble in 1989 a year after Lowe made a sex tape with a 16-year-old girl — the teenager’s family filed a lawsuit against him — this was not the moment that made Lowe realize he needed help.

Instead a missed phone call from his mother convinced the Parks and Recreation actor he needed to make a change.

“I wasn’t ready until I was ready” he said. “I was ready when one day back in the days of answering machines my mother called me and I could hear her voice on the answering machine. I didn’t want to pick up because I was really really hungover and I didn’t want her to know. She was telling me that my grandfather who I loved was in critical condition in the hospital and she needed my help. And I didn’t pick up. My thought process in that moment was ‘I need to drink a half a bottle of tequila right now so I can go to sleep so I can wake up so I can pick up this phone.’”

Today I have 31 years drug and alcohol free. I want to give thanks to everyone walking this path with me and welcome anyone thinking about joining us; the free and the happy. And a big hug to my family for putting up with me!! Xoxo pic.twitter.com/DHbPegsqoX — Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) May 10 2021

As hungover as he was even Lowe knew his thought process was “nuts.”

“It was like a badly written moment in a soap opera — complete with the walk into the bathroom and looking at myself in the mirror” he said.

Lowe had been carrying around a business card of a drug and alcohol counselor in his wallet that a friend had given him.

“I couldn’t keep a pair of sunglasses for more than two weeks but I kept this card for a year in my wallet” he said. “I called it the next day.”

Rob Lowe still works on his sobriety every day

Learning about the science of addiction and how substance abuse can affect the brain was integral for Lowe’s recovery. Therapy helped too — understanding why he was the way he was and how his experiences had shaped him.

“All of my understanding about life has come from getting sober and being in recovery” he said. “The work that you do once you stop whatever it is you’ve been abusing — that’s when the real work begins. And that continues to this day. In many ways it doesn’t get any easier but it does get more fulfilling.”

Lowe said people always thought he was going to end up like Warren Beatty in Shampoo.

“Instead when I got sober who I really was came out” he said. “It turned out I was one of the first of my peers to get married and have kids. That guy was in me all the time but the life I was leading wouldn’t let him out.”

“One of the great gifts of recovery is that you start living your authentic life. You start living your actual values and living as who you truly are” he added.

Sunday’s action at the Misano World Circuit “Marco Simoncelli” for the Pirelli Made in Italy Emilia-Romagna Round with Race 1 winner Michael Ruben Rinaldi (Aruba.it Racing – Ducati) topping the 15-minute session by over half a second ahead of Sunday’s two MOTUL FIM Superbike World Championship races.

Rinaldi was untouchable in the 15-minute session to kickstart the day’s action with a lap time of 1’33.774s seven tenths clear of teammate Scott Redding as the British rider looks to make the step onto the podium in his team’s home race with Turkish star Toprak Razgatlioglu (Pata Yamaha with BRIXX WorldSBK) in third place.

Reigning Champion Jonathan Rea (Kawasaki Racing Team WorldSBK) finished in fourth place one second off Rinaldi’s time with teammate Alex Lowes around 0.020s behind Rea. American Garrett Gerloff (GRT Yamaha WorldSBK Team); the American will need to battle his way back through the grid in the Tissot Superpole Race.

Leon Haslam (Team HRC) was seventh ahead of Michael van der Mark (BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team) and Chaz Davies (Team GoEleven) with Tom Sykes (BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team) completing the top ten.

The Italian driver set the best time in the final free practice session ahead of his teammate Scott Redding and Toprak Razgatlioglu.

After a first day of free practice dominated by Michael Ruben Rinaldi on Ducati the Superbike riders returned to the track this morning at around 9 a.m. to take part in FP3 the last rehearsals before the first event of the weekend: Superpole.

With the sun still present on the Adriatic coast and the mercury already reaching 24°C in the air and 29°C on the ground the 22 competitors benefited from ideal conditions during these 30 minutes of driving which allowed them to refine their settings.

Summary of the results of the 2021 edition:

WSBK Superbike Misano June 2019 June 2021 FP1 1'36.029 Jonathan Rea 1'34.848 Toprak Razgatlioglu FP2 1'36.021 Michael van der Mark 1'34.334 Michael Ruben Rinaldi FP3 1'46.484 Loris Baz 1'34.018 Michael Ruben Rinaldi Super poles 1'34.596 Jonathan Rea Race 1 Rea Sykes Bautista Warm Up 1'35.814 Jonathan Rea Superpole race Bautista Lowes Haslam Race 2 Rea Razgatlioglu Haslam All time lap record 1'34.596 Jonathan Rea

A godsend for Alex Lowes who is riding a Kawasaki for the first time on the Misano circuit and showed substantial gains from the start of the session by being the first to get to the top of the timesheet .

But that did not last for the Englishman quickly dislodged by Rinaldi decidedly untenable at home and determined to give a boost to his somewhat sluggish season so far (he has not yet finished on the slightest podium where his teammate Scott Redding has two victories).

Redding secures double for Ducati

The latter for his part came to the support of his garage neighbor by joining the leading group at the start of the session thus continuing his progression in the ranking. It will be recalled that number 45 experienced a very difficult first free practice session yesterday finishing in a distant 12th place.

In the end the former MotoGP rider finished FP3 in second place allowing the factory Ducati team to achieve an auspicious one-two finish heading into qualifying. He is ahead of Toprak Razgatlioglu who set his best time in the final moments and enters the top 3. Then follow the two Kawasakis of Lowes and Jonathan Rea in that order.

Big fall for Laverty and red flag

Garrett Gerloff took sixth place ahead of Eugene Laverty the victim of an accident in turn 10 just under seven minutes from the end of the session triggering the red flags and an interruption of the session almost ten minutes. The Northern Irish pilot was left with a visit to the medical center but the first returns are rather reassuring.

🏥MEDICAL DIRECTOR INFO: Rider #50 @eugenelaverty has been taken to the medical center for a check-up. Rider conscious. Updates to follow. #ITAWorldSBK 🇮🇹 - WorldSBK (@WorldSBK) June 12 2021

Tom Sykes finished these FP3s in eighth place ahead of Axel Bassani and Andrea Locatelli. We then find Michael van der Mark at the gates of the top 10 just ahead of Leon Haslam. Difficult session on the other hand for the Frenchman Lucas Mahias only 15th and who finished ahead of Chaz Davies and Álvaro Bautista. Christophe Ponsson is 20th.

With FP3 completed the Superbike riders will now turn their attention to Superpole the start of which is scheduled for 11:10 a.m. The latter will make it possible to establish the hierarchy which will take place on the grid in the afternoon during Race 1.

LULU,Lululemon Athletica,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZXZlcnlnaXJsLmNvbS90cnlpbmctbHVsdWxlbW9uLWFsaWduLWR1cGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trying the Most Popular Lululemon Align Dupes,"I am always (seriously ALWAYS) keeping an eye out for a great dupe. Although I love fashion shopping and clothes more than many other things in this world I do not have an unlimited budget. Therefore even though I’d love to I simply cannot spend $100 on every pair of leggings I own. Luckily we live in a world where Lululemon dupes are aplenty.

The famous Lululemon Align Pant is a favorite of our editors our readers our friends and seemingly every single person on the internet. I love them just as much as the next gal—and I of course believe in treating yourself every now and then as well as in investing in quality pieces that will last a long time. However sometimes a girl just needs a pair that won’t break the bank.

I searched the internet saved every Lulu dupe TikTok I saw and read reviews until my eyes hurt to find the absolute best and most popular Align dupes out there. Then I ordered them all and tried them out so that I could share my new found expertise with all of you. And let me tell you I definitely found my new favorite (keep reading to find out which one 😉).

In an effort to keep things consistent I ordered everything in a 7/8 length or 25″ inseam—but I am 5’3″ so that’s why they all look pretty much full-length on me. I wear a size 10 in Lululemon leggings and I ordered every other pair in a size large (apart from the Aerie ones which are a medium).

Keep reading to find out which of these Lulu Align dupes are worth the purchase and which are not:

These leggings are so popular for a reason: they truly are buttery soft they fit well and do not slide down and the waistband is supportive enough that they are always flattering. A few of our editors even swear that no other leggings come close to being as good. I definitely love how they feel but I’ll be honest—I think they’re a tiiiny bit overhyped. For the price point I just think that there are other leggings out there that are just as great. However I do appreciate the selection of colors patterns and lengths as well as the brand’s warranty policy.

You guys I am telling you these are THE. ONES. They feel exactly like Aligns down to the point where I think they could be made from the exact same material. The texture is identical: truly buttery soft with the same level of thickness. They also have the same seams (style and placement) and a circular logo on the back of the waistband. So if someone saw you on the street they would have no idea these weren’t the real thing. The ONLY tiny difference is that the hidden pocket in the front of the waistband is on the opposite side (which doesn’t matter I am just letting you know). The one downfall is that there aren’t a ton of colors but catch me ordering the rest and wearing them all summer long.

These are also pretty close to the real thing but the material is a tiny (emphasis on tiny) bit different. They are slightly more slick feeling and a little bit less buttery. However they still feel thick enough to be supportive and not slide down. They also have the second seam detail on the waistband which I actually think is kind of cute! This pair has the most color options by far so if you’re looking to try something out of your comfort zone for summer these are a great affordable option.

Our editors love the Colorfulkoala brand for affordable leggings and I’ve personally owned this pair for a little while now. I love that they are supportive enough to work out in but comfortable enough to lounge around in or wear while working from home. Although they are not an exact dupe they definitely can hang with Lulu Aligns and for the price point are a great option. They stay up and the waistband is thick and comfortable. This particular style does not come in a ton of colors but the options they do come in are all cute!

OK so I wouldn’t really say these are a dupe for Aligns but they are definitely a comparable option. The material is a little different: this Aerie pair is more slick than buttery and they are slightly more lightweight. They also have a different style of seam going for more of a seamless and less structured look. I love and own three pairs of these and I will say that they are more of a lounge legging than one you can workout in. They are soooo comfortable but they sometimes slide down slightly because of the lightweight material. This is an especially great option if you’re looking for a non-Amazon pair at a reasonable price (they are also on sale more often than not!).

This is the only pair that I was disappointed in. The material is not very close at all: these are more slick feeling feel a little cheap and I would not call them “buttery.” However I do have to disclaim that I ordered a pair in a color called “Black Lux” so that I could get a 25″ pair so I am wondering if that means that they have a different feel than the rest of the colors that do not have “Lux” in the title. They do have a lot of positive reviews so I think it’s either that or that the material has recently changed. But I will also say that I liked the fit of these the least. They are definitely less high-waisted and something about them just made me feel like they were unflattering.",,,,,,,,,,,,

For many middle-class Americans $1 million is still a whole lot of money. With all the bills monthly mortgages or rent rising costs of groceries among so many other expenses — not to mention inflation rates — the idea of saving $1 million in their lifetime seems insurmountably hard.

Yet according to a new study by Northwestern Mutual the average adult in the U.S. said that they expect they’ll need at least $1.46 million to retire comfortably. This number while already high still represents a 15% increase from last year’s study and a whopping 53% increase from 2020.

So how can a person living in today’s middle class possibly save such a large amount of money for their golden years? The good news according to Kelly Gilbert owner and principal of EFG Financial is that even taking simple common-sense actions can help you create massive savings for your retirement.

GOBankingRates talked to Gilbert to get his advice for how people in the middle class can work to reach that $1 million goal for retirement.

Start Saving Now

You might think that you simply have too many obligations right now to really put your focus on retirement savings. There’s the mortgage. And the car note. Your eldest child’s braces. And oh yeah utility bills. Not to mention grocery prices that may make it seem like you need to take out a loan before loading up your cart.

Or you may think you should only be saving toward more pressing milestones like buying a house or college tuition. However you’d be wrong. Gilbert said that one of the most important things you can do is to start saving for retirement right now.

“The interest over time earned on your savings can help reach goals so start saving for retirement as soon as possible” he said.

Gilbert added that you can get resourceful as you figure out ways to jumpstart your savings. For instance you should take advantage of any employer matches on retirement account contributions.

Make Saving Automatic

There’s no greater temptation to start spending — even if it’s on necessities — like seeing that little bit left over in your paycheck after you’ve paid your bills. But before you start planning that vacation or daydreaming about a new car you should factor in the reality of your retirement savings.

Gilbert suggested alleviating temptation by automatically routing a portion of your paycheck directly to your retirement account. It may be hard to picture the benefits in the short term but when you’re sitting on your porch — or better yet enjoying some time on the beach — in retirement you’ll thank your younger self.

Cut Spending

Use your retirement savings goals as a reason to take the shears to your spending and really trim yourself down to only the essentials.

“Review recurring charges in your budget and get rid of any monthly subscriptions and memberships you do not use” Gilbert said. “If you want to make a nonessential purchase wait a couple of days before you buy it to determine if it’s a want or a need.”

He added that investigating rewards programs to boost savings for essential items such as groceries and gas can also help you increase savings.

Become a Minimalist

Remember Marie Kondo? Turns out her philosophy of minimalism isn’t just applicable to your living space — it’s also great for your retirement savings account.

Avoiding extravagant or unnecessary purchases is one of the best things you can do for your savings according to Gilbert. He said that living within your means and sticking to a budget can help you get closer to your retirement goals.

To paraphrase Kondo ask yourself what will really spark joy — a big luxury car you’ll end up replacing before you retire anyway or the chance to feel secure in a pleasurable retirement.

One bettor's big decision for $1.7 million,"Open Extended Reactions

Wayne Shelton walked into Paycom Center on Tuesday for his first ever NBA playoff game. It was Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Shelton a single father of one and owner of a real estate appraisal business in Phoenix Arizona is ""nervous as hell."" Over the past year he's become one of the Thunder's biggest supporters -- not for sentimental reasons but because the team may help him cash the parlay of a lifetime.

Shelton avidly watches and bets on sports often using multiple screens to keep up with all of the action. However his method for sports betting isn't exactly conventional: He largely only bets futures very rarely dabbling in day-to-day betting.

""I plant seeds throughout the year"" Shelton told ESPN. ""I bet all the major sports for all the futures divisions whatever. And the whole idea is I'll invest a decent amount but now I get to enjoy the entire season as a sports bettor without having to put more money down. I can enjoy what I invested and enjoy every game because they all matter.""

So over one year ago May 1 2023 when DraftKings offered him a high-limit 50% profit boost he knew he had to take a shot.

Shelton noticed that the Texas Rangers had an outrageously positive run differential a month into the MLB season and on that day believed they were a better shot to win the World Series than their 22-1 odds suggested. He began his process of ""research"" -- but for the purposes of this new bet that term will be used loosely. A family member whose family was ""not really into sports"" started following the Kansas City Chiefs so Shelton felt betting a repeat for the reigning champs could be fun at +600.

Then there was the Thunder who Shelton believed showed potential after a feisty outing as the 10-seed in the play-in tournament. At 70-1 to win in 2024 OKC was the final piece of Shelton's puzzle.

He packaged the three championship futures into a $100 parlay to build a new futures ticket. The payout: $1.7 million.

""I never bet that high on a future especially a lottery ticket like this one"" Shelton said. ""They gave me a high max and I just said 'You know what? This one time max it out let's go.' [I] never do that. [And] here we are.""

In November the Rangers won their first World Series in franchise history. In February the Chiefs repeated as Super Bowl champions. Now the Thunder the Western Conference's No. 1 seed are three series wins away from capturing the franchise's first NBA title since moving to Oklahoma City.

""Most people would prefer to [bet] day-to-day and that's because you get your payout immediately"" Shelton said. ""For someone that does it like me you have to be willing to invest. You have to know you are not going to get paid tomorrow. It's been a year since I made the ticket and I've just enjoyed the ride.""

Shelton aims to have 40 futures tickets active at any given time so he's generally familiar with the options available to him to maximize his profit. However with so much money on the line this time (his previous biggest win was $7000) he has had to think about it a little harder.

The most traditional method is hedging which he did ahead of the Dallas-Oklahoma City series to the tune of a $10000 payout should the Mavericks win. He said he will ""probably"" hedge each round if the Thunder continue to win.

Additionally like all major sportsbooks DraftKings offered a cash out on the wager but at around $75000 following OKC's opening round series win Shelton didn't believe the value aligned and started looking at his options to cash out elsewhere.

After the Super Bowl reports emerged of a betting ticket that was just a Thunder title win away from cashing $1.7 million. Travis Geiger's ears instantly perked up.

About four years prior Geiger Zach Doctor and Guy Dotan all alumni of UCLA founded WagerWire a secondary betting ticket exchange born out of the founders' desires for a place to buy into each other's action. While the company isn't the first of its kind -- PropSwap for example launched in 2015 -- Geiger and his co-founders believe they got in early on something that could become a staple of the betting industry.

""This is not only a way for you to ride with your friends but a way for you to play it like an asset that you're more familiar with like a pair of sneakers like crypto like a stock"" Geiger told ESPN. ""It takes what was a risk class and makes it an asset class. If you game it all the way out it creates a secondary market and as we know secondary markets are kind of an inevitability of capitalism.""

Users sync their sportsbook accounts with WagerWire populating their wagers in the app's system. From there they can shop their bet around to other users or wait for offers to come in. They can of course purchase other users' wagers as well.

The app's bet value calculator tells users how much a given ticket is worth based on the original odds/payout and the probability of it cashing based on events that have already occurred. In Shelton's case WagerWire valued the ticket at just over $180000 ahead of the Thunder's series against the Mavericks.

Expected payout for Shelton's ticket If the Thunder ... Expected Value of Ticket After Game 1 of Thunder-Mavs $228613 Advance to Western Conference finals $330366 Advance to NBA Finals $720420 According to WagerWire calculations.

Geiger wanted the opportunity to land this ticket on WagerWire as it would be the biggest bet the platform ever handled. He reached out to the purported ticket holder -- only it wasn't Shelton but instead a 23-year-old named Sean Koehler who attempted to co-opt the internet fame by claiming the ticket was his.

Shelton caught wind of the scheme and contacted Koehler who admitted to duping media outlets. Shelton eventually verified the bet was his by syncing his DraftKings account in WagerWire. DraftKings declined to comment for this story but confirmed the legitimacy of the ticket.

Though Shelton wasn't sure if he even wanted to sell he listed the ticket on the platform to keep all his options open.

Right now WagerWire makes its money by splitting ""nominal"" buyer transaction fees with sportsbooks which vary from operator to operator. For big transactions like Shelton's -- as well as that of Martwon Weaver who sold a $680960 NFL awards parlay that ultimately lost for $25000 -- the company waives its fees.

The sportsbooks handle all of the actual transferring of wagers -- a feature that keeps the secondary market compliant with betting laws.

""The PropSwap transaction relates to what the holder of the sportsbook ticket wants to do with that piece of paper which is now really a contract between the player and the book"" Nevada attorney Dan Reaser told ESPN about PropSwap in 2017. ""It is not the business of taking wagers to facilitate someone buying or selling that contract.""

Geiger feels that his company's product complements sportsbook's cash-out options which are inherently lower than market value to align with their own business needs. To that end it's possible that WagerWire and similar products could eventually directly integrate with sportsbook interfaces providing a more appealing alternative right in the apps.

It might eventually look similar to the secondary events ticket marketplace: If a user couldn't get the ticket they wanted at the original price they can pay a premium to get in later.

Finding a buyer willing to pay thousands -- or hundreds of thousands in Shelton's case -- to get in on the action can be difficult. This is where another company White Glove Bets enters the picture.

Self-described as a ""concierge service"" for digital betting White Glove Bets has a stable of ""high-level VIPs"" that ordinarily cannot deposit money at major sportsbooks due to the inherent risk they bring with their deep coffers. While they're not what you would call professional bettors these players regularly make six-figure deposits and wagers.

""They have that Type A personality if you will"" White Glove Bets co-founder Kevin Smith told ESPN. ""Many of them are business owners or at least executives that are pretty high up the food chain."" He added that many of the company's clients also work in the financial sector. Smith said the clientele is ""predominantly"" male bettors with some as young as 25 years old. Several have been circling Shelton's ticket.

One of the potential investors who has a particular penchant for futures was very intrigued by the final leg of the wager and expressed interest in buying it. Smith has requested that the potential buyer remain anonymous.

White Glove Bets set them up with WagerWire who facilitated a $100000 offer to Shelton -- who promptly turned it down.

At that time Shelton characterized it as a fair offer given DraftKings' cash out was approximately $55000. But knowing that the Thunder were likely to knock out the Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs he decided to hold onto the ticket anticipating a value increase. He also had some reservations about the still emerging secondary market.

""The first thing that was going through my head was 'Wow ok somebody is considering a hundred grand'"" said Shelton. ""If somebody's willing to offer me a reasonable amount above cash out I'm not going to ignore it no question. It's just that I have to trust the company that I'm talking to or the person I'm talking to and I just don't know these companies well enough to be comfortable saying 'Sure I'll do that.'""

Since then Shelton claims to have gotten several offers over $100000 though he notes that many of these including one for $200000 were not legitimate. Protecting the original ticket remains his top priority.

Still if the secondary market can continue to grow and be taken seriously it could provide the alternative to cash outs that high-end bettors have been waiting for: Only a ""super VIP"" could have the capital to bail Shelton's ticket out above the cash out value and such a buyer could also have the means to properly hedge the bet all the way.

""As [the big betting operators] become more corporate they have less tolerance for high-end VIPs"" Smith said. ""I'm not being critical of them at all or their business model.""

While the financial thrillseekers wait in the wings looking for that moment to make him a life-changing offer Shelton is just enjoying the ride. He says he might take a vacation and wants to meet someone famous if and when he comes away with the money but hasn't put a lot of thought into it because it isn't tangible. For now the betting everyman is staying the course taking his monumental decision day by day.

""My family has been supportive people online -- and there's a lot of them -- have been very supportive and that does help with the immense amount of stress that comes with this"" Shelton said. ""And when I say stress -- find like 30 different emotions bundle them up together and it's that way all the time. But I appreciate that and I appreciate that people haven't been harsh and cruel.""

On Tuesday night with Shelton in attendance the Thunder won the first game of their series. The new value of the ticket according to WagerWire is $228613

""[I'm] relieved that I get a day to breathe"" Shelton told ESPN Wednesday morning. ""Awesome game and environment.""

This was the only game of the series Shelton was planning on attending. Now it's back to Arizona where the largest sweat of his life -- and perhaps others -- will continue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L2xpZmVzdHlsZS9pbS1hLXBvcm4tc3Rhci1oZXJlcy10aGUtbW9zdC1jb21tb24tbWlzdGFrZS1tZW4tbWFrZS1kdXJpbmctc2V4L9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L2xpZmVzdHlsZS9pbS1hLXBvcm4tc3Rhci1oZXJlcy10aGUtbW9zdC1jb21tb24tbWlzdGFrZS1tZW4tbWFrZS1kdXJpbmctc2V4L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I'm a porn star — here's the most common mistake men make during sex,"X-rated creators have revealed what Aussie men are getting wrong when it comes to sex and there’s a clear theme.

Sex conversations are having a moment in Australia. There’s been a rise in women creating racy content online and it has led to plenty of chatter about modern sexuality trends and kinks.

Now four creators have revealed what men are still getting wrong about sex in 2024 and why the most common mistake is an exclusively Aussie issue.

Alicia Davis who was a correctional officer bringing home $1100 per week before she became an X-rated creator via a subscription service said Aussie men can be quite “egotistical” when it comes to sex.

Davis 31 said they’re often far too eager to rush in which can ruin the experience.

“They think it’s all about getting in and getting the job done rather than the little things that can add to the moment.”

She explained that many don’t care if a woman is satisfied as long as they are.

Davis went as far to say that European men are better in bed.

“Whenever I’ve slept with an Irish or British guy they have been much more communicative and sensual. It makes a world of difference” she argued.

Similarly creator Annie Knight 26 who previously went viral for revealing that she’d slept with 300 people in the past 12 months said Aussie men tend to have a “jump straight in” approach to sex which isn’t ideal.

“What they don’t understand is you have to go slowly. Start by kissing and light touching” she said.

Kay Manuel who is also an X-rated creator said the issue is once again that Aussie men “rush” to reach the finish.

“Honestly it derails the whole experience” she said.

Manuel said this can often lead to women “faking it” because they want to appease men who aren’t making enough effort.

“We are made to feel that stroking their ego by faking it will make for better sex. But that only serves … them” she pointed out.

The theme of having no patience continued with escort Katija Cortez who said men think women can orgasm on “command.”

“I’m not sure how men really think we can just make it happen automatically 57 times in a session. Even better when they last 10 seconds and ask if I’ve finished!” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNlbnRyYWxtYWluZS5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9vYml0dWFyeXJvYmVydC1tLXBoaWxsaXBzLTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary: Robert M. Phillips,"WAYNE – Robert M. Phillips of Winter Haven Fla. and Wayne died peacefully at home in Wayne after a long battle with Parkinson’s Disease with his family at his bedside. Bob was 78 years old.

Bob was born on Aug. 31 1945 in Blue Hill the son of Harold Maurice Phillips and Hildred (Williams) Phillips. He grew up in that small town never venturing too far unless it was a trip to Selden (near Danforth) to visit family. It was there that he learned to fish for brook trout with his Uncle Alton and cousins Bobby and Roger. There were lots of chances to fish at home too over the years especially along Mill Brook by his home winding its way from the back side of Blue Hill Mountain on into the Blue Hill Bay.

Those growing-up years were also marked by participation in most school athletics Boy Scouts a newspaper route tending lawns and gardens around town music lessons a couple summers working at the Weekly Packet newspaper spending too much money every year at the Blue Hill Fair and riding his bike all over the place in a time before helmets and paved bike lanes.

Bob graduated from George Stevens Academy in 1963 and moved on to study engineering at the University of Maine Orono graduating in 1968 with a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering.

He began three years of active military service in 1968 at the Naval Officer Candidate School in Newport R.I. receiving his commission as an “officer and a gentleman” in March 1969. After an additional three months of training in San Diego Calif. he served aboard the USS Earnest G. Small DD 838 as Main Propulsion Assistant until its decommissioning in late 1970. Home port was Pearl Harbor Hawaii and his time aboard ship included a six-month deployment to the western pacific with an aircraft carrier group during the Vietnam War.

His final year of active naval duty was as Materiel Officer for Destroyer Squadron 322 in Norfolk Va. as they prepared for a six-month Mediterranean deployment. Upon completion of his active military service in December 1971 Bob returned to Maine obtained his professional engineer license and began his 45-year career at the Maine Department of Transportation where he had been employed summers while in college.

He worked out of the Ellsworth Division Office for several years on survey crews and highway construction projects. Bob was transferred in 1974 to the Maine DOT Bureau of Planning in Augusta and now faced adapting to an office environment. Bob moved on to Maine DOT’s Bureau of Project Development in 1977. There he took on scheduling development of highway and bridge improvement projects management of Federal transportation funds and administration of various municipal and public aspects of project development. During the next two and a half decades he was an active participant in the Bureau’s automation and its transformation from top-down executive control of project development into a team oriented program management organization that held multi-disciplinary project teams responsible for project delivery.

The pencil paper files and typewriters of 1977 were slowly replaced by personal computers at every workstation. Program and project finances were now managed by state-of-the-art automated systems. Bob witnessed and participated in Maine DOT’s evolution from the survey-design-dig-pave “Interstate Era” into a more environmentally responsive customer conscious user friendly public entity.

Bob retired from Maine DOT in December 2013 and in retirement enjoyed space and freedom on his old farm in Wayne. His life turned a corner in 1982 with his marriage to the love of his life Cynthia (Burrill). A daughter Baylee Jeanne was born in 1988 and a son Richard Maurice joined them in 1991. Baylee and Rick each grew strong here found love and were married following college. When Cyndi retired in 2017 more time was spent at their home in Florida during cold months.

Bob’s happiest days were spent with his family but the open space endless challenges and solitude he found on the farm kept him grounded and eternally grateful for his good fortune here on earth; especially all those times of peace he found “In The Garden”.

Bob is survived by his wife Cynthia of Wayne who crossed his path all those many years ago and proved that faith hope and love endure… the greatest of these being love; their children Baylee Jeanne Bachelder and her husband Bradford Bachelder of Wayne and Richard Maurice Phillips and his wife Sara (Webber) Phillips of Surry; grandchildren Eleanor Cynthia Bachelder and Robet Bradford Bachelder of Wayne and Maverick Maurice Phillips of Surry; his son Daniel Robert Phillips and his wife Wanita of Benton; his sister Nancy (Phillips) Stubbs and her husband William Stubbs of Bucksport; two nephews Mark Stubbs and his wife Tricia of Auburn and Robert Stubbs and his wife Melissa of Bucksport; and a number of cousins.

The international money laundering ring operated by exploiting the flight crew’s “trusted positions” and airport security privileges according to a complaint filed by the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.

US officials said the investigation had “exposed critical vulnerabilities in the airline security industry” and shone a light on the methods employed by drug traffickers.

Charlie Hernandez 42 Sarah Valerio Pujols 42 Emmanuel Torres 34 and Jarol Fabio 35 were arrested by agents from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in New York on Tuesday.

They are accused of taking a cut of each shipment they smuggled through airport security checkpoints and onto flights bound for the Dominican Republic.

Prosecutors said the flight attendants who worked on different international airlines that flew between the two destinations smuggled approximately $8m in cash from the sale of drugs such as fentanyl over several years.

Code word ‘lotions’

They allegedly used the code word “lotions” to mean drug proceeds and referred to the smuggling ring’s drug-dealing clients as “los tigres”.

The flight crew all had a special clearance with the US Transport Security Administration which permitted them to go through a designated security lane at John F Kennedy International Airport with less scrutiny than normal passengers.

All four flight attendants have been charged with one count each relating to unlicensed money transmission which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

They have also been charged with one count each of violating airport security requirements which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

Mr Hernandez of West New York in New Jersey and Ms Pujols from the Bronx in New York were additionally charged with a conspiracy count which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

The oil industry got clobbered in 2020 and continues to face volatility amid the coronavirus crisis. However oil investors are hopeful as countries begin to vaccinate their populations and industries restart their operations. Recently the International Energy Agency said in a report that it expects oil demand to hit 100.6 million barrels for the first time since late 2019 in the last quarter of 2022. However the agency noted that the slow pace of vaccinations in Asia could dent the expected recovery.

Nonetheless analysts believe that oil companies have seen the rock bottom and are set to gain in the coming months. Despite the global push towards renewable energy and price fluctuations the oil industry is expected to thrive for years to come with major oil companies like Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) Chevron (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) expecting huge profits.

The country’s share of overseas travelers fell from 13.7% in 2015 to 11.7% in 2018 as potential visitors chose other destinations and a US Travel Association forecast expects a further decline to 10.4% by 2023. In 2016 international visitors actually decreased about 2% from 2015.

There’s no one reason for the decline and some is due to the rise of other countries as appealing destinations and strength of the U.S. dollar. Some however is attributable to the policies and rhetoric of former US president Donald Trump like the “travel ban” on certain Muslim-majority countries and a perceived hostility toward foreigners. But some travel executives warn that the visibility of mass shootings hate crimes and racism could also tarnish the US’s image with potential visitors.

While US president Joe Biden has arguably improved the US image abroad and made a point to undo controversial policies some travel executives are urging the industry not to assume a change in the White House is a panacea. Considering a full recovery of international visits will likely take years the stakes are high.

“I think we’ve got lots of work to do to restore the appeal of the United States as a global travel destination” Marriott International CEO Anthony Capuano told MSNBC’s Ali Velshi during a recent interview at the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing’s annual conference. The hotel chain posted a $267 million annual loss in 2020—its first since 2009.

Foreign travelers are still eager to visit

Despite the image problems in recent years airlines hotels and destinations still say they’re expecting to see pent-up demand from international visitors as soon as borders open.

The vaccine rollouts on US soil have stimulated domestic travel but international flights have still been largely suspended while immigration health and aviation officials work to reopen cross-border flights.

Travel companies are sending a clear message to the US government: Come up with a plan to reopen international travel safely and fast.

The urgency makes sense. The US earns more money than any country from international tourists who spend an average of $4200 on each overseas visit. But even with half of US adults vaccinated and back to maskless mingling this summer most international travelers are still waiting for the green light to visit.

Under a best-case scenario inbound international travel to the US is expected to recover in 2024 according to the most recent data from Tourism Economics a research company.

The US welcomed 79.4 million international visitors in 2019 based on statistics from the US Department of Commerce’s National Travel and Tourism Office—a slight drop from 2018 but higher than about 77.2 million people in 2017. But in 2020 the US counted only about 19.4 million visits from abroad.

The US was the world’s third-most popular tourist destination in 2018 behind France and Spain according to the World Tourism Organization. The top markets for international visitors to the US are Canada Mexico and the UK.

The lost travelers translated into a huge financial hit for the tourism industry. According to a May 11 letter from the US Travel Association to Biden the country has lost $150 billion in export income last year. And 2020 was the worst year on record for US hotels with only 44% occupancy according to data from Smith Travel Research (STR) which tracks hotel supply and demand statistics.

But international traffic should open up soon from select countries provided that issues like COVID-19 variants don’t derail those plans.

The European Union recently announced it would lift quarantine rules for vaccinated travelers and allow people to travel in the region using digital “passports” and the US and UK are setting up a task force to look at restarting air travel between the two countries but have not announced a date when it might resume.

A more welcoming climate for tourists

Biden has already taken steps to invigorate US tourism by revoking Trump’s policies. In January he ended the travel ban originally directed at citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries calling it “a stain on our national conscience.”

Destinations within the US are also trying to signal that the climate for tourists is different.

New York City which welcomed 13.5 million international visitors in 2019 turned up the volume on its messaging about being a welcoming place during the Trump years.

“There’s no doubt about this that some of the policies that were put in place by the Trump administration—the protectionist policies—created a lot of challenges for us” said Chris Heywood of NYC & Company the city’s official destination marketing organization. He was speaking from Mexico City where the organization was holding its first in-person media event since the pandemic started.

NYC & Company had to activate all of its advertising and marketing resources to reinforce its welcoming spirit said Heywood. “I don’t think we would have had to do that if we had a president that was pro-tourism and pro-welcome.”

And yet despite headlines that the travel industry was suffering from a “Trump Slump” it’s not clear the extent to which the former president affected travel. Several other factors like strong US currency and travel trends in emerging markets likely played a role as well.

“One of the big reasons [was] because the growths are from the Asia-Pacific area where people tend to travel to nearby countries rather than long-haul countries like the US” said Bing Pan an associate professor at Penn State who studies tourism and recreation.

Some markets did show declines in US visitation that appear linked to the former president. Germany which went from being the third-largest US overseas market in 2012 to the sixth in 2018 lost its appetite for US travel in favor of visiting places like Egypt Thailand and the United Arab Emirates according to data from the US Travel Association. In 2017 Bloomberg cited a survey indicating that almost half of Germans who wanted to travel to the US had changed their mind because of Trump.

And when Trump started a trade war with China in 2018 Chinese visitors to the US fell 5.7% that year after a period of steady growth. China had also warned citizens about possible harassment from US officials as well as frequent shootings and robberies in the country.

But concerns about losing potential visitors are not new. The US Travel Association refers to the period between 2000 and 2009 as “the lost decade” estimating the US missed an opportunity to attract 68 million visitors because it didn’t have a marketing strategy as international travel started booming globally. The numbers were compelling enough to convince Congress to pass a new law known as the Travel Promotion Act in 2010 which created the destination marketing organization known as Brand USA. The public-private partnership is partially funded by the application fees tourists pay for visa waivers.

The role of hate crimes and gun violence

Even if Trump’s disparaging comments about immigrants are no longer flooding the airwaves the US still visibly struggles with issues like racism gun violence and hate crimes. While it’s hard to tie any one of those issues to visitor numbers anecdotal evidence shows these factors could discourage tourists.

In a recent study from Temple University nearly half of 214 Asian American and Pacific Islanders across the US said they were concerned about traveling locally domestically and internationally after a surge in hate crimes.

“I think one way to view this is that some of the domestic social issues that the US is having will have a ripple effect on international travel to the US” said Robert Li director of Temple University’s US-Asia Center for Tourism and Hospitality Research.

Tourism officials in regions with unwelcoming politics are also worried about the impact on international travel. Nashville calculates that international travelers make up 5-7% of its overnight visitors in a typical year. Though the city is known for being more progressive than other parts of Tennessee anti-LGBT bills have made their way through the state legislature.

Butch Spyridon CEO of the Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp. said he hasn’t seen factors like mass shootings police violence or discriminatory state laws dramatically affect the US tourism industry’s bottom line yet but that they “certainly could.”

“All of those [issues] combined make the international traveler question ‘Is the US safe?’ He said. “I think so far they mostly conclude [that] yes we are still a welcoming safe country. But the more issues come up and the more often eventually if we ignore it it will have an impact on us.”

Yet for some visitors the most unwelcoming vibes come from security and immigration procedures at the airport.

“You feel like they look at you like a criminal” said Jana Isaza from the Dutch Caribbean island of Bonaire. She said she’d pay more for a flight connection that doesn’t transit through the US because the security procedures are so uncomfortable.

Peter Cain a traveler from Australia who loves visiting the US for its natural diversity national parks and friendly people agreed that the immigration and security procedures can be intimidating.

“I love going [to the US]—absolutely love it” he said. “But the immigration people scare the crap out of me.”

Looking for solutions

The public has put the world’s biggest companies under a microscope to prove they’re making good on their commitments to diversity equity and inclusion and the tourism industry is no exception.

Marriott’s Capuano said groups are increasingly digging into what kind of action the hotel chain has taken on issues like sustainability gender and race equality before booking meetings there. Tourism organizations like NYC & Company and Destination D.C. are adding more content to their websites to showcase their cities’ multicultural attractions and commitment to diversity.

“We’re proud that Washington D.C. is known as a destination for people to peacefully express their First Amendment rights” Destination D.C. president Elliott Ferguson said in an emailed statement.

Another tactic to attract more people to the US is making it easier to enter. One way to do this could be growing the list of 39 countries in the US Visa Waiver Program which allows visitors to enter the country for 90 days after filling out a quick $14 application good for multiple trips.

For citizens of other countries getting a tourist visa typically involves paying a bigger fee and making an appointment for an interview with immigration officials well ahead of a trip. Embassy closures due to the pandemic have led to long wait times in cities like Bogotá where the current average wait time for an appointment to secure a visitor visa is 616 days.

Now that even Emirates has launched its premium economy time has come to analyze the differences between these two classes on Alitalia but also on the other major airlines operating in our skies.

Travel classes

In this article:

On medium/long-haul flights you can normally find 3 or 4 travel classes. From first class we go to business then to premium economy and finally to the tourist cabin. Although when we book a ticket the classes seem to multiply as we are offered fares from basic economy or economy light up to first flex.

Approval of the Cards is at the discretion of American Express. The annual free Gold Card and Green Card fees are subject to reaching specific annual spending thresholds.

While in the former it is the cabin the seat and the service that change in the latter each fare brings other little extras benefits: from whether or not you can take a suitcase on board whether or not you can pay for a seat choice (e.g. Qatar's business comfort excludes seat choice or lounge access) to the chauffeur service that Emirates has decided to eliminate from the ""light"" first class fare.

Premium vs. Economy

First the thing to understand is that each airline has renamed the cabin with its own name. For example for Alitalia economy is called ""Classic"" while premium is called ""Classic +"" and so on.

British Airways offers World traveller plus Aeroflot simply calls it comfort for Delta it is Premium Select and so on.

The big difference is having a few more inches for legs and a larger more reclining seat than in economy class.

At the level of menu offerings and wine choices there is hardly a big difference between economy fare and premium class. Of course that was before Emirates came along and redefined the concept of premium economy.

The best and worst premium economy at the moment

If you want to opt for these seats it is always best to take a tour of Seatguru to find out what the company offers and the differences between the various planes.

When ranking there are many aspects to consider:

Cabin layout and type of chair

Ground and on-board service

Benefits for frequent flyers

Ticket cost

If one is looking for a middle ground between a business and economy class seat I think Delta's comfort+ cabin deserves special mention. In fact the seat is the same as in economy the passenger is offered only a few more inches of space and little else.

It is not much better with British Airways which maintains the 2-4-2 configuration and offers little more to its premium economy passengers.

In contrast Air France offers a more comfortable seat but still a poor product in terms of service on board its fleet.

The last image however shows the brand new premium economy inserted for the past few months on Emirates' latest A380s. A product that in many other companies might be considered Business and is set to redefine the standard for this cabin.

La best seat ever remains the one offered by Singapore Airlines aboard its A350ULRs those used to connect the city-state with New York currently the World's longest commercial flight.

When is it worth buying a PE ticket?

Certainly when the economy fare and premium fare are very similar or when it is even lower it does not happen so rarely with Alitalia. Let's analyze the example. Right now a ticket to Brazil costs just under €600.Among the benefits Alitalia offers in this fare is lounge access priority boarding. There is no refund of the ticket which is instead included in the economy flex which however costs twice as much.

It must be said that lounge access is a plus offered by Alitalia as almost no other airline includes this benefit in the PE ticket.

In addition it should be remembered that Alitalia's PE fare guarantees an attractive mileage gain which is not the case with basic fares.

Here it might seem advantageous as a ticket but just take a look at the business class fare on the same flight to have doubts about which ticket to detach.

The difference between PE and Business is about 300€. It is obvious that traveling in a seat that becomes a real bed having a high quality service in terms of menu and wine list challenges the seat choice. Not to mention that in business you would earn more qualifying miles and bonus miles compared to all other classes.

One of the other reasons why one might opt for PE is to find A possible upgrade in business or auction if the company offers this service or with miles. In the latter case however attention must be paid to the fare rules.

As mentioned at the beginning of this article cabin classes are one thing and ticket classes are another. Depending on the class of our ticket we will or will not have the opportunity to request and obtain an upgrade.",,,,,,

As the Welsh players posed for their team photo it was hard not to notice the bizarre formation they took up. With five players stood at the back and six squatting down in front but some way to the left of those standing a lot of people poked fun at their lack of organisation.

But a quick look back at Euro 2016 shows that they did the same thing then and oddly it's nowhere near the strangest photo formation they've had.

In a game against Moldova in 2017 they lined up with six at the back and five in front but left a space between Hal Robson Kanu and Aaron Ramsey that could have seen another person fit into it.

That same year against Serbia they had seven stood and four squatting in front but Jazz Richards stared at Ben Davies rather than the camera.

They've lined up with four standing behind seven but most ridiculously with three standing behind eight squatting players but it's not happening accidentally.

""At first we didn't look into it but then gradually a few photos got together and it was awful so we just thought we may as well keep it the same"" Joe Ledley said to Wales Online in 2017 about the trend.

""It's been lucky for us too. It's not really superstitious but I don't think we will have a proper photo.

""We don't practice. We just talk within the group and we decide what we're going to do.""

Poorly organised team photos go back quite a way with Wales with an article on RTE even digging out a similarly messy photo from before a 2-1 win against Italy in 2002.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9saXZlLW5ld3MvMjAyMTA2MTItZGVubWFyay1zLWNocmlzdGlhbi1lcmlrc2VuLWNvbGxhcHNlcy1kdXJpbmctZXVyby0yMDIxLW1hdGNoLXJlY2VpdmVzLWNwctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Denmark's Christian Eriksen in stable condition after collapse during match,"EURO 2021

Denmark midfielder Christian Eriksen was taken to a hospital Saturday after collapsing on the field during a match at the European Championship leading to the game being suspended for more than 90 minutes.

Denmark's players gather as paramedics attend to midfielder Christian Eriksen (not seen) during the Euro 2021 Group B football match between Denmark and Finland at the Parken Stadium in Copenhagen on June 12 2021.

The governing body of European soccer said Eriksen has been stabilized and the Danish soccer federation said he was awake.

“Christian Eriksen is awake and is undergoing further examinations at Rigshospitalet” the Danish federation wrote on Twitter.

Danish soccer federation director Peter Moeller said Eriksen got a “heart massage” while being treated on the field.

“He fell over and got help and heart massage on the field"" Moeller told Danish public broadcaster DR. ""He was fortunately awake when he left stadium.”

The Euro 2020 match between Denmark and Finland had been halted in the 43rd minute with the score 0-0. It resumed at 8:30 p.m. local time and Finland eventually won 1-0.

UEFA said both teams had held an emergency meeting before deciding to continue playing. The players came back out onto the field to a huge ovation as they started warming up for a second time.

Mathias Jensen replaced Eriksen in the Denmark lineup. Only a few minutes were played before a shorter-than-normal halftime break.

Eriksen was given urgent medical attention on the field for about 10 minute after collapsing near the end of the first half. He was then carried off on a stretcher. UEFA then announced the game had been suspended “due to a medical emergency.”

Eriksen had just played a short pass when he fell face-forward onto the ground. His teammates immediately gestured for help and medics rushed onto the field. Eriksen was given chest compressions as his Denmark teammates stood around him in a shielding wall for privacy.

Eriksen’s partner Sabrina Kvist Jensen went onto the field and was comforted by Denmark captain Simon Kjaer and goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.

The Finland players huddled by their bench and eventually walked off the field while the Inter Milan midfielder was still getting treatment as did the referees.

Eriksen was eventually carried off to a loud ovation with his teammates walking next to the stretcher.

Inter Milan team physician Piero Volpi told The Associated Press that the Italian club was in contact with the Danish soccer federation.

“We’re in contact with the Danish federation the team manager the team physician. But we still don’t know anything yet” Volpi said. “We heard what UEFA said and we’re all happy that he’s been stabilized. But that’s all we know.”

Volpi added that Eriksen never contracted COVID-19 has no medical conditions that he’s aware of and has passed every medical exam without problem since joining Inter in January 2020 from Tottenham.

“But we’ll talk about that when the time is right” Volpi added of Eriksen’s medical history. “Right now the important thing is that he recovers.”

Eriksen is one of Denmark’s biggest stars and the incident brought an instant sense of shock to the Parken Stadium where about 15000 fans fell into hushed silence. Some supporters could be seen crying and hugging in the stands.

As the fans in the stadium were waiting for updates Finland supporters started chanting “Christian” which was then answered by the Danish fans shouting “Eriksen.”

A huge roar then went up from all supporters when the stadium announcer said Eriksen was “stable and awake.”

The incident brought back memories of other soccer players who have collapsed on the field including Fabrice Muamba who needed CPR in 2012 when he collapsed in a match between Bolton and Tottenham at White Hart Lane.

Muamba who fully recovered tweeted ”Please God” as Eriksen was taken to the hospital.

Joel Pohjanpalo scored the only goal of the game as Finland edged out Denmark in their Euro 2020 Group B opener but the match was overshadowed by the awful moment Christian Eriksen collapsed and had to be taken to hospital.

Eriksen left the pitch conscious and in a stable condition but his sudden collapse just before half-time with no one around him shocked everyone inside Parken Stadium in Copenhagen.

Immediately the players and match officials knew something was terribly wrong and called for medical assistance. The Danish players formed a wall around Eriksen as the medical professionals worked to resuscitate him.

Pictures showed that Eriksen was conscious as he was taken off the field which was the first moment everyone was able to breathe a sigh of relief.

He has now been transferred to a local hospital in Copenhagen and is reported to be stable in hospital after the terrifying scenes.

UEFA decided that there would be a crisis meeting between the two teams and match officials to decide the next steps then announced that the match would be restarted.

Upon the restart in what was an understandably subdued atmosphere the tempo of the match was very slow indeed.

It was Finland who conjured up the only goal of the game as Pohjanpalo pounced though Kasper Schmeichel should certainly have done better with the effort which came more or less straight at him.

Denmark could not find a way through for the remainder of a match that will be remembered only for the shocking collapse suffered by Eriksen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL25ld3MtYW5kLXBvbGl0aWNzLzIwMjEvMDYvZGFuaXNoLXNvY2Nlci1jaHJpc3RpYW4tZXJpa3Nlbi1jb2xsYXBzZXMtZmllbGQtbWF0Y2guaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Danish soccer star Christian Eriksen stabilized after collapsing on field during match.,"Danish soccer star Christian Eriksen collapsed all of a sudden during the first half of the Euro 2020 match against Finland that was being played in Copenhagen. Eriksen 29 was walking near the sideline when it suddenly looked like he tripped and then fell forward to the pitch. For a split second other players continued the game until they realized what had happened and teammates frantically called for assistance. The game was stopped in the 43rd minute when the score was still 0-0.

Medical staff rushed to the pitch and the stadium fell silent as soon as it became clear the situation was serious. Medics appeared to try to resuscitate Eriksen with CPR and some reports say a defibrillator was used. His teammates looked visibly upset with some shedding tears as they formed a wall around their teammate to try to protect him from view.

After several minutes Eriksen who is a midfielder for Italian team Inter Milan was taken off the field on a stretcher and he received a huge ovation from the crowd at the stadium. He was taken to the hospital where he was “awake” according to a tweet by the Danish soccer federation. The Union of European Football Associations said Eriksen “has been transferred to the hospital and has been stabilized.” Fans in the stands kept chanting Eriksen’s name after the players left the field.

The event immediately brought to mind what happened in 2012 when Fabrice Muamba collapsed in the middle of a game. He was said to be “effectively dead” for 78 minutes before he was revived. Although he recovered he never resumed his professional career. “Please God” he tweeted shortly after Eriksen’s collapse.

But De Boer says “it is a bit too early. We don’t want to take any risks. We have two more group matches.”

He did not say who would replace the Juventus defender in the starting lineup for the team’s Euro 2020 opener. The Netherlands already is missing center back and captain Virgil van Dijk with a long-term knee injury.

While the extent of McCormick’s ties to his “home state” are cloudy his ties to another state—the “deep state”—seem far more clear.

Despite his claims to the MAGA movement McCormick is steeped in the nexus of government intelligence and big business that Donald Trump and his acolytes ambiguously refer to as “the deep state.”

Those connections range from colleagues to boards to corporate investments with additional ties to notorious surveillance systems and an internal monitoring project at McCormick’s firm—the legendary hedge fund Bridgewater Associates—that was directly modeled after the Chinese Communist Party’s autocratic surveillance state.

And in the mind of Trump who is McCormick’s most crucial political ally some of those ties would be about as problematic as a MAGA Republican can get—such as for instance former FBI Director James Comey.

Comey it turns out accepted a senior role at Bridgewater the year after McCormick signed on as the fund’s president. As general counsel Comey oversaw an internal security program whose invasive and sometimes demeaning methods of surveillance and interrogation earned him a reputation as Bridgewater’s “in-house inquisitor.”

Aside from Comey the most prominent of McCormick’s “deep state” affiliations is his recent three-year run as a paid trustee of the secretive government-backed investment group In-Q-Tel—quite literally the Central Intelligence Agency’s very own venture capital firm.

McCormick’s role at In-Q-Tel appears on his candidate financial disclosures where he listed the entity’s name as “IQT.” Tax filings from In-Q-Tel which is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit show that McCormick joined as a trustee in March 2018 and left in 2022 as he pursued his first Senate campaign. He collected an annual $35000 salary logging five hours of work a week according to the tax records and his election bid has since seen hundreds of thousands of dollars in support from executives tied to IQT and its investments.

For McCormick his deep state connections embody the larger political contradictions he’s already been forced to reconcile as a corporate Republican seeking office in the quasi-populist era of Trump.

That tortured balancing act failed two years ago. In the 2022 GOP primary in Pennsylvania the lifelong moderate failed to land Trump’s endorsement—losing that honor and subsequently the GOP primary to Mehmet Oz.

While McCormick got the coveted Trump endorsement this year—though there weren’t any other viable Republicans running in the primary—the dissonance is starker than ever.

Today the MAGA wing of the Republican Party finds itself fully enthralled with conspiracy theories about the intelligence community which Trump and his allies have for years cast as public enemy No. 1. Trump is vowing retribution as a key 2024 campaign plank.

Given that McCormick’s challenge to Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) will be one of the most contentious races of the 2024 cycle the hedge funder turned true MAGA believer may have to work harder than expected to scrub his deep establishment ties in order to appeal to his new base.

A former colleague of McCormick’s at Bridgewater told The Daily Beast that McCormick was “an honorable man” a “stand-up guy” and an “independent” and “brilliant leader.” But the colleague also put his finger on the Trump issue calling it a “sad reality” that McCormick will have to cave to the whims of the former president.

“He knows that if he wins he won’t get to do what he thinks is right” the person said. “He has his own money and he won’t be so susceptible to outside pressures financially. But he’s still going to have to kiss the ring and that’s unfortunate.”

McCormick’s campaign did not respond to detailed questions for this article.

It’s not clear if Trump knew about McCormick’s work with the U.S. intelligence community including the CIA and Comey. But as it turns out the deep state overlaps in myriad ways with McCormick’s 13-year tenure as a top executive at Bridgewater.

In 2010—the year after McCormick left George W. Bush’s Treasury Department to sign on as Bridgewater’s president—Bridgewater hired Comey who would later come to embody the darkest of Trump’s paranoiac accusations about federal agents.

Bridgewater brought Comey on officially as head of security and general counsel. In practice however Comey’s role more closely resembled that of an “in-house inquisitor” over the first iteration of the firm’s oppressive internal employee monitoring program which would later come to be called “The Politburo.”

Before he led the FBI unleashed a bombshell on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign and got fired by Trump Comey reportedly raked in $7 million per year at Bridgewater. His task was to keep employees in line with the goals of what firm founder Ray Dalio called “radical transparency.” Those efforts included constant surveillance—including recorded meetings and videotaped internal “trials” of employees—with Dalio telling Bridgewater staff that Comey was “like a godfather adjudicating it all.”

The taped meetings were “just the tip of the surveillance ecosystem” at Bridgewater Vanity Fair reported in its profile of Comey’s time with the firm.

“A slew of ex FBI agents staffed the security team. Not only did cameras cover seemingly every inch of the property but they seemed to be watched in real time. Staffers who left their desks even briefly would return to sticky notes left on their computer monitors admonishing them for failing to put up a screen saver” Vanity Fair reported.

Comey would go through employee cellphone and computer records and was apparently so intrusive that he embarrassed one executive into resigning.

But when Comey’s security posse only turned up “little evidence of actual offending behavior to snuff out they created their own” according to Vanity Fair.

In one instance the report said Comey left an executive’s binder clearly labeled and unattended in Bridgewater offices. He then watched as surveillance cameras captured a low-ranking employee discovering the binder and going through it. Comey put the employee on trial and fired him with the approval of Dalio.

Comey however eventually found himself repelled by Dalio’s extremes resigning after two years. (This month Comey happens to be publishing a murder mystery novel that takes place inside a fictionalized version of Bridgewater.)

Dalio however only ramped things up implementing more and more intrusive policies to fully enact his “radical transparency” dogma.

That program it turns out was literally modeled on the Chinese Communist Party’s social surveillance program which Dalio openly admired. He even named the project after the CCP’s own “Politburo” and compared it favorably to “Big Brother” in a 60 Minutes interview.

China of course is another area where McCormick is against the prevailing GOP winds as Bridgewater’s internal culture “reflects aspects of Chinese political ideology” and invested heavily in the region—after McCormick took over as co-CEO in 2017 the fund’s Chinese investments skyrocketed.

The “Politburo” staffed up with officials from the National Security Agency and the CIA. But Bridgewater workers found it “intimidating” and “humiliating” and so intrusive that in 2017 one whistleblower filed a human rights complaint with the state of Connecticut where the fund is headquartered which was covered at the time in The New York Times.

As detailed in a recent book about Dalio titled The Fund the Politburo essentially pitted its employees against each other assigning roles like “auditors” and “overseers” and recording practically every moment of activity—all in pursuit of Dalio’s core “radical transparency” philosophy.

While the system repelled many employees—including Comey and one-time CEO Jon Rubinstein who both left after disagreements with Dalio—McCormick stayed aboard got a promotion and publicly defended Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Rubinstein quit after a “firing squad” meeting that McCormick personally sat in on according to the book where Rubinstein made the case that Dalio’s increasingly authoritarian policies were creating a “climate of fear.” When McCormick one of a handful of senior executives in the room was personally asked if he agreed with Rubinstein’s take he said he did not according to the book.

McCormick has subsequently defended Dalio. In 2020 when McCormick was asked if he took issue with a fundamental contradiction at the core of the monitoring program—“radical transparency” within the company but kept secret from outside scrutiny—he replied that he “doesn’t think it’s inconsistent at all.”

“Ray has always said this: Radical transparency is not total transparency. There are certain things that we’re not transparent about and consciously so. Personnel and salary discussions for example” McCormick said.

Shortly after rising to co-CEO McCormick joined the board at IQT.

The venture capital nonprofit which former CIA Director George Tenet founded in 1999 has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to hundreds of technology firms and startups some of which are still secret.

Today IQT oversees more than $1 billion in assets and even has its own special-purpose acquisition company. Though the group keeps a low profile IQT maintains a close relationship with government intelligence and security divisions and runs “almost all investment decisions” by the CIA.

Many IQT investments seek to cultivate the private development of surveillance technology that could one day benefit the intelligence community and some of them overlap with both Bridgewater and McCormick.

One of those companies is Palantir a tech firm closely tied to right-wing financier Peter Thiel whose sprawling government work has made it a lightning rod for civil rights controversy—and whose fate was “rescued” by IQT’s investment.

Bridgewater itself helped fund Palantir and incorporated Palantir technology to advance its own investments as well as to help monitor Bridgewater employees in the fund’s pursuit of Dalio’s “radical transparency.”

Palantir executives have contributed thousands of dollars to McCormick’s 2024 campaign.

Additionally one of IQT’s current trustees Howard Fox who also served on the board with McCormick has put serious money—more than $150000—behind McCormick’s candidacy in both 2022 and this cycle.

The same is true of other McCormick supporters like the CEO of Tenable an IQT-backed tech firm which announced its public stock offering shortly after McCormick joined the board.

And while it’s true that McCormick brings his own money to the table that hasn’t stopped Bridgewater donors from chipping in. In all Bridgewater employees mostly executives have contributed about $100000 to McCormick’s political aspirations with current president Kyle Delaney throwing $50000 to a 2022 super PAC backing his old colleague.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,"A super PAC supporting Republican David McCormick's Senate run in Pennsylvania is launching a $4 million TV ad buy today its first in one of the most-watched contests of the 2024 campaign.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8va2V5c3RvbmVuZXdzcm9vbS5jb20vc3RvcnkvZGF2ZS1tY2Nvcm1pY2stcHJvZml0ZWQtZnJvbS0yMDA4LWNvbGxhcHNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Dave McCormick profited off the 2008 financial collapse,"US Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs David McCormick speaks during a press conference as part of the G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors' Meeting in Sao Paulo Brazil on November 9 2008. (NELSON ALMEIDA/AFP via Getty Images)

Dave McCormick forged a relationship with Ray Dalio the founder of Bridgewater Associates in early 2008 and was rewarded with a job at Bridgewater after Dalio made $780 million on the financial collapse.

Much like his upbringing Dave McCormick the Republican challenger for US Senate in Pennsylvania can attribute his wealth and his career as the president and CEO of the world’s largest hedge fund to being in the right place at the right time.

McCormick served as the president of Bridgewater Associates the world’s largest hedge fund from 2009 when working Pennsylvanians were reeling from the financial collapse to 2020 and served as its CEO from 2020 to 2022.

A recent book titled “The Fund” by Rob Copeland is a biography that focuses on Ray Dalio’s rise as the founder of Bridgewater Associates.

It also shines a spotlight on how McCormick got rich thanks to the proverbial revolving door and his friendship with Dalio while he was serving as the Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs in 2008.

“When you look at something like the recession where millions and millions of people lost their pensions or were severely hurt millions lost their jobs and to hear that someone benefited during that time it’s heartbreaking” Darrin Kelly President of the Allegheny/Fayette County Labor Council said in in an interview.

McCormick began working under former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in 2007 and went to Bridgewater Associates in 2009.

During this time Copeland explained in his book that McCormick met with Dalio multiple times in early 2008 when Dalio predicted an impending financial crisis and at these meetings Dalio was encouraging McCormick and other officials from former President George W. Bush’s administration and the Treasury to print money in order to stave off a financial crisis.

Once the great recession started the federal government would heed Dalio’s advice and print trillions of dollars throughout the end of 2008.

According to Copeland Dalio was betting against the dollar by investing in gold treasury bonds and commodities as the government was pumping trillions of dollars into the struggling economy in the fall of 2008.

“While Bridgewater’s automated trading systems were positioned relatively conservatively in 2007 and 2008 Dalio himself ordered a number of manual adjustments so the fund would profit more heavily from an overall decline investment staffers there then recall. Throughout this period he had placed a series of bets that would pay off if central bankers printed money to revive the economy—the exact move he had predicted” Copeland wrote in the book.

Dalio made $780 million dollars in 2008 as Bridgewater Associates’ Alpha fund saw a 9% increase. Other hedge funds were witnessing 20% losses during that time.

Dalio then rewarded McCormick by hiring him as Bridgewater Associates’ president in 2009. McCormick would then go on to earn $21 million in 2021 as the hedge fund’s CEO.

To put things into perspective over 191000 Pennsylvanians lost their jobs in 2008 and 2009 and the state’s unemployment rate peaked at 9.3% in October 2010. Home foreclosures in the state skyrocketed by 173% during that time and over 44000 properties were foreclosed on in 2009.

All of this happened while McCormick began working at Bridgewater Associates.

“You look at it right now there are still pension funds that have not gotten fully back. There are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of union members whose pensions were literally wiped out or were taken to the point where they’re still not back. People are still struggling from that day” Kelly said.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in 2022 that McCormick and his wife Dina Powell a Goldman Sachs executive are worth between $116 million to $290 million and possibly more.

McCormick lived in Connecticut while working for Bridgewater and the Associated Press reported that he rents a $16 million mansion on Connecticut’s “Gold Coast” one of the densest concentrations of wealth in the country. The mansion includes a 1500-bottle wine cellar an elevator and a private beachfront resort overlooking the Long Island Sound.

McCormick’s wealth and lavish lifestyle are already focal points in his upcoming campaign against US Sen. Bob Casey.

Casey is campaigning on a progressive economic platform that includes supporting unions going after junk fees and going after corporations for price gouging during and after the pandemic.

Casey is also using his opponents out of state residence and wealth whenever he gets a chance to on the campaign trail.

“He doesn’t live in Pennsylvania. He lied about living in Pennsylvania. We know that and he continues to try to make that case that he’s living here” Casey said to supporters in Lancaster last month.

“So here’s a candidate who’s an out-of-state candidate being supported by out of state billionaires. We don’t want a senator like that.”"

DOJ to prioritize ransomware on same level as terrorism

McDonald's has become the latest company to be hit by a data breach after unauthorized activity on its network exposed the personal data of some customers in South Korea and Taiwan.

The fast-food giant said Friday that it quickly identified and contained the incident and that a thorough investigation was done.

""While we were able to close off access quickly after identification our investigation has determined that a small number of files were accessed some of which contained personal data"" the burger chain said.

McDonald's said its investigation determined that only South Korea and Taiwan had customer personal data accessed and that they would be taking steps to notify regulators and also the customers who may be impacted. No customer payment information was exposed.

McDonald's said it will look at the investigation's findings coupled with input from security resources to identify ways to further enhance its existing security measures.

Businesses across various sectors are being targeted by cybercriminals including some very high profile cases in recent weeks. On Wednesday JBS the world's largest meat processing company revealed that it had paid the equivalent of $11 million to hackers who broke into its computer system last month.

The company ultimately paid the ransom in Bitcoin cryptocurrency to prevent further disruptions of the meat plants mitigating potential damage to the food supply — including restaurants grocery stores and farmers that rely on JBS production.

And Colonial Pipeline which transports about half of the fuel consumed on the East Coast last month paid a ransom of 75 bitcoin — then valued at roughly $4.4 million — in hopes of getting its system back online. On Monday the Justice Department announced that it had recovered most of the ransom payment.

National security threat

The recent ransomware attacks highlight the vulnerability of the country's energy infrastructure to hackers. It also shines light on an emerging ransomware business trend in the depths of the dark web where criminal gangs brazenly sell their expertise in computerized mayhem to the highest bidder.

U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday cautioned that ransomware attacks are ""getting worse and worse"" echoing concerns of White House officials who have orchestrated emergency meetings to brainstorm responses to the national security threat.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday told reporters aboard Air Force One that President Biden would ""100%"" bring up cyberattacks in his upcoming meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Mr. Biden is scheduled to speak with Putin on June 16 in Geneva Switzerland as part of his first overseas trip as president.

The owner of several McDonald's locations recently reopened the restaurant at 26990 Grand River in Redford Township after spending several months remodeling the establishment.

Gone is the red roof and the PlayPlace replaced with the more modern-looking building and an outdoor patio. The work began earlier this spring and took about two months.

Renovations Campbell said can be more complicated than just building on a vacant lot.

""I kind of like how this one turned out from where it was"" Campbell said. ""It's easy to make something new from the ground up.""

Campbell owns several McDonald's locations including others in Redford Farmington Hills Dearborn and Garden City which was recently remodeled and rebuilt at the corner of Ford and Middlebelt roads.

The new space features plenty of the new features McDonald's is introducing across the region including kiosks for ordering and table service though that will have to come at a future date: Campbell said the restaurant is still just drive-thru and carryout only due to a lack of employees. He said he hopes to open in the dining room in the coming weeks.

Removing the PlayPlace and replacing it with outdoor dining space was a move Campbell said that seemed to make sense from a service perspective.

""We had this big open space and made it ... so we could go out and service it better"" he said. ""A lot of people like the patio.""

The response from customers since they reopened has been trending upward Campbell said.

""We've been gaining a little more traction so we've got some positive feedback from customers a lot of people like it"" he said.

The restaurant which is open 24 hours marked its reopening by hosting the Redford Chamber of Commerce breakfast event June 8 bringing members of the township's community in to see the new look.

Seeing the renovations made to the property shows a renewed sense of commitment to Redford said Pat McRae the township supervisor. Having an example like the renovated restaurant shows others the type of community Redford is and that can help draw in more improvements and businesses alike.

""I think it's essential. By people like Jon investing in the community with his business it encourages other businesses to come because they see that he's willing to invest in what he has"" McRae said. ""By businesses all in the township that are reinvesting and upgrading and doing the things they need to do it helps create and bring in more business.""

Campbell said he won't be resting from completing the Redford restaurant's construction for long: he said he's expecting to begin renovations at another one of his restaurants — located on the corner of Beck and Pontiac Trail in Commerce Township near Walled Lake Western High School — soon.

The restaurant is currently closed after a fire but Campbell said they hope to begin work later this summer on that space as well.

""Once we get through the fire insurance we're going to start construction"" he said. ""We'll probably be starting that one in two months.""

The right fruit juice can deliver awesome health benefits so we're not anti-juice overall. But ordering McDonald's orange juice with a combo meal—or a regular soda for that matter—will pour on more calories plus more sugar than a coffee will.

One Major Side Effect of Drinking Coffee From a To-Go Cup According to Experts

Another McDonald's breakfast rule of thumb.

It might go without saying but opting for no meat in your McDonald's breakfast will help keep the calories (plus fat sodium and others) down.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

But if you're going to choose meat…

Consider requesting bacon. That's because a single McDonald's sausage patty drives up the calorie count of a breakfast item about 120 calories higher than bacon does. (That's not to say we recommend bacon freely—read Eating Bacon Could Cause This Type of Liver Disease New Study Reveals.)

There's one sausage exception when it comes to McDonald's breakfast.



At 450 calories the Sausage Burrito Meal has the fewest calories of any McDonald's breakfast combo. (The Egg McMuffin Meal has the same.)

15 Unhealthiest Fast-Food Breakfasts To Never Eat According to Dietitians

But the single worst McDonald's breakfast order…

Perhaps not shockingly the #1 worst item on McDonald's breakfast menu is the Big Breakfast with Hotcakes. This is a belly buster—McDonald's describes the Big Breakfast with Hotcakes as ""a warm biscuit savory hot sausage fluffy scrambled eggs crispy hash browns and golden brown hotcakes with a side of real butter and the sweet flavor of maple."" (Notice they don't say ""real maple syrup"" which might tell you that you don't even need to read the syrup package to know there's a lot of fructose in there.)

At 1340 calories this is one of the highest-calorie items on McDonald's entire menu. It even beats out the Double Quarter Pounder Combo Meal's 1270 calories.

Those heavy carbs the saturated fat the fried items: This is not a recipe to feel energized for the day. Unless you're splitting this with a couple other people stay away from McDonald's Big Breakfast with Hotcakes.

The Best Pancakes in Every State

Wiser breakfast choices at McDonald's are…

McDonald's says the Sausage Burrito Fruit & Maple Oatmeal and an Egg McMuffin all have 310 to 320 calories. As an alternative a single order of hash browns has just 140 calories.

It all goes to show that even when it comes to fast-food breakfast knowing what to ask for can be better for your health!

(Reuters) - Merck said on Thursday its therapy being tested in certain patients with a type of cancer in the uterus lining failed a late-stage trial.

The drugmaker's Keytruda therapy in combination with chemotherapy was being evaluated in about 1095 patients with high-risk endometrial cancer after surgery.

The trial did not meet the main goal of disease-free survival which is the length of time after primary treatment for a cancer ends that the patient survives without any signs or its symptoms.

The study's other main goal of overall survival was not formally tested since the trial failed in showing significant disease-free survival.

Endometrial cancer begins in the inner lining of the uterus or endometrium and is the most common type of the disease affecting the organ.

Merck's Keytruda belongs to a class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that work by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to detect and fight tumor cells.

Keytruda is currently approved in the United States for two indications in endometrial cancer one of which is treated using it as a combination therapy with partner Eisai's drug Lenvima.

Endometrial cancer leads to more than 13000 deaths in a year in the U.S. according to government data.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

The digital-only items were part of a limited Gucci collection for Roblox a step by the fashion house that prides itself on Italian craftsmanship to enter an expanding virtual space where many of its youngest admirers already are at home.

Anyone whose virtual alter ego is wandering around the Roblox online game platform these days might run into other avatars sporting Gucci handbags sunglasses or hats.

While the Gucci Garden space on Roblox was open for two weeks in May the platform’s 42 million users could spend from US$1.20 to US$9 on collectable and limited-edition Gucci accessories.

Items were hidden in the virtual Gucci Garden which echoed real-world Gucci Garden exhibitions in Florence and other global cities. Some items were offered for free and the exclusivity was underlined with limited time releases.

The experience allowed Roblox’s core demographic – roughly aged nine to 15 – a digital entrée to the rarefied world of luxury goods that few can dream of in the real world. Now that the space is closed the limited edition items have even greater cachet. According to the developer more than 4.5 million items were “won”.

Many parents may scratch their heads at paying real money to accessorise an avatar but Generation Z players have long been prepped for this evolution.

They ran through physical streets and parks to intercept and capture Pokemon Go characters part of an augmented reality mobile game that launched in 2016. Many took the edge off pandemic lockdown by playing with real-world friends over gaming platforms. On Roblox dressing up avatars is old hat.

“Gen Z they sometimes see virtual products as more valuable than physical products” Christina Wootton the vice-president for brand partnerships at Roblox said. “We are definitely seeing that on Roblox where it is all about storytelling and self-expression. There are so many people who come together and socialise and connect with their friends and they want to represent their digital selves through fashion.”

A look from the Gucci Aria collection in March 2021.

While the Gucci items users bought only can be “worn” on the Roblox platform it is just the tip of the metaverse iceberg.

Similar items made and traded in the metaverse are known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – digital objects backed by blockchain technology certifying their authenticity and uniqueness. NFTs which might be anything from personalised “skins” or costumes for avatars to digital art can be traded ad-infinitum potentially growing in value with each trade. Their ownership is not limited to any single platform.

Even on Roblox which has its own marketplace where items can be traded the Gucci “Dionysus Bag with Bee” was resold for over $4100 worth of Robux – exceeding the price of a real Gucci “Dionysus” bag and a huge premium over the original price of 475 Roblox roughly US$4.75. Only 851 of the bags were available making it the rarest piece in the collection compared with the 2.6 million wide-brim denim hats that were snapped up for free.

Unlike NFTs the astronomically priced “Dionysus” bag cannot be traded outside the Roblox platform making it seemingly a vanity investment for a superfan.

The metaverse’s potential for the fashion world goes well beyond the world of gaming and extends into digital ecosystems that are still under construction. So-called decentralised worlds are seeing a huge influx of money with billions being spent to iron out technical issues.

Boson Protocol a technology company is bridging the gap between the metaverse and physical world with a new venture designed to allow consumers to purchase fashion NFTs for their avatars from a platform Decentraland. NFTs in turn will contain vouchers redeemable for corresponding real-world items. The project announced on June 9 is expected to launch in two months.

“If we increasingly are going to exist in these digital spaces then objects that are scarce unique and ownable of course are going to have value in those spaces” London-based Boson Protocol co-founder Justin Banon said. “All of these things of social signalling in the real world are just in fact perhaps more important in the digital world.”

Looks from the Gucci Aria collection in March 2021.

In another example of how fast this space is moving the IMVU metaverse on June 9 launched a marketplace featuring digital fashion as wearable NFTs for avatars on the social platform. The looks previewed in a recent digital fashion show include a Black Lives Matters patchwork shirt dress I Love NY souvenir hoodie and a pink camouflage bubble jacket each a unique NFT that will be auctioned off over the next 30 days with bids opening at US$100.

It’s only natural that fashion would pave the way for the less digitally savvy consumers who may shy away from bitcoin and balk at multimillion-dollar sales of NFTs that have captured the attention of artists and collectors alike.

“Fashion brands have to go where other people are not going. The whole point of a fashion brand is to stand out” Allen Adamson co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce said.

For Gucci the biggest return on investment from the Roblox tie-up “is to become part of that generation’s world” Adamson said.

“No one shares ordinary” Adamson said. “‘My avatar is wearing a Gucci belt’ is a little different” and perhaps even catchier for a certain audience than spotting a real Gucci bag on the street.

Gucci CEO Marco Bizzarri said that more than generating revenue the Roblox collaboration was a way to tap fresh creative veins and stay apace of an evolving world where fashion music films and technology increasingly mash-up.

“Who knows what the industry will look like in 10 years? We want to start before everyone else to get up to speed” Bizzarri said at the physical Gucci Garden opening in Florence Italy. “Certainly they are not operations that bring a lot of business now but they could be a source of business tomorrow.”

Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele described the metaverse as new “territory” to explore.

“Fashion has become more than a boutique along the street in a capital. I think we are in a phase when maybe the world wants to go beyond the industrialised revolution and doesn’t know how to do it” Michele said. “Especially now in this phase of the pandemic it is a big chance to accelerate changes.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVwcmVzc3VyZS5jb20vcmF0Y2hldC1jbGFuay1yaWZ0LWFwYXJ0L2NsYW5rLXJldHVybi10by1zYXZhbGkvejVlOGYy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart: Clank Return to Savali - puzzle guide list,"Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart: Clank Return to Savali - puzzle guide list Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart guide walkthrough

This page of the guide to Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart explains how to solve all 3 of Clank's puzzles after the return to Savali which is the fourth an final puzzle-related location. You'll learn how to manipulate the spheres in the Savali catacomb puzzles and how to get other Clanks to the meta-terminal.

Puzzle starting location

You can start solving the final 3 puzzles when you return to planet Savali- this will happen after the Nefarious' ships are destroyed during your second visit to Sargasso. When you return to Savali you will need to unlock access to the catacombs and also defeat a boss - Undead Grunthor - while exploring them.

Eventually you will arrive at the location in the picture. If you want to acquire the Dimensional Map you will have to interact with the new anomaly and attempt Clank's puzzles.

First puzzle

Start by doing a double jump over the chasm to land on the shelf with the Electric Sphere.

Immediately throw the electric sphere at the left generator shown in picture 2. This will rotate the whole platform you're standing on by 90 degrees.

Go straight ahead to the place where you have to take the Heavy Sphere (picture 1).

A little further to the left is a second heavy sphere (picture 2) so you should currently have two in your inventory.

Turn 180 degrees where you picked up the second heavy sphere. Throw one of the them into the moving platform slot marked in the picture. This way you will lower it.

Select the first heavy sphere you still have with you from your inventory. Stand in the spot visible in the picture (this will later be a rotating platform) and throw the heavy sphere into the marked slot next to the platform you just left. This way running projections won't be blown away by the running fan.

Stay still and wait for the projections to reach the pressure plate in picture 1.

The platform you are standing on will move. This will allow you to take the electric sphere from picture 2.

There is also a pressure plate on the shelf you took the electric sphere from. Stay on it and wait for the running projections to move the adjacent platform. Ultimately the projections should follow the path shown in the picture.

Remain on the pressure plate. Throw the electric sphere at the slot marked in picture 1. This will allow the projections to travel by the cable and reach the meta-terminal. Teleport once the exit unlocks.

Second puzzle

Go straight ahead and perform a double jump over the spikes to reach the Lift Sphere. You also need to watch how the pressure plate activates (it's a short scene).

With the lift sphere reach the slot in picture 1 which is to the left of the meta-terminal.

After placing the lift sphere in the slot enter the red area to catapult Clank. Try to safely land on a higher ledge where you have to take the Speed Sphere - the location is shown in picture 2.

Go back towards the starting location but on your way remove the lift sphere from the slot you used to catapult Clank.

Use the speed sphere on the slot in picture 1 located near the starting point. Then run through the blue area to break the blocks and find a heavy sphere.

Take the speed sphere from a nearby slot and throw it at the slot in the picture above. It is located right next to the starting point on the main path and from now on the projections will run faster.

Turn towards the slot shown in the picture and throw the lift sphere at it.

Now stand on the pressure plate from picture 1 to make the projections run in another direction. They must destroy the obstacles on the upper level.

Make Clank run through the red area and you will be catapulted to the top. You will find the second lift sphere there (picture 2)

Along the way take the first lift sphere from the bottom slot and the speed sphere from the starting area. Ultimately you should have 2 lift spheres and 1 speed sphere in your inventory.

Reach the main path near the spikes again and do the following:

place the speed sphere in the slot at point 1 in the picture place the lift sphere in the slot at point 2 in the picture.

The speeding projections should now make long jumps over the spikes.

Take the side path towards the meta-terminal. Throw the lift sphere in the slot from picture 1.

Catapult where you used the last lift sphere and throw the heavy sphere at the working spiked machine from picture 2.

You may have already reached the side pressure plate from picture 1. Standing on it will rotate the platform by 90 degrees.

If you did everything right the projections will catapult correctly over the spikes and start hitting the meta-terminal. Wait for the exit to unlock and use teleportation.

Third puzzle

Go straight ahead jump over the chasm and take the Electric Sphere.

You must place the electric sphere in the slot right next to it. Touch the cable and you will be transported to a shelf with a Lift Sphere.

Make sure Clank is standing on the pressure plate at the lift sphere location. Throw the lift sphere at the slot marked in the picture.

Perform a double jump to return to where you put the electric sphere earlier.

Wait for the running projections to reach the pressure plate you were standing on a moment ago. This will lower the side platform shown in the picture. You can take the Heavy Sphere from it.

Remain in that location. Pull the electric sphere from the picture above to you and wait until the projections stop coming to the pressure plate.

The platform you are standing on will move upwards. Use the electric sphere on the new slot here (picture 1).

Touch the cable to move to the next shelf. You will find a Speed Sphere (picture 2).

Turn 180 degrees and pull the electric sphere you just used towards you.

Jump down to the bottom next to the starting area. Place the speed sphere in the slot next to the lift sphere as shown in the picture above.

Run through the green area to speed up and then through the red area to catapult Clank to another high ledge shown in the picture.

There use the electric sphere on the slot and touch the cable to transport Clank to the next platform. Another lift sphere is located there.

Once you got the lift sphere turn 180 degrees and pull the electric sphere towards you. Don't leave your current location.

Now throw the heavy sphere towards the same slot (see the picture above) so the catapulted projections won't be affected by the fans anymore.

You will have to make two more throws from the same shelf:

throw the lift sphere into the slot from point 1 in the picture throw the electric sphere at the slot from point 2 in the picture.

If you've done everything right the projections should reach the last cable and then make their way to the meta-terminal to unlock the exit a moment later. Teleport to the final location of the stage.",,,,,,,,,

Not only was the sentence fair a state appellate court ruled last week it didn’t go far enough.

Now Brittany Burnett could face a harsher prison term after the appeals court ordered her resentencing on charges of eluding police aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest.

Burnett 27 has remained incarcerated since October 2019 when a Bergen County jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts she faces for injuring the trooper when she tried to flee a traffic stop in the stadium parking lot during a Taylor Swift concert.

The Queens woman was hired to drive passengers to the Meadowlands concert the night of July 20 2018. Near the end of the show Burnett allegedly pulled over outside the stadium to call her clients and State Trooper Michael Delgaizo who was working traffic detail approached the Jeep Cherokee and advised her to move. Burnett allegedly refused. When Delgaizo attempted to write a ticket she accelerated and knocked the trooper over prosecutors said.

A Bergen County judge sentenced Burnett to five years on the eluding charge plus an additional four months in county jail for resisting arrest. The sentence included 364 days in county jail on aggravated assault charges that would run concurrent to her state prison time.

That ruling however was too lenient according to the appealed decision. The judge should have considered an additional three to five-year prison sentence for the assault charge and state prison time for resisting arrest the court wrote.

The trial judge considered that Burnett might face hardship in prison because she identifies as an ""openly gay woman"" who suffered ""discrimination because of her sexual orientation” according to the decision.

But because Burnett “received a state-prison sentence for eluding the court should not have sentenced her to the county jail on the other offenses” according to the appellate decision.

A new sentencing date for Burnett is pending. The trial judge will decide whether to tack on the additional prison time for the assault and resisting charges to her original sentence.

Delgaizo testified at trial that while walking toward his vehicle during the traffic stop he heard Burnett’s SUV shift into drive. He spun around slammed the hood and yelled: ""Stop. Put the car in park” but Burnett moved forward slowly and hit the trooper's knee.

The officer reached his arm in the driver's window to unlock the car but the door wedged under his armpit and he was on the ramp leading to Route 120 until he became dislodged and fell ""end over end"" multiple times. A traffic-control worker and a civilian witnessed the incident and corroborated Delgaizo's version of events during the trial the court wrote.

Prosecutors said Burnett left the stadium complex and fled onto Route 17 where she allegedly changed her clothes from a pink suit jacket to a white tank top. Other troopers arrested her that night after recognizing the license plate.

The trooper sustained injuries to his knee and back that forced him to miss a month of work prosecutors said. The court however dismissed charges that Delgaizo suffered significant bodily injury.

When casino giant Genting Group bought an abandoned resort site on Las Vegas Boulevard in 2013 with plans for a lavish project the deal sparked hopes for the sleepy north end of the Strip.

The area was blighted by abandoned hotel projects and sprawling tracts of land where big visions never materialized. Foot traffic was thin the area was poorly lit and overall it was just quiet especially compared with casino-packed sections of the boulevard a few miles away.

“It was dead” developer Lorenzo Doumani recalled.

Eight years later Genting is scheduled to open its long-planned project Resorts World Las Vegas on June 24. The north Strip isn’t in the kind of dire straits it used to be in but the new hotel could bring more tourists to the area and if history repeats itself a surge of visitors overall to Las Vegas who want to see the latest offering in America’s casino capital.

The $4.3 billion project is set to be a flashy property with lots of star power and is the first newly built megaresort to debut on the Strip in more than a decade — all at a time when Las Vegas’ tourism industry the backbone of the local economy is starting to find its footing after getting crushed by the coronavirus pandemic.

“We are trending in the right direction but we are far from recovered” said Jeremy Aguero a principal with Las Vegas consulting firm Applied Analysis.

Big offerings

Resorts World on the site of the former mobbed-up Stardust was initially supposed to open in 2016. But its debut kept getting pushed back and in real estate circles it was all too common for people to ask “What’s going on with Resorts World?”

The property which underwent design changes is massive by any measure featuring 3500 rooms more than 40 food and beverage spots a 5.5-acre pool complex a 27000-square-foot spa a 5000-person-capacity theater 250000 square feet of meeting space and a 117000-square-foot casino.

Its collection of retail stores is slated to include a Kardashian Kloset pop-up shop that will sell items from the reality TV family’s personal closets and the resort boasts a lineup of scheduled concerts from Celine Dion Katy Perry Carrie Underwood and Luke Bryan all of whom are slated to perform several shows.

Miley Cyrus is slated to perform there as well at a grand opening celebration July 4 that will be broadcast on the skyscraper’s 100000-square-foot exterior LED screen.

Resorts World also has an affiliation with Hilton that according to analysts could lure plenty of guests who want to use or earn points with the hotel chain.

‘Shiniest new property’

Industry watchers told the Review-Journal that Resorts World could initially siphon customers from competitors. Macquarie Capital analyst Chad Beynon for instance figures other high-end properties “will probably lose some business at least early on” given Resorts World’s room count.

Also simply being the newest destination in town gives people a reason to walk in.

People “want to see the shiniest new property on the Strip” Truist Securities analyst Barry Jonas said.

Casinos rely on plenty of walk-in traffic. According to Aguero of Applied Analysis the average visitor to Las Vegas goes to five properties while here and resorts will have guests who want to venture out to see the new one.

Tourism overall has often climbed in Las Vegas when a megaresort opens as people are drawn to the city because of the new property.

“It makes Vegas that much more of an attraction” said Doumani who expects to break ground this fall on Majestic Las Vegas a nongaming hotel off the north Strip.

Alan Feldman distinguished fellow in responsible gaming at UNLV’s International Gaming Institute said that over the past 30 years “new resorts have almost always expanded the market and brought new visitors.”

Feldman a former longtime executive with MGM Resorts International said it appears that “all of the stars are aligning” for Resorts World’s debut which he believes will spark more tourism overall and higher room rates across the market.

Travel to Las Vegas is already on the rise and Feldman said Resorts World is bringing “new consumer energy” with its amenities.

There are always customers who want to see the “newest and greatest thing” but even beyond that Genting could draw visitors from Asia as international travel restrictions loosen according to Michael Parks a hotel-casino specialist with real estate brokerage CBRE Group.

Genting based in Malaysia has locations in its home country and in Singapore among other places including New York. On the Strip Resorts World was envisioned early on to feature a live panda exhibit and a replica of the Great Wall of China and even though such offerings were later scrapped the property will “pay homage to Genting Group’s roots with Asian-inspired touches throughout the design and amenities” Resorts World Las Vegas President Scott Sibella previously told the Review-Journal.

Plus with the economy reopening vaccines rolling out and coronavirus restrictions being lifted tourism overall has been gaining momentum.

As Jonas of Truist Securities noted people want to visit Las Vegas after a year of not coming here “or going anywhere for that matter.”

‘Finally coming to life’

Boyd Gaming Corp. imploded the Stardust in 2007 to clear space for its multibillion-dollar Echelon project but halted construction in summer 2008 as the once-roaring economy was stumbling.

The unfinished casino was one of many abandoned projects that littered the valley after the frenzied mid-2000s bubble burst and one in a long line of failed supersized projects on the north Strip.

By the time Genting bought the site that stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard featured two halted partially built resort projects Echelon and Fontainebleau; the vacant former New Frontier site where plans by Israeli investors for a newly built luxury resort went nowhere; the empty former Wet ‘n’ Wild water park site where multiple plans including a 142-story casino-resort never left the drawing board; and the shuttered Sahara which was being transformed into the SLS Las Vegas.

Today the north Strip is by no means buzzing with activity everywhere. The former New Frontier site — now owned by Wynn Resorts Ltd. — and the Wet ‘n’ Wild plot — the site of along-stalled arena and hotel project by ex-NBA player Jackie Robinson — remain undeveloped. Also the 60-plus-story Fontainebleau still hasn’t been finished more than a decade after it went bankrupt under the original developers.

However the SLS after a volatile start traded hands in 2018 and the new owner launched a $150 million overhaul and renamed the property Sahara Las Vegas. The Fontainebleau was reacquired by its old developer in February albeit with no word on when it would open and construction of Resorts World has brought lots of people and activity to that once-quiet site.

Moreover the nearby Las Vegas Convention Center recently finished a $1 billion expansion that brought the facility even closer to the Strip. The first major trade show in the U.S. since the pandemic hit World of Concrete was held this month at the convention center’s new West Hall.

Southern Nevadans have long predicted a turnaround on the north Strip thanks in large part to Resorts World’s long-planned entrance.

That resurgence said CBRE’s Parks “is finally coming to life.”

It’s a good thing Schneider Electric is a major sponsor of T-Mobile Arena. Technically speaking Schneider Electric was the first founding partner of the arena which turned five years old in April.

The folks who run T-Mobile Arena which houses the home ice rink for the Vegas Golden Knights will know who to call if there are any power or energy issues inside the venue on Monday when the temperature is forecast to soar to 112 degrees for VGK vs Montreal Game 1 Monday in Las Vegas and to an even more sizzling 117 for VGK vs Canadiens Game 2 Wednesday.

Add the fact that the arena doors will be open during the hottest times of the day to allow more than 18000 warm-blooded fans into the building and you have yourself a situation where arena workers will be paying close attention to the thermometer to make sure it’s cold enough to have an ice rink playing surface that’s up to icy NHL standards. There are the temperatures of the building interior and the ice to monitor plus the humidity level.

The spike in temperatures might end up shattering records for Las Vegas next week. There is an excessive heat warning from 10AM Monday to 8PM Friday — the entire week.

You might recall the ice conditions surfaced as an issue in the 2018 Stanley Cup Final when the Golden Knights hosted the Washington Capitals in Games 1 and 2 at T-Mobile Arena. Some Capitals players complained about the ice surface after Washington lost 6-4 in Game 1. The Caps went on to take the next four games against the Golden Knights including clinching the Stanley Cup in Game 5 on the ice that they complained had problems during Game 1.

The ice temperature before warm-up could be 18 degrees and it could warm to 24 degrees though the NHL wants the ice to be no warmer than 24 at the end of the game.

LVSportsBiz.com asked VGK and MGM Resorts PR (MGM Resorts is part-owner of the arena) about the ice topic in an email and if we hear back we will share their responses.

Monday’s Game 1 start is 6 PM and game tickets went on sale Friday.

The same issue of ice surface quality could surface for the Tampa Bay Lightning’s arena in downtown Tampa in Florida where the humidity and high temps are a challenge. The Lightning play the New York Islanders in the other semifinal.

It’s likely the Golden Knights will stick with Carnell “Golden Pipes” Johnson to sing the U.S. national anthem Monday. With Montreal as the opponent the Canadian national anthem will have to be sung and that assignment will likely go to Lynnae Meyers.

Take a look at Johnson’s anthem when the word “night” is sung.

Former Vegas Golden Knights players who are now on the Canadiens Nick Suzuki Tomas Tatar and Jon Merrill will be visiting Las Vegas next week.

LAS VEGAS – Jeremy Walker of Paradigm Bull Company just had to nod his head on Saturday night.

Marquis Metal Works Coriolis Effect had erupted from the bucking chutes during the championship round of the PBR Las Vegas Invitational and quickly sent Mason Taylor to the MGM Grand Arena dirt in 3 seconds.

Coriolis Effect was scored a career-best 46.25 points to propel himself to the No. 4 ranking in the YETI World Champion Bull standings.

“Hey that’ll work” Walker said. “Mason got out on him and he bucked hard. I’ll take it.”

Coriolis Effect did give Taylor some trouble inside the bucking chute before Taylor nodding for the gate but the 21-year-old bull rider was not going to make any excuses.

“No it was not that bad” Taylor said. “I kind of quit letting that stuff get me rattled up before I get on. I was just wanting to stomp him so bad. I wanted Jeremy to quit talking about him.”

Walker was proud of Taylor’s effort.

“Mason got him and picked him and wanted to get out on him” Walker said. “If he keeps picking him he’ll get him rode. He looked good to me.”



Coriolis Effect has bucked off 14 consecutive riders on the Unleash The Beast since Joao Ricardo Vieira rode him for 89.5 points in Fort Worth Texas last season.

The 5-year-old is 15-1 on the UTB since making his premier series debut last year in Guthrie Oklahoma.

“He’s big” Taylor said. “He ain’t very strong. He ain’t strong at all actually because I wasn’t anywhere I was supposed to be when I left. He just kind of reared out of there real big and kind of got me sitting on my butt. And man I think if you just ride him like you’re supposed to that bull is going to feel like a good one to get on.”

The Unleash The Beast is now on a six-week break until Last Cowboy Standing at Cheyenne Frontier Days on July 26-27.

Walker plans to let Coriolis Effect enjoy some time off before hauling him to Cheyenne and continuing a potential push at the 2021 World Champion Bull title.

Walker now has two bulls in the Top 5 of the standings with Coriolis Effect and No. 2 Marquis Metal Works Red Clark.

This is an Inside Science story.

Artificial intelligence can design computer microchips that perform at least as well as those designed by human experts devising such blueprints thousands of times faster. This new research from Google is already helping with the design of microchips for the company's next generation of AI computer systems.

The process of designing the physical layout of a chip's parts known as floor planning is key to a device's ultimate performance. This complex task often requires months of intense efforts from experts and despite five decades of research no automated floorplanning technique has reached human-level performance until now.

In the new study the researchers had AI software treat floorplanning as a game said study co-lead author Azalia Mirhoseini a computer scientist at Google Research's Brain Team in Mountain View California. In this approach the chip's computation cores memory controllers and other elements are the pieces the canvas on which they sit is the board and a winning result is optimal performance according to a range of values such as chip size and power usage.

As the AI analyzed a greater number and variety of microchips it became faster and better at chip design. This strategy proved better than previous automated techniques ""because it learns from experience"" said study co-lead author Anna Goldie a computer scientist also with Google's Brain Team. ""Previous approaches didn't learn anything with each chip.""

In less than six hours the new method can generate manufacturable chip floor plans that are comparable or superior to ones made by experts in all key details including performance energy consumption and chip area according to the researchers. This could potentially save thousands of hours of human effort for each generation of microchips.

A number of these designs were not initially intuitively better to experts ""but still delivered really good results"" Mirhoseini said. The AI-designed floor plans have inspired experts with new ideas such as placing components in doughnut shapes to reduce the distances between them she noted.

Google is now manufacturing these AI-designed chips. The researchers suggested that more powerful AI-designed hardware can in turn fuel more advances in AI.

This new floor planning strategy could also help tackle other problems that involve looking for the best uses of limited sets of resources such as city planning or vaccine testing and distribution the scientists added. They detailed their findings in the June 10 issue of the journal ""Nature.""

Their penetration into the emerging markets has helped developing nations acquire cutting-edge technology and improved connectivity with the world but it has come at a cost. The close working relationship between Chinese big tech and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is perceived as a national security threat by many countries. These tech giants are more than capable of serving the party’s strategic and geopolitical interests. The extent to which CCP wants to dictate control in the cyberspace domain is evident from the official statements from Cyber Administration of China (CAC). According to CAC the CCP’s ideas should always become the strongest voice in cyberspace and China’s proposition of internet governance should be an international consensus. This can be achieved through enhancing the “global influence of internet companies like Alibaba Tencent Baidu Huawei.”

Chinese Quid pro quo

As per the CCP’s Constitution it is mandatory for any enterprise with more than three or more full party workers to form a party’s organisation and provide for party activities. Big tech firms are not an exception to this rule; in fact they have the highest number of internal CCP Party committees which aim to promote party loyalty. Huawei has over 300 party branches Alibaba has around 200 and Tencent has around 100. Additionally Jack Ma of Alibaba Robin Lo of Baidu Pony Ma of Tencent and Lei Jun of Xiaomi are members of CCP.

This relationship between Chinese big tech and CCP seems to be symbiotic. The CCP provided the capital gave government contracts to these companies in their initial stages eliminated the foreign competition by banning or regulating foreign companies helped them grow and now therefore is the time for the Chinese companies to pay back by aligning themselves to the party’s strategic goals. This intermingling of big tech and CCP share its roots in the flagship program of “Military Civil-Fusion” (MCF) pioneered by President Xi Jinping. The purpose of the MCF is to develop China into a technologically advanced military might by 2049 by helping break barriers between Chinese civilian research commercial companies and its military and industrial defence sectors. The implementation of the MCF strategy relies not only on indigenous technology but also on acquiring critical dual-use technologies outside China through licit or illicit ways including cyber theft espionage and predatory acquisition. Thus the role of these big tech companies become further critical in the acquisition of data technology and start-ups.

This relationship between Chinese big tech and CCP seems to be symbiotic. The CCP provided the capital gave government contracts to these companies in their initial stages eliminated the foreign competition by banning or regulating foreign companies helped them grow and now therefore is the time for the Chinese companies to pay back by aligning themselves to the party’s strategic goals

As per Article 7 of China’s National Intelligence law 2017 Chinese companies are required by law to share data with the State. The law also states that the “State protects individuals and organisations that support assist and cooperate with national intelligence work”.

There have been multiple reports about the use of Huawei’s surveillance and face detection system by CCP on Uighurs Muslims in the “re-education” camps. In fact Huawei has developed a face detection software which will give an “Uighur alarm” to authorities if it identifies members of the oppressed minority group based on their ethnicity.

The CCP is using its big tech for surveillance not only in its own country but even outside. There have been reports of surveillance and data theft at the African Union’s headquarter in Ethiopia through Huawei. These and other malicious activities by Huawei have already led to the blacklisting of its 5G instruments in US and multiple other states.

Similarly the messages of WeChat owned by Tencent are subject to surveillance and are often deleted if they do not conform to the Party’s standards even if they originate outside China. The Canada Wenzhou Friendship Society has already been accused of meddling in Canadian election using the WeChat app.

China monitors the world not just by using these big tech firms but also by using surveillance hardware. A classic example is using a microchip to infiltrate many US companies some of which were involved in government defence contracts. Super Micro Computers Inc. is a San Jose-based company that assembles server’s motherboard which are further used by many companies including Amazon Apple Elemental etc. Super Micro Computers subcontracts the manufacturing to various companies in China. While auditing the motherboard servers it was found that they were sabotaged with a microchip most probably designed and manufactured by the Chinese military unit and were roughly the size of the tip of a pencil. The microchip had network capability memory and processing power for an attack and were embedded in the servers during their manufacturing in China and then shipped to the US. This insidious attack by China on the US companies was one of the most sophisticated hardware attacks.

India erring on the side of caution

India has also not been immune to cyberattacks data theft and industrial espionage by State-sponsored Chinese hackers and big techs. According to a recent intelligence report in a systematic plan by Chinese authorities at least 72 Alibaba cloud servers were sending Indian data to China. This comes amidst China’s super surveillance report on around 10000 prominent Indian personalities including PM Narendra Modi. Just last month Chinese state-backed hackers infiltrated the servers of Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India to steal the intellectual property of the Indian COVID-19 vaccine makers. There have also been reports of Chinese PLA unit 61938 APT22 group targeting critical Indian infrastructure including nuclear power plants financial institutions railways and banking. The list is long but one thing remains the same one cannot trust digi-tech that has its origin in China or is substantially controlled by Chinese companies. The Chinese companies are constantly in sync with the CCP and PLA and provide them with information as and when requested.

As it is said these days data is the new oil and Chinese companies at the behest of the State are engaged in enhanced oil exploration and recovery. Commendably the Indian government banned 267 Chinese apps including WeChat and PUBG (Tencent) UC Browser (Alibaba) TikTok (Bytedance) that were involved in data acquisition and were a threat to the sovereignty and integrity of India. India also recently banned Huawei from participating in its 5G trials. However these companies are trying to return to India in indirect ways. Recently the relaunch of PUBG Mobile was announced by the name Battlegrounds Mobile India. The company that is bringing it to India Krafton has Tencent as its second biggest shareholder.

The digital threat from China is not only in the form of these apps but the threat looms large based on the extent of Chinese investments in Indian start-ups. Chinese investment in Indian start-ups account for up to US $4 billion and 18 of the 30 Indian unicorns have Chinese investment. The heavy presence of Chinese investors in the India start-up market is a threat to the financial independence of Indian companies. Recently India banned the automatic route of investment from countries sharing its borders and further the Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is checking whether the Ant group (Alibaba financial arm) has any ‘control’ over Paytm. This is a welcome step since Chinese predatory acquisition of start-ups is out in the open.

The digital threat from China is not only in the form of these apps but the threat looms large based on the extent of Chinese investments in Indian start-ups. Chinese investment in Indian start-ups account for up to US $4 billion and 18 of the 30 Indian unicorns have Chinese investment

A gentle nudge forward

Since then Indian start-ups have diversified their investment options and are getting investments from Japan the US Australia and other like-minded nations. Similarly Indian investors have risen to the occasion and are now funding various Indian start-ups. We need ‘Atmanirbharta’ especially in start-ups that are working in the field of critical dual-use technology. Grooming Indian start-ups by providing them funding and easing the regulations and tax structure will help in creating a strong base for the start-ups to flourish. A conducive environment for innovation more research and development grants from the government a long-term national policy for new and emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence quantum computing etc. are required from the government to shield against the threat emanating from Chinese big tech and the CCP in the digital foray. We need to understand that strategic critical technologies will emerge from the open market unlike in the past where military technologies were the domain of ordinance factories and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). We as a nation must be intelligent and foresighted enough to tap these technologies in their nascent stage and nurture them so that we can protect ‘Atmanirbharta’ from any adversaries.

Since that time Microsoft has released an abundance of updated versions each offering more features and incorporating better technology than the one before it. The most current web-based version of Microsoft Word is Microsoft 365 but the software version of Microsoft Office 2019 includes Word 2019.

Microsoft Word is included in all of the Microsoft 365 application suites. The most basic (and least expensive) suites also include Microsoft PowerPoint and Microsoft Excel. Additional suites exist and include other Office programs such as Microsoft Outlook and Skype for Business.

Do you need Microsoft Word?

If you only want to create simple documents consisting of paragraphs with bulleted and numbered lists with very little formatting you don’t need to purchase Microsoft Word. You can use the WordPad application included with Windows 7 Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. If you need to do more than that though you’ll need a more powerful word processing program.

With Microsoft Word you can choose from a variety of preconfigured styles and designs which provides an easy way to format long documents with just a single click. You can also insert pictures and videos from your computer and the internet draw shapes and create an insert all kinds of charts.

If you’re writing a book or creating a brochure which you can’t do effectively (or at all) in WordPad or an application like Abiword you can use the features in Microsoft Word to set margins and tabs insert page breaks create columns and even configure the spacing between lines. There are also features that let you create a table of contents with a single click. You can insert footnotes too as well as headers and footers. There are options to create bibliographies captions a table of figures and even cross-references.

If any of these things sound like what you’d like to do with your next writing project then you’re going to need Microsoft Word.

Do You Have Microsoft Word?

You might already have a version of Microsoft Word on your computer tablet or even your phone. Before you make a purchase you should find out.

To see if you have Microsoft Word installed on your Windows device:

From the Search window on the Taskbar (Windows 10) the Start screen (Windows 8.1) or from the Search window on the Start menu (Windows 7) type msinfo32 and press Enter. Click the + sign beside Software Environment. Click Program Groups. Look for a Microsoft Office entry.

To find out if you have a version of Word on your Mac look for it in the Finder sidebar under Applications.

Where to Get Microsoft Word

If you are sure you don’t already have it you can get the latest version of Microsoft Word with Microsoft 365. Microsoft 365 is a subscription though something you pay for monthly. If you’re not interested in paying monthly consider purchasing Office outright. You can compare and purchase all of the available editions and suites at the Microsoft Store. If you want to wait though you can get Microsoft Word 2019 during the latter part of 2018 by purchasing the Microsoft Office 2019 suite.

Some employers community colleges and universities offer Microsoft 365 free to their employees and students.

The History of Microsoft Word

Over the years there have been many versions of the Microsoft Office suite. Most of these versions came with lower-priced suites that only included the most basic apps (often Word PowerPoint and Excel) to higher priced suites that included some or all of them (Word PowerPoint Excel Outlook OneNote SharePoint Exchange Skype and more). These suite editions had names like “Home and Student” or “Personal” or “Professional”. There are too many combinations to list here but what’s important to note is that Word is included with any suite you can buy.

Here are the recent Microsoft Office Suites that also contain Word:

Microsoft Word 365) is available and updated regularly in Microsoft 365

Word Online is a free limited version.

Word 2019 is available in Office 2019

Word 2016 is available in Office 2016

Word 2013 was available in Office 2013

Word 2010 was available in Office 2010

Word 2007 was included with Office 2007

Word 2003 was included with Office 2003

Word 2002 was included in Office XP

Of course Microsoft Word has existed in some form since the early 1980s and has had versions for most platforms (even from before Microsoft Windows existed).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjbWFnLmNvbS9ob3ctdG8vdHVybi1taWNyb3NvZnQtYXV0aGVudGljYXRvci1pbnRvLXlvdXItcGFzc3dvcmQtbWFuYWdlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Turn Microsoft Authenticator Into Your Password Manager,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/turn-microsoft-authenticator-into-your-password-manager on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjbWFnLmNvbS9ob3ctdG8vdHVybi1taWNyb3NvZnQtYXV0aGVudGljYXRvci1pbnRvLXlvdXItcGFzc3dvcmQtbWFuYWdlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy8yMDIxLzA2LzEzL21pY3Jvc29mdC1icmFkLXNtaXRoLXRydW1wLWp1c3RpY2UtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC1nYWctb3JkZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | Microsoft President Brad Smith: Secret gag orders like the Trump Justice Department’s must stop,The past seven days marked another bad week for the collision between technology and democracy.

Microsoft ended their joint Xbox / Bethesda showcase with a mini fridge.

Xbox ( YouTube

In Microsoft’s defense the gorgeously coiffed (did you see that Black woman’s hair! Finally!) Redfall was probably the announcement it intended to whet our appetites with but still Microsoft’s parting E3 gift wasn’t Halo Infinite’s release date but a dang fridge.

The mini fridge is shaped like an Xbox Series X—so a black rectangular box like most fridges. According to the teaser the fridge features “Xbox velocity cooling architecture” suggesting there might actually be console tech keeping your Monster Energy drinks cool.



Back when the Series X was revealed in 2019 fans observed that the black rectangular and uncomfortably holey console wouldn’t look out of place super-sized and next to a dishwasher. Microsoft would have us believe that the shape was a design feature rather than a flaw because apparently the fridge-like configuration was the most efficient way for the console to disperse heat.

Microsoft leaned into the joke in tweets and a contest that awarded one lucky(?) winner a full-size Series X-styled fridge.

So how did we get from a one-off joke to having a mini fridge close out one of the biggest video game showcases of the year?



The answer is—and believe me it pains me to write this next phrase because it is just so asinine— Microsoft got into a Twitter brand war with Skittles.



Advertisement

Yes really.



Back in April Twitter hosted a March Madness-esque bracket pitting different brands against each other to see which company had the best “How do you do fellow consumers?” tweets. After beating out questionably-good-at-Twitter brands like Wendy’s and Mr. Peanut (I don’t know how you can have a Best at Twitter tournament and not include Steak-umms) the finals came down to Skittles and Xbox. Aaron Greenberg the general manager of Xbox marketing tweeted that if fans helped Xbox win the title bout against Skittles he’d make the Series X fridge real (albeit smaller).

Xbox won the fake poll by a razor-thin margin and Microsoft true to its word put the mini fridges into production. This energy drink storage case is scheduled to hit stores just in time for Christmas because why wouldn’t Xbox want to take advantage of a meme during the most important spending time of the year. That’s capitalism for ya baby!

Astra Industrial Group said that the agreement signed between its fully-owned subsidiary Tabuk Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Co. and Moderna to commercialize the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and future variant-specific booster candidates in Saudi Arabia is valid for three renewable years upon consent of both parties.

However it is difficult to determine the agreement value as it depends on the level of supply and sales to the market which is dependent on successful registration of the products.

Under the terms of this agreement Tabuk Pharmaceuticals will hold the marketing authorization for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in Saudi Arabia.

The agreement scope also includes obtaining and maintaining any required authorization including registration of the products with the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) and carrying out pharmacovigilance activities.

The deal provides suitable handling of the products for the main distributors hospitals clinics and others.

The agreement gives Tabuk the possibility to discuss opportunities to distribute other Moderna products for COVID-19 if authorized in the future.

There are no related parties to the agreement Astra noted adding that any material financial impact will be announced in the upcoming interim and annual financial statements.

Targeted Dream Incubation

Scientists have a stark warning for us: Companies want to target your dreams with advertisements — and they're already doing it.

40 sleep researchers have signed an open letter calling on legislators to regulate ""targeted dream incubation (TDI)"" according to Science Magazine. In it warned that large corporations such as Coors’ and Burger King were actively attempting to engineer the dreams of potential customers.

""TDI-advertising is not some fun gimmick but a slippery slope with real consequences"" the researchers wrote in their letter. ""Planting dreams in people’s minds for the purpose of selling products not to mention addictive substances raises important ethical questions.""

They continued ""Our dreams cannot become just another playground for corporate advertisers.""

Dreaming of Beer

The letter authors specifically cite an instance in which Molson Coors — the parent company of Coors Blue Moon and Miller beers — used TDI to advertise in people's dreams in the days leading up to the Super Bowl.

For that they invited willing participants to watch a ""dream inducing video"" created with the help of a sleep scientist that included images and sounds of ""waterfalls mountains and of course Coors"" before they fell asleep according to a press release by Molson Coors.

Participants could also get a 12 pack of Coors for free if they sent a link of the video to a friend so they could also have their dreams incepted.

Check out a video of their efforts below:

Dark Cyberpunk Implications

Having a corporation needle its way into your dreams is definitely a scenario you’d see play out in a cyberpunk story — but it’s actually happening in reality.

Though dream engineering currently requires our active participation sleep researchers warn that this could usher in a new dark reality where corporations employ passive TDI tactics through things like smart speakers.

""[It] is easy to envision a world in which smart speakers [...] become instruments of passive unconscious overnight advertising with or without our permission"" the letter authors said. ""These tailored soundtracks would become background scenery for our sleep as the unending billboards that litter American highways have become for our waking life.""

For now we'll have to wait and see if legislators do something about this. If the researchers are right though this could end up being a slippery slope where we aren’t even safe from big corporations in our sleep — and that’s enough to keep anyone up at night.

Japan is opening up its semiconductor sector to cooperation with outside firms chiefly TSMC after losing its global leadership position

By Tim Culpan / Bloomberg Opinion





As much as the US pines for the good old days of global semiconductor supremacy Japan feels its loss of glory even more.

Once a dominant name in electronic components the nation has been overtaken by Taiwan South Korea and more recently China. Yet Tokyo might have a viable plan to revitalize its domestic sector.

“Unlike the purely domestic independent way it was done in the past I think we need to cooperate with overseas counterparts” Akira Amari a former economy minister and senior member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party told Bloomberg News’ Isabel Reynolds and Emi Nobuhiro this week.

That is remarkable pragmatism for a country whose industrial policy has largely revolved around protecting and isolating its companies to preserve national identity. Yet three decades of decline show that past policies are just not cutting it.

In 1988 Japan commanded 50 percent of the global semiconductor industry according to a presentation this month from the Japanese Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry that cited data from research firm Omdia.

Back then names such as NEC Corp Toshiba Corp Hitachi Ltd and Fujitsu Semiconductor Ltd occupied six of the top 10 places in market share alongside US giants Intel Corp and Motorola Solutions Inc.

By 2019 Japan accounted for 10 percent. The US had climbed to 50 percent due to the ascent of chip designers like Qualcomm Inc Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

These US firms rose thanks to a bifurcated business model aided by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC 台積電) an anchor tenant in Taiwan’s noted science parks. The arrangement reflects complementary skill sets. Rather than both design and manufacture a chip as was once the case most US companies now just outsource to foundries like TSMC.

Amari said that TSMC is exactly the type of foreign partner that Japanese companies should work with since it is the world’s largest maker of non-memory semiconductors.

His words carry weight given that he is heading a party working group on chip strategy as part of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s policy to incorporate industry plans into the government’s growth plans.

Japan remains a global leader in the equipment and materials used for production. As chips get increasingly more difficult to make tighter integration across the supply chain is inevitable.

Taiwanese companies including TSMC and United Microelectronics Corp (聯電) have a lot to offer.

The Taiwan-Japan relationship is also becoming one of the closest in East Asia. Tokyo last week donated 1.24 million doses of much-needed COVID-19 vaccine as Taipei struggles to contain an outbreak. They share close trade cultural and tourism ties and feel increasing economic and military tensions from Beijing.

The idea of semiconductor cooperation is not without precedent. More than a decade ago Yukio Sakamoto president of Japan’s then-largest memory chipmaker Elpida Memory Inc tried to rally together a consortium of local and Taiwanese companies to battle against industry giants Samsung Electronics Co and Micron Corp.

Japan’s semiconductor sector was already on the slide. Elpida was formed by the merger of memory divisions from NEC and Hitachi in 1999 a time when the nation’s share had already fallen below 30 percent.

Sakamoto did not think that either the Japanese or Taiwanese firms could survive on their own.

“We don’t have the scale” he said in 2010.

Sakamoto’s proposal fell through amid opposition from Taiwanese companies and political pressure in Taipei. Within two years his company had filed for bankruptcy and Taiwanese rivals largely exited the computer memory industry.

The mood is vastly different now. TSMC in February said it plans to set up a Japan research center primarily centered on materials development so that it can tap into the nation’s deep pool of chemical engineers.

The ministry hopes to take it further and expects to offer strong incentives to lure a foreign chip foundry to Japan Kazumi Nishikawa of the ministry’s IT Industry Division told Bloomberg News.

Politically both governments are crucially aware of the need to cooperate and jointly work with the US to hold off China’s rising strength.

Chinese companies have increased their share of Apple Inc’s orders a benchmark for the global electronics supply chain and Beijing is willing to spend as much as it takes to ensure its chip industry gains traction.

Not content with being the king of chip design the US now sees lack of manufacturing capacity as a threat to national security. Washington is looking to spend more than US$30 billion to get back in the game increasing the urgency for other nations to cement their own plans.

With semiconductors becoming a key weapon in the technology cold war Taipei and Tokyo would be smart to team up.

It currently connects more than 9200 power-generating units over 600000 miles of transmission lines. These lines are essential in getting electricity transported to our homes and businesses. Because of the importance of electricity to our daily lives grid failures can have catastrophic consequences. That's why companies are investing heavily in upgrading this critical infrastructure.

Three companies working hard to build the next-generation grid are Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEP)(NYSE: BEPC) NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) and Xcel Energy (NASDAQ: XEL). Here's why those investments could pay big dividends for their investors over the coming years.

Providing support to both ends of the grid

Brookfield Renewable doesn't operate the power transmission lines that make up the electrical grid. Instead it focuses on investing in two other types of assets that will enhance the grid's reliability. First it's a leader in owning operating and developing distributed generation (DG) projects. These are off-grid power-producing assets like rooftop solar and battery storage. Thus it enables end-users to generate power closer to the source reducing the load on the power grid.

Brookfield also operates large-scale energy storage assets like pumped storage. These facilities provide critical grid-stabilizing services by supplying power when other facilities are offline. For example it delivers backup capacity to address the intermittency of greener electricity grids handling energy produced by wind- and solar-generating facilities.

The company's investments to expand those two business lines will help give Brookfield Renewable the power to grow its earnings at a double-digit annual rate in the coming years. That should support its plan to increase its dividend by around 5% to 9% per year.

Building a leading grid operator

NextEra Energy is one of the largest utilities in the country. It operates two electric utilities in Florida an electricity-generating business that happens to be the world's largest wind and solar power producer and a leading transmission business. NextEra Energy Transmission integrates renewable energy and strengthens the electricity grid.

It built this leading business via acquisition and development projects. For example earlier this year it acquired GridLiance for $660 million adding 700 miles of high-voltage transmission lines across six states. Meanwhile in 2019 it bought the Trans Bay Cable a 53-mile underwater transmission system that supplies more than 40% of the power used in San Francisco. It also won approval last year to build a new transmission line in Western New York to ease grid congestion and maximize the delivery of renewable energy in the region. Overall NextEra is becoming a leader in building the next-generation grid designed to handle increased loads from renewable energy.

Those investments will help power NextEra's growth plan to expand its earnings per share at a 6% to 8% annual rate through 2023. That could support dividend growth of around 10% through next year.

Rapidly expanding its grid

Xcel Energy operates one of the fastest-growing investor-owned transmission systems. It has more than 20000 miles of transmission lines across 10 states.

The utility is investing heavily to expand its transmission business to help support increased renewable energy deployment. Overall the company is investing $24.3 billion through 2025 to expand its operations with 25% of that spending earmarked for electric transmission projects. One notable project is the proposed Colorado Pathway Transmission expansion. Xcel could invest up to $1.7 billion to build 560 miles of transmission lines that could support roughly 5.5 gigawatts of new renewable power generation.

Those transmission-related investments will help power Xcel's plan to grow its earnings per share at a 5% to 7% annual rate over the coming years. That should support similar yearly increases in its 2.6%-yielding dividend.

Building the future of energy

The global economy is switching power sources from fossil fuels to renewable energy. That will require a significant investment to upgrade the power grid. While many companies stand to benefit from this megatrend Brookfield Renewable NextEra Energy and Xcel Energy are great options for investors. That's because their investments should pay immediate benefits to shareholders via steadily rising dividends.

One of these stocks was Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS).

Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS) has experienced a decrease in hedge fund sentiment lately. Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS) was in 3 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic is 17. Our calculations also showed that ASPS isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Hedge funds have more than $3.5 trillion in assets under management so you can't expect their entire portfolios to beat the market by large margins. Our research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). So you can still find a lot of gems by following hedge funds' moves today.

With all of this in mind let's take a look at the recent hedge fund action encompassing Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS).

Do Hedge Funds Think ASPS Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

At the end of the first quarter a total of 3 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock a change of -25% from the fourth quarter of 2020. By comparison 8 hedge funds held shares or bullish call options in ASPS a year ago. So let's check out which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.

The largest stake in Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS) was held by Renaissance Technologies which reported holding $6.7 million worth of stock at the end of December. It was followed by Arrowstreet Capital with a $0.4 million position. The only other hedge fund that is bullish on the company was D E Shaw.

Story continues

We view hedge fund activity in the stock unfavorable but in this case there was only a single hedge fund selling its entire position: Citadel Investment Group. One hedge fund selling its entire position doesn't always imply a bearish intent. Theoretically a hedge fund may decide to sell a promising position in order to invest the proceeds in a more promising idea. However we don't think this is the case in this case because none of the 750+ hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey identified ASPS as a viable investment and initiated a position in the stock.

Let's check out hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS) but similarly valued. We will take a look at Protalix BioTherapeutics Inc. (NYSE:PLX) Avinger Inc (NASDAQ:AVGR) Summit Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:SMLP) Pangaea Logistics Solutions Ltd. (NASDAQ:PANL) Pieris Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:PIRS) Ayala Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:AYLA) and Apollo Endosurgery Inc. (NASDAQ:APEN). This group of stocks' market values are similar to ASPS's market value.

View table here if you experience formatting issues.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 5.6 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $14 million. That figure was $8 million in ASPS's case. Pieris Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:PIRS) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Summit Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:SMLP) is the least popular one with only 1 bullish hedge fund positions. Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for ASPS is 17. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 17.2% in 2021 through June 11th and surpassed the market again by 3.3 percentage points. Unfortunately ASPS wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was quite bearish); ASPS investors were disappointed as the stock returned -22.3% since the end of March (through 6/11) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market in 2021.

The TV show is very different from its source material however thanks to a thorough re-imagining by filmmaker Jim Mickle who wrote or co-wrote three of the series’ eight episodes directed four of them and served as co-showrunner along with Beth Schwartz. In the process of going from the page to the screen Mickle changed Sweet Tooth’s tone look and even genre. Slate caught up with him last week to talk about what drew him to the material the changes he had to make for television and the one plot point he wishes he’d found a way to include in the show. (Spoilers for both versions of Sweet Tooth follow.) This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Matthew Dessem: I’m interested in the process of adapting this and turning it from a comic book into a TV show. So let’s start with your background with comic books. You’ve done a lot of comic book adaptations and you just announced you’re about to do another one [a feature adaptation of God Country]. Did you grow up reading comics?

Jim Mickle: I did but I never quite understood the big comic books. I always gravitated towards Image in the ’90s. It was independent comics and those offbeat voices that really resonated or felt a little bit more personal—that was always something that inspired me. I would go through cycles where I wouldn’t really read comics for a couple of years. Then I’d find myself at a comic book store I’d fall back in love and I’d pick up everything that had come out in the years prior.

I started off as a storyboard artist and at one point wanted to be a comic book artist. So I always had this relationship from afar. And then Sweet Tooth I got the first couple of issues in one of those binge sprees and fell in love with that concept. I had just made Stake Land which is a very similar kind of story. And there was just something about it that felt so fresh: visually the idea of a kid with antlers but also the idea of bringing nature into it. At the time I remember sharing it with Nick Damici my writing partner and just saying “I think there’s something in here.” And we kept reading them and as each issue came out it felt like “This is too big for a movie. You can’t really condense this.”

It wasn’t until about 2016 that I had been talking about some other stuff with [Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey’s production company] Team Downey and they said “We’re trying to crack this comic book for television. Have you ever heard of Sweet Tooth?” I had them all on my shelf at that point. I was just like “Yes.” As soon as they said that I pictured that cover and it rekindled it all.

It seems like a difficult thing to crack. The way that you did it was by changing the genre changing the audience sort of completely reimagining it. When did you make the decision “We’re just going to go crazy with this premise?”

It was very organic and it took time I have to say. I remember looking at it falling in love with it saying “We’re going to do this.” The aesthetic at that point was let’s do it as practically as we can possibly do it. At that time I think it was a little bit more Where the Wild Things Are the film adaptation. It was a little bit more raw and more like the comic book. I guess it was probably around the end of 2016: the election had just happened I had just finished season two of Hap and Leonard I was about to start a movie that folded four days before we were to start shooting and it was all at Thanksgiving. I remember I was just so beat down by it and picking up the pieces and going back and reading it feeling like “I don’t know that I have it in me to do that version. I don’t know that I have it in me to do what I know is going to be years of the story leaning into the sadness or the melancholy of it. Or holding up a dark mirror to the world.” It was like “I already feel like we’re in the dark mirror. We can’t get a darker mirror.”

So it started from there—I started looking at it through that lens and saying “This comic book felt so fresh in 2010 and here we are 2016. A lot of these things have actually happened. Apocalyptic storytelling has come and gone and had three iterations by now. If we just do this it’s going to feel like we’re stuck in 2010.” I started asking questions like “What if you could make an apocalyptic story where you actually want to go to that world?” What does that look like? And you start asking “What happens if humans just disappear for 10 years and nature is suddenly allowed to thrive?” It would probably be one of the most beautiful places you could go to.

So it started from asking “What if it was actually beautiful and vibrant and not the dusty sepia-tone look we’re used to with apocalyptic stories?” Gus was the biggest part of that: not just a ten-year-old boy but a ten-year-old boy who is also animal and everything is natural instincts and anything that is human or synthetic is just going to feel alien. Suddenly decisions like the hot pink of those flags [used by one of the show’s militias to mark territory] become “What’s a color that doesn’t occur in nature?” You start with that premise and it trickles down to every decision.

One of the things was it took Jeff [Lemire] 40 issues to get the mythology out. We needed to get to a lot of that right away. So it felt like we needed a guide and once you bring a narrator into the situation suddenly you’re going “We’re actually telling a fairy tale here.” It was an ongoing process that happened very organically.

Once you started redesigning it you did every aspect at once? The look the changes in the story all of that?

Well it started with that. Originally it was with Hulu and Jordan Helman and Sasha Silver—I had worked with Jordan on Hap and Leonard. I remember originally he said “Just go write the script. We’d like to get a script as soon as possible. You don’t have to show us an outline.” Which to a writer is like “Oh my God. I don’t have to do an outline!” I still wanted to do one just so I knew what the heck I was doing. So I did an internal one. I wrote an outline I thought that I knew what I was doing. It was the first time I was writing something solo because I had always worked with Nick Damici and it was like “I’m going to prove to myself that I can do this.”

So I locked myself away and I wrote the outline and then I started going to script and I reached the end of the outline and I was only 15 pages into the script. And I was like “All right this is not going to work.” But then you start playing in the world of Gus and his dad in the woods which is only a page or two in the comic it’s not very much. And you start going “This is the whole story. This is where he learns everything. This is where he learns morality and this is where his innocence comes from. He’s only going to know about trees and dirt.”

So I started looking at it like “Well we need a lot more here—what if we just spend this entire opening episode with Gus in the woods?” Because originally I think you were going to meet two or three other groups of characters by the end of the pilot. I think Jepperd was to come in halfway through. It was much faster and it suddenly felt like that was the wrong way to do it. You have to live with this kid and go what he goes through so that when he leaves the fence that’s the thing that sends us out to the world. So it was a process.

I wish I was one of those people who can look at something and go “It’s got to be this this and this.” I’m much more of a “Got to sit with it and digest it and use trial and error and look at it from a couple of different angles.” Because of that things take longer than I’d like them to but they wind up going how they should I guess.

That first version of the pilot which of the characters had you reimagined?

Well we met Singh we met Gus we met his father and we met Jepperd at that point. The idea to include Singh came in really early because I love that character from the book and felt like I didn’t want to wait. The trick with the comic book is it’s very driven by Gus’ point-of-view for the first six or seven issues. Hap and Leonard season one we told almost all from Hap and Leonard’s perspective which is how the books were written because they’re first person narration by Hap. It was my first time doing television and I learned the hard way that it’s very hard to maintain rhythm and pace when you’re doing that kind of story for a long period of time. When you’re just settling with your main characters and not branching out.

So we knew that at some point we were going to have to start meeting other characters before Gus met them. Dr. Singh felt like the perfect version of that because he was an interesting character and it felt interesting to think “What if we met him 10 years before we meet him in the comic books?” So that idea was there right from the get-go. Originally I remember starting to write the father more like he is in the comic book but it felt almost like it was a repeat of Jepperd. It felt like he was another authoritarian type. I remember Linda my partner was like “It feels like he’s just being handed from one thing to a very similar thing—can we find a way to do something differently?” I had a really great upbringing and I had a great very nurturing father. So it felt like that was the story to tell: somebody who’s actually ripped away from that and forced to go on the road with Jepperd.

When did you decide Jepperd would change from a white hockey player to a Black football player?

I know nothing about hockey and that was always the thing that intimidated me. I’m a massive football fan I was really into Last Chance U at the time and I was just fascinated by these players. I played very competitive sports till I was 20 or so having that sort of thing where you’re constantly driven to compete and be physical and at times be brutal. And when that tips into your normal life then you’re a pariah. I thought that was really interesting as was the idea that you could be at the top of your game and have one small injury that knocks a millisecond off of your 40-yard dash and all of a sudden you’re out of the league and coping with what you’re going to do with the rest of your life.

So all that was swirling the idea of Jepperd as this character who could come from that who probably is not prepared for the world a normal world. But when the world turns upside down all of his skillsets that have been hindrances in his personal life are suddenly the things that he can use to survive. I was nudging Jeff and just letting him know “Hey we might be making this change.” And then when we cast Nonso [Anozie] I just sent him a picture of Nonso six foot six almost 300 pounds. Like “Is he a hockey player? Because I don’t think he’s a hockey player.” And Jeff was like “No go ahead.”

Were there characters or arcs you were sorry to lose from the comic book? What hurt to cut?

One big thing was that how Gus gets to the preserve in the comic is very different and Jepperd’s role in that is very different. [Spoiler: In the comics Jepperd betrays Gus and sells him to a militia in exchange for his wife’s remains.] We kept working on that for so long trying to get that right trying to get a version that was going to work. We tried it we tried it we tried it. It’s one thing in a comic book but how do you do it when you’ve spent eight hours with these characters and the audience has fallen in love with their relationship? How do you do that in a way that does not result in people just throwing their televisions out the window? It just felt like it was the wrong thing. On the page violence and violence with children is a very different thing than onscreen with actors. There are things that you can get away with in comics that we can’t and vice versa.

You shot the pilot and then COVID-19 hit. That pilot opens with a global pandemic—were there things that you changed after actually experiencing one?

It was so accurate that we actually simplified a lot of it. That opening was originally probably five or six minutes in the very first cut from 2019. It actually opened with Singh in front of the candy machine and he’s got his mask on and it just opens on just his eyes. And then he pulls his mask down and he takes a deep breath. That was the opening shot which is now further into the pilot. We were able to lose a lot of stuff because part of the challenge was showing the audience how quickly the world could fall apart. I remember pitching it as “We’re going to watch the world be perfect and then fall apart in the span of just a few minutes and to do that we’re going to have to show this.” We had a scene where Singh went into a supermarket and saw aisles of flu medicine gone stuff like that that felt important at the time to show. But now the world has a shorthand for all this. So that was actually the only thing we changed just simplifying it.

You mentioned earlier the waves of post-apocalyptic fiction that came out between the Sweet Tooth comic books and the time that you started adapting it for television. Which ones did you draw from? What are your favorites?

I Am Legend is my favorite book of all time and Night of the Living Dead and the remake were big as I grew up. That was always a huge part of it. My first movie Mulberry St. is very much inspired by that and so is Stake Land. We made Stake Land but before it was released The Walking Dead came out. By the time our movie ended up coming out I remember people going “They’re ripping off The Walking Dead” and being so frustrated by that because it was just the timing of releases. I was actually looking back at that and realizing how much of it was inspired by the Depression era. I remember when we were making stuff then looking at what things looked like in the Dust Bowl—it was industrial post-industrial images. I think it was interesting to look at that and go “No what does it look like now?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvMjAyMS82LzEyL2NhbWVyb29ucy1uZXRmbGl4LWJvb3N0LWJpZy13aW4tZm9yLWVuZ2xpc2gtc3BlYWtpbmctbWlub3JpdHnSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9mZWF0dXJlcy8yMDIxLzYvMTIvY2FtZXJvb25zLW5ldGZsaXgtYm9vc3QtYmlnLXdpbi1mb3ItZW5nbGlzaC1zcGVha2luZy1taW5vcml0eQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cameroon’s Netflix boost big win for English-speaking minority,"Number of Cameroonian films available on global streaming platform set to rise to four in coming days.

Yaounde Cameroon – This month marks another milestone for Cameroon’s growing film industry with two more movies set to premiere on Netflix.

A Man for the Weekend a romantic comedy about a career-driven woman asking a colleague to pose as her boyfriend for a family reunion is set to begin showing on the global platform on June 16. It will be followed by Broken the story of a woman running away from marriage while putting her father’s company and her reputation on the line on June 22.

The acquisitions bring to four the number of Cameroonian films on the United States-based streaming giant after Therapy and The Fisherman’s Diary became available earlier this year.

“I definitely knew this moment would come” said Ndamo Damarise who played Teacher Bihbih in The Fisherman’s Diary a critically acclaimed drama about a 12-year-old child called Ekah.

Inspired by Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai Ekah defies the odds to go to school in a fishing community where girl-child education is a taboo.

“I feel proud and elated to be part of this movement which hasn’t just gained global recognition but has inspired so many lives positively by addressing very sensitive and burning issues in our community” Damarise said.

‘We believed in our creativity’

The Fisherman’s Diary which was pre-selected in the 2021 Oscars attracted large international appeal for addressing the right to education.

It has won dozens of awards around the world including eight at the 2020 Golden Movie Awards Africa (GMAA) in Ghana and four at the International Film Festival of Ahmednagar in India including best film of 2021.

“We never ever saw ourselves getting this far” said Kang Quintus producer of The Fisherman’s Dairy. “It’s quite an achievement for Cameroon that every Cameroonian should be proud of.”

Impressively the film was shot in the coastal town of Limbe in 2019 during the peak of fighting in Cameroon’s Anglophone crisis which has been raging in its Northwest and Southwest regions.

“It was a huge challenge realising the project [in that context] given the insecurity – but we pulled through” said Quintus. “We were able to stay focused and believed in our creativity.”

Indeed the majority of Cameroonian films are produced in Cameroon’s Anglophone regions home to about 20 percent of the majority Francophone country’s 26 million people as well as to Silicon Mountain a nickname coined to represent the thriving tech ecosystem centred around the city of Buea.

All four movies acquired by Netflix have been produced by English-speaking Cameroonians.

“I wanted to produce a film that will be very impactful – a film that every community around the world can watch and relate to the story” said Quintus who received the film’s script in 2014 but only started working on it in 2019.

“I wasn’t ready then [in 2014]. I had to take my time to put together resources and the technical team” he said. “I was very confident when we started shooting the film – it was a very inspiring story.”

‘Opportunity meeting readiness’

The Netflix exposure is a major boost for Anglophone movie makers who have long struggled to find an international platform to distribute and showcase their creations.

Things began changing a few years ago when they started putting their content on Amazon Prime and some airlines.

Agbor Gilbert president of the Cameroon International Film Festival who has been in the movie business since 2005 is one of the key actors who knocked Netflix’s doors for Cameroonian films.

“Netflix had been refusing to acquire [English-language] Cameroonian films because Cameroon’s cinema was entirely under a French organisation called OCAPAC that works with the French civil law system in Francophone Africa” said Gilbert noting that Anglophone Cameroonians had not “set up a copyright system (under common law) that will protect their own distribution”.

“So I had meetings with Netflix officials so many times telling them that we [English-speaking Cameroonians] produce films – we are citizens of Cameroon but not French Cameroonians – we have our English systems so we should benefit from the Anglo-Saxon platforms in the world” said Gilbert.

“We even told them there are about four million Cameroonians in the US of which three million are Anglophones” he added.

“After front-and-back discussions Netflix said our claims were genuine. So the acquisitions were just a case of opportunity meeting readiness.”

Industry insiders are optimistic about the future of Cameroonian cinema pointing among others to the growing collaboration with Nigerian actors from the neighbouring country’s popular Nollywood industry. However some decry the lack of government policies that enable art to flourish.

“We were shooting a movie and we needed a courtroom in Buea” said Anurin Nwunembom director of Therapy who has been doing films since 2001.

“We negotiated for two weeks and it ended up failing. We went to Tiko [a coastal town also in the Southwest region]; it still failed so we had to sort a cultural centre” he added.

“Most officials refuse to understand the place of art. These people are educated enough to see what the culture and entertainment industry is doing for other countries.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdXByb3h4LmNvbS90di9tYW5pZmVzdC1uZXRmbGl4LW9uZS1vZi10aGUtd29yc3Qtc2hvd3Mtb24tdGVsZXZpc2lvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should You Watch 'Manifest' On Netflix? Read This First,"An NBC sci-fi series Manifest premiered on Netflix last week and it has already taken up residence among the streaming service’s most-watched movies and television shows according to Netflix’s own Top 10 chart (it held at number two all weekend according to my Netflix account). Netflix doesn’t license as much off-network content as it used to but despite having its own streamer in Peacock NBC clearly felt that Netflix could provide the show with a bigger audience while collecting tidy licensing fees to boot. The series which wrapped up its third season last week is also on the bubble and has not yet been renewed. How well it does on Netflix could factor into NBC’s decision to give it a fourth season or put the series out of its misery.

Warning: Manifest is not a good show. I should know. I have watched every episode and recapped each one for another outlet.

Its poor quality however is not entirely apparent from the pilot which was heavily hyped on NBC ahead of its fall debut in 2018. It’s a compelling premiere episode with a fascinating premise. It’s about the passengers of Flight 828 who left from Jamaica and arrived in New York City. However when the 191 passengers land they learn that five-and-a-half years had passed and that in the interim they were presumed dead by everyone else.

It seems like an obvious setup for a drama about passengers who must reintegrate into their lives after five years have passed and after many of their loved ones have moved on. However there’s only an inkling of that in the beginning. Yes when Ben Stone (Josh Dallas) returns his wife Grace (Athena Karkanis) has a new boyfriend and his daughter — who wasn’t on the flight — is now five years older than her twin brother who was on the flight but the family drama is dispatched with fairly early on (in fact the wife’s boyfriend played by Rescue Me‘s Daniel Sunjata inexplicably disappears from the series after a handful of episodes).

It’s a broadcast network television series so naturally it also attempts early on to take shape as a police procedural. Ben’s sister Michaela (Melissa Roxburgh) is an NYPD detective and she — like the other passengers on the flight — have “callings” (or visions) that aid her in solving crimes but that element of the series is eventually abandoned as well.

It’s not until the second season that Manifest figures out that it really wants to be a supernatural conspiracy thriller but even then the writers mostly seem to be making it up as they go along. It takes the better part of two seasons for a bare-bones mythology to even begin to take shape.

– The Stone family helps other passengers resolve their callings which usually entails saving someone from danger. However some of the more bizarre callings often appear to be hugely significant but are never referred to again. For instance at one point the Stone family creates a scene in their living room using a hockey net only to find themselves in a vision hundreds of years in the past on a ship out in the middle of the ocean looking up into the sky to see Flight 828 flying above them. The dramatic calling however is never explained or mentioned again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c3RsZS5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9zZWxlbmEtd3JpdGVycy1jYWxsLW91dC1uZXRmbGl4LWJ1ZGdldNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Selena' Writers Called Out Netflix's Budget For The Series & Their Pay,"Netflix had a chance at a win with Selena: The Series but now that Parts 1 and 2 have been released many of the writers have shared disappointment and frustration. A new Los Angeles Times article details how they felt their “work was cheapened” especially in comparison to other Netflix originals. A major point of contention is reportedly that the project was ordered as a Latin American production and thus given a relatively small budget that affected their pay.

“I feel like our work was cheapened from the start” Gladys Rodriguez a co-executive producer on the series told the Times. “We were never given a fair chance.”

The largely English-language series was not made as a U.S. original even though it would have made sense for it to have been. It follows the life and career of the late singer Selena Quintanilla-Pérez who became a cultural icon in the 1990s. While she was especially famous in Latin America she was a Mexican American born and raised in Texas and boasted a sizable following in the United States as well. A Netflix spokesperson however told the Times that it was the singer’s lasting popularity in Mexico that led the Latin American originals team to order the project to series.

Still Quintanilla-Pérez’s star status in the United States is significant even now — and Netflix viewership showed it at the beginning. In the first 28 days after Selena’s Dec. 24 premiere 25 million households watched it with half of those being U.S. viewers per Deadline. The show topped the U.S. top 10 list in its first week and it also cracked the corresponding lists in Mexico Argentina Colombia and Peru.

Yet the promising early numbers don’t seem to correspond well with the response to the series. Selena has just a 25% average Tomatometer score and its average audience score sits at 58% at the time of publishing. Showrunner Moisés Zamora said they made “an incredible show given what we were given” which was well below $2 million per episode according to the Times’ sources. Meanwhile some of Netflix’s highly acclaimed series such as Stranger Things and The Crown have budgets of $12 million and $13 million per episode according to Screen Rant.

The Selena budget impacted the minimum compensation rates writers could receive based on the Writers Guild of America’s rules per the Times. As a result they said they felt they were undercompensated and overworked. Rodriguez even said she has “a little bit of PTSD” from the experience. (Netflix told the outlet via a spokesperson that it believed the compensation was fair based on the quotes their U.S. representation negotiated.)

The budget was even questioned by fans on Twitter as far back as the show’s arrival on Netflix in December 2020. “The show was frankly given a budget that did not allow it to succeed” wrote one in part. Another tweeted “Netflix really didn’t give the Selena series the budget it deserved.” Still another wrote “Who decided the budget for the Selena series on Netflix..how y’all gonna do her like that.”

Despite the controversy the series did get approval from the Quintanilla family. Her father Abraham Quintanilla Jr. and sister Suzette Quintanilla both worked on it as executive producers. Additionally Suzette later told Entertainment Tonight that some scenes made her cry “because it literally was on point.”

Regardless of how everyone feels about the series now what Selena writers are hoping for moving forward is increased Latinx representation in movies and TV plus equal treatment. “My goal is to continue making the case that our stories are worth telling — they deserve as much as any other production” Zamora told the Times."

The essay heralds Rudd’s return to domestic politics after a self-imposed exile in the United States following his 2013 election defeat. “The Case for Courage” is part of Rudd’s broader campaign advocating for a royal commission into Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. However when asked at the essay’s Melbourne launch what such an inquiry would investigate he was strangely coy. Exhibiting uncharacteristic humility Rudd said it should be up to the legal experts to work through the terms. Although he conceded that he had been personally hurt by News Corp’s hostile coverage of his government Rudd seemed intent on not making his project seem like a personal crusade. Rudd has good reason to feel wronged. News Corp’s coverage of his response to the 2008 global financial crisis was pure spin. Rudd acted early providing stimulus checks directly to households in a move that helped Australia avoid a recession. But Murdoch media cast him as the leader whose reckless spending put an end to Australia’s budget surplus. Despite this Rudd and Labor are now employing the same anti-debt anti-deficit rhetoric to criticize the most recent Liberal budget. This is just one indication that Rudd’s “Fourth Way” as he calls it is indistinguishable from the Third Way that has led to Labor’s current malaise.

News Corp The nefarious role of Murdoch’s News Corp in moving the Australian polity to the right is an obsessive concern of Rudd’s as well as the liberals fawning over the ex–prime minister’s latest offering. For many liberals Murdoch embodies everything that is wrong with the world. This analysis of the malign influence of the Australian media is not original. Much of Rudd’s argument about how News Corp undermines democracy repeats the analysis Robert Manne made more forensically twenty years ago. Rudd characterizes News Corp as a company waging a psyops campaign aimed at manipulating voters who would otherwise flock to Labor: Their mission is simple: to so paralyze the people with fear that it induces a psychological reaction on the part of the voting public that cause them to cling to conservative politics under the illusion that by doing so certainty can somehow magically be restored. The problem with this analysis is that it takes two points for granted: first that News Corp wields enormous power and second that the company uses this power to keep the Australian Labor Party (ALP) out of power. However in Rudd’s home state of Queensland where Murdoch’s media ownership is most concentrated Labor has been electorally dominant in state politics since Joh Bjelke-Petersen left office in 1987. This suggests that News Corp’s main goal isn’t to shift voters. Time spent reading the Australian or the Herald Sun and watching Sky News will make it clear that these outlets are not really trying to persuade the electorate to support one party over another. Rather their aim is to set the agenda. Take News Corp’s campaign in the lead-up to the 2018 Victorian election about African gangs supposedly causing havoc in Melbourne. Rehashing every racist law and order trope didn’t swing many voters to the conservative alliance. But it did push Victorian politics to the right as Labor premier Daniel Andrews bent over backward to be seen as “tough on crime.” This is News Corp at its most dangerous: actively pandering to the far right setting the political agenda for the center-right and ensuring the center-left follows its orders.

Misunderstanding the Liberals In the remainder of Rudd’s essay he lays out his desired path to a Labor victory. Along this journey Labor must launch a negative campaign against the Liberals that accuses them of appropriating much of Labor’s economic program. Consequently the focus of Rudd’s criticism is on the moral rather than political shortcomings of his opponents. Labor according to Rudd is the natural home of anyone who doesn’t think of themselves as greedy corrupt and racist. “The Liberals’ overall ideological project is now almost literally bankrupt” Rudd proclaims. The reason for this he suggests is because the pandemic has forced Scott Morrison’s party to embrace big government. “By any measure” he continues the entire basis of the Liberal Party’s rolling campaigns against Labor’s fiscal stimulus debt and deficit deliberately aimed at fostering people’s anxiety fear and anger over “Labor’s economic mismanagement” has now been proven to have been a lie all along. Even staunch critics of Keynes like the US economist Robert Lucas conceded that everyone is a Keynesian in a foxhole. That doesn’t mean they have changed their tune for good. The deeper problem is that Rudd misunderstands the Liberals’ ideological project. In fact stimulus spending is perfectly in keeping with pro-business politics. Morrison’s 2020 spending packages largely socialized capital’s losses. What matters is not the amount of money the Liberals were willing to spend but how and where they directed these sums. They allowed large profitable businesses to claim JobKeeper support payments during the height of the pandemic. The New Daily reported that more than sixty publicly listed companies received JobKeeper and other handouts despite recording combined profits of more than $8.6 billion over the past eighteen months. Since April 2020 these businesses have funneled over $3.6 billion in dividends to investors. Meanwhile public services have not benefited from such unconditional generosity. In fact the government punitively barred universities from claiming JobKeeper even though they had to deal with huge losses because of the decline in foreign-student numbers. Arguing over the value of deficit spending diverts attention from the patently regressive nature of the Liberal relief measures.

Rudd’s Campaign Pitch Labor should be homing in on the contrast between Liberal profligacy in doling out money to big business and the austerity they apply to everyone else. The party could then run a positive campaign building on strong community sentiment in favor of rebuilding social services defending the public sector and reducing inequality. But this would require Labor to actually break with its four-decade-long commitment to neoliberal orthodoxy. Rudd is unable to provide a clear-eyed look at the real challenges his party faces. Instead he uses his misinterpretation of Liberal stimulus spending to justify his proposal for Labor’s negative campaign. “The marketing men of the Liberal Party” Rudd remarks “may seek to use the COVID-19 crisis to try to reinvent themselves as ‘Labor-lite.’” Rudd’s comments are particularly telling. They reveal his own sclerotic vision for Labor: an amorphous commitment to big government spending combined with an unwillingness to confront the interests of capital. Rudd masks the similarities between his own project — an accommodation with the Right — and that of the Liberals by dubbing it the “Fourth Way.” This perfectly captures the unimaginative vacuity and conservatism of his program. The former prime minister’s recipe for a prosperous future appears hollow when examined up close. Rudd’s program includes large-scale investment in STEM training “the creation of a critical mass in Australian venture capital funds” and a focus on developing “new technology industrials” like “AI big data and blockchain.” Basically the Third Way infused with a touch of Silicon Valley tech optimism. Rudd doesn’t like calling for the government to create jobs. Instead he proposes “a new National Jobs and Training Agency to provide retrenched or otherwise longer-term unemployed workers with a universal training guarantee for newly emerging industries.” This is almost indistinguishable from former Liberal PM Malcolm Turnbull’s vision of an “ideas boom.” With wages stagnant and unions still in decline Labor has lost much of its historic voting base. Unsurprisingly Rudd refuses to grapple with his party’s responsibility for these trends which date back to the 1983 Prices and Incomes Accord introduced by Labor PM Bob Hawke. Rudd’s preferred option is for Labor to broaden its base: For the Labor Party to secure 50-plus per cent of the two-party preferred vote in the future and a primary vote north of 40 per cent it must garner new levels of support from small business independent contractors and sole traders most of whom operate outside the traditional industrial relations system. This overlooks the fact that many independent contractors and sole traders operate outside of the traditional industrial-relations system because the system has failed them.

The tabloid’s blend of gossip and right-wing political coverage has made it Britain’s most widely read paper for more than four decades until the rival Daily Mail claimed the title last year.

Its editors have struggled to carve out a place for the paper in a new world of online news – trying a paywall model before abandoning it – and attempting to move on from a phone hacking scandal that blew up a decade ago damaging The Sun’s credibility as a campaigner for social causes.

News Corp said its cash flow forecasts for the Sun led it to book an impairment of £84 million pounds ($154 million) in 2020 according to its accounts published on Friday. The carrying value of its publishing rights and titles as of June 28 last year fell to zero from £112 million in 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL25ld3MvdGVjaC9taWNyb3NvZnQtd2lsbC1lbmQtd2luZG93cy0xMC1zdXBwb3J0LWluLW9jdG9iZXItMjUtbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLXdpbmRvd3MtY29taW5nLTM4Mzg5ODUuaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL3RlY2gvbWljcm9zb2Z0LXdpbGwtZW5kLXdpbmRvd3MtMTAtc3VwcG9ydC1pbi1vY3RvYmVyLTI1LW5leHQtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi13aW5kb3dzLWNvbWluZy0zODM4OTg1Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Will End Windows 10 Support in October 25: Next Generation Windows Coming?,"Microsoft has said that it will end support for Windows 10 in 2025. The company has updated its official documentation to reflect Windows 10 Pro and Home?s ?retirement? date. According to Microsoft?s support document for Windows 10 Home and Pro Microsoft Windows 10 Home Pro Pro Eduction and Pro for Workstations the current generation of Windows will retire on Octiber 24 2025. This suggests that all development and security updates for Windows 10 will be dropped completely by 2025. There is no word about Windows 10 Enterprise of Windows Server builds based on Windows 10. This comes soon after Microsoft CEO last month talked about the ?next generation of Windows? during Microsoft Build 2021 conference.

The Microsoft support page says that Microsoft will continue to support at least one Semi-Annual channel until October 14 2025. The page said that the change applies to all Home Pro Pro Education and Pro for Workstations editions of Windows 10. The developments in the recent days have all pointed towards a new generation of Microsoft Windows. While the company has not announced anything regarding Windows 11 (unconfirmed name) Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella during the company?s Build 2021 conference last month said that he has been testing the next generation of Windows since past few months.

Nadella during Build 2021 also pointed towards the new Windows App Store that Microsoft has been working on saying that it promises to unlock a better economy for developers and creators within Windows itself. Rumours have previously suggested that Microsoft may even allow third-party commerce platforms in apps so developers could avoid Microsoft’s 15 percent cut on apps and 12 percent commission on games.

The Mail is sharper the Star is wittier the Mirror more caring Metro cheaper (actually it’s free). Who needs the Sun any more? Who is it talking to? What is it trying to say? Even those producing it don’t seem sure.

After losing its confidence and its chutzpah it is losing circulation and cash at an alarming rate. Having dropped out of the Audit Bureau of Circulation remit (along with the Times and Sunday Times) just as the Mail overtook it as Britain’s biggest selling daily paper it now regards sales figures as a “commercial secret”. Finances are dire too. Last year the Sun and Sun on Sunday lost £200m compared with a loss of £68m the year before.

News Corp’s official audited reports published last August (*see below) don’t detail individual titles so we had to wait until this week for the News UK titles to release their figures – 50 weeks after the end of the financial year. They showed that while the Times and Sunday Times managed a pre-tax profit of £10m the Sun was in such a bad way that its value was written down to zero.

This financial meltdown is in turn leading to a “safety first” approach that is taking the zing out of editorial: “We simply cannot afford to lose money and sales by rocking boats” as one journalist put it. “We need to hang on to every penny we can get.”

And so Sun readers are offered an anodyne diet of stories about when they’ll be allowed to go to the pub soap star trivia and a slavish devotion to Johnson that irritates many staff. How did it come to this? Fear. The rabbit-in-headlights fear that paralyses.

Phone hacking (although to this day the company insists that it never happened at the Sun) and Operation Elveden which saw a clutch of journalists put on trial for paying public officials for stories coupled with wokeness are important factors. Training policy insists that journalists confirm that they have read and understood a strict code of conduct and editorial policies particularly on privacy while newly-hired diversity and equality monitors assess journalistic output.

There is a belief on high at London Bridge headquarters doubtless rammed home from the higher-ups in New York that the world is changing and News UK must change with it. That all sounds laudable but there is a commercial aspect: with a desperate struggle to keep advertising revenue the last thing the firm wants is for the Sun to get embroiled in a Twitterstorm that will provoke a woke backlash and spook advertisers.

But surely every newspaper should be operating under these sorts of standards? Yes but successful papers – as exemplified by the Mail – are still willing to go out on a limb to challenge the powers-that-be; the Sun is running scared. As one journalist said: “If you constantly ram down the throats of reporters that they will carry the can if things go wrong it hardly encourages anyone to push the envelope in cracking an important story. Remember this is the company that handed over its own journalists to the police. If it goes pear-shaped we can expect no support from Murdoch.”

Ah Murdoch. The Sun King. The ultimate media magnate. Everyone conflates News UK Fox News Corp et al with Rupert Murdoch: Fox faces billion-dollar lawsuits = “Rupert’s in trouble”; the New York Post is accused of publishing fake news = “Murdoch propaganda”. Times Radio is tanking = “Murdoch’s lost his touch”. But how much is he involved? If parts of his empire are crumbling is it his absence or his lingering presence that poses the bigger problem?

Take Andrew Neil’s GB News television network for example. It goes on air next week while News UK’s TV station which would have aimed at the same Fox-style right-of-centre market has been pulled – or at least reduced to a limited streaming service – at the last minute.

This is so un-Rupert. After a lifetime spoiling for a fight with the BBC to invest in studios expensive star hirings and then walk away just at the moment the Beeb is on its knees over Bashir is extraordinary.

But it may also be the key to why things are going wrong. Murdoch’s USP has always been his daring decisiveness taking huge risks on seemingly extravagant ventures and deals – even jeopardising the entire corporation as he did with BskyB. But that has gone; the wheeler-dealing days seemingly over. There have been a welter of multimillion media deals in the past month involving the likes of Verizon Amazon Buzzfeed Forbes and the New York Times but where was Murdoch? Fox (the broadcasting business the family kept when it sold 21st Century Fox to Disney) bought a small sports site but his businesses were nowhere near the big action.

Selling rather than buying seems to be the name of the game these days as 90-year-old Rupert spends his days quietly in the Oxfordshire countryside with wife Jerry. He doesn’t even make those daily nerve-stretching calls to editors any more – they are now more likely to come from News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson.

Which all takes us into the realms of the HBO series Succession with the suits and siblings having different ideas from the grand old man of what the company should be and who should run it. Without a clear future strategy the Murdoch empire could be ripe for the picking once the emperor finally leaves the stage.

Green son James has abandoned the business over climate change daughter Elisabeth has her own TV enterprises and heir-apparent Lachlan has gone walkabout in Australia although he still runs Fox. That leaves former Times and Wall Street Journal editor Thomson calling the shots from New York and former News of the World and Sun editor Rebekah Brooks running the show in Britain. Murdoch regards both almost as family – he gave Brooks away at her wedding and with her at his side famously answered “this one” when asked what his top priority was when the hacking scandal erupted.

They may harbour ambitions for even greater power (although Elisabeth may have other ideas about Rebekah having told her she’d “****ed the company”) but even though both ran Murdoch newspapers the portfolio might still be vulnerable in either of their hands. Neither has the ink running through their veins as Murdoch does; they inhabit the digital age.

Today’s News Corp is a very different beast from the one Rupert created and nurtured. Lumped together across three continents “news media” may still be the biggest generator of income but Dow Jones video streaming and even online real estate services are of increasing importance. And the newspapers are morphing. The message in last year’s annual report was clear: “digital-first brings cost reductions”; Australian “storied print editions” – that means local papers – are closed; “digital reincarnation of titles” is the objective.

Dear old Rupert was so slow to pick up on the internet and when he did he didn’t know what to do with it. Look at the Sun’s “strategy” – probably too strong a word – as articulated by one who lived through it: “First it was treated as a poor relation to the printed paper. Then it went behind a paywall – disaster. Then the paywall was dropped and the idea was that the website would drive people into buying the printed paper. But this is not how the market works. Nobody reads Sun Online for free and then says ‘I must rush out and buy a printed copy’. Meanwhile Associated had worked all this out from the start and MailOnline was romping out of sight.”

News Corp now claims that the Sun is the UK’s most-read online news brand. Indeed it is if you ignore the BBC and if the measure is “monthly unique visitors”. Even then it is being challenged by the Mirror. But both trail the Mail Guardian and Express by other metrics. There are so many measuring sticks – print sales subscriptions unique users monthly visits – that it’s like juggling apples and oranges. And anyway even by its chosen yardstick the Sun had shrunk from 164m to 119m viewers over the year to March.

The Times and Sunday Times are having more success with their subscription models so that after decades of being propped up by a couple of swaggering redtops they now provide the crutches for their surviving but wounded tabloid stablemate.

So what does the future hold? The first indicator could come with a change of editor at the Times. John Witherow who has occupied the chair first at the Sunday and then the daily since 1994 will be 70 in January so retirement does not seem an unreasonable notion. Brooks is said to have some people in mind but favourite must be 57-year-old Tony Gallagher whose CV includes being deputy editor at the Mail and editor of the Telegraph. As one observer asked: Why else would he have moved from editing the Sun to be No 2 at the Times?

The titles seem secure because they are influential brand assets like the current Dow Jones/Wall Street Journal golden goose. Still they are almost bound to go “digital first” and most likely merge into seven-day publishing with all the attendant cost savings – providing legal hurdles can be overcome possibly with the help of a friendly government. If this is on the cards for the next two or three years it – along with the nobbling of the BBC and attempts to tame Facebook and Google – may be the explanation for the cult of Boris.

After all Murdoch has always been the loudest cheerleader for those he backs – and from whom he wants a business or political favour. Hurrah for Maggie! (Sky); Hurrah for Blair! (don’t join the euro); Hurrah for Dave! (Brexit referendum).

As to the Sun? It is doubtless seen in New York as all pain and no gain but it’s Rupert’s baby and so as long as he breathes it’s probably safe.

In a way the paper has become a metaphor for the man himself: badly under-estimated at the start it enjoyed explosive growth through brash brilliance and bravado surviving big setbacks along the way. But then misjudgments crept in and it started to run out of steam as rivals seized modern technology it didn’t understand and eclipsed it. Now it faces a twilight of dependency on any patent remedy that might eke out a few more years before the inevitable final sunset.

They may be monsters but we’ll miss them when that day comes.

NEWS CORP BY NUMBERS

The Sun made a pre-tax loss of £201m last year with phone hacking payments reaching almost £90m according to figures released on Friday and the value of the paper has been written down to zero.

News Corp’s financial year runs from July 1 to June 30 so these figures are 50 weeks out of date and there may be even worse news around the corner.

The News Corp annual report was published last August showing the performance of the company’s various divisions which it calls “segments”. Dow Jones and with it the Wall Street Journal were given their own segment last year “in the interests of transparency” while all other newspapers and radio stations are lumped together under the banner “News Media”.

Circulation/subscription figures are given for individual titles but when it comes to finances the segment is sub-divided by national company so that until the Sun released its figures today it was impossible to see which title was responsible for which gains/losses.

The annual report says that the Sun’s paid circulation averaged 1.09m between January and June 2020 according to “internal sources”. The figure for the Sun on Sunday was 934000 for the Sunday Times 610000 and for The Times 322000. The report highlights the increase in Times subscriptions and describes the Sun as the leading online news brand with 164m unique monthly visitors. By the March quarterly report that had fallen to 119m.

News UK employed 4500 staff. Today’s Sun release shows that the paper had 546 staff in June last year down from 605 the previous year. Directors were paid a total of £4.6m and the highest-paid director – almost certainly chief executive Rebekah Brooks – received £2.4m.

Phone hacking categorised in News Corp reports as “UK newspaper matters” arising out of “certain conduct at the News of the World” cost £88.7m in compensation and costs – and there is no end in sight. Claims are still being settled – only yesterday a further payment was made to former Lib Dem MP Simon Hughes relating to a Sun splash. This is significant since Hughes had already received a pay-out over a News of the World story and the company has always maintained that there was no hacking at the Sun.

News UK revenue for the year was $898m* down $134m (13%) on 2019 and circulation and subscription revenue fell by $34m “primarily” because of falling sales of the Sun.

Subsequent quarterly reports show that News Media income across the UK US and Australia fell by between 25% and 33% compared with the same periods in the previous year but this is not broken down by country.

Figures for the Times and Sunday Times published simultaneously suggest that the editors John Witherow Martin Ivens and his successor Emma Tucker – along with accountant Michael Gill – were paid £3.2m between them.

*As an American-based business News Corp publishes its figures in dollars; the News UK figures are in sterling.

The essay heralds Rudd’s return to domestic politics after a self-imposed exile in the United States following his 2013 election defeat. “The Case for Courage” is part of Rudd’s broader campaign advocating for a royal commission into Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. However when asked at the essay’s Melbourne launch what such an inquiry would investigate he was strangely coy. Exhibiting uncharacteristic humility Rudd said it should be up to the legal experts to work through the terms. Although he conceded that he had been personally hurt by News Corp’s hostile coverage of his government Rudd seemed intent on not making his project seem like a personal crusade. Rudd has good reason to feel wronged. News Corp’s coverage of his response to the 2008 global financial crisis was pure spin. Rudd acted early providing stimulus checks directly to households in a move that helped Australia avoid a recession. But Murdoch media cast him as the leader whose reckless spending put an end to Australia’s budget surplus. Despite this Rudd and Labor are now employing the same anti-debt anti-deficit rhetoric to criticize the most recent Liberal budget. This is just one indication that Rudd’s “Fourth Way” as he calls it is indistinguishable from the Third Way that has led to Labor’s current malaise.

News Corp The nefarious role of Murdoch’s News Corp in moving the Australian polity to the right is an obsessive concern of Rudd’s as well as the liberals fawning over the ex–prime minister’s latest offering. For many liberals Murdoch embodies everything that is wrong with the world. This analysis of the malign influence of the Australian media is not original. Much of Rudd’s argument about how News Corp undermines democracy repeats the analysis Robert Manne made more forensically twenty years ago. Rudd characterizes News Corp as a company waging a psyops campaign aimed at manipulating voters who would otherwise flock to Labor: Their mission is simple: to so paralyze the people with fear that it induces a psychological reaction on the part of the voting public that cause them to cling to conservative politics under the illusion that by doing so certainty can somehow magically be restored. The problem with this analysis is that it takes two points for granted: first that News Corp wields enormous power and second that the company uses this power to keep the Australian Labor Party (ALP) out of power. However in Rudd’s home state of Queensland where Murdoch’s media ownership is most concentrated Labor has been electorally dominant in state politics since Joh Bjelke-Petersen left office in 1987. This suggests that News Corp’s main goal isn’t to shift voters. Time spent reading the Australian or the Herald Sun and watching Sky News will make it clear that these outlets are not really trying to persuade the electorate to support one party over another. Rather their aim is to set the agenda. Take News Corp’s campaign in the lead-up to the 2018 Victorian election about African gangs supposedly causing havoc in Melbourne. Rehashing every racist law and order trope didn’t swing many voters to the conservative alliance. But it did push Victorian politics to the right as Labor premier Daniel Andrews bent over backward to be seen as “tough on crime.” This is News Corp at its most dangerous: actively pandering to the far right setting the political agenda for the center-right and ensuring the center-left follows its orders.

Misunderstanding the Liberals In the remainder of Rudd’s essay he lays out his desired path to a Labor victory. Along this journey Labor must launch a negative campaign against the Liberals that accuses them of appropriating much of Labor’s economic program. Consequently the focus of Rudd’s criticism is on the moral rather than political shortcomings of his opponents. Labor according to Rudd is the natural home of anyone who doesn’t think of themselves as greedy corrupt and racist. “The Liberals’ overall ideological project is now almost literally bankrupt” Rudd proclaims. The reason for this he suggests is because the pandemic has forced Scott Morrison’s party to embrace big government. “By any measure” he continues the entire basis of the Liberal Party’s rolling campaigns against Labor’s fiscal stimulus debt and deficit deliberately aimed at fostering people’s anxiety fear and anger over “Labor’s economic mismanagement” has now been proven to have been a lie all along. Even staunch critics of Keynes like the US economist Robert Lucas conceded that everyone is a Keynesian in a foxhole. That doesn’t mean they have changed their tune for good. The deeper problem is that Rudd misunderstands the Liberals’ ideological project. In fact stimulus spending is perfectly in keeping with pro-business politics. Morrison’s 2020 spending packages largely socialized capital’s losses. What matters is not the amount of money the Liberals were willing to spend but how and where they directed these sums. They allowed large profitable businesses to claim JobKeeper support payments during the height of the pandemic. The New Daily reported that more than sixty publicly listed companies received JobKeeper and other handouts despite recording combined profits of more than $8.6 billion over the past eighteen months. Since April 2020 these businesses have funneled over $3.6 billion in dividends to investors. Meanwhile public services have not benefited from such unconditional generosity. In fact the government punitively barred universities from claiming JobKeeper even though they had to deal with huge losses because of the decline in foreign-student numbers. Arguing over the value of deficit spending diverts attention from the patently regressive nature of the Liberal relief measures.

Rudd’s Campaign Pitch Labor should be homing in on the contrast between Liberal profligacy in doling out money to big business and the austerity they apply to everyone else. The party could then run a positive campaign building on strong community sentiment in favor of rebuilding social services defending the public sector and reducing inequality. But this would require Labor to actually break with its four-decade-long commitment to neoliberal orthodoxy. Rudd is unable to provide a clear-eyed look at the real challenges his party faces. Instead he uses his misinterpretation of Liberal stimulus spending to justify his proposal for Labor’s negative campaign. “The marketing men of the Liberal Party” Rudd remarks “may seek to use the COVID-19 crisis to try to reinvent themselves as ‘Labor-lite.’” Rudd’s comments are particularly telling. They reveal his own sclerotic vision for Labor: an amorphous commitment to big government spending combined with an unwillingness to confront the interests of capital. Rudd masks the similarities between his own project — an accommodation with the Right — and that of the Liberals by dubbing it the “Fourth Way.” This perfectly captures the unimaginative vacuity and conservatism of his program. The former prime minister’s recipe for a prosperous future appears hollow when examined up close. Rudd’s program includes large-scale investment in STEM training “the creation of a critical mass in Australian venture capital funds” and a focus on developing “new technology industrials” like “AI big data and blockchain.” Basically the Third Way infused with a touch of Silicon Valley tech optimism. Rudd doesn’t like calling for the government to create jobs. Instead he proposes “a new National Jobs and Training Agency to provide retrenched or otherwise longer-term unemployed workers with a universal training guarantee for newly emerging industries.” This is almost indistinguishable from former Liberal PM Malcolm Turnbull’s vision of an “ideas boom.” With wages stagnant and unions still in decline Labor has lost much of its historic voting base. Unsurprisingly Rudd refuses to grapple with his party’s responsibility for these trends which date back to the 1983 Prices and Incomes Accord introduced by Labor PM Bob Hawke. Rudd’s preferred option is for Labor to broaden its base: For the Labor Party to secure 50-plus per cent of the two-party preferred vote in the future and a primary vote north of 40 per cent it must garner new levels of support from small business independent contractors and sole traders most of whom operate outside the traditional industrial relations system. This overlooks the fact that many independent contractors and sole traders operate outside of the traditional industrial-relations system because the system has failed them. Loopholes in employment law have allowed businesses to strip workers of the rights afforded to full-time workers by classifying them as contractors. The gig economy is the most obvious example of this. A person who works fifty hours a week driving a rideshare vehicle is considered self-employed and therefore not entitled to even the most basic employment rights.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIxMDYxMzAwNTAyMi9lbi9Xb3JsZC1jbGFzcy1Xb21lbi1FeGVjdXRpdmVzLVNob3J0bGlzdGVkLWluLVdlUXVhbC1Bc2lhLVBhY2lmaWMtQXdhcmRzLWZvci1Qb3RlbnRpYWwtQy1zdWl0ZS1MZWFkZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World-class Women Executives Shortlisted in WeQual Asia-Pacific Awards for Potential C-suite Leaders,"Twenty-four female executives have been recognised by the WeQual Awards 2021 for their outstanding contribution to business from some of the biggest companies in the Asia-Pacific region.

The tabloid’s blend of gossip and right-wing political coverage has made it Britain’s most widely read paper for more than four decades until the rival Daily Mail claimed the title last year.

Its editors have struggled to carve out a place for the paper in a new world of online news – trying a paywall model before abandoning it – and attempting to move on from a phone hacking scandal that blew up a decade ago damaging The Sun’s credibility as a campaigner for social causes.

News Corp said its cash flow forecasts for the Sun led it to book an impairment of £84 million pounds ($154 million) in 2020 according to its accounts published on Friday. The carrying value of its publishing rights and titles as of June 28 last year fell to zero from £112 million in 2019.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL25ld3MvdGVjaC9taWNyb3NvZnQtd2lsbC1lbmQtd2luZG93cy0xMC1zdXBwb3J0LWluLW9jdG9iZXItMjUtbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLXdpbmRvd3MtY29taW5nLTM4Mzg5ODUuaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL3RlY2gvbWljcm9zb2Z0LXdpbGwtZW5kLXdpbmRvd3MtMTAtc3VwcG9ydC1pbi1vY3RvYmVyLTI1LW5leHQtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi13aW5kb3dzLWNvbWluZy0zODM4OTg1Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Will End Windows 10 Support in October 25: Next Generation Windows Coming?,"Microsoft has said that it will end support for Windows 10 in 2025. The company has updated its official documentation to reflect Windows 10 Pro and Home?s ?retirement? date. According to Microsoft?s support document for Windows 10 Home and Pro Microsoft Windows 10 Home Pro Pro Eduction and Pro for Workstations the current generation of Windows will retire on Octiber 24 2025. This suggests that all development and security updates for Windows 10 will be dropped completely by 2025. There is no word about Windows 10 Enterprise of Windows Server builds based on Windows 10. This comes soon after Microsoft CEO last month talked about the ?next generation of Windows? during Microsoft Build 2021 conference.

The Microsoft support page says that Microsoft will continue to support at least one Semi-Annual channel until October 14 2025. The page said that the change applies to all Home Pro Pro Education and Pro for Workstations editions of Windows 10. The developments in the recent days have all pointed towards a new generation of Microsoft Windows. While the company has not announced anything regarding Windows 11 (unconfirmed name) Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella during the company?s Build 2021 conference last month said that he has been testing the next generation of Windows since past few months.

Nadella during Build 2021 also pointed towards the new Windows App Store that Microsoft has been working on saying that it promises to unlock a better economy for developers and creators within Windows itself. Rumours have previously suggested that Microsoft may even allow third-party commerce platforms in apps so developers could avoid Microsoft’s 15 percent cut on apps and 12 percent commission on games.

The Mail is sharper the Star is wittier the Mirror more caring Metro cheaper (actually it’s free). Who needs the Sun any more? Who is it talking to? What is it trying to say? Even those producing it don’t seem sure.

After losing its confidence and its chutzpah it is losing circulation and cash at an alarming rate. Having dropped out of the Audit Bureau of Circulation remit (along with the Times and Sunday Times) just as the Mail overtook it as Britain’s biggest selling daily paper it now regards sales figures as a “commercial secret”. Finances are dire too. Last year the Sun and Sun on Sunday lost £200m compared with a loss of £68m the year before.

News Corp’s official audited reports published last August (*see below) don’t detail individual titles so we had to wait until this week for the News UK titles to release their figures – 50 weeks after the end of the financial year. They showed that while the Times and Sunday Times managed a pre-tax profit of £10m the Sun was in such a bad way that its value was written down to zero.

This financial meltdown is in turn leading to a “safety first” approach that is taking the zing out of editorial: “We simply cannot afford to lose money and sales by rocking boats” as one journalist put it. “We need to hang on to every penny we can get.”

And so Sun readers are offered an anodyne diet of stories about when they’ll be allowed to go to the pub soap star trivia and a slavish devotion to Johnson that irritates many staff. How did it come to this? Fear. The rabbit-in-headlights fear that paralyses.

Phone hacking (although to this day the company insists that it never happened at the Sun) and Operation Elveden which saw a clutch of journalists put on trial for paying public officials for stories coupled with wokeness are important factors. Training policy insists that journalists confirm that they have read and understood a strict code of conduct and editorial policies particularly on privacy while newly-hired diversity and equality monitors assess journalistic output.

There is a belief on high at London Bridge headquarters doubtless rammed home from the higher-ups in New York that the world is changing and News UK must change with it. That all sounds laudable but there is a commercial aspect: with a desperate struggle to keep advertising revenue the last thing the firm wants is for the Sun to get embroiled in a Twitterstorm that will provoke a woke backlash and spook advertisers.

But surely every newspaper should be operating under these sorts of standards? Yes but successful papers – as exemplified by the Mail – are still willing to go out on a limb to challenge the powers-that-be; the Sun is running scared. As one journalist said: “If you constantly ram down the throats of reporters that they will carry the can if things go wrong it hardly encourages anyone to push the envelope in cracking an important story. Remember this is the company that handed over its own journalists to the police. If it goes pear-shaped we can expect no support from Murdoch.”

Ah Murdoch. The Sun King. The ultimate media magnate. Everyone conflates News UK Fox News Corp et al with Rupert Murdoch: Fox faces billion-dollar lawsuits = “Rupert’s in trouble”; the New York Post is accused of publishing fake news = “Murdoch propaganda”. Times Radio is tanking = “Murdoch’s lost his touch”. But how much is he involved? If parts of his empire are crumbling is it his absence or his lingering presence that poses the bigger problem?

Take Andrew Neil’s GB News television network for example. It goes on air next week while News UK’s TV station which would have aimed at the same Fox-style right-of-centre market has been pulled – or at least reduced to a limited streaming service – at the last minute.

This is so un-Rupert. After a lifetime spoiling for a fight with the BBC to invest in studios expensive star hirings and then walk away just at the moment the Beeb is on its knees over Bashir is extraordinary.

But it may also be the key to why things are going wrong. Murdoch’s USP has always been his daring decisiveness taking huge risks on seemingly extravagant ventures and deals – even jeopardising the entire corporation as he did with BskyB. But that has gone; the wheeler-dealing days seemingly over. There have been a welter of multimillion media deals in the past month involving the likes of Verizon Amazon Buzzfeed Forbes and the New York Times but where was Murdoch? Fox (the broadcasting business the family kept when it sold 21st Century Fox to Disney) bought a small sports site but his businesses were nowhere near the big action.

Selling rather than buying seems to be the name of the game these days as 90-year-old Rupert spends his days quietly in the Oxfordshire countryside with wife Jerry. He doesn’t even make those daily nerve-stretching calls to editors any more – they are now more likely to come from News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson.

Which all takes us into the realms of the HBO series Succession with the suits and siblings having different ideas from the grand old man of what the company should be and who should run it. Without a clear future strategy the Murdoch empire could be ripe for the picking once the emperor finally leaves the stage.

Green son James has abandoned the business over climate change daughter Elisabeth has her own TV enterprises and heir-apparent Lachlan has gone walkabout in Australia although he still runs Fox. That leaves former Times and Wall Street Journal editor Thomson calling the shots from New York and former News of the World and Sun editor Rebekah Brooks running the show in Britain. Murdoch regards both almost as family – he gave Brooks away at her wedding and with her at his side famously answered “this one” when asked what his top priority was when the hacking scandal erupted.

They may harbour ambitions for even greater power (although Elisabeth may have other ideas about Rebekah having told her she’d “****ed the company”) but even though both ran Murdoch newspapers the portfolio might still be vulnerable in either of their hands. Neither has the ink running through their veins as Murdoch does; they inhabit the digital age.

Today’s News Corp is a very different beast from the one Rupert created and nurtured. Lumped together across three continents “news media” may still be the biggest generator of income but Dow Jones video streaming and even online real estate services are of increasing importance. And the newspapers are morphing. The message in last year’s annual report was clear: “digital-first brings cost reductions”; Australian “storied print editions” – that means local papers – are closed; “digital reincarnation of titles” is the objective.

Dear old Rupert was so slow to pick up on the internet and when he did he didn’t know what to do with it. Look at the Sun’s “strategy” – probably too strong a word – as articulated by one who lived through it: “First it was treated as a poor relation to the printed paper. Then it went behind a paywall – disaster. Then the paywall was dropped and the idea was that the website would drive people into buying the printed paper. But this is not how the market works. Nobody reads Sun Online for free and then says ‘I must rush out and buy a printed copy’. Meanwhile Associated had worked all this out from the start and MailOnline was romping out of sight.”

News Corp now claims that the Sun is the UK’s most-read online news brand. Indeed it is if you ignore the BBC and if the measure is “monthly unique visitors”. Even then it is being challenged by the Mirror. But both trail the Mail Guardian and Express by other metrics. There are so many measuring sticks – print sales subscriptions unique users monthly visits – that it’s like juggling apples and oranges. And anyway even by its chosen yardstick the Sun had shrunk from 164m to 119m viewers over the year to March.

The Times and Sunday Times are having more success with their subscription models so that after decades of being propped up by a couple of swaggering redtops they now provide the crutches for their surviving but wounded tabloid stablemate.

So what does the future hold? The first indicator could come with a change of editor at the Times. John Witherow who has occupied the chair first at the Sunday and then the daily since 1994 will be 70 in January so retirement does not seem an unreasonable notion. Brooks is said to have some people in mind but favourite must be 57-year-old Tony Gallagher whose CV includes being deputy editor at the Mail and editor of the Telegraph. As one observer asked: Why else would he have moved from editing the Sun to be No 2 at the Times?

The titles seem secure because they are influential brand assets like the current Dow Jones/Wall Street Journal golden goose. Still they are almost bound to go “digital first” and most likely merge into seven-day publishing with all the attendant cost savings – providing legal hurdles can be overcome possibly with the help of a friendly government. If this is on the cards for the next two or three years it – along with the nobbling of the BBC and attempts to tame Facebook and Google – may be the explanation for the cult of Boris.

After all Murdoch has always been the loudest cheerleader for those he backs – and from whom he wants a business or political favour. Hurrah for Maggie! (Sky); Hurrah for Blair! (don’t join the euro); Hurrah for Dave! (Brexit referendum).

As to the Sun? It is doubtless seen in New York as all pain and no gain but it’s Rupert’s baby and so as long as he breathes it’s probably safe.

In a way the paper has become a metaphor for the man himself: badly under-estimated at the start it enjoyed explosive growth through brash brilliance and bravado surviving big setbacks along the way. But then misjudgments crept in and it started to run out of steam as rivals seized modern technology it didn’t understand and eclipsed it. Now it faces a twilight of dependency on any patent remedy that might eke out a few more years before the inevitable final sunset.

They may be monsters but we’ll miss them when that day comes.

NEWS CORP BY NUMBERS

The Sun made a pre-tax loss of £201m last year with phone hacking payments reaching almost £90m according to figures released on Friday and the value of the paper has been written down to zero.

News Corp’s financial year runs from July 1 to June 30 so these figures are 50 weeks out of date and there may be even worse news around the corner.

The News Corp annual report was published last August showing the performance of the company’s various divisions which it calls “segments”. Dow Jones and with it the Wall Street Journal were given their own segment last year “in the interests of transparency” while all other newspapers and radio stations are lumped together under the banner “News Media”.

Circulation/subscription figures are given for individual titles but when it comes to finances the segment is sub-divided by national company so that until the Sun released its figures today it was impossible to see which title was responsible for which gains/losses.

The annual report says that the Sun’s paid circulation averaged 1.09m between January and June 2020 according to “internal sources”. The figure for the Sun on Sunday was 934000 for the Sunday Times 610000 and for The Times 322000. The report highlights the increase in Times subscriptions and describes the Sun as the leading online news brand with 164m unique monthly visitors. By the March quarterly report that had fallen to 119m.

News UK employed 4500 staff. Today’s Sun release shows that the paper had 546 staff in June last year down from 605 the previous year. Directors were paid a total of £4.6m and the highest-paid director – almost certainly chief executive Rebekah Brooks – received £2.4m.

Phone hacking categorised in News Corp reports as “UK newspaper matters” arising out of “certain conduct at the News of the World” cost £88.7m in compensation and costs – and there is no end in sight. Claims are still being settled – only yesterday a further payment was made to former Lib Dem MP Simon Hughes relating to a Sun splash. This is significant since Hughes had already received a pay-out over a News of the World story and the company has always maintained that there was no hacking at the Sun.

News UK revenue for the year was $898m* down $134m (13%) on 2019 and circulation and subscription revenue fell by $34m “primarily” because of falling sales of the Sun.

Subsequent quarterly reports show that News Media income across the UK US and Australia fell by between 25% and 33% compared with the same periods in the previous year but this is not broken down by country.

Figures for the Times and Sunday Times published simultaneously suggest that the editors John Witherow Martin Ivens and his successor Emma Tucker – along with accountant Michael Gill – were paid £3.2m between them.

*As an American-based business News Corp publishes its figures in dollars; the News UK figures are in sterling.

The electric grid is one of the most important pieces of infrastructure in the country. It currently connects more than 9200 power-generating units over 600000 miles of transmission lines. These lines are essential in getting electricity transported to our homes and businesses. Because of the importance of electricity to our daily lives grid failures can have catastrophic consequences. That's why companies are investing heavily in upgrading this critical infrastructure.

Three companies working hard to build the next-generation grid are Brookfield Renewable (BEP 2.05%) (BEPC 1.22%) NextEra Energy (NEE 1.25%) and Xcel Energy (XEL -0.16%). Here's why those investments could pay big dividends for their investors over the coming years.

Providing support to both ends of the grid

Brookfield Renewable doesn't operate the power transmission lines that make up the electrical grid. Instead it focuses on investing in two other types of assets that will enhance the grid's reliability. First it's a leader in owning operating and developing distributed generation (DG) projects. These are off-grid power-producing assets like rooftop solar and battery storage. Thus it enables end-users to generate power closer to the source reducing the load on the power grid.

Brookfield also operates large-scale energy storage assets like pumped storage. These facilities provide critical grid-stabilizing services by supplying power when other facilities are offline. For example it delivers backup capacity to address the intermittency of greener electricity grids handling energy produced by wind- and solar-generating facilities.

The company's investments to expand those two business lines will help give Brookfield Renewable the power to grow its earnings at a double-digit annual rate in the coming years. That should support its plan to increase its dividend by around 5% to 9% per year.

Building a leading grid operator

NextEra Energy is one of the largest utilities in the country. It operates two electric utilities in Florida an electricity-generating business that happens to be the world's largest wind and solar power producer and a leading transmission business. NextEra Energy Transmission integrates renewable energy and strengthens the electricity grid.

It built this leading business via acquisition and development projects. For example earlier this year it acquired GridLiance for $660 million adding 700 miles of high-voltage transmission lines across six states. Meanwhile in 2019 it bought the Trans Bay Cable a 53-mile underwater transmission system that supplies more than 40% of the power used in San Francisco. It also won approval last year to build a new transmission line in Western New York to ease grid congestion and maximize the delivery of renewable energy in the region. Overall NextEra is becoming a leader in building the next-generation grid designed to handle increased loads from renewable energy.

Those investments will help power NextEra's growth plan to expand its earnings per share at a 6% to 8% annual rate through 2023. That could support dividend growth of around 10% through next year.

Rapidly expanding its grid

Xcel Energy operates one of the fastest-growing investor-owned transmission systems. It has more than 20000 miles of transmission lines across 10 states.

The utility is investing heavily to expand its transmission business to help support increased renewable energy deployment. Overall the company is investing $24.3 billion through 2025 to expand its operations with 25% of that spending earmarked for electric transmission projects. One notable project is the proposed Colorado Pathway Transmission expansion. Xcel could invest up to $1.7 billion to build 560 miles of transmission lines that could support roughly 5.5 gigawatts of new renewable power generation.

Those transmission-related investments will help power Xcel's plan to grow its earnings per share at a 5% to 7% annual rate over the coming years. That should support similar yearly increases in its 2.6%-yielding dividend.

Building the future of energy

The global economy is switching power sources from fossil fuels to renewable energy. That will require a significant investment to upgrade the power grid. While many companies stand to benefit from this megatrend Brookfield Renewable NextEra Energy and Xcel Energy are great options for investors. That's because their investments should pay immediate benefits to shareholders via steadily rising dividends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFvbC5jb20vZWxvbi1tdXNrLXNheXMtdGVzbGEtYWNjZXB0LTEwMjAzOTUwNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk says Tesla will accept Bitcoin payments again once miners use 50% clean energy,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Chris Saucedo/Getty Images for SXSW

Elon Musk said Tesla would accept Bitcoin payments again once ""mining"" uses 50% renewable energy.

Validating Bitcoin transactions requires lots of computers to use vast amounts of energy.

Tesla started accepting Bitcoin in March then stopped in May citing environmental concerns.

Tesla will resume accepting bitcoin payments for its cars once miners of the cryptocurrency can show they are using roughly 50% clean energy CEO Elon Musk said in a tweet on Sunday.

""When there's confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions"" he said. This is the first time Musk has detailed the conditions where the company would start accepting Bitcoin again.

Musk announced in March that Tesla would accept payment in Bitcoin then reversed this position in May when he said the company would no longer accept Bitcoin because is was too environmentally costly to mine the cryptocurrency. He said at the time that Tesla intended to use Bitcoin again in future ""as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy.""

Musk's Sunday tweet caused the price of Bitcoin to jump to almost $40000. His tweet was a response to a Cointelegraph article that contained quotes from Magda Wierzycka the CEO of asset manager Sygnia. Wierzycka said Musk had deliberately pumped up the price of Bitcoin so Tesla could sell off a big chunk of it. Musk disputed this.

""This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market"" Musk said. He said in April that Tesla had sold 10% of its Bitcoin holdings to prove it was a viable alternative to cash.

The electric-car maker bought $1.5 billion of Bitcoin in February.

Bitcoin uses a ""proof of work"" computing process to validate transactions on its blockchain which requires lots of computers to use vast amounts of energy. Estimates on how much renewable energy Bitcoin miners use to power their computers vary widely but according to Cambridge University 65% of Bitcoin mining takes place in China where coal is the most common type of energy production.

Here are Classic Trains editors’ picks for the five best Southern trains.

Crescent

Introduced on April 26 1925 the Crescent Limited ran between New Orleans Mobile Atlanta Washington and New York. The train was operated by the Louisville & Nashville West Point Route Southern and Pennsylvania railroads; about half its route was on SR tracks.

The all-Pullman train one of the most distinguished in the South offered a range of onboard services and charged a $5 extra fare. Southern’s handsome green Ps-4 Pacifics pulled the train between Atlanta and Washington. In 1929 the train received new equipment painted in two-tone green with gold trim. The Crescent Limited name and extra-fare services disappeared from the timetable in 1934 and the train became nameless Nos. 37 and 38 carrying coaches. In 1938 the train regained its title now shortened to Crescent. Diesels replaced the 4-6-2s in 1941.

The Crescent was upgraded in 1949. New streamlined sleeping cars and coaches and distinctive high-windowed observation cars graced the beautiful new postwar Crescent.

After two decades of competition from autos and the airplane the Crescent was partially consolidated with its running mate the Southerner beginning in the late 1960s. The combined trains were renamed the Southern Crescent in 1970. In May 1971 with the creation of Amtrak Southern continued to operate its own passenger trains. The Southern Crescent still offered sleepers (the last private railroad sleeping-car service in the U.S.) fine dining and west of Atlanta a dome car. The Southern Crescent became an Amtrak service in February 1979.

Royal Palm

With a history spanning 1913–1970 the Royal Palm was one of the longest-lived train names on the Southern. The train began as a Chicago-Cincinnati-Chattanooga-Jacksonville operation. The Royal Palm largely functioned as a Cincinnati–Florida train with connecting trains feeding it cars at Cincinnati.

During the Florida boom of the 1920s the Royal Palm often ran in multiple sections but by 1932 it was reduced to a single year-round section. As Florida travel revived new competition came with three fast streamlined trains from the Midwest to Florida in 1940: the City of Miami the South Wind and the Dixie Flagler. But streamliners wouldn’t come to the Royal Palm’s route until after World War II.

In 1949 Southern introduced the winter-season New Royal Palm. The streamliner a running mate to the year-round Royal Palm offered sleeping cars from Chicago Detroit Cleveland Buffalo and Atlanta to Miami via Cincinnati. And the train’s equipment served as the regular Royal Palm during the off season. The New Royal Palm lasted until the end of the 1954–55 season. This ended a long tradition of winter-season trains from the Midwest to Florida. Its Royal Palm cousin endured many changes and downgrades until its last remnant was discontinued in 1970.

Southerner

Under pressure of the press and the Atlanta business community and concerned about the competition from the Seaboard Air Line Southern introduced its first all-streamlined train the Southerner in 1941. It began life as an all-coach train on an all-Southern route south of Washington. The road’s distinctive green E6 diesels pulled the train from its inception. The Southerner boasted attractive coaches a full diner and a round-end tavern-lounge-observation car. The streamliner operated between New York and Washington on the PRR and to Atlanta Birmingham and New Orleans via the Southern. By the early 1950s the Southerner would begin also carrying sleeping cars for Atlanta and Birmingham to compete with the Seaboard’s Silver Comet.

The Southerner was partially consolidated (southbound only) with the Crescent in the late 1960s. The completely combined trains were renamed the Southern Crescent in 1970.

Tennessean

The Tennessean was Southern Railway’s second streamliner. Inaugurated in May 1941 it ran between Washington and Memphis. The train used the Southern from Washington to Lynchburg Va. Norfolk & Western from Lynchburg to Bristol Tenn. and the Southern again from Bristol to Memphis.

The Tennessean carried similar lightweight coach dining and lounge cars to the Southerner. It also carried mail cars on the front and heavyweight Pullman sleepers on the rear. Motive power on the easterly portion of the route was a Southern Ps-4 Pacific streamlined by industrial designer Otto Kuhler; N&W 4-8-4s handled it from Lynchburg to Bristol where Southern E6s took over to Memphis.

The Tennessean catered to the Washington–Memphis travel market also served by the Memphis Special — a train whose main job was hauling the U.S. Mail. Despite its relatively slow schedule the new streamlined Tennessean succeeded in more than doubling the amount of coach ridership generated by the Special.

Originally the Tennessean’s sleepers operated only from Bristol to Memphis; a Washington–Memphis sleeper was added later. Useful during World War II the Tennessean always struggled to attract more lucrative long-distance riders. As mail and express revenues dropped postwar the train fell on hard times. The Tennessean’s last Washington–Memphis run was in mid-1966; the truncated remnant was later abandoned.

Asheville Special

Inaugurated in February 1932 the Asheville Special train 15 and 16 ran as far as Greensboro N.C. In its best years the train carried mail and offered coaches a diner and through sleeping cars from New York to Asheville Winston-Salem and other destinations. The train ran on one of the most scenic routes in the South.

The Asheville Special was combined with the train 31-32 the Augusta Special as far south as Salisbury N.C. from its inauguration until 1949 when the two trains were split or combined at Greensboro. Also at this time the Asheville Special was rerouted to operate to Asheville via Winston-Salem.

Given the Southern’s predilection for eliminating money-losing passenger trains it was remarkable that the Asheville Special lasted as long as it did. In February 1970 the train’s New York sleeper was cut back to Washington–Asheville. Then in July 1970 the Special stopped serving Winston-Salem and returned to its pre-1949 route to Salisbury. At the same time the train began running only three times per week and lost its Washington– Asheville sleeper. But Southern added a recently acquired dome car to the remaining consist in 1971 giving spectacular views of the mountains east of Asheville. But all that scenery and history couldn’t save the train and it was discontinued in 1975.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3gxM21lbXBoaXMuY29tL25ld3MvdHJlbmRpbmcvbm90ZWQtZG9nLWhhbmRsZXItaW5qdXJlZC1pbi13cmVjay1lbi1yb3V0ZS10by13ZXN0bWluc3Rlci1zaG93L2FydGljbGVfMzJhM2MzZTgtZmFhYS01MDRjLWJmYTEtYjQzYTJlYzhiY2MwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Noted dog handler injured in wreck en route to Westminster show,"Memphis TN (38111)

On a hot July afternoon in 2004 the anthropologist Heidi Larson perched on a low mud wall in Nigeria talking with a group of mothers as livestock and children milled about. Public-health workers had been making progress vaccinating thousands of Nigerian children against polio but rumors that the shots were laced with H.I.V. and infertility drugs had led to a vaccine boycott in several northern states. Larson who was working for UNICEF’s Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (now known as Gavi) spoke to the women through a Hausa interpreter. “Aside from the vaccine rumors is there anything else you’re concerned about?” she asked.

Her question unleashed a torrent of answers. The women said they were frustrated by the government’s aggressive efforts on behalf of a single vaccine when their villages lacked reliable drinking water and electricity. They wondered why no one was knocking down their doors to rout diarrheal diseases poverty or starvation. They were infuriated by the condescending attitude of public-health officials toward their vaccine concerns; they were still haunted by a clinical trial for a meningitis drug conducted by Pfizer eight years earlier which had left eleven Nigerian children dead and dozens disabled. Amid America’s “war on terror” some found it entirely plausible that Western countries might be trying to sterilize Muslim children or infect them with H.I.V. Others were eager to vaccinate their kids but forbidden from doing so by their husbands. Larson found that there was no single explanation for their vaccine hesitancy. Instead their attitudes were filtered through an intricate mix of rumors mistrust history and facts on the ground.

Larson a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine studies vaccine rumors—how they start and why some flourish and others wither. Public-health experts often address vaccine hesitancy on an informational basis by debunking rumors and misinformation. But in her recent book “Stuck: How Vaccine Rumors Start—and Why They Don’t Go Away” Larson argues for a more expansive view of the problem. “We should look at rumors as an eco-system not unlike a microbiome” she writes. Tackling misperceptions individually is like eliminating a single microbial strain: when one germ is gone another will bloom. Instead the entire ecosystem must be rehabilitated.

In 2010 in London Larson founded the Vaccine Confidence Project with the goal of putting these ideas into practice. Its analysts—trained in digital media political science artificial intelligence psychology statistics epidemiology and computer science—monitor news sites and social media in more than a hundred languages then strategize with local health groups about how to tackle the rumors they find. Larson describes the Vaccine Confidence Project as “investigating the global vaccine weather while zooming in to local storms.” This year the project has fielded requests for help from health officials in some fifty countries including in the few days before one of our phone calls Sudan Somalia Turkey and Iran. Her team works in an epidemiological spirit hoping to contain outbreaks of misinformation swiftly before they can spread.

Larson has also developed a tool for quantitatively mapping vaccine hesitancy: the Vaccine Confidence Index a set of validated questions concise enough to reach vast populations. In 2015 she posed the questions to sixty-six thousand people in sixty-seven countries—the first time a rigorous survey of vaccine attitudes had been conducted at that scale. Larson’s results took many public-health experts by surprise. The lowest levels of vaccine confidence were found in countries with the highest education levels and the best health-care systems; seven of the ten most vaccine-hesitant countries were within the European Union. (France ranked first.) Global-health efforts tend to focus on poorer countries such as Nigeria but the results suggested that the ability of vaccines to end pandemics might also be weak in wealthier countries—the same nations that export public-health expertise to the developing world.

Larson who is sixty-four has a calming meditative demeanor that masks a restless intellect. Willowy with no-nonsense straight hair she has spent the coronavirus pandemic tracking vaccine attitudes from the home in North London she shares with her husband the Belgian microbiologist Peter Piot who helped discover and contain Ebola. Larson and Piot share a vast repository of global-health experience; in March 2020 they shared the coronavirus. She experienced mild symptoms but Piot fell seriously ill.

Over a video call this spring Larson told me that the COVID vaccination effort “should remind everybody that you cannot have scientific advances and great global-health plans” without taking vaccine confidence into account. Five months into the vaccination effort the share of the U.S. population who’ve received at least one dose of the vaccine has barely exceeded fifty per cent. After reaching a peak of more than four million doses per day in mid-April the daily number of doses has been falling off slipping under a million per day in June. Herd immunity through vaccination seems increasingly unlikely. But Larson is already thinking ahead to the next pandemic. Future outbreaks may well be deadlier and more contagious than COVID-19. What good will our high-tech vaccines be if not enough people will take them?

Larson was born in 1957 and grew up in Boston. Her father was an Anglican priest and her mother was a professor of German. The doors of home and church were unbolted and heavily trafficked the church as likely to host Passover Seders as N.A.A.C.P. meetings. As a child Larson spent hours in the basement darkroom with her father who taught filmmaking and communications in addition to working as a priest; in the nineteen-sixties those pursuits converged in the civil-rights movement which he documented on film. The day after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated Larson’s father headed to Memphis with his camera. Larson who was eleven at the time remembers him warning her and her younger brother that he might end up in prison but for a good cause. “I grew up understanding the power of belief” she told me.

At Harvard Larson started as a biomedical-engineering major then switched to studying sociology and photography. For her senior thesis she photographed children with Down syndrome who’d been mainstreamed into the public schools. After graduation she spent a fellowship year in Israel studying how Jewish and Arab children played together then made a similar study among Muslim and Hindu children in India; later as a graduate student in anthropology at the University of California Berkeley she worked with a Punjabi community in England that was predominantly Sikh but changing under the influence of Muslim immigrants from Pakistan. Other researchers had warned her that it would be hard to gain the trust of people in such vulnerable communities; her solution she recalled was just to “be interested.”

One morning during her time at Berkeley as she was driving down a coastal highway in the fog her Volkswagen hatchback flipped over a cliff and into the Pacific Ocean. The car slammed roof first into the water sinking until only its rear wheels broke the surface; Larson was trapped upside down in the car. Two elementary-school kids cutting through the redwoods on their way to school managed to contact rescuers who pulled her from the car unconscious after forty-five minutes. Larson survived the crash with only a case of hypothermia and a ticket for driving with an out-of-state license. Her father had always stressed the importance of listening to those who are overlooked and her rescue by children reinforced that lesson. “I’ve learned to pay close attention to people on their own terms” she said.

In 1990 fresh out of grad school Larson took a job at Apple Computer studying how the presence of computers affected students and teachers in a series of Los Angeles classrooms. Later she moved to Xerox PARC where she observed office workers adjusting to new technologies such as fax machines. Among other things Xerox hoped to install a printer on every desk but Larson found that workers preferred walking to the printing room. “It reminded me of women going to the well in Nepal” she said—it was a detour with a social function. Xerox wanted to know how workers at an international company related to fax machines and UNICEF in New York had recently splurged for two. Larson spent a year studying faxes in the organization then took a job there and was sent to Fiji.

For six years Larson worked to help South Pacific countries improve children’s welfare. Attending to people on their own terms turned out to be critical. Once she obtained an audience with the King of Tonga who preferred to hold forth about his slimming regimen. (He’d previously held the Guinness World Record for world’s heaviest monarch.) Larson talked with him about his cycling and his penchant for coconuts; the king eventually signed on to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

It was impossible to ignore how H.I.V. was ripping through Asia. There was no vaccine or effective treatment. Although Larson had jettisoned pre-med as an undergrad anthropology turned out to be the right specialty for the crisis. “The social cultural and human dimensions—that was all we had” she said. She moved to Geneva to join the World Health Organization focussing on the factors that shape behavior around infectious diseases. She crisscrossed the globe for the next two years leading workshops meeting government officials collaborating with local health teams and observing communities that were getting it right. Her mother however had died of ovarian cancer. Larson herself had contracted a host of illnesses—dengue fever hepatitis E amoebiasis giardiasis eosinophilic meningitis and cerebral malaria—and wanted to move closer to her father. She returned to New York to work with UNICEF’s newly formed Gavi Alliance in 2002.

The Nigerian vaccine boycott which started two years into Larson’s tenure with Gavi brought her face to face with an unsettling aspect of global health: even the most strenuously wrought achievements—ones that required years of painstaking logistical financial and diplomatic effort—could be gutted by the mere puff of rumor. The local strain of polio ultimately spread to twenty countries as far afield as Yemen Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. Fifteen hundred children were paralyzed; it cost a half-billion dollars to contain the outbreak. The lesson for Larson was that global vaccination efforts would never succeed without a detailed understanding of rumor and a rigorous process for creating trust.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLW5vcnRoZXJuLWlyZWxhbmQtNTc0NjQyMjbSATtodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY28udWsvbmV3cy91ay1ub3J0aGVybi1pcmVsYW5kLTU3NDY0MjI2LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carrick-a-Rede island fire 'was started deliberately',"With only one way on and off the island he said ""it was certainly a challenge but crews were able to fulfil their role and bring the blaze under control"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vaG93LWlzd2FwLWZpZ2h0ZXJzLXdvb2VkLWlkcHMtYmFjay10by1ib3Juby12aWxsYWdlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How ISWAP is wooing IDPs back to Borno villages,"Members of the factional Boko Haram group the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) are reportedly cajoling many people living in various camps in northern…

Members of the factional Boko Haram group the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) are reportedly cajoling many people living in various camps in northern part of Borno State back to their ancestral villages.

The terrorists are reportedly assuring the locals of safety security and economic support once they return to their villages which they fled at the height of the Boko Haram insurgency.

Sources said the campaign by ISWAP is part of their “consolidation drive” after the death of Abubakar Shekau.

The campaigns are going in many communities in Magumeri Abadam Kukawa Monguno Nganzai Gubio and Mobbar local government areas all in the northern Borno credible sources said.

Thousands of people among them women and children are living in Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps in some major towns especially in northern Borno after they were forced out of their dwellings. However some of them have started going back to their villages without the consent of relevant authorities it was gathered.

Military authorities have not formally admitted the new consolidation tactics by ISWAP but credible sources said unless drastic measures are taken by relevant authorities the “welfarist” approach deployed by the terrorists could reverse some of the gains recorded before and in the aftermath of the dead of Shekau.

It was learnt that Nigerian ground troops with active support of the air force have recovered many no-go areas in Borno ahead of the return of civilians.

Governor Baba Zulum of Borno State and other donors have constructed thousands of houses in some liberated communities especially in central and southern part of the state and thereafter resettled thousands of displaced persons.

There were celebrations in the security circles after Shekau was killed by ISWAP fighters but experts said it was too early to celebrate as ISWAP’s attention is no longer divided and they would most likely consolidate their gains through mass recruitment of followers in ungovernable locations.

“Yes there is credible information that villagers and IDPs that were leaving in IDP camps and confined within parapet have started returning to their villages” one of our sources said.

He said the returnees were expected to return to their normal ways of living as farmers fishermen and traders.

“Most of the IDPs are responding to appeals by the new ISWAP leadership led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi the son of late Mohammed Yusuf the founder of Boko Haram who is now the spiritual leader of the terrorists group.

“They ISWAP terrorists have promised the people so-called fairness justice safety and security…You know there is a marked difference between ISWAP and Shekau’s faction. Shekau used to attack raid and kill people.

“On the other hand ISWAP fighters strive to win the hearts and minds of locals by not attacking them. Even though they have raided many communities in Borno and Yobe states civilian casualty was not much…The fighters target security operatives and their sympathisers and their sympathizers among the civilian population as evident in what happened in Geidam in Yobe State and Dikwa in Borno during recent raids” he said.

A retired military officer Sanusi Ali described this as a dangerous trend.

“We all know that ISWAP is as dangerous as the Shekau’s faction so government must tackle them before they hypnotize the locals” he said.

Why ISWAP is having a field day

Another source said the ISWAP fighters are finding it easy to consolidate their gains because of absence of civil authority in many towns and villages especially in northern Borno.

“Military operatives including the army navy and air force have done a lot in clearance operations especially in the Lake Chad region but once they move to other locations the terrorists return in full force.

“So the only way to end this fight is to empower the police and other security outfits like Customs Immigration and civil defence to take charge of liberated communities so that the people would not be at the mercy of Boko Haram fighters.

“The truth is that wherever there is no noticeable presence of security agents the hapless returnees would be governed by ISWAP.

“It is not completely true that the ISWAP faction is a harmless group…No they want to use the civilian population as human shield on one hand as a formidable platform of generating revenue on the other.

“Once the locals resume economic activities like farming and fishing they would be paying taxes to the terrorists. This is why it is necessary for the federal government to establish civil authorities in the localities and continue fighting the terrorists until they have nowhere to hide.

‘Troops must concentrate on ISWAP’s weaknesses’

Daily Trust on Sunday learnt that many top commanders of Shekau’s group and some from the ISWAP’s camp died during the infamous encounter at the hiding place of Shekau in the Sambisa forest.

Pundits are of the belief that the demise of the top commanders of the two opposing groups could end insurgency in the North-East but remnants of Shekau and ISWAP followers and cells affiliated to them are likely to pose threat to the common people. A good case in point was on May 28 when some of the insurgents in spite of the dearth of their commanders regrouped summoned courage and tried to attack an army base at Rann Kala Balge Local Government Area of Borno State. They were however overpowered by the military and most of them were killed and their fighting equipment seized.

Similarly a surprise attack launched by the elements of ISWAP in Diffa Niger Republic was repelled by the Nigerien forces.

Another source said after the death of Shekau ISWAP fighters had detained most of surviving Shekau’s commanders who either surrendered or were captured and are still searching the area to find others.

“For instance at a market place in a village near Damboa ISWAP fighters surrounded and killed many followers of Shekau who were allegedly accused of extorting money from locals” the source stated.

“But the problem is that hardened followers and commanders of Shekau have vowed to avenge the death of their leader. In one of the intercepted voice messages one of the top commanders of Shekau who was not in Sambisa during the encounter said ISWAP followers had betrayed his confidence by attacking and killing their leader and that he would kill anyone he came across. Many of the remnants of Shekau’s followers believe that ISWAP leaders should not be trusted” he said.

He said while Shekau’s followers tend to deal with situations including the civilians in an aggressive way the ISWAP group is only fighting against the government and the security forces.

According to him there is the probability that ISWAP’s new approach will take on an extra dimension because its members received most of their training finance and arms from their foreign accomplices.

“They have taken control of the Sambisa and Mandara mountains as their operational headquarters in addition to their hideouts in the Lake Chad area and could strike from any location. They could be more dangerous than their counterparts unless the security forces are able clampdown on them and their foreign sponsors. They have well-placed moles in different locations who are feeding them with vital information; they must be detected and punished.

“ISWAP uses money to attract people and its members are good at keeping their data and transactions confidential. That is why many of their operations and movements are carefully planned. But the military too are giving them a hot chase especially in the northern part of Borno State and should that continue the group will be overwhelmed. Nigerien forces have recently dealt ISWAP a mighty blow” he explained.

In the same vein a member of the volunteer security outfit Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) in Maiduguri said ISWAP which is allegedly affiliated to the ISIS might use several recruitment methods to enlarge its membership and could use the social media platforms including Facebook Twitter Watsapp and YouTube videos which are effective ways to reach a target audience mostly unemployed persons and youths he said.

“The group was said to have shared money to residents of Geidam town after a recent raid but those sharing the money did not specifically reveal their intention. The fact remains that there are hundreds of unemployed youths from one place to another while many families are displaced. Besides getting a job or job skill and capital now is very difficult. There are so many factors that could shape the pathway to lead many people to join radical groups” he added.

Meanwhile those who are successfully recruited will continue to also find a way of radicalising vulnerable persons he said adding that the intelligence services and local communities must be observant.

He further said both the volunteers and the military must act swiftly to protect their bases and push back and overpower advancing insurgents.

“With the fall of Shekau and his followers the step ISWAP takes to crack its target is known to the military which is why the group was overpowered by troops in Damboa town on Tuesday and many of their fighters killed while guns explosive devices and vehicles were retrieved from them. In fact soldiers should not wait until ISAWP fighters launch an offensive; they know their weaknesses they should concentrate on them.” he said.

Zulum confirms recruitment promises action

In a Democracy Day speech marking his two years at the helm Borno State Governor Babagana Umara Zulum said effort was being made to provide humanitarian supplies and money to displaced persons to improve their wellbeing and thwart recruitment militarization and radicalization by insurgent based networks.

“From records we have experienced instances when insurgents offered as low as between N5000 and N10000 to recruit some spies and smugglers of weapons” he said.

We’re yet to get briefed – Military spokesperson

When contacted yesterday the newly appointed spokesman of Nigerian Army who is the outgoing Director of Defence Information Brig.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu did not pick several calls put to his mobile phone.

But the Acting Coordinator Defence Media Operation Brig.-Gen. Bernard Onyeuko in a reply to Daily Trust’s enquiry via a text message said he had no briefing on the matter.

“Good evening. I don’t have any brief on that yet” he wrote.

A Belfast mum has turned the heartache of losing two of her babies in early pregnancy into an incredible support system for others experiencing early loss.

Ellie Goan 37 is Northern Ireland's first ambassador for the charity CRADLE which works with the NHS supporting women partners surrogates and intended parents affected by pregnancy loss before the 24th week.

The South Belfast woman has brought the support the charity offers to Northern Ireland and is now working with the Belfast Trust to help them support parents experiencing pregnancy loss by supplying comfort bags and outpatient packs.

Speaking to Belfast Live Ellie - who lives with husband Barry and their daughters Aoibhinn eight and Etain three - said she wanted to help others as a lasting legacy to her two babies she lost.

""It means I can give something back in their memory"" she said.

""I didn't get to meet them or hold them or see them but this is my way of honouring their memory. That is why it is so important to me.""

CRADLE provides a range of early pregnancy loss resources to healthcare professionals which are made available to bereaved parents during their hospital appointments or care.

The resources – which include comfort bags of toiletries outpatient and antenatal appointment packs – reflect the physical needs of women during their experience of pregnancy loss in a hospital or clinic setting.

The leaflets and support cards inside the comfort bags and packs signpost women to peer support services and where funding is available to the CRADLE counselling team.

""My first pregnancy was textbook my little girl was born and she's eight now but then very sadly my next two pregnancies ended in miscarriage between 8 and 10 weeks"" said Ellie who works at the City Hospital.

""Just through my experiences the support and resources available to the staff in the hospital were quite limited. There was the odd leaflet and sadly my scan pictures didn't show anything so when I left the hospital I literally left with nothing.

""I left with a leaflet for the Miscarriage Association which is another great charity but it was just limited there's nothing and it's not just Northern Ireland it's UK wide that miscarriage and early pregnancy loss is seen to be one of those things talked about like it is just one of those things just go on and go about your business.""

Ellie is determined that other parents will get the support she did not receive at the time of her losses and hopes other Trusts in Northern Ireland will start working with CRADLE to support parents at this time.

She said one of the simple things the charity provides are packets of tissues.

""It is a packet of tissues and a little card and they are prepared by me and will be prepared by other volunteers who understand signposting to support the Facebook page and the charity itself"" she said.

""You leave with something you might not cry at the scan room but most people will cry after and it just means you have something in your hand.

""Women who go through say an ectopic pregnancy or a later early loss - because early loss is classed up to 24 weeks or 23 plus six - and need a hospital admission we do full comfort bags.

""It is all the toiletries and bits and pieces you could possibly need for a short hospital stay so it is one less thing that is in your mind that you don't have to send a partner to try and put a toiletry bag together.

""You have a hair brush hair bobbles and inside that bag as well you have a 'Dear friend' letter which has been written by our founder Louise and it just tells you there is no right way to feel you can be sad you can be upset you can take it in your stride but just to know you are not alone.

""The whole ethos of CRADLE is to let women going through early loss know they are not alone. There is such a taboo it is not talked about pregnancy loss in general is not talked about but early loss is certainly not and it is only when you have talked about your own experiences and talk about what you went through when you were at that point that so many people reach out and say that happened to me too.

""But nobody talks about it.""

She added: ""Everybody feels different. I am very passionate about talking about it now I have my wee rainbow baby she is three so I am in the place now where I can talk about it but my two girls also know about the two siblings they never got to meet because that's how I felt about my pregnancies and miscarriages some people don't and that's OK as well.

""Everybody's journey is a very different journey but there is still that emotion and there is still that rawness for most people and it's possibly a generation thing that when it happened in the past you just got on with things or were expected to get on with things.""

Ellie said it can be a very lonely and isolating time for parents and she wants to ensure people know there is support out there and they don't have to be on their own.

She said she is proud to be an ambassador for the charity but hopes it will grow and expand into hospitals throughout the country so that it is not a ""'postcode lottery"" for people in the Belfast Trust area.

""You get a positive pregnancy test and you presume and I think it's just society's way of thinking that in nine months time you get to take a baby home and that's just not always the case"" she said.

""My experience was early loss and that's clearly where my passion would lie and CRADLE are just one of the other charities that are focussed on early loss.

""There was nothing like it in Northern Ireland and I am just really proud to be the ambassador initially for the Belfast Trust.""

She added: ""Any bereavement and any trauma I think Northern Ireland in particular we have been very good at hiding things or not talking about things but things are changing in all sorts of arenas so hopefully this is another step forward that people can feel comfortable talking.""

Ellie said it was important that people knew it does not matter how you became pregnant - surrogacy donor or IVF - or where that baby is in the journey CRADLE is there to support you.

""You are not alone it doesn't make it any easier knowing that you are not alone it doesn't take away from your own hurt or your own grief but just know there is help and there is support"" she said.

Talking about her own experience Ellie said she counts herself as ""one of the lucky ones"" who was able to access counselling following her second loss.

""I think whenever society is telling you to suck it up or it's perceived that you should be over it now sometimes it's not as easy as that"" she said.

""I had very bad anxiety after my second loss as well it hit me very bad and some of that was possibly due to lack of support that was there.

""This is just one source that whenever the GPs are overwhelmed an midwives are overwhelmed this is just another way that there is some sort of support to be found when you don't get a follow up phone call.""

She added: ""There was just nothing there for me I was very lucky in that I had a very understanding GP who I had to go to myself when I realised my mental health was going downhill a bit. I was lucky I was caught early and was offered CBT but I know I am in the minority when it comes to that and I think it was the GP on the day that understood.""

Ellie said there is a CRADLE Facebook page for parents who have gone through early loss and you can speak to people who will understand and ""get it"". Counselling is also offered virtually something that has been difficult for people to previously access.

CRADLE runs via donations and Ellie has set up an Amazon Wish List so people can help her purchase the pieces for the comfort bags.

Séana Talbot Maternity and Neonatal service manager at Belfast Trust said: “We are delighted to be working with CRADLE to support women experiencing pregnancy loss. The CRADLE packs will hopefully make a difference for women and their partners at a very difficult time.”

Jackie Stacey Ward Sister in the RJMH Maternity Assessment Unit and Early Pregnancy Clinic and Barbara Gergett Childbirth and loss Midwife echoed those sentiments: “Women who have received the packs so far have shown an appreciation for the consideration of what is included.

“Working with CRADLE helps staff within Belfast Trust provide practical resources to women who are experiencing early pregnancy loss. The CRADLE comfort bags and peer support reassures women that they are not alone and other people have walked a similar journey.”

CHANDLER Ariz. – June 13 2021 – Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) successfully launched the Tactically Responsive Launch-2 (TacRL-2) payload into orbit for the U.S. Space Force (USSF) using the company’s Pegasus XL rocket. TacRL-2 was launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base.

The USSF’s tactically responsive launch concept seeks to introduce speed agility and flexibility into the launch enterprise in order to respond to dynamic changes in the space domain or an operational theater and insert or replace assets on orbit much faster than standard timelines to meet emerging combatant command requirements.

Northrop Grumman successfully launched the TacRL-2 payload into orbit for the U.S. Space Force's Space and Missile Systems Center using the company’s Pegasus XL rocket.

Pegasus the world’s first privately-developed commercial space launch vehicle is an air-launched three-staged rocket carried aloft by Northrop Grumman’s specially modified ""Stargazer"" L-1011 aircraft. Shortly after its release from Stargazer at approximately 40000 feet above the Pacific Ocean Pegasus ignited its first stage beginning its successful flight carrying TacRL-2 to its intended orbit.

“This Pegasus launch was a clear demonstration of our team’s ability to provide rapid and responsive operational needs” said Rich Straka vice president launch vehicles Northrop Grumman. “Our team was able to execute the design integration and testing of the TacRL-2 launch vehicle in less than four months from contract award.”

This is the 45th launch of Pegasus which uses solid propulsion to offer maximum responsiveness by enabling launch to a wide variety of orbits on short timelines. This capability provides customers with the flexibility to operate from virtually anywhere on Earth with minimal ground support requirements. Pegasus has launched more than 90 satellites into low earth orbit from five separate launch sites in the United States Europe and the Marshall Islands.

The payload was successfully deployed its intended orbit a Space Force spokesman confirmed on Sunday.

Pegasus is an air-launched rocket deployed from a Stargazer L-1011 aircraft. Shortly after its release from Stargazer at approximately 40000 feet above the Pacific Ocean Pegasus ignited its first stage and flew TacRL-2 to a sun-synchronous low-Earth orbit.

TacRL-2 is a technology demonstration satellite to be used for space surveillance. The Space and Missile Systems Center’s Space Safari office integrated the satellite built and operated by the Air Force Research Laboratory and Utah State University Space Dynamics Laboratory.

TacRL-2 is named after the Space Force’s tactically responsive launch program an effort to figure out ways to shrink the timelines for planning space missions. This was the first mission supported by SMC’s new Space Safari program office.

“When I challenged the Space and Missile Systems Center about a year ago to demonstrate a responsive space capability they accepted and delivered” Chief of Space Operations Gen. John Raymond said in a statement. “The team presented an integrated space domain awareness satellite ready for launch in record time” he said. “What normally would have required two to five years took 11 months.”

Launch vehicle assembly integration and testing were completed within four months of contract award said Lt. Col. Ryan Rose chief of SMC’s Small Launch and Targets Division.

S. Space Force successfully launched the Tactically Responsive Launch-2 (TacRL-2) mission on a Northrop Grumman Pegasus XL rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base on June 13 at 4:11 a.m. EDT delivering a technology demonstration satellite to Low Earth Orbit.



Pegasus the world’s first privately-developed commercial space launch vehicle is an air-launched threestaged rocket carried aloft by Northrop Grumman’s specially modified “Stargazer” L-1011 aircraft. Shortly after its release from Stargazer at approximately 40000 feet above the Pacific Ocean Pegasus ignited its first stage beginning its successful flight carrying TacRL-2 to its intended orbit.



Tactically responsive launch as a concept seeks to introduce speed agility and flexibility into the launch enterprise in order to respond to dynamic changes in the space domain or an operational theater and insert or replace assets on orbit much faster than standard timelines to meet emerging combatant command requirements.



“Today’s successful launch is a clear signal to our strategic competitors that we will not cede access to space” said Chief of Space Operations Gen. John W. “Jay” Raymond. “When I challenged the Space and Missile Systems Center about a year ago to demonstrate a responsive space capability they accepted and delivered! The team presented an integrated Space Domain Awareness satellite ready for launch in record time; what normally would have required two to five years took 11 months.



“The space domain is defined by speed” Raymond said. “And with this effort we demonstrated the kind of speed it will take to win. We executed a ‘21-day call-up’ to get a satellite on orbit – pulling the payload mating it with the rocket and integrating the combined package onto the aircraft. Agile responsive capability development combined with our ability to rapidly launch and insert capabilities into space where we want when we want will deny our competitors the perceived benefits of beginning a conflict in or extending a conflict to space.”



The TacRL-2 mission was executed by the Small Launch and Targets Division within the Space and Missile Systems Center’s Launch Enterprise in partnership with SMC’s Space Safari Office and launched a satellite built and operated by the Air Force Research Laboratory and Space Dynamics Laboratory.



During a six-month standby period a notice to launch was executed and the satellite launched several weeks later exercising Concept of Operations tactics techniques and procedures required of a responsive launch.



“I am very pleased with the success of this tactical launch demonstrating rapid and responsive technologies and what it means for the continuous Space Force support to the warfighter” said Lt. Col. Ryan Rose chief Small Launch and Targets Division. “The team completed the launch vehicle design build integration and testing in only four months from contract award and then executed the launch within a few weeks of call-up.”



TacRL-2 was the first mission supported by SMC’s new Space Safari Program Office. Space Safari rapidly integrates mature technology and systems to quickly respond to specialized space needs.



For TacRL-2 Space Safari successfully demonstrated their end-to-end approach to tactically responsive missions by acquiring and integrating the space vehicle launch vehicle payloads and ground elements in record time as well as conducting on-orbit planning and operator training.



This mission was a first-of-its-kind effort that has already identified several constraints and lessons learned. The USSF will use this information to improve upcoming TacRL missions with the Space Safari office planned to launch in 2022 and 2023. Tactically Responsive Launch is the first step toward the USSF acquiring a tactical space mobility and logistics capability to support combatant command’s future requirements for tactical spacepower.

A Northrop Grumman rocket successfully launched a secretive Space Force satellite for ""space domain awareness"" — or detecting artificial objects in orbit — on Sunday (June 13) in a rapid response mission for the U.S. military.

A Northrop Grumman L-1011 carrier aircraft took off from the newly renamed Vandenberg Space Force Base and flew out over the Pacific Ocean where it launched the a solid fuel Pegasus XL rocket carrying the new satellite at 4:11 a.m. EDT (1:11 a.m. PDT/0811 GMT). Vandenberg officials confirmed the success of the launch in a Facebook statement.

The mission is called Tactically Responsive Launch-2 (TacRL-2) and is part of a program acknowledged by Air Force from at least 2019. In its biennial report of that year Air Force stated its rocket systems launch program is ""developing a tactically responsive launch capability"" through awarding Pegasus XL rocket launches to Northrop Grumman.

""Team V successfully launched the Tactically Responsive Launch-2 mission. A demonstration of a speed agility and flexibility in space launch"" Vandenberg officials wrote in a statement. ""Showing that space assets can be placed in orbit faster than standards timelines this launch showcases the talent dedication and flexibility of Team V."" The Space Force and Northrop Grumman did not provide a live webcast of the launch.

As of 2019 program requirements state Northrop Grumman must have ""launch vehicle readiness"" in four months and then put the launch vehicle on standby ""with a 21-day call-up to launch capability"" Air Force added in the biennial report.

TacRL-2 and other launches of its type are part of Space Force's push to offer more flexible small launch services called ""responsive launch."" The mission was built by Space Safari a new military entity that ""responds to high-priority urgent space needs"" through a rapid acquisition and execution process according to Space Force.

""Space Safari's initial mission is to plan acquire and deliver a specialized space capability with the ability to integrate and launch within just weeks of a 'Go!' order"" Col. Dennis Bythewood director of special programs said in a Space Force release on Thursday (June 10) announcing the establishment of a Space Safari program office.

""Where most space vehicles take years to deliver and launches are similarly planned years in advance this ability to quickly integrate and launch will result in greatly enhanced capabilities"" Bythewood added.

Space Safari was modeled after a rapid-response Air Force group nicknamed ""Big Safari"" and more properly known as the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group. Big Safari was founded in 1952 to centralize the Air Force's covert surveillance during the Cold War according to the U.S. Air Force.

Gen. John Raymond Space Force's chief of space operations spoke about Space Safari's mandate during a Council on Foreign Relations webcast event Thursday (June 10) SpaceNews reported.

""A year ago I challenged our acquisition organization to develop a capability in tactical timelines integrate it onto a launch vehicle and launch it and let's see how fast we can do it"" Raymond said adding ""In less than a year they took satellite components off the shelf married them up with a satellite bus that was off the shelf and put them together in a space domain awareness satellite.""

Northrop Grumman received the launch contract under a nearly $1 billion nine-year procurement program from 2019 known as Orbital Services Program-4 SpaceNews added. The procurement allows for task orders for specific requirements; federal contracting information shows that the Space Force's Space and Missile Systems Center awarded Northrop Grumman the TacRL-2 task order in July 2020 according to SpaceFlightNow.

In February Space Force released a new procurement request for successor Tactically Responsive Launch proposals including TacRL-3 in April 2022 and TacRL-4 in February 2023. Space Force also alluded to the procurement in its Thursday press release.

Demand is so frenzied that U.S. mills have stopped taking orders from customers in recent weeks according to Dan DeMare director of sales at Toledo Ohio-based Heidtman Steel Products Inc. DeMare said the mills may not begin taking new orders until late summer so that they can clear backlogs.

In a global economy already shaken by supply shortages and inflation worries the mills' moves may signal more delivery snags and even higher prices for a commodity key to a wide swath of industries. Across the world about 500 pounds of it is used per person each year in everything from paper clips and automobiles to skyscrapers and toasters.

Steel futures in the U.S. have tripled in 12 months as the swifter-than-expected economic recovery caught producers by surprise while in China futures reached a record after authorities pledged to lower output in a push to control emissions. Prices have also surged in Europe so imports may only rise a certain amount even if the U.S. were to lift Trump administration tariffs.

""The sharpness and speed of the moves has been something like I've never seen before"" Phil Gibbs an analyst at Keybanc Capital Markets in Cleveland. ""I've been covering this space now close to 15 years so I've seen some pretty crazy runs.""

While prices have surged across commodities the 220% jump in U.S. steel in the past year eclipses other highfliers such as copper and crude oil. A Standard & Poor's index of steel companies which includes Nucor Corp. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. and U.S. Steel Corp. is up 69% in 2021 easily the benchmark's best performance through the first five months of the year.

The rally seemed unimaginable just 10 months ago when steel executives said it could be at least 2022 before metal demand would return to pre-pandemic levels. The quick recovery and slow ramp-up of steel plants drained inventories that were already low during the height of the pandemic.

Lumber a market where producers were also caught short amid a surprise surge in housing demand is one of the few materials with comparable gains. And even homebuilders are having to reckon with the effects of tight steel supplies.

Carl Harris who has spent 36 years building homes said he's looking at two-month delays on refrigerators ranges and dishwashers. Delivery times that are normally two to three weeks are now as much as half a year in many parts of the country he said.

The lag means Harris can't install the appliances package to market the two-bedroom empty-nester home just outside Wichita Kan. even though the rest of the house is ready.

It's also getting more expensive to drill in the shale patch as rising prices for steel cement and other supplies and services lead to higher costs for explorers according to Citigroup Inc.

The Kepler lineup has been supported since 2012 but the support is now coming to an end along with support for older Windows operating systems.

NVIDIA Kepler GPU Architecture (GeForce 600 / 700) Series Driver Support Officially Ends on 31st of August Windows 7/8/8.1 Drivers Also To Be Discontinued

The NVIDIA Kepler GPU architecture has been supported for generations but as time goes by older GPU architectures are removed from official support lists. This was reported in our previous article which confirmed that NVIDIA's LTSB (Long-Term Support) drivers for the Kepler GPUs will maintain support for the said architecture for 3 years after which it would be retired along with the GPUs.

NVIDIA ended driver support for its Fermi (GeForce 400 / 500 Series) back in 2018 moving it to legacy status. The same is expected to happen with the Kepler-based GeForce 600 / 700 series when NVIDIA moves beyond R470 drivers. NVIDIA has officially confirmed that the driver support will end on the 31st of August 2021.

Looking back at Kepler the GPU architecture brought NVIDIA back in the fight with mainstream chips competing against flagship parts from AMD. NVIDIA also focused a lot on efficiency which made it win in latter generations such as Maxwell and Pascal. The Kepler series did take a huge blow when AMD fired back with its Hawaii GPUs in 2013 but lept back in the game with Maxwell a year later.

The Kepler GPU generation was also the first to introduce Titan class products which are still running to this day and the most latest iteration being the Titan RTX which was introduced in Turing GPU generation. The RTX 3090 serves as this generation's Titan-class product though its labeled as a GeForce variant.

The following chart from NVIDIA shows the CUDA and driver support plan for current GPU architectures:

Note: The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 Ti and GeForce GTX 750 aren't based on the Kepler architecture but in fact based on the Maxwell architecture and hence won't be retired with the upcoming driver update.

It is not just the Kepler GPUs that are being retired. NVIDIA has also confirmed that it would no longer support older Windows operating systems such as Windows 7 Windows 8 & Windows 8.1.

Effective October 2021 Game Ready Driver upgrades including performance enhancements new features and bug fixes will be available for systems utilizing Maxwell Pascal Turing and Ampere-series GPUs. Critical security updates will be available on systems utilizing desktop Kepler-series GPUs through September 2024. A complete list of desktop Kepler-series GeForce GPUs can be found here.

Q: Why is NVIDIA dropping support for Kepler desktop GPUs?

A: Kepler-based desktop GPUs initially launched in March of 2012. Since then gaming technology has evolved dramatically with technologies like DirectX 12 Ultimate and NVIDIA DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling). Moving forward NVIDIA’s software QA team will be focusing on hardware that supports newer technologies. Q: Why is NVIDIA dropping support for Windows 7 Windows 8 and Windows 8.1?

A: Microsoft has officially ended support for Windows 7 and Windows 8 with Windows 8.1 nearing the end of its lifecycle as well. The vast majority of our GeForce customers have migrated to Windows 10 OS. In order to ensure GeForce owners experience the best possible security support and functionality NVIDIA will now focus on Windows 10 operating system.

One of the most exciting use cases for blockchain and nonfungible tokens enthusiasts inspired by Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash have long been hoping for a VR/AR world with a crypto-powered internal market. Now however Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks the technology to make it happen is on our doorstep.

Speaking at the virtual Computex conference Huang said that he “believe(s) we’re right on the cusp of” the Metaverse and spoke glowingly of its potential according to a transcript of a Q&A session he had with reporters — going as far as to say that users will one day use metaverses to “simulate the future.”

“There will be AR versions where the art that you have is a digital art. You own it using NFT. You’ll display that beautiful art that’s one of a kind and it’s completely digital. You’ll have our glasses on or your phone. You can see that it’s sitting right there perfectly lit and it belongs to you. We’ll see this overlay a metaverse overlay if you will into our physical world” he said.

He noted that Nvidia is already using a VR version of Nvidia’s new office building to test these theories a campus that the company has dubbed “Voyager.” Among the world’s largest manufacturers of GPUs Nvidia used supercomputers to “simulate architecture” for Voyager helping with the design and ecological efficiency and eventually the company will allow employees to attend work by wearing VR headsets from home and controlling robots to move about the physical office space a joint VR/physical workplace hybrid.

“This building completely exists in VR. We designed it completely digitally. We’re going to build it out so that there will be a digital twin of this very physical building in VR. We’ll be able to simulate everything train our robots in it. We can simulate how best to distribute the air conditioning to reduce the energy consumption [...] We can simulate all of that in our digital twin our building metaverse before we deploy anything here in the physical world. We’ll be able to go in and out of it using VR and AR.”

Huang isn’t the only CEO who has weighed in on NFTs and the Metaverse as of late though he’s certainly the most optimistic. In January Fortnite founder Tim Sweeney said that NFTs are the most “plausible” path toward a functioning metaverse but for now they remain a “speculative mess.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc29mdHdhcmUvbnZpZGlhLWlzLWRyb3BwaW5nLXN1cHBvcnQtZm9yLXdpbmRvd3MtNy1hbmQtd2luZG93cy04LWRyaXZlcnMv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxlZXBpbmdjb21wdXRlci5jb20vbmV3cy9zb2Z0d2FyZS9udmlkaWEtaXMtZHJvcHBpbmctc3VwcG9ydC1mb3Itd2luZG93cy03LWFuZC13aW5kb3dzLTgtZHJpdmVycy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA is dropping support for Windows 7 and Windows 8 drivers,"NVIDIA is dropping support for Windows 7 Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 drivers starting in October. 2021 as they focus on supporting Windows 10 and later versions of Windows.

In a new support bulletin published on Friday NVIDIA says they will only provide new features bug fixes or performance enhancements to Game Ready Drivers for Windows 10.

While drivers for Windows 7 Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 will continue to receive critical security updates through September 2024 they will no longer receive any non-security improvements.

""Microsoft has officially ended support for Windows 7 and Windows 8 with Windows 8.1 nearing the end of its lifecycle as well"" explains NVIDIA in a support bulletin first spotted by Ghacks.

""The vast majority of our GeForce customers have migrated to Windows 10 OS. In order to ensure GeForce owners experience the best possible security support and functionality NVIDIA will now focus on Windows 10 operating system.""

NVIDIA further states that their final Game Ready Driver supporting Windows 7 Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 will be released on August 31st 2021.

From that point forward there will be no further drivers released that support these versions of Windows.

For users running these older Windows versions there should not be much impact to your gaming experience on existing games and they will continue to run as normal.

However NVIDIA commonly adds performance improvements into their drivers to support new games as they are released and these older versions of Windows will no longer receive these benefits.

According to the Steam May 2021 Hardware & Software survey only 2.13% of users continue to use Windows 7 0.07% run Windows 8 and 0.98% run Windows 8.1 so there will likely be little impact by this change.

Operating system usage in Steam Hardware and Software survey

Furthermore users running Windows 7 or later can still upgrade for Windows 10 for free using a digital license if it's critical that they continue to receive the latest driver updates and improvements.

Dropping support for older legacy operating systems is a good thing as it pushes users to move to supported operating systems that continue to receive security updates.

Windows 7 and Windows 8 have already reached the end of extended support and no longer receive free security fixes while Windows 8.1 will no longer receive security updates starting on January 1st 2023."

Designers can look at the energy density and battery storage to monitor and prevent overvoltage or over-temperature phenomena. An increase in battery size can directly affect the weight cost and safety of the EV making a well-equipped battery management system (BMS) one of the best methods of shrinking the size of the battery.

Over time Analog Devices (ADI) has showcased an extensive portfolio of BMS products through 5-generations of consistent updates. Keeping up with its trend ADI recently introduced two multicell battery monitors. These monitors are Automotive Safety Integrity Level-D (ASIL-D) certified with new low-power features to enable continuous battery monitoring even after the car has been turned off.

This article aims to explore ADI's monitors and how it looks compared to a few competitors like Texas Instruments and NXP.

ADI’s New Multicell Battery Monitor

Since 2008 ADI has designed and manufactured BMS solutions to meet the growing demand for effective EV technology and keeping safety in mind enough to achieve an ASIL-D rating. ADI's latest addition to its BMS portfolio claims to handle 6-18 cell modules with low-power consumption.

Utilizing ADI's 8 or 12 channel monitors in a BMS allows for continuous verification of each battery cell's charge even after the EV is turned off. It takes roughly 304 μs to measure all cells in a system.

ADI's ADBMS6815 multicell battery stack monitor is optimized for 12 series-connected battery cells with data accumulated under high noise mitigation. Meanwhile the second product announced the ADBMS6817 is identical in characteristics only differing in handling 8 series-connected battery cells.

ADI has improved battery cell monitor technology by having the daisy-chained cells be bidirectional. This ability can help diagnostics locate faults that could occur on the communication line that connects each cell. Each cell has a dedicated pulse-width modulation (PWM) duty cycle control that adds passive cell balancing to the equation.



With its past innovations ADI certainly has the attention of EV manufacturers in addition to its latest stackable battery monitors; however there may be some competition that holds advantages and disadvantages over them.

Texas Instruments’ BMS Features Wireless Communication

Texas Instruments (TI) is a distinguished manufacturer in the vast world of electronics known for creating affordable semiconductors for various applications. For decades TI has been designing hybrid and EV powertrain systems that include BMS technology. TI was also the first BMS manufacturer to receive an ASIL-D rating.

TI’s 16 in series cell monitoring IC is coupled with a battery balancer that is fully autonomous with auto-pause and resumes abilities for robust cell balancing. Screenshot used courtesy of Texas Instruments

As for some specifications TI's battery management integrated circuit (BMIC) offers 128 μs accurate cell voltage measurements across all 16 channels. The option for 12 14 and 16 series-connected cells offering more design flexibility than ADI's latest battery monitor.

Since the ability to extend EV's driving range comes from having a more prominent battery source TI holds a slight advantage compared to ADI by having 12-16 cell options.

Both BMS solutions offer daisy chain communication for optimal monitoring and share a similar balancing current. Also they can both filter for unwanted distortions and have a passive balancing architecture.

One increasing benefit is how TI states it has implemented a wireless data transfer that removes several connectors and cabling from the BMS.

With TI being at the forefront of that specific technology ADI has yet to announce a wireless BMS product that can compare to TI; however it does have a line of wireless power transfer products including receiver/chargers and transmitters.

Keeping that in mind it might be possible for EV manufacturers to see ADI developing a wireless BMS product in the foreseeable future.

Removing the wireless aspect to the BMS another comparison is with NXP's latest BMS.

NXP’S 14-Channel Battery Cell IC

NXP's 14-channel battery cell controller (BCC) IC can monitor between 7 to 14 in series cells through daisy-chained communication or capacitor isolation. What stands out about NXP is the scalability expectations; NXP's BCC could be on the cusp of becoming a game-changer for future battery design with potentially 800 cells per daisy chain.

Compared to ADI and TI's battery monitors NXP's BCC MC33771C has an isolated communication speed of 4 Mbps double the speed and offers a two-wire twisted pair versus a single use for Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication. This SPI is advantageous since a faster SPI can boost the short-distance comms for the BMS.

This battery monitor component can be easily integrated into energy storage systems (ESS) and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for EVs and industrial applications. In addition NXP's BCC is equipped with passive balancing and can operate in sleep mode just as ADI's solution.

Through looking at the different options for BMS it becomes prevalent to see how vital this system is and how so many top companies are approaching it in similar yet drastically different ways.

The Importance of BMS

An EV is only as good as its battery system. The aesthetically pleasing features within the cabin can draw customers in but what gets people to invest in the transition to renewable energy-based transportation is the driving range and price.

To drive longer on a single charge requires an extensive enough battery and storage system. No one wants a trunk-filled battery supply which is why designers and engineers are addressing the battery setup. The fundamentals of a robust and efficient EV powertrain is a well-equipped BMS.

ADI TI and NXP all share the concept of stackable battery cells with daisy-chained communication to save on space and bring design flexibility into the equation. Temperature control becomes essential when the heat begins to dissipate from the multicell configurations.

Each manufacturer offers a product that can easily monitor temperature and run diagnostics for potential faults from cell to cell. In addition NXP and TI have discussed ways of going wireless or cloud-based to free up more space for potentially more battery cells.

The global focus on EVs can bring more and more technology like BMS further into the future. As a result newer and more innovative systems are sure to be on the horizon.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The female manager of the store in Eustis on Thursday afternoon spotted 33-year-old Arthur Steve Weingartner taking his pants off in the men’s section of the store according to an arrest report from the Eustis Police Department. She asked him what he was doing but he ignored her and continued to remove his pants. He was also drinking a beer.

The manager said she felt “very nervous” because of the way he was acting and he was disrupting other customers.

When an officer arrived at the store and tried to talk to Weingartner he walked away. The officer threatened to taser Weingartner but ended up taking him to the ground before handcuffing him.

A pat down turned up a folding knife and a set of metallic knuckles.

In May he was placed on probation following a post-race incident at Darlington in which he slammed into Kevin Harvick’s car on pit road. Later that same month he lost his driver’s license and was put on actual probation after being cited for careless and reckless driving after being caught doing 128 miles per hour in a 45 miles per hour zone in North Carolina. There were reports that Busch got into it with Richard Childress at Kansas Speedway in June. In August he intentionally wrecked Elliott Sadler at Bristol after the two had made contact with one another earlier in the Truck Series race.

The trend continued at Texas Motor Speedway as the season came to a close as Busch who famously enjoys running in all three major NASCAR series was parked by NASCAR for the Nationwide Series (now the Xfinity Series) and Cup Series races in Fort Worth and fined $50000 for an incident that occurred during the Truck Series race.

Kyle Busch intentionally wrecked Ron Hornaday Jr. during the 2011 NASCAR Truck Series Winstar World Casino 350K at Texas Motor Speedway

Coming into the 2011 Winstar World Casino 350K at Texas Motor Speedway Busch had won six NASCAR Truck Series races on the year and had only finished outside the top 10 twice in 15 starts.

He put himself in a good position to pick up a seventh win as he began the race in fourth position but his day wouldn’t last very long at all. On lap 14 of the 148-lap race Busch and four-time Truck Series champion Roy Hornaday Jr. made contact with one another while trying to pass a slower truck causing both to brush the wall.

Busch driving his familiar No. 18 truck proceeded to get behind Hornaday Jr.’s No. 33 and pushed until it ended up in the wall. Busch was immediately parked by NASCAR for the remainder of the race and Hornaday Jr.’s day ended as well. Following the race Hornaday Jr. said he would have been “really upset” had NASCAR not made the decision to park Busch and would have shown up to Busch’s house had NASCAR not intervened.

But it wasn’t just the remainder of the Truck Series race for which Busch was parked.

Busch was ‘parked’ for the remainder of the weekend at Texas Motor Speedway and fined $50000

The morning after the Truck Series race Busch was called back to Texas Motor Speedway and was told by NASCAR that he was barred from competing in the Nationwide Series race on Saturday and the Cup Series race on Sunday. It’s not often that NASCAR makes such a choice but given everything that had transpired they felt it was the right call. And Busch actually agreed.

Later that day Busch released a statement in which he apologized to Hornaday Jr. and his team while also apologizing to his fans and sponsors (h/t ESPN).

“I understand why I was taken out of the car for the rest of the weekend. NASCAR officials had to act and I accept their punishment and take full responsibility for my actions. “As a racecar driver the hardest thing to do is to sit on the sidelines listening to cars on the track when you know you should be out there competing. For this I have no one to blame but myself.” Kyle Busch

Denny Hamlin took over for Busch in the Nationwide Series O’Reilly Auto Parts Challenge and finished second despite having to start from the back of the field. Future Daytona 500 winner Michael McDowell took over Busch’s No. 18 Toyota for the Cup Series AAA Texas 500 and finished 33rd.

By not being able to race on Sunday Busch fell to 11th place in the Cup Series standings 100 points out of the lead and was officially eliminated from contention for the points title. That Monday his bank account was affected as well as Busch was fined $50000.

He wasn’t the first driver to be parked by NASCAR

Busch certainly wasn’t the first driver to be parked by NASCAR nor would he be the last. In 2002 Kevin Harvick the owner of Hornaday Jr.’s truck was kept out of the Cup Series race at Martinsville after getting into multiple collisions with Coy Gibbs during that weekend’s Truck Series race.

In 2007 Robby Gordon was barred from competing in the Cup Series race at Pocono due to his actions in the weekend’s Busch Series race as he failed to obey NASCAR’s instructions for positioning his car on a restart following a collision with Marcus Ambrose. Gordon then wrecked Ambrose who was leading the race on the second-to-last lap.

In 2015 a season in which Kyle Busch won the points title NASCAR parked Matt Kenseth for two of the final three Cup Series races of the season one at Texas Motor Speedway and the other at Phoenix Raceway for what was deemed a purposeful wreck of Joey Logano at Martinsville.

The oil industry got clobbered in 2020 and continues to face volatility amid the coronavirus crisis. However oil investors are hopeful as countries begin to vaccinate their populations and industries restart their operations. Recently the International Energy Agency said in a report that it expects oil demand to hit 100.6 million barrels for the first time since late 2019 in the last quarter of 2022. However the agency noted that the slow pace of vaccinations in Asia could dent the expected recovery.

Nonetheless analysts believe that oil companies have seen the rock bottom and are set to gain in the coming months. Despite the global push towards renewable energy and price fluctuations the oil industry is expected to thrive for years to come with major oil companies like Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) Chevron (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) expecting huge profits.

The oil and gas industry is a major player in the U.S. economy and contributes close to 6 million jobs or 5.6% of total employment in the United States which is absolutely massive with a lot of these coming from the biggest oil companies in USA.

Within the United States the leading oil producer is the state of Texas which is followed by the Gulf of Mexico North Dakota and New Mexico. Several companies like Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) Chevron (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) have operations in Texas.

To determine the biggest oil companies in USA we used data from Fortune 500 which ranks and provides information on the top 500 companies in the United States. We used revenue profits assets and total employees of the company as per the latest report to calculate our own rankings giving precedence to revenue and assets over profits and employees. After all Amazon was a loss making company just up to a few years ago but was still among the biggest retailers in the world. So without further ado let's take a look at the companies dominating one of the cornerstones of the American economy starting with number 15:

There's nothing inherently unique about the liquified natural gas (LNG) business but the company — along with the supplier Cheniere — want you to think of this liquified natural gas delivery as different: this shipment of gas was deemed ""carbon neutral."" This isn't the only instance of this happening; earlier this year Occidental Petroleum sold a shipload of crude oil it too deemed 100 percent ""carbon neutral.""

How exactly does a massive shipment of crude oil or fossil gas fracked in the United States and shipped across the Atlantic manage to get a ""carbon neutral"" label? The greenhouse gas emissions associated with this drilling is not absorbed or erased. They are zeroed out on paper thanks to an accounting trick: Using credits from carbon offsets.

These emissions illusions are key components to corporate climate pledges. Fortune 500 companies including many fossil fuel polluters have raced out to announce ""net zero"" commitments often accompanied by slick self-congratulatory advertising. But these schemes are more often about image management than pollution reduction; Shell after all plans to grow its fossil fuel business while making ""net zero"" promises.

Shell's ""carbon neutral"" LNG is an instructive case. Where do these ""credits"" come from exactly? Shell's website of ""nature based"" credits lists one project in the United States: The GreenTrees initiative a reforestation project in Louisiana that claims to have protected 120000 acres and planted over 40 million trees. But a recent investigation found that it was paying landowners to do things they had already done on their own — like planting trees or simply not cutting down existing ones — while creating carbon credits to sell to companies like Shell Duke Energy and Microsoft.

This is par for the course. One multimillion-dollar offsets program touts its role protecting threatened trees but much of it is based on selling credits for trees that were in no danger. An investigation into a major aviation emissions offsets program found a range of similar problems. And a deep look at California's multi-billion dollar forest offsets program found millions of ""ghost credits"" purchased by polluters to enable them to continue spewing carbon into the atmosphere.

A meaningful effective offsets program would need to result in verifiable emissions-reducing actions that would not have happened otherwise (what's called ""additionality"" in policy circles). But it's not clear this is possible; the programs being critically scrutinized have been certified by so-called ""independent"" auditors.

While it's bad that corporations are faking it when it comes to climate action the more profound danger is that these programs are actually increasing emissions in the real world — while corporations and government regulators point to spreadsheets that show progress.

Truly effective climate action would require direct emissions reductions at the source. Even the normally cautious industry-friendly International Energy Agency admitted as much in its recent report which drew banner headlines because it spoke an inescapable truth: confronting climate chaos means we must stop drilling and fracking now. But corporate polluters along with politicians and even environmental organizations favor the creation of complex credit markets based on the misguided notion that direct regulation of pollution is too onerous and prescriptive.

These are not just theoretical concerns. The Biden administration is expected to unveil a Clean Electricity Standard designed to create a carbon-free power goal by 2035. But if that standard rests on credits and offsets or on empty promises that gas-fired power plants can be equipped with ""carbon capture"" technology we will fail. Creative accounting cannot rescue us from the climate catastrophe.

There is an alternative: A bona fide renewable energy standard based on clear regulations that requires a rapid shift away from burning fossil fuels. Renewable portfolio standards have been among our most effective means of reducing localized pollution and climate emissions. These proven success stories must be emulated and expanded nationally. We have no time not to embrace the most effective method to reign in the urgent threat posed by our climate crisis.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMTMvc2hlbGwtY29uc2lkZXJpbmctc2FsZS1vZi1ob2xkaW5ncy1pbi1sYXJnZXN0LXVzLW9pbC1maWVsZC5odG1s0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjEvMDYvMTMvc2hlbGwtY29uc2lkZXJpbmctc2FsZS1vZi1ob2xkaW5ncy1pbi1sYXJnZXN0LXVzLW9pbC1maWVsZC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shell considering sale of holdings in largest U.S. oil field worth up to $10 billion,"Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell is reviewing its holdings in the largest oil field in the United States for a possible sale as the company looks to focus on its most profitable oil-and-gas assets and grow its low-carbon investments according to sources familiar with the matter.

The sale could be for part or all of Shell's about 260000 acres (105200 hectares) in the Permian Basin located mostly in Texas. The holdings could be worth as much as $10 billion the sources said on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.

CNBC has independently confirmed that a sale is not imminent but ongoing talks with a buyer or potentially multiple buyers are ongoing. Some of the acreage in question is part of a joint venture with Occidental .

Shell declined to comment.

Shell is one of the world's largest oil companies all of which have been under pressure from investors to reduce fossil-fuel investments to stem changes to the global climate brought on by carbon emissions. Shell BP Plc and TotalEnergies have pledged to lower emissions through increased investment in renewables while divesting some oil and gas holdings.

Mergers and acquisitions activity in the top U.S. shale field jumped in the last year as some firms sought to bolster holdings and others looked to take advantage of rising prices to sell. U.S. oil futures are up 49% this year to nearly $72 per barrel more than double their 2020 low as oil demand returned with the pandemic ebbing.

Earlier this year Shell set out one of the sector's most ambitious climate strategies with a target to cut the carbon intensity of its products by at least 6% by 2023 20% by 2030 45% by 2035 and by 100% by 2050 from 2016 levels. However a Dutch court said last month that Shell's efforts are not enough ordering it to lower emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels.

Last month the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a report that investments in new fossil fuel projects should stop immediately if consumers wanted to meet U.N.-backed targets aimed at limiting global warming.

Oil majors including Shell say the world will need substantial new investment in oil and gas for some years to come to meet demand for motor fuels and chemicals.

Shell's oil and gas production in the Permian from company-operated and non-operated rigs averaged 193000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020 around 6% of its total output that year according to its website.

The Permian produces roughly 4.5 million barrels of oil a day or about 40% of overall U.S. production.

More deal-making could take place this year with Chevron Exxon Mobil and others looking to shed unwanted assets and raise cash according to industry experts. Last week Occidental Petroleum agreed to sell some of its Permian holdings to Colgate Energy for $508 million in a move to reduce its debt.

Most Permian deals this year have been concluded at between $7000 and $12000 per acre said Andrew Dittmar an M&A analyst at energy researcher Enverus.

Rising activity has pushed up prices. In April closely held DoublePoint Energy sold to Pioneer Natural Resources for about $40000 per acre a level not seen since the 2014-2016 rush by producers to grab positions in the Permian.

Several smaller shale companies including KKR-owned Independence Energy have combined this year. A lack of interest in oil IPOs have private equity owners aiming to increase their production while awaiting investor interest in new offerings.

The long delay has not only deprived people to use the road in time but it has also swelled the project cost by more than double (122 per cent) than the original estimation they added.

The RHD has recently sought revision of the SASEC-I: Joydebpur-Elenga road widening project for the fifth time seeking one and a half years more time from the latest completion schedule in June 2021.

Earlier the government revised the project four times following failure of the state-owned road developer to complete the construction work.

Three lenders - the Asian Development Bank (ADB) OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) and Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (AFD) - are involved with the project as co-financers.

A senior official of the Planning Commission (PC) said the RHD recently sought revision of the project for the fifth time from the commission after the failure of completing the 70-km Joydebpur-Elenga highway widening work.

""We are scrutinising the RHD's revised proposal. If we find its justification we will approve it with necessary recommendations"" said the PC official.

He opined that the project had already been delayed for years which was unexpected.

The RHD with the financial support of the government ADB OFID and AFD started widening of Joydebpur-Elenga highway into a four-lane one with lanes for slow-moving vehicles on its both sides in a bid to connect north and western Bangladesh with the central part (Dhaka).

The highway would also establish cross-border connection with India and increase regional connectivity with other South Asian nations.

The RHD undertook the project in March 2013 at Tk 27.88 billion cost with an aim of completing the road development work within five years (March 2018).

Failing to complete the work at the original cost the government revised the project for the first time extending its cost by Tk 2.78 billion to Tk 30.67 billion without enhancing the deadline.

The RHD failed again and the government allowed a 'special revision' extending the cost to Tk 33.65 billion but kept the project completion schedule same (March 2018).

The RHD failed that time too and had got another revision (second revision) with both time and cost extension. The government increased the project cost to Tk 55.93 billion and the completion schedule to June 2020.

But the RHD became unsuccessful again. The government awarded yet another 'special revision' to the project extending the cost to Tk 62.14 billion and the time to June 2021.

However the entire time period of eight years and three months was not enough for the RHD to complete the road widening work.

So this time the agency has sought fifth revision and extension of one and a half years more time to December 2022 from the PC for completing the project.

It has cut the project cost by a marginal amount of Tk 184.1 million to Tk 62.14 billion in its proposal.

When asked a RHD official replied that their work had been delayed due to spells of lockdown in early last year and this year for the Covid pandemic.

""Our construction work has almost finished. The remaining work will be completed within this year.""

""But we are keeping another year in our hand as the defect liability period of the project. During this period the contractors will be liable for any defect of their construction work"" he added.

A member at the PC told the FE that the government had invested millions of dollars for training up its manpower during the last 50 years but their capacities were still in a deplorable level.

When a 70-km road widening work required nearly 10 years to complete how the country would get financial and economic return from the project the PC member questioned.

""We give reminders to the project implementing agencies several times every year but the outcome is dissatisfactory. The agencies should be more proactive in completing their projects by ensuring quality of implementation"" he added.

The Razorbacks entered the day with 102 homers three behind Old Dominion which was eliminated by Virginia last weekend in the NCAA Columbia (S.C.) Regional.

Robert Moore homered twice Cullen Smith hit a grand slam and Charlie Welch left the park for the second consecutive game to lead the onslaught.

Moore's two-home run game was the 11th by a Razorback this season and the third by Moore joining efforts against Murray State and at South Carolina.

Every home run extends the single-season school record which had been 98 in 2018 entering the year.

50 WINS

Coach Dave Van Horn notched his first 50-win season with the Razorbacks as Arkansas improved to 50-11.

""I mean 50s a big number"" Van Horn said. ""We've won a lot of games. We still have work to do. We're not going to get all carried away about it. It'll probably be something we talk about when the season's over but we've got to keep winning.""

Van Horn has won 50-plus games in three other seasons with a 51-11 NCAA Division II championship season at Central Missouri State in 1994 a 51-17 season at Nebraska in 2000 and a 50-16 season with the Cornhuskers the following season. Nebraska qualified for the College World Series in each of those two seasons.

Arkansas has won 50-plus games in four seasons the first three under coach Norm DeBriyn in the Southwest Conference: 51-15 in 1985; 51-16 in 1987; and 51-16 in 1989. The Razorbacks went to the College World Series in each of those seasons.

NO FRANKLIN

Arkansas played without center fielder Christian Franklin in the super regional opener as the junior sat out with a case of strep throat.

Franklin had started in center field in 59 of the previous 60 games.

Van Horn said he might consider holding Franklin out again today or bringing him in midway through the game.

Senior Braydon Webb played center field and batted leadoff as Van Horn shuffled his defense and lineup to cover for Franklin.

Freshman Cayden Wallace moved to left field for the second time in two games and senior Matt Goodheart played right field for the fourth time in the last five games.

Welch was the designated hitter for the sixth time in seven games.

SLAM STATS

Smith's third-inning grand slam which made the score 7-1 was the fourth of the season for the Razorbacks.

The others were by Jacob Nesbit in a 14-1 win over Memphis on March 23 by Goodheart in a 26-1 win over Arkansas-Pine Bluff on April 14 and by Wallace in an 8-4 win over Arkansas State on May 11.

SNEAKY FAST

Casey Opitz is known for throwing out would-be base stealers but the Arkansas catcher showed again in the second inning he's a surprisingly good base stealer.

After Opitz's two-out single North Carolina State pitcher Reid Johnston didn't pay attention to him and Opitz got a huge jump and easily stole second. He then came around for the Razorbacks' third run of the inning on a double by Jalen Battles.

Opitz improved to 6 of 6 on steals this season and 13 of 14 for his career.

SHORT START

Johnston lasted a season-low three innings against the Razorbacks.

Johnston had pitched 6-plus innings in each of his 10 starts and averaged 109 pitches in those games. The Razorbacks worked him for 7 runs on 6 hits including 2 home runs and a walk on 76 pitches.

SLAVENS SLAPS ONE

Arkansas first baseman Brady Slavens hit a two-run double in the sixth inning for his first hit in three NCAA Tournament games since returning from a right ankle injury.

Slavens had been 0 for 7 in two games in the Fayetteville Regional against Nebraska and was 0 for 3 against North Carolina State before his drive to right field off reliever John Miralia scored Goodheart and Wallace.

EARLY HR

For the fifth consecutive postseason game involving the Razorbacks a solo home run was hit in one of the first two innings when North Carolina State's Jose Torres hit a towering shot to left field on Patrick Wicklander's first pitch of the second inning.

In last week's Fayetteville Regional NJIT's Albert Choi led off game one with a home run Goodheart hit a first-inning home run in a 5-1 win over Nebraska the Cornhuskers' Jaxon Hallmark hit a first-inning home run in a 5-3 win over the Hogs and Nebraska's Luke Roskam hit a second-inning home run in the Razorbacks' 6-2 win in the championship game.

ROSTER MOVES

The addition of right-hander Zebulon Vermillion to the 27-man roster for the super regional meant the Razorbacks had to make a corresponding move and it was junior Caleb Bolden who won't pitch this weekend.

[GALLERY: Click here for more photos » arkansasonline.com/612ncsua/]

Van Horn said Bolden had soreness from last Friday's shaky start against NJIT.

""I guess he had some soreness last Friday and maybe he should have told us about it"" he said.

Bolden (2-0 4.50 ERA) had started on four of the last five weekends. He lasted just 1 1/3 innings in last Friday's regional opener against NJIT.

GROUNDHOG DAY

A groundhog traipsed across the field near home plate before the top of the second inning briefly stopped in front of umpire Shawn Rakos then ran toward the first-base dugout and North Carolina State's players and coaches.

The groundhog then ran to the tarp stationed down the right-field line and eventually scampered to safety.

AROUND THE HORN

• Johnston hit Wallace in the back with a 1-1 pitch in the third inning the 11th hit batter by the right-hander and the seventh time Wallace has been hit.

• Former long-time Grambling State baseball coach Wilbert Ellis served as the NCAA representative at the super regional.

That’s when the idea to turn an old hotel and surrounding 10-acre property on Scott Avenue into a hub for social services was first made public.

Thanks to the generosity and efforts of many and $3.5 million in CARES money the idea is becoming a reality. And the name is about to change.

The Hazel House of Hope is the unofficial title now tied to the project.

Jonathan Board interim director for nonprofit Morgantown Community Resources which owns and operates the property said he can’t confirm the name change.

But he can confirm what’s taking place in the 110000-square-foot facility.

Bartlett Housing Solutions The Salvation Army and The United Way of Monongalia and Preston Counties are currently operating in the building.

And there’s more on the way. Board said that of the roughly 300 rooms in the building there are only 15 or so that aren’t either occupied or under negotiation to some degree.

That’s not to mention a 5000-square-foot first-floor sobering center that according to Morgantown Communications Director Andrew Stacy is still on track to open this fall.

“The city is working to establish the nonprofit agency that will oversee the sobering center” Stacy said noting a board of directors is also being assembled. “City administration is also preparing to post the executive director job in the next week or two and is working to finalize some branding for the facility.”

Board said there are also announcements coming regarding use of some of the surrounding land.

“There are numerous discussions being had as to what to do with that” Board said. “I’m certain that announcements will be made soon in reference to very creative problem solving-type solutions for housing and shelter and all sorts of things.”

One of the hurdles facing the concept is transportation as many of the services relocating to Scott Avenue were once clustered in and around the downtown.

Mountain Line’s current service to Scott Avenue operates from 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday through Saturday.

Mountain Line CEO Dave Bruffy said the transit authority budgeted for 2500 additional service hours in the upcoming fiscal year which equates to about $185000. He said service could be extended from 7:30 a.m.-10 p.m. seven days a week for about $140000.

After getting some additional information about the lunch and dinner programs being provided by The Salvation Army Bruffy said Mountain Line is ready to begin route planning.

“We will likely begin the expanded service in August” Bruffy said. “We will be looking at seven-day-a-week service starting earlier and running later — exact times yet to be determined.”

Board said the progress made on the project thus far is thanks in large part to the generosity of everyone from Mark Nesselroad and the Hazel Ruby McQuain Charitable Trust who first acquired the property to various contractors and support service personnel who opted not to bill for their work.

He said Morgantown Community Resources is committed to following suit.

“Morgantown Community Resources is not here to make money. It’s here to provide dignity and hope and shelter and food. So that is our goal” he said. “It’s very exciting. Lots of incredible things are happening here.”

Over the past week that's exactly what's happened to Virginia closer Stephen Schoch thanks to the Cavaliers' dramatic win in the Columbia Regional and an interview that the righty gave after icing a midday 3-2 elimination game victory over South Carolina.

The chat went viral and so did Schoch who has since changed his Twitter bio (@bigdonkey47) to: ""UVA baseball thrower guy #37 I talked about Dippin Dots on tv once and now idk what's going on.""

You didn't know Kenny Powers played for Virginia?



Well you do now 😂 @UVABaseball @bigdonkey47 pic.twitter.com/S6RJYAziNC — ACC Network (@accnetwork) June 6 2021

To find out what exactly is going on we tracked down Schoch who is still in Columbia where the Hoos face Dallas Baptist (Saturday noon ESPNU and ESPN App) to see who will advance to the College World Series.

Ryan McGee: First things first. How many times per day do people mispronounce your last name? (It's pronounced ""Shock."")

Stephen Schoch: Well it doesn't happen as much now as it did a week ago [laughs]. It's always been pretty much every day. Just last weekend I went to the Old Dominion-South Carolina game and I was in my Virginia stuff and getting heckled pretty good. All of a sudden these three guys were calling it out like ""Skoshe!"" I shoot back at them ""Hey learn how to say my name before you yell at me!"" It ended up being three scouts from the Rays Astros and White Sox. Then I was like ""OK cool actually you guys can call me whatever you want.""

McGee: What's the last week been like for you? Not just the internet fame but quick reminder Virginia also blasted its way into the super regional in super dramatic fashion.

Schoch: The winning part that's all that really matters. I'm like that ... all the time. I'm just kind of a weird guy and I say whatever's on my mind. Especially right after I've pitched because my mind has been in all sorts of different places. I guess that's what that interview finally captured [laughs]. But all that's really mattered is that we've kept winning and I've gotten to keep on playing college baseball. Because the NCAA isn't going to throw me another year just because I said something in a TV interview about Dippin' Dots. All this attention is awesome. But it isn't nearly as awesome as getting to play baseball for the University of Virginia for this much longer.

McGee: You know I was the sideline reporter for the BYU-Coastal Carolina football game back in December and BYU has all those dudes who are like 28 years old. That's you too right?

Schoch: Totally. Everyone is always saying ""old guy"" this and that on Twitter. I tell them you have to mix it up y'all. Now I will give credit to one guy who said ""This 50-year-old needs to calm down on the mound before he blows out a hip."" And I can't lie to you he hit the nail on the head because after the first inning against South Carolina (a save earned in a regional elimination game) my hip did get a little tight and I was thinking maybe I do need to relax a little and do some stretching in the dugout.

McGee: How old are you?

Schoch: 24.

Really excited for my team to be advancing to the Super Regionals. We played one hell of a game today.



Just wanted to clear one thing up since I've been getting a lot of messages from strangers: I am not 40 years old I'm 24. pic.twitter.com/D2vkDbbOgj — Stephen Schoch (@bigdonkey47) June 8 2021

McGee: But in everyone's defense that's old for a college baseball player. And with that haircut and beard your headshot looks like a photo of a Civil War soldier.

Schoch: [Laughing] Yeah people say that but I've also looked like this ever since I've been in college. I've just always looked really old. I have shaved it off before but then when I see myself in the mirror I don't even recognize myself. I always fall into that trap around Halloween wanting to see if I will look good with just a mustache so I will pick a costume of a guy who has a mustache. One year it was Magnum P.I. And I just realized that saying that probably doesn't help with the old guy comments does it?

McGee: UVa is your third college baseball team. You're a sixth-year grad student. Where all have you played and why?

Schoch: I am from Maryland but I first went to Appalachian State [in 2016] and loved it there but my coach was told his services were no longer needed so I transferred closer to home at UMBC. I had to sit out a year because of the transfer rules then. I had a great time at UMBC because the coaches there let me be myself.

McGee: We all saw you throw your glove out of the stadium like you were mad at it after a big win in the regionals. But that's nothing new right? UMBC just tweeted about a glove launch after a big win several years ago.

My favorite @bigdonkey47 story is that our baseball team was playing FDU in a super early afternoon game my boss' office overlooks the field but is obstructed so we couldn't see the infield. We knew we won when we saw a single glove go absolutely flying into the outfield. — Zach Seidel (@Seidel_Z) June 8 2021

Schoch: The first time I threw my glove after a win was probably four years ago. It was after the Bethesda Big Trains had just won the championship game against the Baltimore Redbirds.

McGee: The who beat the who in the what now?

Schoch: This was the championship of the Cal Ripken Collegiate Baseball League in 2017. Me and all my teammates we looked up to this one guy who played in the local softball league named Rick Davis. In slow-pitch softball they have the rule where you can only have so many runs but he didn't care if the bases were loaded or empty or whatever. He was going to hit a bomb and let everyone in the park know about it. I'd sit there in the bullpen and watch him for eight innings and not get fired up? Yeah right.

I had a play at first and the runner tried to slap the ball out of my glove. It made me mad so instead of punching him and starting a brawl I threw the glove with the ball in it out of the ballpark. If you think about it that was really a pacifist approach.

McGee: So your inspiration was a dude playing softball next to the field where you played summer ball? Rick Davis. Was he like a mechanic or a preacher or a mailman or something?

Schoch: I never asked because in my mind he was whatever I thought he was. It's more fun to imagine it. But a competitor is a competitor no matter where they play or what they play.

McGee: So you played at UMBC three years 2017-19 and right smack in the middle of that is when we all learned who the Retrievers were because they famously beat top seed Virginia in the 2018 NCAA men's basketball tournament ... and then after you graduated UMBC you transferred to Virginia? How did that play?

Schoch: In grad school the first thing you do is an icebreaker and you go around the room and tell everyone who you are and where you're coming from. So that was always a tough one to let out there in Charlottesville. But it was awesome to be at UMBC when that happened. Since we've made it to the super regionals you think I can say that and it be OK?

McGee: Sure. Just like you can talk about caves and Dippin' Dots. It's OK because you clinched a gigantic postseason win. Speaking of I'm sure there are people who think the beard and that interview are just part of all the goofy stuff we see players and teams do during the college baseball postseason but I get the feeling that's probably how you talk all the time.

Schoch: For the last 24 years of my life that's how I've been. That's how I've always talked. But that day was the first time that someone had televised me hitting myself in the head for 20 minutes straight and then put a headset on me and said ""You know what live TV needs this guy.""

McGee: Do you punch yourself in the head on a regular basis?

Schoch: Yeah I only do that on days of the week that end with a 'Y.' I do it anytime I'm thinking. But especially after I've thrown a bad pitch. I don't want to feel good about myself after that so I go to the back of mound whisper a few sweet nothings into my own ear. What I think about myself in that moment -- nothing good -- and then I'll hit myself in the head and tell myself to believe all the thoughts and go for it.

McGee: You had always dreamed of playing at Virginia and finally had that chance but then COVID happened and your 2020 season was taken away. Now here you are with a second chance and every game you play that could be your final pitching appearance your last game. You clearly love the game but does all that make you appreciate this more right now?

Schoch: I am so thankful that I got to come back this year. COVID made me appreciate it more but also I stepped away from school between seasons summer and fall to go work and earn some money. I did landscaping because I thought it was like working out but if you attack landscaping like you attack relief pitching you end up hurting yourself.

McGee: Like don't hit yourself in the head with a rake when you mess up?

Schoch: Something like that. So I took a job in insurance sales. You know what I learned then? Stephen Schoch isn't really built to be behind a desk. I was making about 250 cold calls a day and maybe talking to four people a day. I wasn't good at it at the time. After quarantine I had kind of forgotten how to communicate with other humans. I didn't hate it. I enjoyed going into the office. But it really made me realize that if I had a chance to come back and play baseball one more season I was going to make the most of it. I was really going to enjoy being on a team being with my teammates. I was really going to get the most I could out of it.

McGee: And by getting the most out of it you mean getting free Dippin' Dots.

Schoch: I have had so many amazing interactions on social media since that interview but how about the CEO of Dippin' Dots reaching out to me on Instagram? I'm hoping that once my amateurism is up I can do some things with him and help him spread the Dippin' Dots gospel.

Follow your dreams kids. Thank you @DippinDots @ScottFischerCEO the whole teams lovin em! pic.twitter.com/CxPGBdjUXM — Stephen Schoch (@bigdonkey47) June 10 2021

McGee: It kind of makes you wish that the NCAA had this name/image/likeness thing worked out already ...

Schoch: Right? I wish they could have gotten some of this NIL legislation passed sooner. But what I really wish is that now so many people have offered me free Dippin' Dots in that interview I wish I had said that the fan offered to buy me a Lamborghini you know?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpcmdpbmlhYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbWNsZWFuLXNob3BwaW5nLWNlbnRlci1wdXJjaGFzZWQtZm9yLTMyLTFtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McLean shopping center purchased for $32.1M,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/mclean-shopping-center-purchased-for-32-1m/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpcmdpbmlhYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbWNsZWFuLXNob3BwaW5nLWNlbnRlci1wdXJjaGFzZWQtZm9yLTMyLTFtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The problems began as a high demand for freezers when people were stockpiling food at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. It snowballed from there into a long-term shortage of semiconductors that has left Dakota TV & Appliance as well as other local businesses high and dry while trying to maintain profits and salvage relationships with increasingly impatient customers.

Semiconductors create partial currents of electricity that power a wide range of electrical products from vehicles to dishwashers and other appliances. The creation of these items have been left at a standstill with many still out of work due to the pandemic. Semiconductors are needed to create computer chips. Most appliances sold today regardless of whether they are ""smart appliances."" need computer chips to function.

“A lot of these appliances are electronically driven instead of mechanical” Schneider said. “If the brains of the operation aren’t built we’re at a standstill. We’re going to probably be able to get some of the run-of-the-mill stuff but as far as some of the higher-end (appliances) and smart technology it’s going to be a challenge for all these manufacturers trying to grab from the same source.”

At Dakota TV & Appliance the wait for a new appliance that is not in stock has ballooned to a range of one to six months. Sales have remained steady but Schneider is trying his best to temper his customers’ expectations on when they can expect a new appliance to be delivered.

“We all as consumers got into the Amazon way of life where if I didn’t have it it was here in a week” Schneider said. “That was our standard before this. Usually we’d have a loaner if your fridge stopped working. That could buy us a week but now we’ve got really nice houses using what is their ‘beer fridge’ normally and that’s in their house right now until their fridge that they ordered last summer gets here.”

Schneider said the store has made a point to keep as much stock of appliances that are easier to come by as possible in an offsite warehouse. Customers who need an appliance replaced in a pinch may have to compromise their wish list if they want an immediate replacement.

“We’ve been steadily having orders in the system on mass-moving products” Schneider said. “(We’re) trying to put together packages that might not be the thing you wanted the most it might not be the exact model but it gives you an option to put something in your house because stuff happens. If your fridge dies you need a new fridge. You’ve got to have something.”

Luckily we have a group of guys that have been here a long time” Schneider said. “You can kind of tell when someone’s feeling down and when a guy needs a pat on the back. It’s not fun giving bad news. Who likes to do that? We all want to give good news and make everyone happy but over the past year you almost become a little numb to it.”

The microchip shortage has had an adverse effect on the car industry as well. Rydell Chevrolet Marketing Director Morgan Hibma said in a statement that she and her coworkers have had to change the way they do business to accommodate for the shortage including a system in which customers can sell their own used vehicles to Rydell.

“Like all dealerships across the country we have been impacted by the semiconductor microchip shortage” Hibma said. “All new car dealerships have experienced a level of disruption in the supply chain. We have both new and used vehicles available and are happy to help guests order their next vehicle. We have also introduced our RydellBuys program where we will buy someone’s vehicle without them having to buy one of ours.”

Grand Forks Subaru owner Matt Bredemeier has been dealing with a lack of stock since March 2020 as well.

“We just don’t have the inventory” Bredemeier said. “We’re down (from) what we normally carry by about 50%. The plants first shut down for a little bit after COVID hit in April because the manufacturers were affected by it as well. There were times when they were shut down for a week or two at a time.”

Bredemeier said the past six months of issues with obtaining microchips has caused the dealership to change the way it sells cars. Many customers are buying cars before they arrive at the dealership.

However he believes this change will not be permanent. Representatives from Subaru have assured him that help is coming.

“It’s changed the way we do business” Bredemeier said. “People are buying cars out of what we have incoming so they’re being pre-sold before they get here. The transports will come here with our inventory and kind of turn around and customers pick them up that way. Starting in July Subaru will be back up to its usual allocations (of stock). We’ll be at about 90% of a normal allocation. They said after July every month from there will be better and better and we’ll be back to normal by fourth quarter.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlbHNpbmtpdGltZXMuZmkvY2hpbmEtbmV3cy8xOTQwNi1uYXRpb24tcy1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLWluZHVzdHJ5LWF0LWEtdHVybmluZy1wb2ludC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nation's semiconductor industry at a turning point,"United States sanctions on technology exports to China as well as pandemic-related supply chain disruptions have caused a severe chip shortage. Businesses and consumers around the world are now facing growing supply concerns.

Recently there has been much news about the global shortage of semiconductor chips. Some pundits have called it a crisis because China is the world's largest consumer of semiconductors taking up more than 50 percent of the global supply and yet its production of high-end chips is limited.

The first tipping point arose when former US president Donald Trump began imposing sanctions on chip exports to key Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei causing a plethora of disruptions in the entire semiconductor industry worldwide.

Over the years China has relied heavily on imports of high-end chips as it followed the rules of globalization and a natural division of labor across different economies in the world. High-end semiconductor chips involve significant inherent risks and the industry requires huge upfront investment. Therefore a division of labor across the world with key parts of the value chain concentrated in the hands of a few players in specific geographies makes sense.

However the US sanctions on chips supplies to China have disrupted these fundamentals. China has realized that self-sufficiency in core technologies such as semiconductors will be critical going forward.

China's move toward self-sufficiency in semiconductors raises new questions on the future of existing global players. Peter Wennink CEO of ASML a leading manufacturer of lithography equipment for the production of computer chips recently told news outlet Politico that Europe should not restrain exports to China like the US has done. Beyond exports foreign players also need to integrate with China's ecosystems with a local presence.

The push for self-sufficiency by China the world's largest chips buyer is driving further advancements in new technologies. The semiconductor industry has become a national top priority. The 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) calls for an increase in research and development spending of more than 7 percent annually in those five years focusing on key technology areas including semiconductors.

Under the nation's Made in China 2025 industrial plan 70 percent of the semiconductors it uses are to be produced domestically by 2025.

China is making progress in technology and innovation. The Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics reported a breakthrough in laser lithography technology last year which is expected to lead to domestic production of advanced lithography machines. However this is still at an early stage and years away from commercialization.

In May last year Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp began mass production of Kirin 710A chips for Huawei and now Huawei builds hardware with a foundry other than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. In October SMIC said it would soon produce 7-nanometer wafers for the Chinese market. In addition China Electronics Technology Group Corp has developed a series of homegrown ion implanters enabling production of 28-nanometer wafers a crucial industry component.

China's moves in the semiconductor industry are reshaping the industry's global dynamics. Major US suppliers including Qualcomm have reported lower revenues and are lobbying against sanctions on exports to China. Industry experts are expecting the US share in the global semiconductor market to drop about 10 percent and revenue to decline more than 20 percent in the next three to five years.

As an attempt to address such issues the China Semiconductor Industry Association and the US-based Semiconductor Industry Association have formed a working group to discuss how to resolve issues such as intellectual property trade policy and encryption.

The rise of Chinese players as well as the actions of the US the European Union and other governments will make competition in the industry more intense. China's semiconductor industry has clearly entered a new era as its competitiveness is sharpening and its structure is changing. Supply and value chains in the rest of the world are changing accordingly.

Different types of players are jostling for position in the evolving value chain. Incumbents and disrupters foreign and local along with State-owned and privately owned enterprises are looking to compete innovate and collaborate.

TSMC's latest investments may solidify its position globally. In April TSMC earmarked $2.87 billion to expand its Nanjing facilities and announced plans for a $12 billion factory in the US state of Arizona covering two major global markets.

The European Union also outsources a lot of its design and manufacturing capabilities and is now offering subsidies for new chip plants in Europe. The industry is moving toward the more advanced 5- 3－and 2-nm chips.

Moore's law which posits that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles every two years or so seems to have reached its limit and innovation in the semiconductor industry may have reached a bottleneck. Disruptions in core semiconductor technologies could take place potentially resulting in major structural changes in the industry.

Japan is opening up its semiconductor sector to cooperation with outside firms chiefly TSMC after losing its global leadership position

By Tim Culpan / Bloomberg Opinion





As much as the US pines for the good old days of global semiconductor supremacy Japan feels its loss of glory even more.

Once a dominant name in electronic components the nation has been overtaken by Taiwan South Korea and more recently China. Yet Tokyo might have a viable plan to revitalize its domestic sector.

“Unlike the purely domestic independent way it was done in the past I think we need to cooperate with overseas counterparts” Akira Amari a former economy minister and senior member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party told Bloomberg News’ Isabel Reynolds and Emi Nobuhiro this week.

That is remarkable pragmatism for a country whose industrial policy has largely revolved around protecting and isolating its companies to preserve national identity. Yet three decades of decline show that past policies are just not cutting it.

In 1988 Japan commanded 50 percent of the global semiconductor industry according to a presentation this month from the Japanese Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry that cited data from research firm Omdia.

Back then names such as NEC Corp Toshiba Corp Hitachi Ltd and Fujitsu Semiconductor Ltd occupied six of the top 10 places in market share alongside US giants Intel Corp and Motorola Solutions Inc.

By 2019 Japan accounted for 10 percent. The US had climbed to 50 percent due to the ascent of chip designers like Qualcomm Inc Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

These US firms rose thanks to a bifurcated business model aided by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC 台積電) an anchor tenant in Taiwan’s noted science parks. The arrangement reflects complementary skill sets. Rather than both design and manufacture a chip as was once the case most US companies now just outsource to foundries like TSMC.

Amari said that TSMC is exactly the type of foreign partner that Japanese companies should work with since it is the world’s largest maker of non-memory semiconductors.

His words carry weight given that he is heading a party working group on chip strategy as part of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s policy to incorporate industry plans into the government’s growth plans.

Japan remains a global leader in the equipment and materials used for production. As chips get increasingly more difficult to make tighter integration across the supply chain is inevitable.

Taiwanese companies including TSMC and United Microelectronics Corp (聯電) have a lot to offer.

The Taiwan-Japan relationship is also becoming one of the closest in East Asia. Tokyo last week donated 1.24 million doses of much-needed COVID-19 vaccine as Taipei struggles to contain an outbreak. They share close trade cultural and tourism ties and feel increasing economic and military tensions from Beijing.

The idea of semiconductor cooperation is not without precedent. More than a decade ago Yukio Sakamoto president of Japan’s then-largest memory chipmaker Elpida Memory Inc tried to rally together a consortium of local and Taiwanese companies to battle against industry giants Samsung Electronics Co and Micron Corp.

Japan’s semiconductor sector was already on the slide. Elpida was formed by the merger of memory divisions from NEC and Hitachi in 1999 a time when the nation’s share had already fallen below 30 percent.

Sakamoto did not think that either the Japanese or Taiwanese firms could survive on their own.

“We don’t have the scale” he said in 2010.

Sakamoto’s proposal fell through amid opposition from Taiwanese companies and political pressure in Taipei. Within two years his company had filed for bankruptcy and Taiwanese rivals largely exited the computer memory industry.

The mood is vastly different now. TSMC in February said it plans to set up a Japan research center primarily centered on materials development so that it can tap into the nation’s deep pool of chemical engineers.

The ministry hopes to take it further and expects to offer strong incentives to lure a foreign chip foundry to Japan Kazumi Nishikawa of the ministry’s IT Industry Division told Bloomberg News.

Politically both governments are crucially aware of the need to cooperate and jointly work with the US to hold off China’s rising strength.

Chinese companies have increased their share of Apple Inc’s orders a benchmark for the global electronics supply chain and Beijing is willing to spend as much as it takes to ensure its chip industry gains traction.

Not content with being the king of chip design the US now sees lack of manufacturing capacity as a threat to national security. Washington is looking to spend more than US$30 billion to get back in the game increasing the urgency for other nations to cement their own plans.

With semiconductors becoming a key weapon in the technology cold war Taipei and Tokyo would be smart to team up.

“It is certainly something that is made in goodwill.” But if private cybersecurity companies and government agencies want to do anything meaningful to combat ransomware which both sides call an urgent national security risk it will require “a step beyond” the traditional public-private partnership Olney said.

“For example not just say ‘I saw this.’ But then I also took time to reverse engineer it and I found this weakness and while I am not legally able to take advantage of that I can give it to you [government agency]” he added. “It’s that sort of additional work to use expertise on my side to prepare the government to do their role in the disruption. That’s the next-step things that we’re thinking about.”

Neil Jenkins chief analytic officer at the Cyber Threat Alliance calls this “active collaboration.”

“It’s not just direction from the government to the private sector to take an action or a request for information” he explained. “It’s an actual routine regular engagement on these prioritized ransomware actors to identify what we know identify what their operational activity is and then through that engagement identify where we can work together to leverage the various authorities that government agencies have and leverage the relationship capabilities that the private sector has with their customers or with their infrastructure to be able to do that disruption.”

Ransomware Task Force’s Recommendations

Both Olney and Jenkins sit on the private-sector led Ransomware Task Force — a 60-member organization that includes dozens of private companies such as Cisco Amazon Web Services Palo Alto Networks and Microsoft along with the FBI U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and other law-enforcement groups.

In late April the group presented the White House with an 81-page report with 48 recommendations to combat ransomware. A week later cybercriminals breached Colonial Pipeline’s systems and shut down a major fuel supply for the East Coast. “And there was dismay but no surprise when that happened” Olney said. “I can’t think of another time where a group of industries has gotten together and said we need help in this way. I come from a security vendor and I’m saying what we’re doing collectively as a society [to combat ransomware] is insufficient.”

Colonial Pipeline’s CEO authorized a $4.4 million ransom payment to restore the critical infrastructure systems however earlier this week the Justice Department recovered about $2.3 million of the ransom paid. Law enforcement tracked the bitcoin payment to a virtual wallet and the FBI somehow had the private key to this wallet which allowed the DOJ to recover the funds.

“In the security community the question is: How did the bureau have the private key for that wallet? And in the legal paperwork for that action they have a throwaway line that just says the private key is in possession of the FBI California office” Olney said adding that this is an example of the type of “creative uses of government power and collaboration with the private sector” that a new Talos report says is needed to disrupt ransomware campaigns.

Olney and Jenkins co-authored the Talos ransomware report. Before heading up the CTA’s analytics efforts Jenkins served in various roles within the Department of Homeland Security Department of Defense and Center for Naval Analyses.

Why a Law-Enforcement Approach Won’t Work

The Talos report says that a traditional law-enforcement approach to ransomware won’t work. “If this is truly a national security problem then it requires a national security solution” Jenkins said.

The Ransomware Task Force wants the government to establish an interagency Joint Ransomware Task Force to lead the country’s ransomware-disruption efforts. This group should include law enforcement agencies like the FBI and U.S. Secret Service as well as the major players in the intelligence community such as the CIA the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the National Security Agency (NSA). It should also include CISA U.S. Cyber Command the State and Treasury departments and possibly other government agencies.

“We believe that the best way to focus this effort is to formalize it under a task force and get people assigned to it where that’s their job” Jenkins said. “Their job is to identify the highest-priority ransomware threat actors and find ways to go after them and disrupt them.”

This of course requires a whole additional layer of collaboration beyond a public-private partnership and cooperation between government agencies may be the tougher nut to crack.

“Both of those are big problems and they are different flavors of issues but a lot of times it comes down to trust and incentives” Jenkins said. “If your work incentives are to arrest somebody then you’re going to be focused on arresting somebody. But if your work incentives within a joint interagency task force are to find ways to disrupt threat actors then suddenly your perspective changes.”

Additionally building trust between groups be it public-private partnerships or an inter-agency task force takes time. “It isn’t something that happens at the snap of a finger because the government calls and says ‘we want you to participate.’ It’s built through engaging in relationships” Jenkins said.

“What I am most concerned about is that the government move beyond treating this problem as a law-enforcement issue” Olney said. “And so I hesitate to celebrate the Department of Justice forming its ransomware task force because we’ve had this problem for many years and we’ve treated it as a law enforcement issue for many years and it’s an insufficient action to dissuade actors from participating in this activity.”

For this reason Olney says it’s critical that a joint ransomware task force exist outside of the DOJ and include the comprehensive list of government agencies that the private-sector Ransomware Task Force proposed in its report. “We need all of these not-always-working-together groups need to come together each with a very important role in ultimately tamping down how active ransomware is.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmFseXRpY3NpbnNpZ2h0Lm5ldC9sYXRlc3QtbmV3cy9leGNsdXNpdmUtaW50ZXJhY3Rpb24taHV6ZWZhLW1vdGl2YWxhLWRpcmVjdG9yLW9mLXN5c3RlbXMtZW5naW5lZXJpbmctaW5kaWEtYW5kLXNhYXJjLXBhbG8tYWx0by1uZXR3b3Jrc9IBnwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmFseXRpY3NpbnNpZ2h0Lm5ldC9hbXAvc3RvcnkvbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MvZXhjbHVzaXZlLWludGVyYWN0aW9uLWh1emVmYS1tb3RpdmFsYS1kaXJlY3Rvci1vZi1zeXN0ZW1zLWVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLWluZGlhLWFuZC1zYWFyYy1wYWxvLWFsdG8tbmV0d29ya3M?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exclusive Interaction Huzefa Motivala Director of Systems Engineering India and SAARC Palo Alto Networks,In our latest episode of the Podcast series Apoorva Komarraju Senior Analyst Analytics Insight speaks to Huzefa Motivala Director of Systems Engineering in India and SAARC at Palo Alto Networks to understand how organizations can safeguard their intellectual data and business assets online through effective cybersecurity solutions and keep hackers from breaking into the business's networks.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vbW9jbzM2MC5tZWRpYS8yMDIxLzA2LzEzL2EtdGFsZS1vZi10d28td2VkZGluZ3Mv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bethesda sisters wed on the same weekend in their parents' backyard,"Sisters Melissa and Rebecca Schefkind had always planned to be each other’s maid of honor—but not on the same weekend.

Prior to the pandemic Rebecca and her fiancé John Friedman planned to wed in May 2020 in front of 150 people at Dumbarton House in Washington D.C. Melissa and her fiancé Alex Fick had booked the Sequoia restaurant in Georgetown for Sept. 5 2020 and started crafting a guest list for their wedding.

But when COVID-19 hit the sisters decided to hold the weddings in their parents’ backyard in Bethesda on the same weekend and to still be each other’s maid of honor. The back-to-back weddings meant their 91-year-old grandmother who lives in Philadelphia would need to make only one trip and the tent they rented could stay up for the weekend. Melissa and Alex wed on Sept. 5 2020 with 11 family members present. Rebecca and John were married the following day in front of 13 guests.

“Maybe some sisters wouldn’t have liked that or [would have] felt like they were sharing the spotlight” Melissa says. “But Rebecca and I never felt that way. It was very much a special thing that we could both be a part of each other’s day.”

Melissa says that she and Rebecca tried to incorporate some of their original plans into their smaller celebrations. The brides wore the dresses they had previously picked out and they used the caterer that Rebecca had contracted. The changing situation did require some creative solutions. Melissa and Alex had planned to have a traditional chuppah a canopy the couple is married under in the Jewish faith. They ultimately decided to have the four posts of the outdoor tent symbolize the chuppah. Through the adjustments they kept the same spirit of the wedding—celebrating their love for each other and the start of their new joint life she says.

Melissa & Alex

The couple: Melissa 33 grew up in Bethesda and graduated from Walt Whitman High School. She is a family law attorney at Bethesda-based New & Lowinger P. C. Alex 33 grew up in Gaithersburg and graduated from Quince Orchard High School. He’s a network engineer for Palo Alto Networks. They recently bought a house in Bethesda.

How they met: The two connected on the dating app Bumble in 2018 and went on a first date at Gringos & Mariachis a Mexican restaurant in Bethesda. Melissa remembers being nervous before meeting him but quickly feeling comfortable. Alex recalls their neighboring table eavesdropping and flashing him a thumbs-up sign after realizing it was a first date. They discovered they both went to the University of Pennsylvania but they don’t remember meeting in college though they may have been in the same chemistry class.

The proposal: In January 2020 Alex created fake tickets for a showing of My Fair Lady and told Melissa that they were going to the Kennedy Center to see the musical. On the balcony outside of the performing arts center Alex proposed. Included on the fake tickets was a QR code that could be scanned to display a message asking Melissa to marry him.

The ceremony: The couple wrote their own vows. “When you do a pandemic wedding and everything is kind of compressed and more intimate it was a nice way to make it even more personal” Melissa says. The officiant led a nondenominational ceremony but Alex stomped on a glass a tradition in the Jewish faith and the pair later made a picture frame with the glass shards.

The reception: A backyard tent had white chiffon drapery and twinkle lights strung from the fabric folds. Guests stayed outdoors and socially distant as they ate dinner.

The dessert: For their pre-pandemic wedding plans Melissa and Alex had decided to order a flavor of cupcake Alex loves. But they felt it wasn’t worth the hassle for the smaller celebration. Melissa’s mom surprised them by ordering the Biscoff cookie-flavored treats anyway.

The toasts: The sisters delivered a maid of honor speech at each other’s wedding and both dissolved into tears while listening. Rebecca spoke about how as the younger sister she always looked up to Melissa. She started by sharing her childhood experiences of stealing Melissa’s clothes and spying on her and her friends. She also spoke of how they became closer as they got older saying Melissa is who she calls for advice. Melissa told of how she always looked out for and tried to protect her younger sister. She shared an anecdote from their childhood: A babysitter was tickling and playing too rough with Rebecca and Melissa kicked the sitter as hard as she could.

The honeymoon: After the wedding Alex and Melissa went on a mini-moon in Georgetown. They booked a hotel for the weekend went kayaking on the Potomac and indulged their tourist side with walks by the Lincoln Memorial Washington Monument and the Kennedy Center—the site of their proposal. Alex says they got to see the attractions that they often overlook.

Rebecca & John

The couple: Rebecca 30 grew up in Bethesda and graduated from Walt Whitman High School. John 33 was raised in upstate New York. They live in the San Francisco Bay Area and both work in advertising Rebecca as an art director and John as a copywriter.

How they met: Though Rebecca and John both went to Syracuse University they didn’t cross paths there. They met in 2015 as colleagues at an advertising agency in Baltimore. They were paired on a project but didn’t want to pursue a relationship until they were no longer coworkers. After John submitted his two-week notice they went out for drinks at Pazo Restaurant in Baltimore to celebrate finishing the project. John recalls realizing at the end of the date that he should be upfront about his interest in dating Rebecca. The feeling was mutual and they soon became exclusive.

The proposal: They dated for about a year before moving to San Francisco together. Rebecca says the cross-country relocation was the true test of their relationship. They realized they could make it even as roommates and were already acting like a married couple. “We’re just better together” John says. “That’s when I think you know.” He decided to propose in December 2018. Their cat Coby a British shorthair has amassed 1.8 million followers on Instagram (@cobythecat) and is an important part of the pair’s lives. John had a collar made that said “Please say yes” and hung the ring from it. When Rebecca had just fallen asleep he woke her up saying that Coby seemed like he needed something. Rebecca bolted up so quickly that she didn’t grab her glasses or notice the collar and ring until John asked her to marry him.

The ceremony: Rebecca walked down the aisle to the song “Clair de Lune.” She says she’s always loved the piano piece and thought it would be a good fit for the intimate setting. After their first kiss they played “Signed Sealed Delivered (I’m Yours).” John says the pair could be more personal in their vows as everyone present was family who knew them well. They each spoke about the other’s sense of humor—Rebecca’s quirkiness and John’s more silly nature. Rebecca also told the story of how they met while John shared that Rebecca is one of the smartest and most driven people he knows.

The dessert: Rebecca says she wanted the cake to look like a classic wedding cake so it was covered with white frosting despite being a chocolate cake with raspberry filling. They gave each guest a hand-painted Coby-shaped cookie.

The honeymoon: Prior to the pandemic the couple had planned for a honeymoon in Thailand. With travel restrictions in place they instead spent a weekend in California’s Big Sur. They have vouchers to make the trip to Thailand once they can safely travel there.

A glamorous Auckland home once owned by Sir John Key appears to be sitting neglected and uninhabited. Neighbours fear it is bringing down the ""feel"" of one of the city's poshest streets.

Former PM Sir John and his wife Bronagh sold the Parnell mansion for $23.5 million in 2017 to a buyer reportedly out of China but neighbours have said they were yet to see anyone move in since the sale.

Now grime has appeared on the home's once immaculately kept walls the garden is unkempt and autumn leaves are piled up against the entry gates.

Neighbours questioned why a buyer would pay a fortune for one of New Zealand's most famous homes only to apparently never visit and fail to maintain the place.

One nearby resident said she felt like sending her son to trim the verge and tidy the fence line.

Another said he was concerned by the state of the ghost house.

""We don't want the best house in the street going backwards it is a bad example for everyone"" the man said.

""He doesn't even cut the front little lawn.""

The mega mansion became one of New Zealand's most recognisable homes during Key's stint as prime minister.

It not only served as a setting for political get-togethers but also became a backdrop on social media.

The sparkling pool in particular became instantly recognisable as the backdrop for son Max's many video blogs music videos and viral photos of his famous dad.

After stepping down as PM Key said he would sell the five-bedroom home.

That led to the $23.5m sale of the 763sq m house and its 1752sq m of land in 2017.

Although the home sold in 2017 the deal wasn't officially settled until 2019.

Just months later New Zealand went into lockdown and closed its borders to all but Kiwi citizens and residents as Covid-19 swept the world.

None of the neighbours spoken to by the Herald on Sunday had seen the new buyer since the purchase.

""I walk past that gate at least three times a week with my dog"" one said.

""And I'm always having a look because I used to see John in there quite often and say 'g'day'.""

""So I've been concerned about what is going on.""

He said the sale had caught the attention of residents up and down the street.

""I've always been interested in it everybody has when they heard the price"" he said.

""And I thought 'Well what's going to happen?' - but nothing has happened.""

He said he'd heard a number of homes in the area were owned by offshore buyers.

""There are some very rich people that come here for two or three weeks of the year and think 'that's marvellous' and go back again"" he said.

Another neighbour called the condition of the home's garden and exterior ""sheer neglect"".

She worked as a gardener and said it was sad to see the state of the home's garden especially compared to how the Keys had kept it.

""It's unfortunate to see any property neglected whether it is here or in any neighbourhood"" she said.

""And presumably if no one is tending the inside of the house then it is similarly neglected.""

Some other neighbours said they hadn't noticed the state of the house and one said he didn't see what the problem was as any buyer was free to do what they wanted with their property.

Blue’s Clues & You released a singalong video with Nina West the week before in which cartoon animals from various “gay” demographics take part in a pride parade. Sasha A. Cohen who will appear in Nickelodeon’s Danger Force will be the first openly transgender teen performer in a live-action show.

The song asks:

“doesn’t it just fill you with pride showing who you are on the inside? With a pride flag up high be true to you Purple means spirit believing you have the power and strength within yourself to do whatever you dream.”

The drag queen then points out the colors that he says are meant to represent transgender individuals as well as specific skin colors.

“Baby blue pink and white represent transgender people because every letter in LGBTQ+ is equal and black and brown represent the queer and trans people of color we’re all in this together so wave that pride flag way up high. Go big! Be kind! Be you! Never have to hide yourself away there’s a place for you.

Every color on the pride flag is a symbol in the sky. And I’m proud to be me every time that I see that pride flag waving high! ”

Are ready for this cringe? Will your kids enjoy this? This isn’t a clip from John Waters’ film. It’s a clip from Nickelodeon.

Breitbart reports that this hard left move of pushing LGBTQ+ propaganda to kids is causing the kids network ratings to crater.

The good news is that this push has resulted in a catastrophic ratings collapse for these corporate wokesters…

What had regularly been a top-rated cable network pre-grooming can now barely attract a third of its audience from 2017.

In July of 2017 Nickelodeon was averaging around 1.2 million viewers per week. Since February of this year the channel has not been able to push its average viewership over 400000. Last month the numbers crashed as low as just 328000.

Just last week during primetime Nickelodeon’s average primetime viewership was just 395000. Its total day average was just 372000.

Basically what that means is that about 1/10th of one percent of the population is tuning in to this garbage.

It’s simply beyond my comprehension what it must be like for parents of young children to try and navigate increasingly aggressive cultural institutions attempting to groom their kids with this kind of adult sexuality. The monsters at Disney are doing the same so are the public schools and then there’s the Internet.

But this is what leftists love most corrupting your children hoping it will confuse and twist them into something they can exploit.

Maybe Nickelodeon is going after the drag queen demo now?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYXVkaWdhemV0dGUuY29tLnNhL2FydGljbGUvNjA3NzI4L1dvcmxkL0V1cm9wZS9VcnN1bGEtdm9uLWRlci1MZXllbi1zYXlzLUc3LWdsb2JhbC1zdHJhdGVneS1oYXMtbm8tc3RyaW5ncy1hdHRhY2hlZC11bmxpa2UtQ2hpbmHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ursula von der Leyen says G7 global strategy has 'no strings attached' unlike China,"LONDON — The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has told Euronews that plans discussed by G7 leaders to help the world's developing countries come ""without strings attached"" in comparison to China.



In an exclusive interview from the G7 summit in southwest England she said the Group of Seven nations and China were ""strong competitors"" in the economic field and ""systemic rivals"" when it came to human rights and democracy.



On Saturday G7 leaders backed a vast global infrastructure plan for developing and emerging countries to rival the Chinese ""Belt and Road"" project. The ""Build Back Better World"" initiative had been announced earlier by US President Joe Biden.



The Commission president referred to the EU's own ""Connecting Europe and Asia"" strategy launched in 2019 and aimed at boosting mutual prosperity for the people of both continents.



""(Where) the connectivity initiative is concerned we discussed intensively (at the G7) that it is important to bring forward this connectivity initiative and make sure we have the better and the more convincing model"" von der Leyen told Euronews' Jack Parrock.



Citing the power of the G7 she added that ""it is first important to convince our partners with us the investment comes without strings attached compared to China"".



Commenting on the dispute between the EU and the UK over post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland Ursula von der Leyen said peace and stability on the island of Ireland and respect for the Good Friday Agreement were of paramount importance.



""We've shown a lot of flexibility; we expect our British friends to show the same flexibility and just to do their job and implement what we have agreed upon"" she said.



""It's the one and only solution to solve the questions connected with Brexit on the island of Ireland and it's a good solution so we should move forward now."" — Euronews",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL25ld2J1c2luZXNzZXRoaW9waWEuY29tL21hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmcvbG9jYWwtZWRpYmxlLW9pbC1jb21wbGV4ZXMtYXJlLW9mLXBhcmFtb3VudC1pbXBvcnRhbmNlLXRvLW1lZXQtZGVtYW5kLWdlbmVyYXRlLWZvcmV4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local edible oil complexes are of paramount importance to meet demand generate forex – New Business Ethiopia,"According to the Global Agricultural Information Network (GAIN) Ethiopia’s oilseeds annual report the total production of sesame seed Niger seed and soybeans during the coming September and October of 2020/21 marketing year is estimated to reach 705000 metric tons slightly down by 0.3 percent over previous year.

With expansion of acreage and improved yields due to good weather conditions production of soybeans and nigger seed is expected to increase nearly by 14 percent and 2 percent respectively; whereas sesame seed production is estimated to drop by 9 percent because of reduction in planted area.

The projected impact of COVID-19 on supply chain disruptions on one hand has pushed farmers to slash sesame seed plantings and shift to cultivation of food crops mainly sorghum to enhance local supply. On the other hand the expansion of local edible oil complexes and integrated agro-industries in the country is anticipated to stimulate oilseeds production to meet the rapidly growing local demand for cooking oils as well as livestock feed.

Ethiopia’s oilseed sector plays an important role in generating foreign exchange earnings and supporting the livelihoods of market actors across the value chain. Oilseed crops are the third largest foreign exchange earners next to coffee and cut flowers and the oilseeds of sesame soybean and nigger seed contribute to nearly 17 percent of Ethiopia’s agricultural exports. During October and September of the 2019/20 marketing year exports of sesame nigger seed and soybeans generated 376 million USD in foreign exchange earnings. A survey report of Central Statistics Agency (CSA) shows close to 1.4 million farmers produce oilseed crops in the country.







According to the 2016 report of the Ethiopian Central Statistics Agency the country has annual potential of producing more than 784809 tons of oil seeds. However Ethiopia is importing more than 350 million metric tons of subsidized palm oil per annum mainly due to challenges in the oil value chain in the country.

Currently however different new industrial edible oil complexes have been launched and become operational in Ethiopia aimed at improving access to edible oil and joining the global edible oil market. Beyond this the factories aspire competing in the global edible oil market and generate hard currency for the country through supplying quality edible oil.

As a result the 5.2 billion Birr worth W.A. Industrial Edible Oil Complex owned by Ethiopian business tycoon Worku Aytenew which was inaugurated recently in Debre Markos town of Amhara State is of paramount importance to meet the ever-growing demand. The W.A. Industrial Edible Oil Complex is carefully choreographing to amass its potential and address the huge edible oil demand in the country. As of the information gained the factory also aspires to export its product to neighboring and other countries.

Attending the inauguration ceremony of the Complex Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (PhD) said that the private sector’s investment in various sectors capitalizing on national resources can play pivotal role in contributing to import substitution of items via producing domestically. The realization of W.A. Industrial Edible Oil Complex witnessed that how Ethiopians become strong business moguls who could award East African business partners.

Prime Minister Abiy commended the business magnate’s success in erecting a massive factory and creating enormous jobs for the local community and the public at large and called on other businesses to follow Worku’s heroism.

Owner of the Complex Worku Aytenew on his part said that the factory will start supplying adequate edible oil products within one month to the local consumers. Wholesalers and retailers that are carrying out the dissemination of the product have already been identified he added.

According to the investor W.A. Industrial Edible Oil Complex has the capacity of producing 1 350000-liter edible oil in daily operation. Currently the factory employs 1500 citizens and it would have the capacity to hire 6000 staff in three-shift upon fully operational. The W.A. Edible Oil Complex will have a multi-purpose economic development project for Ethiopia.

The complex has also a vision to satisfy up to 60 percent of the nation’s total edible oil consumption in the coming five years. The giant edible oil plant consumes 18000 quintals of oilseeds a day. More than 6 million quintals of oilseeds grains will be used which cost more than 18 billion Birr annually.







The investor further said that the company will focus on addressing the local edible oil demand. At the same time the company will also supply edible oil to the international market and eyes to generate foreign exchange for the country. The inauguration of W.A Industrial Edible Oil Complex is one such an opportunity for engagement in production of basic consumer products locally. Accordingly the factory uses nigger seed peanut seed soya bean and sesame seed as input for the oil processing. On top of addressing the local edible oil demand the factory is said to export sesame seed to several countries of the world.

It is to be recalled that Ethiopia inaugurated a 4.5 billion Birr PhiBela a Giant Edible Oil Complex in Bure town Amhara region in April 2021. This bears eloquent testimony that the government of Ethiopia has given due attention to the agro industry sector and put in place directives to attract more investors to this area of investment. Once the complex becomes fully operational the factory will be among the giant palm oil processing plants in Africa.

The PhiBela edible oil has a daily production capacity of 1.5 million liters of palm oil is deemed to be the largest edible oil factory in the country to potentially cover 60 percent of the country’s demand when fully operational. The factory said will play a significant role of stabilizing the domestic market of edible oil before venturing into the export market. In addition it is expected to create 3000 jobs.

Currently Ethiopia’s local production of edible oils is estimated at 31000 metric tons annually. However the local consumption exceeds 615000 metric tons of which 95 percent is met by imports.

Once this infrastructure is in place it is paramount to focus on pushing forward tourism on an international level MEP Josianne Cutajar said.

She was addressing the Global Tourism Forum in Bodrum Turkey.

The Maltese MEP added that there is a strong will from the European Union’s side in this regard and proof of this is the fact that discussions have already started with third countries.

Cutajar also stated that transport as a whole is a tool that connects not only countries but also cultures with one another and for this reason transport makes it possible for tourists to move around from one country to another.

“People wish to go abroad they wish to learn and meet new cultures and therefore our job is to give them enough confidence and peace of mind so that this can be done in a safe and secure manner” Cutajar said.

It is very important to increase the confidence of tourists and travellers alike and in this regard there are discussions taking place regarding the introduction of a European Safety Seal so that this purpose could be achieved in an efficient manner she said.

Cutajar also spoke about the importance of keeping certain fundamental principles central to our modus operandi while recovering from the pandemic including environmental and technological changes that need to take place and also connectivity.

As regards connectivity Cutajar stated that there needs to be continuous work so that means of transport are both efficient as well as affordable. “As a person hailing from an island from Gozo I know what it means to use various means of transport and to spend a long time travelling in order to go to work or to reach the centre of Europe.”

In this context Cutajar closed with a call for countries such as Malta and those in close coastal proximity to make better use of sea transport. In conclusion she also mentioned the work of the Maltese Government in this area with the recent introduction of the fast ferry which increased sea transport alternatives for both locals and tourists alike."

Surveys are one of the best and easiest ways to make money online. Anyone can participate in online surveys and earn extra cash.

These days there are dozens of websites and apps that’ll pay you for taking surveys. However many of them are only available to US residents. So if you live in other countries your choices are very limited.

However if you live in a few of the western countries with bigger economies (more companies means more market research studies!) such as Australia the U.K. and Canada you are not totally out of luck.

We have already published a post with a list of the best paid survey sites in the U.K.

If you’re Canadian you may have found it tough to find sites that allow Canadian residents to participate in surveys.

Thankfully there are some good survey sites out there that do accept Canadian members.

Top Paying Canadian Survey Companies

Here are some of the best survey panels for residents of Canada.

(Please note that the earnings quoted below are in USD rather than CAD simply because many of the sites and apps below are US-based companies that accept Canadian members.)

Let’s start out with iPoll. This Canadian based site will pay you for providing your opinion on the products and services you use. iPoll is one of the best paying surveys that pay via PayPal. But if you don’t like PayPal payments you can trade your earnings for Amazon or the App Store & iTunes gift cards.

Survey Junkie is another one you can join if you are Canadian. Complete your profile and the site will match you with surveys. The website pays you cash to your PayPal account or you can get gift cards for places like Amazon. Survey Junkie pays you $1 to $3 per survey.

Next on the list we have i-Say. This company pays you to take surveys. You can have your earnings sent to your PayPal account or you can choose a gift card for retailers like Amazon Walmart and Tim Hortons. There are also Visa cards available. The site pays $0.10 to $1 per survey.

Opinion Outpost will pay you in PayPal cash Amazon gift card or Visa gift card when you answer surveys. The site pays you up to $5 per survey.

Next on the list we have Swagbucks. This is a super popular website that accepts members not just in the United States but in lots of other countries like Canada and the UK.

The site pays you for sharing your opinion and it offers other ways for you to make money outside of surveys. You can also get paid to watch videos shop online and play games. You can cash out your earnings for a gift card for lots of different retailers like Amazon or you can get real cash sent to your PayPal account.

You can cash out your earnings for as little as $1 to $5 depending on the gift card option that you choose. The average payout per survey can be anywhere from $0.40 to $5.

The next site I want to mention is YouGov. This is a survey company that accepts Canadian members. The company pays you with either cash or vouchers for answering questions and taking part in surveys. According to the company you can get your opinion featured in the news. You can get paid right to your bank account.

Toluna is a survey website that pays you for sharing your opinion. You can get your earnings sent to your PayPal account. Or you can choose to get a gift card instead for places like Amazon and Walmart.

With PrizeRebel you can get paid to your PayPal account or get gift cards for retailers like iTunes and Amazon. You can redeem your earnings with as little as $1 to $5 in your account.

LifePoints is another great survey site for Canadian members. You get paid to share your feedback on products and brands. You’ll earn points for taking surveys that you can redeem for money to your PayPal account or for gift cards.

For more details and tips on how to increase your earnings read our honest LifePoints review.

Finally we have QuickRewards. This is one of the best survey sites out there for Canadians.

On this site you can get paid for taking surveys. But that’s not all. The platform also pays you to play games complete offers watch videos and shop online. You can cash out your earnings for money to your PayPal account or get a gift card for places like Walmart and Amazon.

What’s great about QuickRewards is that you only need to have 1 cent in your account in order to redeem your earnings. And the site pays very fast too.

So if you’re looking for Canadian survey sites that pay fast then you may want to give QuickRewards a try.

How Much Do Canadian Surveys Pay?

Are online paid surveys worth it?

Well it depends on what you are looking for. If you are wondering “how can I make $500 fast“ then no surveys are not worth it since while you can certainly make $1000 or more it won’t be instant.

But if you are looking to make some extra cash in your spare time then yes online surveys are a great option.

The amount of money you earn depends on how many surveys you take and the site you use.

Here are some examples:

Survey Junkie: Up to $3 per survey.

Opinion Outpost: Up to $5 per survey

Ipsos i-Say: $0.10 to $1 per survey.

Swagbucks: $0.40 to $5 per survey with the occasional survey offering as much as $50.

Some surveys pay $50 or even $100s but this isn’t typical. Most of the time you’ll earn from $0.25 to $5 per survey.

Tips for Success with Paid Surveys

Here are some tips you should keep in mind when taking surveys.

Sign up for multiple survey websites

Sign up for a few different survey sites. Doing this increases the number of surveys available to you that you actually qualify for which gives you more opportunities to make money online with surveys.

Set up an email account solely for survey sites

If you are signing up for multiple survey sites and you should be then you might want to consider setting up a separate email address. This will ensure that your regular inbox doesn’t get cluttered with emails about surveys.

Avoid Scams

A legit survey site will never make you pay to join. If a site asks you to pay a fee to sign up or to participate then it is likely a scam. Similarly don’t share any sensitive data like your Social Security Number driver’s license number credit card details or bank details with any site or app.

Closing Thoughts

Taking surveys can be a good way to make some extra money online in Canada or any other place on earth. Give these sites a try and you can bring in a little cash. Sure survey sites are not going to make you rich. But that’s not the point of them. They are ideal for supplementing your regular income though. So do give them a try.

Connecticut Online Casino History

In 2021 online casino gambling was passed by legislation and signed into law by Governor Lamont. Foxwoods Casino and Mohegan Sun Casino have been operating as retail casinos in the state for some time now where you can play online slots and select table games. Unfortunately nothing was able to be passed in the past due to federal laws banning online gambling but that was overturned in 2018 which then allowed states to take matters into their own hands.

The Foxwoods Resort Casino is owned and operated by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe and opened back in 1992. They are the second-largest casino in the United States. Mohegan Sun is operated by the Mohegan Tribe which was opened in 1996. Both tribes are expected to open a joint casino in East Windsor which is within 15 miles of the Western Massachusetts border. The expansion has become more likely as the bill wanted bigger markets getting a casino.

On October 19th 2021 Connecticut launched its first online casinos.

How to Play With Connecticut Online Casinos

Playing with an online casino is a great way to gamble without having to travel to a retail casino. However the process may seem daunting to those not as familiar with iGaming and online wagering. You can follow these simple steps to get to gambling with online casinos in Connecticut.

1 Choose an Online Casino The first thing you need to do is compare the online casino options available to you. You can play on all three if you would like and it is not a bad idea to take advantage of the enormous new-user bonuses that each casino DraftKings and Mohegan Sun are willing to offer up. You can visit the casinos’ online web pages or download the mobile apps to get started.

2 Sign-Up With Bonus Offer The next thing you need to do once you have chosen your online casino or casinos is making an account. You will need to provide personal information so that the online casino can confirm your identity. If there is a bonus or promo code you will want to make sure to use LINEUPS’ offer to confirm the best bonus. For some casinos you simply need to click through our links to secure that great bonus. Some of the information will include email full name address birth date and last four digits of your SSN. This personal information will confirm your identity but the casino reserves the right to ask for further proof of ID to make sure that you are a legal bettor.

3 Make a Deposit With your account created it is time to make a deposit into your account. Many casinos accept a wide range of payments including PayPal debit card credit card eCheck and more. Some online casinos even allow deposits/withdrawals in-person at their affiliated physical casino in the state. Note that with some new-user offers your first deposit will be primed for a deposit match so make sure to know the terms of that bonus and take advantage of that first-time deposit match that will earn you bonus wagers.

4 Play Casino Games Once your account is created and money has been deposited it is time to play some casino games. You can filter by the type of casino game on the online casino platform. Once you find a game you like you simply need to click on it to activate the game. Then you can place the amount that you would like to wager and enjoy the game. Any money won or lost will be automatically added or deducted from your online casino account.

Online Casino Games

Blackjack – Blackjack is a big draw for online casinos as it is a quick way to sit down and play a few hands. There are different varieties of blackjack offered plenty of table limits and no waiting for a table.

Roulette – Roulette is another popular online version which makes it easy to quickly press bets and spin the wheel. There are different varieties and limits here as well.

Slots – Slots is a very traditional casino game both retail and casino. There are a wide variety of slot games with different settings features and wager limits. Online casinos are also making sure to add new games often to keep the selection fresh for all users.

Online Poker – It is still to be determined as to what poker will be available for Connecticut. However both retail casinos have huge poker rooms and would likely carry some sort of version on their online product.

Deposit & Withdrawal Options

Play+: There are multiple sportsbooks and casinos that use a prepaid card called Play+. You can make deposits and withdraw from your Play+ card and move it around multiple multiple accounts. You can also access money at ATMs where you can withdraw.

PayPal: PayPal is another easy way to move money in and out and is now widely accepted across multiple sportsbooks and casinos. You can add cards and bank accounts into your PayPal that makes it quick and easy to add or withdraw money.

Debit/Credit Cards: This is easier for deposits as there are other options to withdraw. You can use any major credit card and debit card to transfer money into your account.

Bank Transfers: You can make electronic transfers between bank accounts and site accounts. Some places will charge a small fee some will not and it was an easy process. However withdrawals might take a little longer than using Play+ or PayPal.

How Online Casinos Work

Online casinos resemble a similar build to how retail casinos would be. When you walk into a retail casino you can find various games grouped together by area and choose based on limits. Online casinos reflect this with all available games in their designated sections of the website but instead of walking across the casino you are just selecting the next game with a click of a button. There is also no sitting next to someone you don’t like or inhaling second-hand smoke.

Online casinos just require a stable internet connection and a verified account to begin playing. Creating an account is very simple. You must be 21 years or older and be located within the state of Connecticut. Next you will need to verify your identity and provide an SSN. The casino app or website will geotag your location to verify you are in the state and then proceed to create your account.

After your account has been created some sites will hand you a bonus bet to use within a short amount of time or give a deposit matching bonus. You are then clear to begin placing wagers.

After secretly recording a webcam chat with him the criminals told Perry that unless he paid them off his friends and family would see the video. At a loss for what to do next he took his own life by jumping off a bridge in July 2013.

Daniel Perry 17 thought he was talking to a pretty American girl from Illinois. They soon began swapping pictures online – nothing unusual for two teenagers.

This is the third and final piece in a series of stories on image-based abuse supported by the Judith Neilson Institute’s Asian Stories project in collaboration with The Korea Times Indonesia’s Tempo magazine the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism and Manila-based ABS-CBN. Elyssa Lopez Neil Servallos and Sonia Sarkar contributed reporting. The piece contains descriptions of a sexual nature. This story has been made freely available as a public service to our readers.

Less than a year later Interpol-backed operations in the Philippines saw dozens of suspects arrested. There was praise the raids were dubbed a success – and there seemed to be hope that the family of Perry an apprentice mechanic in Dunfermline would find some closure.

But almost eight years on his relatives have yet to see justice much like the thousands of survivors of online sextortion who never made headlines.

With cases increasing amid the Covid-19 pandemic we spoke to survivors in multiple locations including Britain Ireland and India who were deceived and blackmailed.

Sextortion cases typically involve criminals trying to befriend men by posing as an attractive woman on Facebook and other platforms. But those who lure and engage with targets or the “chatters” – some of whom are hired by gangs – come from a variety of backgrounds and are sometimes minors.

With illicit operations mostly based in the Philippines Morocco and the Ivory Coast experts say this form of image-based abuse is an emergent international industry shaped by the convergence of technology money-transfer companies cryptocurrencies and ill-equipped authorities.

STRIKING BACK

By the end of 2013 it became obvious to the authorities that the issue of sextortion could not be resolved within a single country’s borders – a joint international response was required.

The plan was called Operation Strikeback. As laid out in an Interpol document its genesis was in Singapore that November when officers from the Interpol Digital Crime Centre first met police representatives from Hong Kong Singapore and the Philippines.

Other international meetings took place while investigations unearthed details of at least three criminal groups based in the Philippines that were targeting people overseas. Then things moved remarkably fast.

On April 30 and May 1 2014 raids were conducted in Bicol Bulacan and Laguna provinces and Taguig city in the Philippines resulting in 58 arrests and the seizure of 250 items including electronic equipment. Among those arrested was Archie Tolin who used the alias Gian and was suspected of targeting Perry and other British nationals.

The operations were according to Interpol the result of intelligence sharing between the Philippines the United States Hong Kong Singapore Australia England and Scotland. Two others followed one in the summer of 2014 and another in 2016.

But the investigation into Perry’s death is still ongoing according to a spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in Scotland. While a warrant had been issued for Tolin in connection with Perry’s death no further details could be provided.

So what happened after these high-profile operations? And why has Tolin not been brought to justice?

What we learned shines a light on the challenges authorities from different continents face when they try to work together.

Brigadier General Robert T. Rodriguez director of the Anti-Cybercrime Group of the Philippine National Police (PNP) told This Week in Asia that the Philippine authorities were aware of Perry’s case when they took Tolin into custody in 2014.

“During the Strikeback operations Tolin was arrested due to an offence different from the one associated with the suicide of the Scottish minor” he said explaining that the police “needed something so that they could get their hands on Mr Tolin”.

At the time he said the Philippine government was willing to file charges against Tolin relating to Perry’s suicide.

“So we requested evidence sharing documents from the United Kingdom to build up the case like his death certificate and the parents’ complaint. However the UK insisted on prosecuting Tolin in Scotland and never provided the police here in the Philippines with those documents” Rodriguez said.

“What the UK later did was to request the testimony of Tolin and other possible witnesses – if our recollection of the fact is correct.”

But the requests came too late. By then Rodriguez said the case for which Tolin had been arrested had already been dismissed in court and his whereabouts were unknown – and a Philippine court never issued a warrant for his extradition to Scotland.

Colonel Bernard Yang from the PNP who took part in the Strikeback operations said they “were actually a very good example of international cooperation. The investigation was really fast we were able to collect information from our counterparts overseas and I do think we hit these syndicates hard.”

But he acknowledged that the course of justice was often slow and some of the suspects arrested during the raids were out on bail.

“We are quite frustrated but according to the law here [suspects in] those cases are bailable” Yang said.

Trials are still ongoing for at least three sextortion rings identified during the Strikeback operations according to documents provided by the PNP through a Freedom of Information request.

THE QUEEN WHO GOT AWAY

In the second round of Operation Strikeback in August 2014 the Philippine police arrested eight more adults for sextortion and rescued five minors who had been exploited by the gang.

Among those apprehended was the woman dubbed the “Queen of Sextortion”: Maria Cecilia Caparas-Regalachuela known as Cecille Caparas who is believed to have led such activities in several towns in Bulacan province.

This raid stemmed from complaints received by the Philippine police from sextortion survivors based in Hong Kong where hundreds had been targeted as the criminal group racked up illicit earnings of some HK$4 million (US$520000).

Although the suspects were expected to face charges such as robbery and extortion it is unclear what happened after this. News reports suggested the charges against Caparas were dropped and she was able to evade the authorities due to her wealth and connections.

What we do know is that Caparas was once again arrested for sextortion in September 2016 in the third round of Operation Strikeback.

Rodriguez from the PNP said he did not have much information regarding Caparas who is believed to have been in a relationship with a policeman. “I think she is lying low” he said.

Philippine prosecutor Jinky Dedumo did not respond to repeated requests for comment regarding Tolin and the cases related to Caparas.

According to Yang who was with PNP’s anti-cybercrime group for about a decade Tolin had no connection to Caparas’ gang.

He said Tolin only 20 years old at the time of his arrest was part of a “bunch of students who were doing crazy things online” while Caparas’ gang “was much more professional and organised – most of the village was involved”.

Another police officer who participated in the Strikeback operations said Caparas’ modus operandi had been detected in survivors’ complaints until at least 2018. While he is not able to confirm whether she remains active he said sextortionists operating today still used her approach of focusing on foreigners.

Other strategies however have changed. The chatters could previously be traced to specific locations such as offices with computers but many of these have been shut down by the authorities.

“Right now they aren’t using a call-centre type set-up it’s guerilla-type [from their own homes]” he said adding that this made it more difficult to track them.

Complicating matters is the fact that the Philippines uses an internet protocol that hosts thousands of users in one internet protocol (IP) address while criminals also try to hide their real locations by using virtual private networks (VPNs) and encrypted apps such as WhatsApp.

Rodriguez said his unit was following individuals with suspicious financial transactions though he noted that sextortion crimes were mostly perpetrated by unemployed people who lived in the country’s slums.

“They find it to be easy money” he said. “Maybe they started as single individuals doing this kind of crime. When their neighbours see that it’s a good source of income then it flourishes.”

This Week in Asia reached out to 10 individuals in the Philippines who had tried to extort money from local and overseas targets – their contacts were shared with us by survivors and other sources. But most did not respond to our interview requests and one demanded financial compensation which we did not agree to provide.

‘THEY MAKE YOU FEEL SHAMEFUL AND GUILTY’

Richard* a 20-year-old university student from Britain did not expect a friendly chat with a stranger to go so awry.

In February during the country’s second lockdown people from different households were forbidden from socialising while bars and restaurants were closed. Most students such as Richard had returned to their family homes and were taking online classes.

After chatting online to a young woman – who appeared “South Korean or Chinese” he said based on the two photos she had posted on her Instagram account – he agreed to have an intimate video call over Google Hangouts.

“At the time I didn’t know it was a fake video of a woman stripping. It seemed a bit glitchy. It kept jumping and going to a black screen” said Richard.

Then the video got cut off. “Suddenly there was a recording of me masturbating shown on my phone” he said. “I started to panic.”

By then Richard knew he was being scammed. The person on the call threatened to send the video to his friends and family on Instagram if he did not pay £400 (US$565) to an account in the Philippines as soon as possible.

But even after making the payment via Western Union he wasn’t off the hook – the scammer then asked him to send £200 every month for the next year.

“It took me two days after the event before telling my mum in person as I was quite ashamed really that I was naive and had fallen for this” he said. “But that’s how they work. They make you feel shameful and guilty just so you can pay.”

Instead of being angry as Richard had feared his mother was supportive. “She even helped me to gain the confidence to go to the police and I did” he said adding that the authorities said they were unable to take action as the scammer was in the Philippines.

After deactivating his Instagram account Richard skipped online classes for a week afterwards as the episode had plunged him into an unhealthy mental state. “I couldn’t focus at all I just kept thinking about it” he said. “When it first happens you feel isolated. You feel you don’t know anyone who has gone through this and you don’t know anyone to turn to.”

He later found an online group with others who shared their sextortion stories and feels fortunate that his friends and family were supportive of him after the incident – but he remains shaken and wary of forming any online relationships.

“What I’ve taken away from this experience is to not perform explicit acts with a trusted person or a stranger online because you can never really know the person’s intentions” he said.

Waghmare* a 25-year-old banker in India learned a similar lesson recently. After finding the “verified profile” of someone named Seema Saini on dating app OKCupid the conversation led to sexting. “We made a video call and I started stripping for about three minutes” he said.

It didn’t take long before Waghmare received the recording and a message that it would be posted on social media if he didn’t pay 1500 rupees (US$20) via Google Pay.

“I was scared so I pleaded twice to not leak it … but the person on the other side was adamant” he said adding that he later received a call from a supposed police officer that only led to more requests for money.

Ritesh Bhatia a Mumbai-based cybersecurity investigator who looked into the case said hundreds of people such as Waghmare had been targeted by a gang operating from the western Indian city of Bharatpur.

“Men are easy prey. Often girls don’t accept requests for friendship or get connected on social media so easily” he said.

MORE AND MORE SCAMS

In Britain the National Crime Agency’s anti-kidnapping and extortion unit recorded 2604 sextortion cases last year up 62 per cent from 2019 – the largest increase in five years.

“Sadly this a serious and organised crime that preys upon people’s emotions and vulnerability. While both men and women can be victims our evidence suggests that men aged between 19 and 35 are predominately targets” a spokesperson told This Week in Asia.

The majority of sextortion crimes could be traced back to overseas-based organised crime groups he said. “For them it’s a low-risk easy way to make money but for victims the impact and repercussions can be long-lasting. We know of at least four recent incidents in the UK where young men who were targeted saw no other way out than to take their own lives.”

In Hong Kong the authorities last year recorded the highest ever number of romance scams: 905 in total almost double the previous year involving losses of HK$212.6 million (US$27.4 million).

According to a police spokesperson 88 per cent of the targets were women between the ages of 15 and 85. “Fraudsters disguised themselves as soldiers merchants or professionals on social media to gain victims’ trust. This would often lead to cyber relationships and subsequent fraudulent requests for money” he said adding that the police did not maintain specific figures for cases involving image-based abuse and sextortion.

Wayne May* runs the online forum Scam Survivors which was set up about nine years ago. Over a 12-month period from February last year he saw sextortion cases jump 13 per cent to a total of 1790.

“People are spending more time online and spending time on their own ­– some are quite lonely. It was going to happen” he said.

Every day his group receives an average of six messages related to sextortion cases along with some 8000 visits to the website which covers all forms of online scams.

“A typical [sextortion] victim would be a male in their 20s to 40s but we’ve had people in their teens and in their 60s come to us. They come from anywhere in the world” he said mentioning countries such as New Zealand and Malaysia.

May said targets were usually first approached on social media – mostly Facebook – and dating websites. They were deceived he explained by the combination of fake video footage and software that could emulate responses such as waving in response to requests to prove the chatter was real.

Experts say some of the videos used in this manner include non-consensual footage of women sold on underground forums.

The perpetrators May said mostly operated out of the Philippines the Ivory Coast and Morocco and took different approaches to sextortion scams.

“For example in the Philippines they use the word ‘scandal’ a lot. If it’s in the Ivory Coast they say ‘I’ll ruin your life’. The West African scammers tend to demand higher amounts of money. They are very gritty and lazy. They are hoping for that one big score” he said.

“The Philippines in particular seems to have syndicates … But in other places like West Africa it’s more likely to be an individual just trying their luck.”

In recent months May said he had encountered cases involving widely varying amounts of money from US$50 to US$90000. While Western Union and MoneyGram were the most common platforms used he said “cryptocurrencies are starting to come up now. And we are also seeing PayPal being used a lot more.”

DIGITAL TRAILS

David Bishop a principal lecturer at the University of Hong Kong and a former corporate lawyer said it was increasingly difficult to follow dirty money.

“It’s now easier than ever to move money across borders and harder to track individuals and illicit funds” he said. “Banks tend to be quite quick to react if you can identify some type of irregularity specially tied to issues like human trafficking because they don’t want to run the risk of any type of sanction whereas the police are jurisdiction bound and are quite slow to act.”

Bishop said wire-transfer companies such as Western Union – which has about 550000 retail agents in more than 200 countries and facilitates payments to billions of bank accounts – had come up again and again in such cases.

“[They] are successful because they are intentionally not strict. And I think it’s disgraceful how they are beating around the bush and lie about that” he said. “Companies like Western Union can facilitate so much illegal behaviour and money laundering because they are not regulated in the same way financial institutions like banks are. I am not saying they should be exactly the same. But they could absolutely be held to account.”

A spokesperson for Western Union “categorically refuted” the idea that the firm was not strict enough.

“We work very hard to identify fraudulent transactions and keep them from going through our systems” she said pointing out that agents were trained to identify prevent and report potential victims while transactions headed to countries such as the Philippines were subject to fraud interviews before they were paid out.

“As criminals become increasingly savvy in moving money to pursue illicit ends we are constantly adapting and evolving” the spokesperson said adding that consumer fraud perpetrated against Western Union customers had decreased by 6 per cent last year.

But scammers aren’t just moving money through networks such as those operated by Western Union. Some have even gone so far as to open branches themselves.

Marcel Jing Caparas-Regachuela – daughter of the “Queen of Sextortion” Caparas – owned two Western Union branches in Bulacan. When she was arrested in 2014 as part of the second Strikeback operation the authorities said the branches were used as remittance agencies for sextortion money.

“Although we can’t get into the specifics of a criminal case we can assure you we have appropriately dealt with this situation” the Western Union spokeswoman said adding that ties with Caparas-Regachuela had been terminated.

A spokesperson for PayPal which was also named as a channel for fund transfers by survivors speaking to This Week in Asia said it had devoted “significant resources” to proactively preventing illicit activities on the platform including working with law enforcement officials.

CRYPTO CONCERNS

While money-transfer companies are widely used by sextortionists experts say they have also come up with other ways to move funds including gift cards for Amazon Google Play and Apple as well as using online gambling platforms.

But the most sophisticated criminals have turned to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to hide their activities.

A 2019 study estimated that some US$76 billion of illegal activity annually involved bitcoin – about 46 per cent of bitcoin transactions per year.

Co-author Sean Foley an associate professor of the Department of Applied Finance at Macquarie University in Australia said they had examined marketplaces on the dark net – a layer of the internet that can only be accessed through anonymising software such as Tor – that typically dealt in the sale of illicit goods and services such as drugs and hacking.

He said image-based abuse – including sextortion and the trade of non-consensual images – represented a small portion of how bitcoin was used but it was an emergent industry with a potential for growth that had been spurred by the anonymity of cryptocurrency-based payments.

“It is definitely concerning” Foley said. “All innovation has its dark side; facilitating the movement of image abuse from a cottage industry to a lucrative one is an unpleasant by-product of the disruptive benefits cryptocurrencies can bring to our financial systems.”

Talis J. Putnins a co-author of the study and a professor at the University of Technology Sydney’s business school said the dark net and cryptocurrencies had allowed illegal pornography to reach large international audiences while providing perpetrators with a sense of safety.

“Technological advancements enabled the industry to more easily cross national borders resulting in streaming online exploitation of children often in developing countries sometimes even with the consent of the parents” he said. “They enabled broader distribution of illicit materials – videos and images.”

Putnins said the “perception of a payment mechanism that is untraceable or completely anonymous no doubt encouraged the participation of some offenders and encouraged further commercialisation of this industry”.

But the shield provided by bitcoin is not impenetrable. For example Foley said a vendor of this content might hide in the shadows until they want to “cash in” their bitcoin for euros or dollars. Accessing an exchange that had their identification on file he said could reveal all of their transactions and counterparties.

In the “Nth Room” online sex scandal in South Korea last year dozens of targets including underage girls were blackmailed and forced to upload graphic and violent videos of themselves to Telegram channels – while about 260000 users accessed these groups often using cryptocurrencies. Some are believed to have been charged up to 1.5 million won (US$1340) to view the content.

Authorities in South Korea – where trials related to the case are ongoing – last year said they had been able to trace dozens of people who paid in cryptocurrencies to access the videos.

Although most criminals prefer bitcoin because it is widely accepted experts note that the illegal share of bitcoin activity has declined due to growing mainstream interest and the emergence of more opaque cryptocurrencies.

“The current world standard is now ZCash [which allows] users to hide the sending address receiving address and amount sent” Foley said. “These shielded transactions are truly opaque and as such have become the preference for those involved in serious criminal activity.”

The girl’s account had posts from 10 years ago. She even had regular posts from yesterday or a week before. It didn’t look fake John from Ireland

BORDER ISSUES

Foley said he doubted that law enforcement agencies “outside the US Europe and Australia” had a good grasp of how to manage cryptocurrency surveillance.

“It is crazy how easy it is to avoid taxes launder money or conduct illegal activity accruing significant personal profits without the potential to be discovered. It is truly a criminal’s dream” he said.

An Asia-based cybersecurity expert who worked for Interpol said authorities in Asian countries were often ill prepared to deal with digital sex crimes.

“They lack technical capabilities. Firstly it is hard to retain good people because the private sector pays more” he said speaking on condition of anonymity. “Secondly police forces rotate staff between different jobs so it is very hard for someone to build up the expertise.”

Another issue he said was the lack of communication between agencies from different countries as well as the absence of a coordinating global body.

“Interpol doesn’t do a very good job at this” he said adding that a secondment at the international organisation was usually three years which in his view was insufficient time to develop a long-term project.

Within law enforcement agencies the cybersecurity expert said half the problem was that those who had the technical skills seldom got to coordinate investigations or attend international meetings.

In some jurisdictions he added crimes such as sextortion were not prioritised because it was difficult for arrests to be made.

In Hong Kong for instance “the police force is being pulled in all directions” he said referring to the wave of protests and an increased focus on national security issues over the past two years.

Police in the city did not respond to queries about the size of its cybersecurity unit or requests for details about its handling of cross-border cases involving image-based abuse and sextortion.

While Bishop from the University of Hong Kong agreed that the city’s authorities struggled to follow digital trails he said “the biggest problem is the natural diffusion of responsibility. When you move things across the border everyone can point fingers at everyone else and that’s why scammers are so successful now.”

There appear to be similar issues in Malaysia. “Unfortunately in instances where there are elements of cross-border crimes there is a higher likelihood of the police declaring a case NFA [no further action] than actually exploring possible avenues to resolve the issue or punishing the perpetrator” said lawyer Kuhan Manokaran.

A police officer based in Hong Kong who spoke on condition of anonymity said the international cooperation structures existed but were just not being used efficiently.

“Are Interpol and Europol doing something about it? The channels are there but whether it is a priority is a different matter” he said. “If the crime involves a lot of media attention Interpol will pay attention but if it’s just another random teenager it’s a different story.”

In response to the exponential increase in online fraud a recent Interpol operation codenamed HAECHI-I recorded more than 500 arrests and nearly 900 solved online fraud cases – including some related to sextortion – following cooperation between nine Asian countries. Six months of investigations which ended in May saw the authorities intercept US$83 million in funds transferred by survivors to scammers.

CRACKS IN THE SYSTEM

Rodriguez the PNP cybercrime unit chief admitted that his team faced endless challenges – not least of which were limitations on budget and equipment as well as the fast-evolving nature of cybercrime.

He said that while cases involving locally based Filipinos had increased scams targeting foreigners were the hardest to crack due to difficulties obtaining statements complaints and evidence.

Rodriguez also said social media platforms did not offer enough assistance during investigations and treated the authorities differently depending on where they were located.

“One of the problems we have is delayed action from these platforms” he said adding that most of the cases involved Facebook. “In some cases we have help from our foreign counterparts. It’s better if the requests come from the US – the cases where we are the ones requesting [assistance] are really very difficult for us.”

In February John* who lives in Ireland was approached on Facebook by someone he thought was a woman from Dublin.

“The girl’s account had posts from 10 years ago. She even had regular posts from yesterday or a week before. It didn’t look fake” he said.

The pair eventually took part in a video call during which he didn’t show his face – despite her insistence. When he continued to refuse the video was cut off.

John who is in his 20s then received a message that said: “I’m not a girl. I now have a video of you chatting with a nude woman online now pay me.”

He was asked to make a payment of €1000 (US$1220) to the Philippines or the video would be released while the scammer also found some of John’s friends and distant relatives on his profile and created a Facebook Messenger group that included them.

“At one point he even started a video call with me just to ask about the transactions” John said. “The scammer wasn’t able to turn off the camera immediately … I saw that he was operating in what looked like an office. It wasn’t a rural area as some documentaries showed. He even had a gaming chair so I figured this must be a business.”

After receiving more threats John deactivated his Facebook account and never sent the money.

“One of my friends [in the Facebook group] said the video was indeed uploaded and some may have seen it. But they have since deleted the group” he said.

John may have escaped sextortion but he is upset about how Facebook handled the case.

Their policies he said seemed to support – if not condone – these malicious acts. “For example [the scammers] were able to add my friends on Messenger without my consent. That shouldn’t be possible. And then they still wouldn’t take down the account of the person on Facebook even when over a hundred of my friends reported the incident.”

A month after the incident John said the account of the scammer was still active.

A Facebook spokesperson said sharing non-consensual intimate images or videos was not allowed on Facebook or Instagram and any such content would be removed.

“In most cases we will also disable an account for sharing intimate content without permission” she said adding that “people who have had accounts deleted for breaking our rules may not be permitted to create a new account”.

But survivors and experts say it is too easy for perpetrators to set up new accounts even after Facebook takes action.

“Every single social media platform has responsibility” said Elena Martellozzo a criminologist and senior lecturer at Middlesex University London. “It’s almost like making a car that is not safe. A manufacturer wouldn’t put a car on the streets unless it’s been tested and is 100 per cent safe.”

MONETISING ABUSE

Honza Červenka – an associate with law firm McAllister Olivarius which specialises in cases of discrimination and abuse in Britain and the US – said he had seen in recent months an increasing number of people trying to profit from different forms of image-based sexual abuse mostly through new platforms such as OnlyFans.

The London-based social media network – which went from 7.5 million users in November 2019 to about 130 million by the end of May – allows users to sell content to monthly subscribers.

“We had reports of people creating an account on OnlyFans and sharing somebody else’s internet videos” Červenka said adding that the platform did not have effective ways of ascertaining the identity or consent of people who appeared in videos or photos.

An OnlyFans spokesperson said the company had a team manually reviewing identities and applications while it also used software to verify the authenticity and integrity of content such as selfies with identification provided by potential creators.

She said the platform goes ""above and beyond [its legal obligations] by using a combination of software human monitoring and community reporting to help keep users safe"" adding that images of minors were removed as soon as possible.

But Červenka said platforms such as OnlyFans had “unfortunately opened the door for monetising [abuse] where the attacker can collect cash for making some materials available publicly”.

He said this had become a trend as had the use of deepfakes – sexual photographs and videos generated using artificial intelligence making them look more real than other digitally manipulated content.

In South Korea an online petition was launched in January demanding stronger punishment for websites that distributed deepfake pornography of local female celebrities and for people who downloaded them.

“[The number of] non-consensual and harmful deepfake videos crafted by expert creators is now doubling roughly every six months” said deepfake detection company Sensity – which had detected more than 85000 such videos by December last year – in a report.

Sensity also warned that the deepfake landscape was quickly evolving as new consumer apps were making the technology even more easily available.

“I think it’s unfortunately just a matter of time for [deepfakes] to really gain notoriety and damage a lot of people’s lives” Červenka said.

Clare McGlynn QC professor of law at the Durham University in England shares the same worry.

“Unless we get on top of detecting these materials and criminalising their distribution there are going to be significant ongoing problems for victims” she said. “Deepfakes and altered images are a significant concern. This is the future of image-based sexual abuse.”

In April Daniel Carraway founder of the polyhydroxyalkanoate start-up RWDC Industries found himself in an unusual forum for someone trying to sell plastic. Carraway was being interviewed by the Iron Man actor Robert Downey Jr. on the FootPrint Coalition’s YouTube channel. The FootPrint Coalition is Downey’s venture capital firm and also an RWDC investor. The FootPrint Coalition’s other investments include a bamboo toilet paper company and an outfit developing mealworm protein.

Encouraged by Downey Carraway pitched his biodegradable biopolymer as the solution to the plastic waste crisis. “We have to clean up the mess we made” Carraway said. “But we also have to stop making the mess.” The plastic industry has been trying to establish a recycling infrastructure since the 1970s he noted but it “just doesn’t work.”

Carraway and other proponents are hyping polyhydroxyalkanoates known collectively as PHA as the next big thing but they are hardly new. Nature has used this class of polymers to store cellular energy for millions of years. Companies have been trying to commercialize them—via industrial fermentation—for several decades. But despite what should be a strong selling point—biodegradability in a wide range of environments—they haven’t taken off. The list of companies that have tried and failed to bring PHA to market keeps growing.

We have to clean up the mess we made but we also have to stop making the mess. Daniel Carraway founder RWDC

This time boosters of the polymer maintain will be different. The world has changed they say. Cities are banning plastic straws and take-out containers and PHA is a responsible alternative. Large consumer product companies are clamoring for biodegradable packaging. Indeed PHA Skittles bags and Bacardí rum bottles are due out in stores soon.

Danimer Scientific the firm responsible for those applications puts the addressable PHA market at 230 million metric tons (t) per year—more than half the world’s plastic demand. Meanwhile the PHA industry is still in its infancy with capacity of less than 1 million t.

Detractors however warn that it won’t be easy for PHA to compete with the likes of polyethylene and polypropylene. PHA’s biodegradability is overhyped they say. And the biopolymer is too expensive to compete with petrochemicals on a large scale. Regardless all eyes are on PHA.

The company leading the current charge for PHA is Danimer. The firm based in Bainbridge Georgia started as a polylactic acid compounder and bought its PHA fermentation technology from Procter & Gamble back in 2007.

Only recently has the PHA business begun to gain significant traction for Danimer. The company opened its first commercial plant in Winchester Kentucky last year. It can make 9000 t per year and is being expanded to about 30000 t by next year.

Danimer says it is struggling to keep up with forecast demand. The first plant it projects will be running at full capacity by the end of this year. Danimer is close to having the output for the expansion reserved by customers as well CEO Steve Croskrey says. “If you count pending contracts we’re there.”

The firm’s biggest-volume product right now Croskrey says is resin for drinking straws used in jurisdictions that have banned straws made from petrochemical plastic. Its sales may soon shift toward packaging. Mars Wrigley plans to start selling Skittles in PHA bags by early next year. Bacardi plans to introduce PHA liquor bottles in 2023 replacing 3000 t per year of conventional plastic. Danimer has also been working with PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay unit on snack bags.

Danimer went public last year through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. Such SPACs now trendy are shell companies that raise money in the stock market on the promise that they will buy a high-growth firm.

The SPAC transaction “gave us a little more certainty about the future and allowed us to focus on customers and construction and things like that as opposed to fundraising” Croskrey says. Flush with the $380 million it raised Danimer ratcheted up its growth agenda. It unveiled plans for a $700 million plant to open in Georgia by 2024 with more than 113000 t per year of PHA capacity.

But Croskrey quickly learned that going public has its downside. Danimer is now facing much more scrutiny than it ever did as a private company. Recent months have brought an exposé from the Wall Street Journal of its biodegradability claims and a series of reports from an investment firm alleging that Danimer executives are hyping the firm’s prospects.

The Wall Street Journal report published in March looks at claims such as the one Bacardí made of its PHA bottle: that it would biodegrade in 18 months. This claim was extrapolated the article states from laboratory tests on PHA sheet under ideal conditions. The article also spotlights a Danimer statement that PHA would biodegrade in landfills—not particularly an environmental benefit when garbage isn’t supposed to degrade in landfills.

A month later Spruce Point Capital Management targeted Danimer. Spruce Point is a short seller an investment firm that bets a company’s stock will decline. Short sellers will often issue reports designed to sour opinion about a company and push its stock price down.

Spruce Point combed through all the information about Danimer it could find. It even obtained Danimer’s production numbers through a Freedom of Information Act request for environmental records from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

It issued a report alleging for example that the company has financial ties to University of Georgia scientists who wrote complimentary studies about Danimer’s technology. It mentions that PepsiCo which had been a Danimer investor sold its shares in the company shortly after it went public.

The report chides Danimer for missing construction targets in Kentucky. It highlights Danimer’s admission made during an earnings call that only 10% of its planned production in Georgia is reserved under contract despite assurances that the new plant will be sold out. And from the Kentucky environmental figures Spruce Point gleans that Danimer is running at only 66% of capacity.

The report also compares Danimer to Metabolix a public company that has become a cautionary tale in PHA. A decade ago Metabolix seemed to have everything going for it including a 50000 t per year PHA joint venture in Iowa with Archer Daniels Midland. But the partnership struggled to sell even 1% of that capacity and ADM pulled the plug in 2012.

Metabolix sold its technology to CJ CheilJedang in 2016. The South Korean firm is now building a plant in Indonesia.

Spruce Point’s founder Ben Axler says he learned about Danimer from the Wall Street Journal story and decided it needed more attention. “We are trying to fill a gap in the traditional research that comes out of the Wall Street investment banks” he says adding that such analysts “tend to take management’s claims at face value.”

One prominent analyst covering Danimer Laurence Alexander of Jefferies Financial Group was bullish on the company when it went public and remains so after the Spruce Point reports. In his most recent note to clients for example Alexander writes that the coming shift toward commercialization “will be a positive one” for the company.

Short-seller reports can be influential. In 2019 the Italian company Bio-on was riding high. It ran a small plant in Bologna Italy that produced PHA from molasses and sugar beet by-products. It launched a line of sunscreens with Unilever that incorporate PHA micropowders. And it signed licenses for its technology in Italy Spain France Mexico and Tatarstan.

Then Quintessential Capital Management issued a report alleging that Bio-on was a “house of cards” that booked fictitious licensee revenue from its own shell companies. Bio-on declared bankruptcy later that year.

Danimer’s stock has lost nearly half its value since the Wall Street Journal article was published in March. However its market capitalization of nearly $2.3 billion is about what it was when it went public.

Croskrey says he often gets asked about the downside of being a publicly traded company. “And you know the downside is clearly this kind of situation where people can attack a company that’s trying to do good and save the world from plastic pollution” he says. “It should be criminal but it’s not unfortunately.”

Danimer released a three-page statement in May addressing the “misconceptions falsehoods and speculation that have been circulating.”

Responding to Spruce Point’s criticisms Danimer says the figures reported to the Kentucky government don’t reflect actual production because they measure polymer coming out of the fermenter before it is compounded with other ingredients and sent to customers. The firm also reiterates its projections for capacity expansions and its ramp-up in sales.

Croskrey adds that Danimer’s expansion plans were delayed to conserve cash during the pandemic a defensive maneuver a lot of companies used in 2020. He also notes that Danimer continues to work with PepsiCo which still has a seat on Danimer’s board.

Croskrey argues that Danimer has advantages Metabolix didn’t have. For instance Danimer starts with a medium-chain-length PHA which he says has more robust physical properties than the short-chain polymers Metabolix was developing. Moreover the company which has long been a major compounder of polylactic acid has more applications expertise than Metabolix did.

Croskrey is standing his ground on biodegradability as well. “PHA is nature’s recycling program” he proclaims. He says the polymer can degrade in landfills because most such facilities aren’t sterile. “PHA will go away in conditions where bacteria can thrive regardless of where that is” Croskrey says.

Industry watchers say PHA has traction in the marketplace though companies shouldn’t hype it. Ramani Narayan a chemical engineer at Michigan State University says the biodegradability of PHA has at times been “oversold” creating the impression that it will quickly disappear in the environment.

But Narayan notes PHA is one of the most biodegradable polymers on the market. A bottle that finds its way into the ocean “is going to last for several years before it’s going to be removed by microbial metabolism which is better than polyethylene and polypropylene which will keep on accumulating” he says. “So there is value.”

Jan Ravenstijn an independent biopolymer consultant and a veteran of Dow and DSM says PHA might indeed be on the cusp of a high-growth phase a transition many new polymers finally make after years of development. It took the polylactic acid maker NatureWorks 23 years to finally turn a profit he notes.

Evidence for PHA’s transition is the blistering demand coming primarily from Asia. “Prices have tripled over the past 9 months or so” Ravenstijn says. “They can sell much more than they can make at the moment.”

Ravenstijn says this demand is driving a raft of expansions from newer players like CJ Kaneka and a firm poised to become a US rival to Danimer: RWDC.

Carraway founded RWDC in 2015 with businessperson Roland Wee. Carraway was no newcomer to PHA having established Danimer in 2004 with his wife Meredith. Carraway sold most of his Danimer stake in 2014 and now has no connection to the company.

RWDC raised $133 million in financing last year. Its investors include Vickers Venture Partners and Flint Hills Resources a chemical arm of Koch Industries.

RWDC launched a 5000 t per year demonstration facility in Athens Georgia earlier this year on the site of a former Invista fiber plant. It has begun construction on a 25000 t unit that it hopes to open in 2023 also in Athens. It plans to build a similar-sized plant after that and possibly a plant in Singapore.

RWDC has a big customer lined up in Cove a California company that aims to bring a biodegradable water bottle to the market later this year. Cove signed an agreement to buy 160000 t over 5 years—most of the PHA that RWDC expects to make. Earlier this month RWDC announced a partnership with Kimberly-Clark a producer of diapers and other consumer products.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGVhdHNoZWV0LmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2xva2ktZGlyZWN0b3Ita2F0ZS1oZXJyb24tcmV2ZWFscy13aHktZGlzY29udGludWVkLWpvc3RhLWVuZXJneS1kcmluay1pcy1pbi10aGUtbmV3LWRpc25leS1zZXJpZXMuaHRtbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Loki' Director Kate Herron Reveals Why Discontinued Josta Energy Drink Is in the New Disney+ Series,"For viewers who have already watched the first episode of 'Loki' it might’ve been confusing to see Mobius drinking Josta a discontinued energy drink that PepsiCo sold in the 1990s. How could he possibly be drinking something that no longer exists? Well Loki director Kate Herron has an answer and it actually makes perfect sense.

Loki is now streaming on Disney+ and Marvel fans couldn’t be more excited. The new series which features Tom Hiddleston reprising his role as the title character also stars Owen Wilson who plays Mobius M. Mobius a representative of the Time Variance Authority (TVA).

For viewers who have already watched the first episode it might’ve been confusing to see Mobius drinking Josta a discontinued energy drink that PepsiCo sold in the 1990s. How could he possibly be drinking something that no longer exists?

Well Loki director Kate Herron has an answer and it actually makes perfect sense.

‘Loki’ director Kate Herron says the show’s writers purposely included items that no longer exist

One of the biggest points of emphasis for Loki is the fact that the show’s current setting exists outside of the realms of space and time. Because of this there aren’t traditional rules regarding what objects may or may not be accessible as TVA can travel through time at their own discretion. According to Herron this explains why the show’s writers wanted to add obscure items that the average person can’t find.

“In the writers’ room they were adding in lots of stuff that basically doesn’t really exist anymore so that’s kind of a fun joke that we tried to continue” Herron told AV Club. “I’m not sure who picked Josta—it might have been Eric Martin—but yeah it’s really funny.”

Herron added that the inclusion of Josta was a lighthearted take on the TVA’s ability to bend space and time.

“I just think it’s fun right? Because they exist outside of space and time and they have access to all the stuff … It’s just little details like that … that you watch and you’re like ‘Wait a second. I know that drink.’”

She was very intentional about building the ‘Loki’ world

Later in the interview Herron spoke on the enormous amount of time and detail she put into crafting the Loki world.

“I think honestly for me so much of it getting my head wrapped around it I did in my pitch. I made this massive document and I broke down everything from look to design to story to characters and I just came in with questions.”

Kate Herron wanted to pay homage to sci-fi films of the past

Herron drew a lot of inspiration for the TVA’s office from Marvel’s original comic books. However she added her own original flair to the show by incorporating stylistic pieces from sci-fi movies that she loves.

“The bigger thing was ‘What is this office like that exists outside of space and time?’” Herron said. “That was exciting to me and it was taking inspiration from the comics. They had these amazing rows of infinite desks in the comics that go into the horizon. I basically was like ‘I want to pay homage to that and have that idea in there.’ … But then also drawing from sci-fi that I love. … I love sci-fi and I just wanted the show to be like this big love letter to it. So we’ve got references scattered across the whole thing to different sci-fi movies that hopefully other fellow sci-fi nerds will enjoy.”

Loki is now available for streaming on Disney+.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vaW5ld3MuY28udWsvb3Bpbmlvbi9jb2x1bW5pc3RzL2diLW5ld3MtaXMtb3Bwb3NpbmctYS1iYmMtd29rZS1tZWRpYS10eXJhbm55LTEwNDk1MDDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GB News is opposing a BBC 'woke media tyranny' that does not exist,"GB News has launched with a promise of challenging the “woke” ideology that is supposedly distorting the lens of UK media. The TV and radio news outlet led by Andrew Neil aims to “unmuffle” the voices of the unheard and cover communities “under-represented” by a media it portrays as gripped by a liberal metropolitan orthodoxy. Presenter Nana Akua who defends football fans who boo England players taking the knee wishes to get to grips with “this PC thing that has got completely out of hand”. Neil’s flagship show has a regular segment called Woke Watch.

Stop Funding Hate played into the channel’s hands by demanding an advertising boycott giving an impression that the cancel culture which has led to speakers being no-platformed at universities is being used to censor British media and enabling Neil to brand them “woke warriors”.

But the idea that our diverse and rumbustious news industry is stifled by a self-imposed gag of political correctness is nonsense. As a challenger brand GB News is anxious to target existing the 24-hour news providers. To stigmatise BBC News as “woke and out of touch” as Neil has done is a casual slur on its vast daily journalistic output and gives a warped impression of the BBC’s present ethos.

The newsroom’s editor-in-chief is the BBC director-general Tim Davie a former PepsiCo executive and one-time member of the Conservative Party. Since becoming D-G he has ordered a U-turn on a decision not to sing “Land of Hope and Glory” at the Last Night of the Proms told staff who campaign on social media that they “should not be working at the BBC” and dropped The Mash Report a comedy criticised for being left-wing. The right-wing columnist Allison Pearson approvingly suspects that Davie “reads The Telegraph rather than The Guardian.”

Richard Sharp the BBC chairman was a Goldman Sachs banker and ex-boss of the Chancellor Rishi Sunak. He is a Tory party donor and Brexiteer. While the BBC’s conservative critics accuse Naga Munchetty and Lewis Goodall of liberal leanings Laura Kuenssberg and Nick Robinson are sniped at by leftists. Neil was similarly targeted as the BBC’s star political interviewer.

GB News presents itself as a radical alternative but it’s a product of the TV news establishment. John McAndrew its director of news and programmes helped shape Sky News. Robbie Gibb a pioneer of GB News is a former head of BBC political output who became Theresa May’s communications chief and recently joined the BBC board. GB News presenters Colin Brazier and Darren McCaffrey are Sky News alumni while Alastair Stewart and Simon McCoy were stalwarts of ITV News and the BBC News Channel. These are familiar figures not disruptive ones.

The upstart channel will hope younger voices such as former Brexit Party candidate Inaya Folarin Iman and former Guido Fawkes journalist Tom Harwood make it feel fresh. It will aim to make rolling news look staid by creating sparky formats that often pair male and female presenters. But newsy discussion shows are not new; think of Loose Women Jeremy Vine or Good Morning Britain.

GB News promises to “serve the whole country” and “offer something for everybody”. The BBC is required by remit to do just that and operates 40 local radio networks and related websites. Its news division has 6000 staff. GB News has 120 journalists.

It champions regional accents – presenter Michelle Dewberry another former Brexit Party figure is from Hull and Gloria De Piero from Bradford. So what? Huw Edwards is from Bridgend and Clive Myrie from Bolton.

If GB News can score some ratings wins over Sky News which has a tiny audience on a slow news day it might persuade its wealthy funders to add to the £60m invested in the project. It has long-term hopes of scaling its model to international markets including Spain which would enhance the UK’s reputation as a leader in creative industries. Neil’s interview show which any rival would love to have will certainly generate press headlines.

Because TV news does not operate in isolation within British media. GB News is targeting the culture wars of identity politics because it knows it will be backed by a right-wing press which has a commercial interest in bashing the BBC and exaggerating the woke bogeyman. Its cheerleaders will range from The Sun the Mail and The Telegraph all market leaders to The Spectator (chairman AF Neil) and website UnHerd (owned by GB News’s Brexit-supporting billionaire backer Paul Marshall). Even The Times slated England’s footballers for taking the knee.

Some people it seems are threatened by efforts to achieve racial and gender equality. But let’s not be kidded that our society least of all our media is in the grip of a woke tyranny.",,,

Pregnancy is characterized by substantial changes in the immune and endocrine systems that predispose women to potential complications caused by various pathogens – including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

More specifically pregnant women are three times more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit after infection with the need for ventilator support or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation but also more likely to succumb to the disease when compared to non-infected pregnant women.

Likewise different obstetrical complications (most notably preterm birth) are also more frequent in cases when the mother is infected with SARS-CoV-2; hence increasing the probability of protracted health problems for both the mother and her newborn child.

COVID-19 vaccine and pregnancy

Nonetheless due to the novel technology and (at the time) uncertain efficacy of the mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 pregnant volunteers were initially excluded from clinical trials. In light of the above effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women many organizations and societies have begun recommending the administration of these vaccines during pregnancy.

At the moment there is a consensus based on the evidence that COVID-19 vaccines give rise to infertility in neither women nor men. Furthermore if administered in pregnancy mRNA fragments from the vaccine do not cross the placenta being consumed by muscle cells at the injection site and/or degraded following the synthesis of an encoded protein.

However albeit reassuring data pertaining to pregnancy and fetal transfer are still limited. This is the reason why a research group led by Dr. Ofer Beharier from the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Jerusalem decided to appraise maternal and neonatal responses to the Pfizer BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.

A multicenter study in Israel

In this multicenter study the researchers have examined a cohort of 1094 participants from eight hospitals across Israel. Pregnant women that had an active maternal COVID-19 disease at delivery were excluded from the study while eligibility criteria included age of 18 years (or older) and stated willingness to participate with informed consent.

Blood samples from women and umbilical cord blood samples from newborns were collected between April 2020 and March 2021. The samples were centrifuged at room temperature (1000 g for 10 minutes) and then sera were aliquoted into dedicated precoded tubes. Finally samples were stored at -80 °C until the analysis.

All study participants were assigned into three groups: those who got the vaccine unvaccinated ones with prior positive SARS-CoV-2 test and those that were unvaccinated without prior infection. Titers of IgG and IgM antibodies from the sera were measured with the use of Milliplex MAP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Panel.

Robust protection for mother and child

The study has shown a steadfast increase in maternal IgG humoral response against various components of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in non-infected patients upon vaccination. These immunoglobulins were easily transferred to the fetus across the placenta which led to a substantial anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer in the bloodstream of neonates within 14 days of the first vaccine dose.

Furthermore in women recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection that has been contracted in the second trimester (i.e. 13-26 weeks of gestation) anti-COVID-19 antibodies in both maternal and cord blood samples remained elevated high at delivery.

Compared to natural infection the vaccination generates powerful protective antibodies in women which are successfully transferred to fetuses during pregnancy. Importantly there was no evidence of fetal IgM response to any of the vaccine-induced antigens which implies there was no direct exposure of the fetus to vaccine-derived antigens.

Implications and future studies

Due to the considerable burden of COVID-19 throughout pregnancy on the mother vaccinations at any time of gestation should be considered for the benefit of maternal health. However the vaccination of previously infected pregnant women should be based on titer testing.

Even though vaccination in very early pregnancy might result in lower efficiency of antibody transfer from mother to fetus this should not be a reason against endorsing vaccination at any time during the gestation period as vaccination in pregnancy obviously confers separate benefits to the mother and her fetus.

In any case since we are dealing with vulnerable populations more public health efforts should be put behind this concept. Future studies will also be needed to address this issue in more depth since ethnicity and race can influence adverse pregnancy outcomes with SARS-Cov2 infection.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHA6Ly93d3cueGluaHVhbmV0LmNvbS9lbmdsaXNoL2FmcmljYS8yMDIxLTA2LzEyL2NfMTMxMDAwMzQ1OS5odG3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Botswana president receives first injection of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine - Xinhua | English.news.cn,"Source: Xinhua| 2021-06-12 00:56:48|Editor: huaxia

GABORONE June 11 (Xinhua) -- Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi on Friday received first injection of Pfizer vaccine against COVID-19 in the country's capital city Gaborone.

""I am here to receive my first jab of COVID-19 vaccine that is currently on going I am taking the jab today like I said before those running the vaccine campaign made arrangements of who will receive the jab and when so my time has come"" said Masisi.

Masisi encouraged everyone to take the jab when their time comes in order to save lives.

The southern African country is currently administering second dose for people who received their first jab of Sinovac. Botswana has administered at least 150019 doses of COVID-19 vaccines so far with a total of 59480 cases and 896 fatalities.

Moderna Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines will be available at the site which is open to the public. Officials said students ages 12-17 who are in sports or clubs are especially encouraged to sign up.

The Pfizer vaccine which is the only COVID-19 vaccine currently approved for children under the age of 18 was hard to come by in Butler County earlier this spring. The Butler County General Health District only received Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines until May 20 when officials said the first shipment of Pfizer was delivered to their department.

Those providers included Walgreens CVS and Kroger though it was not clear how many doses of Pfizer were available at those sites.

Now Bailer said the department offers all three vaccines at its clinics. Walk-ins are accepted on Wednesdays from 9 a.m. to noon at the Butler County Fairgrounds on Fairgrove Avenue in Hamilton.

Canada paid a premium to get more than 250000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine delivered last December weeks earlier than planned.

The detail is contained in heavily redacted contracts released to the House of Commons health committee late Friday but any specifics on what price was paid or how the delivery schedule was amended were deleted before the contract was published.

Canada reached a deal with Pfizer in July 2020 to buy at least 20 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine it was developing with German-based BioNTech. The first contract was signed on Oct. 26.

Pfizer Canada CEO Cole Pinnow told The Canadian Press in February that Canada’s negotiations were based on an expectation the first vaccines wouldn’t be authorized for use until late January at the earliest and deliveries were planned to start after that.

But within a month of the contract being signed Health Canada’s chief medical adviser Dr. Supriya Sharma was signalling that her department was about two weeks away from giving the vaccine the green light.

That appears to have sent Canada racing back to Pfizer to see if its contract could be amended to get some doses delivered early. On Dec. 4 Canada and Pfizer signed an amendment allowing for that but at a cost.

“Whereas (the) purchaser has requested and Pfizer has agreed …. to amend the delivery schedule so that a certain number of contracted doses are delivered prior to Jan. 1 2021 and in consideration thereof the parties have agreed to increase the price contracted doses which are delivered prior to Jan. 1 2021” the contract says.

Every detail in the contract related to the price paid for dose was deleted before the documents were made public.

The contract with Pfizer stipulated nothing would be shipped until Health Canada had authorized the vaccine which happened on Dec. 9. The first shipment of 30000 doses was on a plane to Canada within days and the first Canadian was vaccinated on Dec. 14.

Ultimately Pfizer shipped 255450 doses before Jan. 1. It has since delivered more than 22.5 million shots and its vaccine has become the main component of Canada’s effort to get all 38 million residents immunized against COVID-19.

The specifics of what Canada paid for the 250 million doses of vaccine it pre-purchased have been hard to come by. The 2021 budget released in April said the total was somewhere around $9 billion.

The only cost per dose revealed so far was released by accident when the price for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was accidentally left in an email included in a package of documents released to the health committee. That email said Canada would pay $8.18 per dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca which would amount to $163 million for the 20 million doses ordered.

The Pfizer contract was one of eight quietly shared with the health committee Friday which is studying Canada’s COVID-19 response and has requested numerous documents from the government as a result. It is the first time Canada has provided any details of its contracts but there are a lot of blank pages and deleted details including all information related to price or delivery schedules.

Procurement Minister Anita Anand has repeatedly said the contracts contained confidentiality clauses that prevented her from releasing them adding she wasn’t going to violate those clauses and risk jeopardizing Canada’s vaccine supply.

NDP health critic Don Davies said he’s frustrated that the committee’s order for unredacted documents was ignored.

“After months of dogged work the opposition finally got Canada’s vaccine contracts” he said on Twitter. “Predictably Liberals released them late on a Friday with barely a week left in the session. Predictably they redacted them in violation of the House Order.”

The contracts do contain some previously unknown details including the premium for early doses of Pfizer and the fact that Canada is allowed to donate doses from five of the suppliers to other countries or international aid organizations such as the World Health Organization or the COVAX vaccine alliance.

There is no mention of donating doses from Pfizer or Moderna but it is allowed for AstraZeneca Johnson & Johnson Novavax Medicago and Sanofi. The contracts also suggest Canada can resell or ask the company to find other buyers for doses from J&J Novavax and Medicago.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to make an announcement at the G7 leaders’ summit in England on Sunday saying Canada will donate up to 100 million doses of vaccine to other countries but it’s not clear yet how many of those would come from supplies initially destined for Canada.

Canada will have almost 50 million excess doses of the four vaccines it has approved and potentially 124 million more from Sanofi Medicago and Novavax if they complete their Phase 3 clinical trials successfully.

Almost two-thirds of all Canadians are now partly vaccinated and more than one in 10 are fully vaccinated. Canada is expecting enough doses to vaccinate every Canadian fully by the end of September.

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXJpem9uYXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzU0NzMwMi9mb3JtZXItYXJpem9uYS1wZy10LWotbWNjb25uZWxsLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWluLW5iYS1mb3ItcGFjZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Arizona PG T.J. McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

73 percent of adults agree that governments should consider the role alternative products can play in making their country smoke-free.

77 percent agree that adult smokers should have access to and accurate information about smoke-free alternatives that have been scientifically substantiated to be a better choice than continued smoking.

67 percent of respondents say that if it is possible to end cigarette sales in their country within 10 to 15 years (through smokers quitting tobacco or switching to better science-based alternatives) their government should dedicate time and resources to making that a reality.

A new international survey commissioned by Philip Morris International Inc. and conducted by independent research firm Povaddo reveals a public appetite for a better approach to reducing the societal harm caused by cigarettes. Seven in ten respondents (71 percent) believe that encouraging those adults who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to smoke-free alternatives instead can complement other efforts to reduce harm.Conducted in December 2020 among 22500+ adults in 20 countries and territories the survey explores attitudes regarding the role of smoke-free alternatives in improving public health. The results reveal broad support for novel approaches to accelerating the decline of cigarette smoking . Specifically the survey found that:Reducing smoking rates remains an important public health issue with three in four respondents (76 percent) believing it is important for governments to dedicate time and resources to achieving this goal. However a majority (58 percent) believe that more regulation and taxation of cigarettes will not be enough to achieve a smoke-free future.“Smoke-free products have already started to play an important role in lowering smoking rates” said Jacek Olczak Chief Operating Officer at PMI . “With the right regulatory encouragement support from civil society and the full embrace of science I believe it is possible for the public’s call to be answered and for cigarette sales to be a thing of the past in many countries within a decade to a decade and a half.”A majority of adults surveyed want to see a shift in the societal approach to tobacco harm reduction including more collaboration between governments and tobacco companies. Moreover nearly seven in ten respondents (68 percent) support tobacco companies working with governments regulators and public health experts to ensure smokers have access to and accurate information about the better smoke-free alternatives science has made available. Further eight in ten respondents believe both governments (88 percent) and businesses (81 percent) have a responsibility to embrace the latest scientific and technological developments.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 biggest oil companies in USA.

The oil industry got clobbered in 2020 and continues to face volatility amid the coronavirus crisis. However oil investors are hopeful as countries begin to vaccinate their populations and industries restart their operations. Recently the International Energy Agency said in a report that it expects oil demand to hit 100.6 million barrels for the first time since late 2019 in the last quarter of 2022. However the agency noted that the slow pace of vaccinations in Asia could dent the expected recovery.

Nonetheless analysts believe that oil companies have seen the rock bottom and are set to gain in the coming months. Despite the global push towards renewable energy and price fluctuations the oil industry is expected to thrive for years to come with major oil companies like Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) Chevron (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) expecting huge profits.

OMAHA Neb. — Kevin Cordes arrived here this week looking like the GEICO caveman—a bushy head of hair thick beard plenty of fur on the rest of his body. By Sunday morning the 2016 Olympian will be nearly hairless.

The process starts with the electric clippers. Then he’ll go through four razors. And there will be a back shave from a friend. That’s the 75-minute deforestation process Cordes will navigate before he dives into the pool in the 100-meter breaststroke Sunday at the U.S. Olympic Trials.

When you’re trying to get to Tokyo every hundredth of a second—and thus every friction-inducing hair follicle—can matter. That’s why some swimmers go from resembling Duck Dynasty characters to pre-pubescent cherubs overnight.

Shaving is the ritual swimmers perform before a big meet removing all hair that cannot be covered by a swim cap or suit. (And truth be told a lot of the hidden hair will go as well.) The goal is to reduce drag (a small factor) and enhance the mental gain from a more streamlined sensation in the water (a big factor). “It’s really that feeling you’ve been searching for” Cordes says. “You feel that smoothness like you’re gliding. It’s that easy speed you’ve been waiting for.”

Now consider this: Cordes is just one of more than 400 swimmers here who will be dumping body hair in bulk over the next week. Men with beards. Women with leg hair. An armada of arm pits. As they say in the furniture clearance sale business: everything must go.

Let the slightly gross shedding begin. “It’s a whole spectacle” says three-time Olympian Elizabeth Beisel now a TV analyst. “I even shaved the hair on my toes.”

Pity the poor hotel drains that have to handle the spectacle. Here come these Lord of the Rings extras preparing to turn local lodging into a mass body-scaping event.

To assess the situation I called the head of housekeeping at the Hilton Omaha Downtown this week to see if they’re prepared for the onslaught. She didn’t get back to me probably because her staff was busy pouring a pre-emptive Liquid-Plumr strike in every shower. I checked in with Eyman Plumbing a local outfit and was told that the threat is real: “When lots of hair is going down the drains it will create backups and clogs” Eyser’s phone answerer says. “The drains need to be properly maintained.” (She stopped short of pitching me on a two-year maintenance plan.)

Hopefully the hotel pipes hold up better than the rooms in the athlete village at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. For some swimmers there is some PTSD still associated with shaving there. “I don’t know what was wrong with the drains in the village” Beisel says. “It was disgusting to be honest.”

Razors are as much a part of racing as tech suits. But they aren’t used often.

One of the demanding facets of the sport is that swimmers at the highest level gear their entire years around one or two major meets. In an Olympic year such as this one that means the sole focus is U.S. team trials and then the Summer Games in Tokyo. They spend months in something of a furry fugue state of training-induced exhaustion when a big meet can seem light years away. “Swimming is kind of brutal that way” Cordes says. “Throughout the year you really have to put your head down and remember what you’re working for. The payoff is going to be there when you rest and finally shave.”

Ahead of those major competitions is the only time they back off in training—tapering is the term—and rest their bodies. Along with a lack of rest comes a lack of shaving; swimmers stay shaggy not wanting to lose that boost by peeling the hair off their bodies too routinely. Hockey has playoff beards; swimming has training beards. “Everyone thinks we’re fully shaved all the time” says Caeleb Dressel the current male star of American swimming. “We’re actually some of the hairiest people around.”

Beisel affirms: “We’re all hairy all year-round. Yes even the girls.” Before competition at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro Beisel shaved Dressel’s back and he shaved the back of her neck. That’s what teammates are for.

Maya DiRado who won four medals in Rio said that the hair growth became a running joke as the weeks and months stretched on between meets—especially when she compared with her fair-haired boyfriend and now husband Rob Andrews. “I’m Italian” she says. “There were times Rob and I would put our legs next to each other and you wouldn’t know who was the girl.”

Part of the key to a well-timed taper—hitting the big meet just right physically and mentally—is waiting to fully shave until right before the first race. For Cordes the shaving process to compete Sunday starts with a beard trimming and using the clippers on some of his body Saturday morning—when he practices Saturday he’ll start to get a lighter feel. “It’s literally peeling the layers day by day feeling faster each morning” he says.

Saturday night it’s time to get down to serious business. That’s when the razors come out for most of the body hair. Now 27 years old Cordes has improved his efficiency—he says it used to take him up to three hours to shave. Now he can knock it out in an hour and 15 minutes before bedtime. “What I look forward to most is putting on some sweats and getting under the covers” he says. “It feels pretty good.”

Sunday morning the final touches are applied: off goes the rest of the beard and the armpit hair. “Those are kind of sensitive” he says. Then it’s time to go to the pool.

The very shaving process serves as a mental reset. After the rest has restored the body here comes the last signal that the endless preparation is now in the rearview mirror and it’s time to compete. “It’s that extra little realization” Beisel says. “Like ‘Yeah this is go time.’ “

And the feeling diving in for warmups after the first full shave in … forever? Transformational.

“It feels colder” DiRado says. “You feel very sensitive and aware of the water.”

“You feel so smooth and slick in the water” Beisel says. “I don’t know if there’s science behind it but it just gets you in that game-ready mode.”

In the weeks before the 2016 Olympic Trials Cordes had a dream one night: he was trying to swim with a mascot suit on. “A bear or something” he says. He told his coach about it and they agreed that when the dreams are going that direction it was time to start tapering and ultimately peeling off the body hair.

“Shaving” Cordes says “is kind of like shedding that mascot suit.”

The Pinnacle Fire began on June 10 and has since grown to more than 4600 acres with no containment as of Sunday according to InciWeb a wildfire tracking website operated by the U.S. Forest Service. Its cause remains under investigation.

The fire appeared to be on the outskirts of the San Carlos Apache Nation parts of which have been threatened for more than a week by other nearby wildfires in the area. The Pinnacle Fire was within the Coronado National Forest in Graham County according to InciWeb.

Two-hundred and forty personnel were assigned to the fire which on Saturday moved south north and east.

At one point on Saturday afternoon firefighting flight operations were stopped because a privately-owned drone was observed flying in a restricted area around the fire an update on InciWeb said. If caught the drone's pilot could face federal civil and criminal fines and possibly jail time the update said.

A home southeast of the fire was evacuated on Saturday evening as the fire crossed ""management action points"" the update said.

The Coronado National Forest issued a closure order for all roads and trails within the Santa Teresa Ecosystem Management Area according to a release from the U.S. Forest Service.

(Bloomberg) — BlackRock Inc. became the first foreign asset manager allowed to start a wholly owned mutual fund business in China a step toward winning a slice of one of the fastest-growing wealth markets.

The world’s largest asset manager was granted a license from the China Securities Regulatory Commission to start selling onshore investment products to Chinese investors the company said Friday in a statement.

The approval comes a month after BlackRock won the nod to pursue a joint venture asset management business along with China Construction Bank Corp. and Singapore’s Temasek. Together the two entities give BlackRock an edge to reach more investors in China as it competes with a slew of global institutions going after an asset pool estimated by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to surpass $70 trillion by the end of the decade.

“China is taking significant steps in opening up its financial markets” BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said in the statement. “We can support more Chinese investors to access financial markets and build portfolios that can serve them throughout their lives.”

The string of approvals are a positive sign for other asset managers including Fidelity International Ltd. and Neuberger Berman Group LLC which are still waiting for permission for their fully controlled operations in the country.

For BlackRock being first “gives it a head start among global managers” said Sun Guiping an analyst with Shanghai Securities Co. The investment giant will also benefit China’s mutual fund industry by bringing in more product offerings and expertise he said.

More wholly foreign-owned or controlled mutual fund providers will emerge as China’s opening up continues Sun said. Their joint ventures already occupy 11 spots among the top 20 largest fund managers in China excluding money-market funds he said.

New York-based BlackRock’s strategy in China stands in stark contrast with Vanguard Group Inc. which ditched plans in March for a wholly owned mutual fund license. Vanguard is taking a different path by working with Ant Group Co. and building a robo advisory service.

BlackRock oversaw more than $9 trillion globally as of March 31.

Except graduation. They eked out this one tradition.

They have managed to get accepted to college overcome Fs deal with trauma navigate the rules of drive-through socializing. Some lost a loved one made a new friend. For many the final act of their upended high school education was the first in-person gathering of their entire class since March 2020.

None of the graduation ceremony restrictions — the limited number of guests spaced-out chairs mask-covered smiles — could stop the exultation of a senior class forged by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The scene appeared pretty normal recently at Sierra Vista High School in Baldwin Park: Dozens of chairs six feet apart filled the field. Family members as many as 10 for each student carried signs and flowers and assembled in clusters in the bleachers. One woman held up a blown-up image of a student's face. They cheered when their senior’s name was called.

Then the most hopeful sign of all: Dressed in red and black gowns the Class of 2021 just couldn't resist. They broke pandemic protocols clumped together in groups at the end of the ceremony and hugged one another.

Here are some of their senior year stories in which math English and science seemed to be the least of the lessons learned.

Johnny Sen Sierra Vista High

Johnny Sen's high school years revolved around sports — volleyball wrestling football cheerleading. More than anything he needed to keep learning and moving.

The pandemic brought everything to a halt. When his sports lifeline was abruptly cut Johnny struggled to adapt to the sedentary routine of online classes. He tried to drum up motivation but in a double whammy he was still recovering from a junior year football injury a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.

Still he kept up with daily physical therapy. As he began senior year — school closed football season on hold — he fought to stay focused. He would turn in assignments and listen to lessons but the material was hard to grasp.

In November his mother who had survived cancer was hospitalized with COVID-like symptoms and slipped into a coma. Johnny got a 3 a.m. call that she had only hours left and raced to the hospital to say goodbye.

His friends surrounded him in the months ahead.

“I wasn’t doing any work; I was failing"" he said. ""It was pretty bad for me.”

For a time he thought he might not be able to graduate: He had Fs in economics and statistics. But his buddies urged him to improve he said so that they could all ""walk"" at graduation.

They tutored him on homework assignments; one friend once showed up at his home at 6 a.m. to make sure he turned in work on time. Johnny turned Fs into Ds and continued rehabilitation for his injury still hoping he could make a team.

When football began this spring Johnny braced his leg and joined his teammates. Recently he got his mother’s name Nhanh tattooed across his forearm.

“Johnny was a quiet leader. He didn’t realize it” said former head football coach Sergio M. Villaseñor. “By his actions and how he elevated himself it gravitated to a lot of the younger players.”

Johnny intends to go to Rio Hondo College to stay close to family get a job and help support his grandmother who became ill with COVID-19 but recovered. He wants to save money for a car and eventually live on his own.

His senior year amid the pandemic showed him that friends and family members had his back: “Even when you're on your own there’s someone there for you.”

Jade Magallanes Sierra Vista High

Jade Magallanes found distance learning made seeking help more difficult. She struggled to find resources. The week before winter break on top of meeting deadlines for college applications she had to prep for three tests and finish applying for financial aid. She said she often stopped eating when she became anxious and overcome by stress and tears.

“I don't think I would take it back though” Jade said “because I appreciate what I went through.”

Her perseverance paid off. Jade graduated from Sierra Vista High School with the grades she wanted and learned how to get through moments when stress took a toll on her physical health. Her mother Jefel Santos taught her how to “just breathe.""

Jade said she learned how to cope by eating comfort food dinners pasta and chicken spending time outdoors and roller skating with her mom. Usually ""just breathe"" translated into pulling away from her textbooks — a skill she will take to UC Merced in the fall.

In the midst of a lonely year Jade found a friend in neighbor and fellow senior Jesus Medina. Unable to see their other friends during the pandemic the two bonded separated only by a wall that she often hopped.

“It just evolved into something very beautiful” Jade said.

Jade’s mother Santos was tearful watching her daughter graduate and at last receive closure. ""This is probably the best thing that we could share seeing her walk"" Santos said.

Khadijat Solebo George Washington Prep

In 2017 Khadijat Solebo and her family left their home country of Nigeria for Los Angeles ultimately settling in Compton.

As immigrants she saw how hard her parents worked to give her and her siblings a better future. Her mother lost her job due to the pandemic and her father a security guard continues to search for stable work.

Khadijat worked hard too. She has always envisioned herself going into the medical field to help underserved communities.

Despite the online setting Khadijat the senior class president also worked with her classmates to put on virtual events like spirit week and homecoming to give them a spark of hope even if it just meant dancing over Zoom.

“Before I didn’t really enjoy school and I didn’t appreciate going to classes” Khadijat said. When schools reopened she did not return to campus out of concern for her family's safety and instead finished school remotely. “But now that I can’t do those things I see the importance of them and how much I enjoy doing them.”

Like other schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District Washington Prep did not host an in-person prom or other senior events.

But as graduation day approached and California neared full reopening Khadijat said she had enough of the virtual experience. Her class deserved a real graduation. She pleaded for help from her school counselor Cindy Contreras-Mostajo. They pushed for an in-person event that could be held safely outdoors.

On Friday the school hosted two ceremonies on the football field. Khadijat took to the podium as class salutatorian.

""With diligence consistency resilience focus and prayer we can do it"" she told her classmates. ""I know we can.”

She is headed to UCLA in the fall where she said she will study biomedicine with hopes of attending medical school.

Joaquin Gonzalez Garfield High

At a certain point in the pandemic separated from friends Joaquin Gonzalez turned inward and focused on accepting who he is. Once he shaved his hair off completely just because it was a look he had always wanted to try — no longer worried about what others thought of him.

“Once you let go of that you're able to grow. … Suddenly you don't see anything that needs fixing” Joaquin said reflecting on the solitude of the pandemic. “You just give yourself the time you need.”

But the months were difficult and more than once he burst into tears unsettled by the loneliness. He knew that he needed time to work on his mental health and find ways to reach out to others. When coursework and side jobs felt overwhelming he stopped to take time for himself.

“We all had this idea that even though we’re at home we need to be 100% [productive] as how we were at work or how we were at school” Joaquin said. “And that’s just not always the case.”

Still Joaquin could not abandon his passion to advocate for community resources and change especially as he saw the toll of the pandemic in his neighborhood and felt moved by the summer of racial reckoning. He got involved with students pushing to defund school police at Los Angeles Unified schools. He worked for RootDown L.A. a group that promotes healthy food in communities of color.

While his grades before senior year weren’t the best Joaquin said that with the help of advisors at InnerCity Struggle an Eastside advocacy organization he stayed on track — and was accepted to UC Riverside. He also is a recipient of the Jordan Brand Wings Scholars Program a full-tuition award.

Joaquin rose to become a leader in the InnerCity organization at times giving presentations or speaking at school board meetings actions “inspiring to see” said Steven Ortega a youth organizer with the group.

Joaquin said he will continue advocating for communities of color and take on activism roles at UC Riverside where he plans to study environmental science and one day bring back his expertise to his hometown.

When he was younger he said he had teachers who labeled him as troubled and unwilling to learn. To walk at graduation he said is meaningful because he has proved them wrong.

It’s not surprising given the increased focus in recent years on C-suite and board parity by investors such as Blackrock as well as other institutions including the Nasdaq which recently stated that companies listed on its US exchange will need to have a minimum of two non-white or female Board members. And if they do not they must publicise the reasons as to why.

The picture is similar in the UK. According to Julia van den Bosch Wazen CFO Practice consultant at Odgers Berndtson The Financial Conduct Authority in the UK is now looking to the London Stock Exchange listings framework as to whether similar measures ought to be implemented while for City firms “there are already ongoing discussions about potentially using wider FCA powers such as denying regulatory approves to drive diversity on Boards”.

But while there’s certainly been improvement the under-representation of women in executive finance positions remains less than rosy with van den Bosch Wazen admitting that “whilst much has been done we are still of the view that progress is too slow”.

Still too few women make CFO

According to the government-backed Hampton-Alexander Review of which Odgers Berndtson are active contributors while women now make up one third of all board positions in the UK’s FTSE 100 companies up from 12.5% less than a decade ago there remains a concerning lack of female representation in senior leadership and key executive roles in FTSE companies with just 15% of finance directors bring women.

“One of the Big Four partners informed me that their annual graduate intake split is around 52% women 48% men. By the time this age group reaches their early thirties the number goes down to 34% women” explains van den Bosch Wazen. “Since many CFOs of listed businesses in the UK take the audit route before moving into industry the disparity of diverse talent coming into the market starts early and is not able to catch up later.”

Recent McKinsey research for its Women in the Workplace report for North America backs this up. While research shows that women and men in financial services begin their careers making up roughly equal portions of entry-level staff once you get higher up the ladder women account for only 19% (one in five) of positions in the C-suite.

The research suggests that as women advance through their careers they steadily lose ground to their male peers at every stage suggesting the pathway to the CFOs office is not as clearly illuminated for female candidates.

Why women make good CFOs

And yet the evidence suggests that when women do make it to CFO the payoff for organisations is positive. Companies with female CFOs and CEOs prove more profitable than those led by men with women-led firms generating US$1.8 trillion more in gross profit than the sector average according to a report by S&P Global.

Furthermore as van den Bosch Wazen points out according to McKinsey’s latest Diversity Wins report companies with more than 30% of women executives are more likely to outperform companies where this percentage ranged from 10-30%.

“The benefits speak for themselves and I’m thrilled that investors are pushing harder for this” states van den Bosch Wazen. “The more diverse your management team the more engaged your workforce and the better your customers are looked after. You are better informed of the world you tend not to miss trends making your balance sheet strong and your organisation run more efficiently.”

Cristina Catania Partner at McKinsey & Company agrees that gender diversity “enriches decision-making and so has a positive impact on companies’ performance and sustainability” however more specifically and in the context of the finance function she points out that studies have found that “women have higher risk aversion than men and that can be a good thing”.

Maggie Xu Principal of Greater China Financial Services Practice at Oliver Wyman agrees suggesting research shows that female CFOs are more risk averse and tend to adopt more conservative accounting policies. And for “those companies/industries with higher litigation risk default risk systematic risk or management turnover risk who are more focused on accounting conservatism female CFOs may well do a better job”.

Arguing that women are “equally qualified to effectively address current and future challenges and disruptions” Hanady Khalife Senior Director of MEA & India for the Institute of Management Accountants further points out that beyond operations inclusive working cultures where women leaders exist have been known to attract and retain top talent.

“No matter how you look at it women leaders are good for business and for building more sustainable self-sufficient and increasingly shockproof businesses even economies” asserts Khalife.

In our roundtable we talk to these four female financial leaders to identify the barriers facing women and discover how organisations and leaders can facilitate their advancement.

Why are women under-represented in senior financial positions and the CFO role specifically?

Julia van den Bosch Wazen Consultant Odgers Berndtson’s CFO Practice: Women in key financial management roles tend to have a shared set of challenges such as balancing home/work life which is overcome by having the right support and an engaged sponsor at work. Sponsors are often men in senior management positions. Men are essential in furthering the development of all strands of diversity in the workplace and the more informed diversity and inclusion allies there are the better the company performs. COVID has forced the majority of companies to work from home and highlighted to many employers the dual nature of a working woman’s careers. That said pre-pandemic many female CFOs said to me that their life was a constant balancing act of whom to disappoint more – their partners kids or friends. Senior women rarely disappoint their employers just like their male peers.

During the executive search processes we run Boards will actively seek diversity though in a risk adverse hiring market like the one that we are in many end up choosing proven Board experience over and above stepping up talent. It is widely publicised that there are more men in those roles than there are women and so the balance is again not restored further facilitating the lack of Board experienced women.

Cristina Catania Partner McKinsey & Company Unfortunately this under-representation of women in senior roles isn’t exclusive to finance – it’s a similar picture in business management and strategy. But prior to COVID concentrated efforts were making some gains. Across all industries we’ve seen women’s representation in the C-suite increase by 24% since 2015 including some notable appointments in the financial sector like Jane Fraser at Citi. There is however a broken rung at the very bottom of the corporate ladder that is stalling progress.

Our annual Women in the Workplace study of women in North America shows that for every 100 men just 72 women are promoted and hired to manager. Women get stuck at the entry level and fewer become managers. Not surprisingly men then end up holding 62% of manager-level positions while women hold just 38%. The number of women decreases at every subsequent level so despite improved hiring and promotion rates for women at senior levels they aren’t able to catch up.

Hanady Khalife Senior Director MEA & India Operations Institute of Management Accountants One would assume this is a problem most prevalent in the Middle East but it is global. A National Bureau of Economic Research study from Denmark found that even at the height of their careers women tend to spend more time raising children and so work fewer hours take longer breaks from full-time employment and are more likely to move into less demanding jobs with lower growth and less pay.

Other reasons include the pay gap lack of mentorship and coaching and aggressive competition by male colleagues as well as lack of female C-suite role models. When women don’t see role models or potential paths towards executive-level leadership they are more likely to deselect themselves out of such roles.

Maggie Xu Principal Greater China Financial Services Practice Oliver Wyman In research we identified four critical barriers for women seeking leadership. Firstly men and women define effective leadership differently while women leadership candidates tend to be evaluated by men. This misalignment in key leadership traits between the genders creates obstacles to women rising to leadership roles. In China although significant increase in the ratio of companies with female executives has been observed during the decade extensive research indicates that the rate for female CEO remains very low and CEOs are critical in assessing the performance of CFO candidates.

Secondly women’s focus or predisposition toward results along with a dislike of ‘networking for networking’s sake’ may cause them to miss an important dimension of what ultimately impacts leadership promotion decisions. We also discovered that qualified women are unintentionally left on the sidelines partly because women are simply not top of mind and so are less likely to self-advocate and must battle inaccurate assumptions related to their willingness to take on more intense roles.

Also men and women perceive their readiness for the next role very differently and most companies do not actively mitigate that bias at play. A woman often won’t apply to a job unless she feels she meets 100% of the described qualifications while for men it’s more like 60% and as we all know raising one’s hand does not necessarily equate with capability.

Finally research shows women are more likely to have ideas mis-attributed to others be talked over in meetings receive vague or unconstructive feedback and be viewed negatively for visibly demonstrating the same confidence that is valued in male leaders. Many high potential women weary of bias exit the talent pipeline either opting out of the workforce or choosing a different career.

How can organisations and leaders motivate empower and facilitate women in reaching CFO status?

Julia van den Bosch Wazen Mentorship from senior colleagues is vital in helping women to navigate the mid-point of their career. Our philosophy in the CFO Practice facilitates that same ethos: we want to help advise women early on to help build careers toward the three-stage interview process they will face when stepping up to their first Main Board role. A financial management career for a listed CFO role needs to be built to answer the questions a CEO will pose (do you have commercial and operational P&L experience to be my partner in setting strategic goals); the Audit Chair (will you give me comfort in your technical financial management skills to assure that the business will not have to restate its numbers); and the Chair (do you keep my CEO ‘in check’ and will you let my Audit Chair rest easy at night).

There are a number of roles within the finance function I strongly encourage women to take en route to Board to gather experience against the above criteria. I also urge women to do more external networking. I’ve set up bi-annual women’s networking lunches giving senior female talent the opportunity to hear how experienced finance leaders have successfully developed their careers. These have been well-received and have now broadened out to both our Regional CFO and Financial Services Practices to help deepen the advice shared.

When selecting a headhunting firm I would urge that you ask what they are doing to support the D&I agenda during the pitch process. Your candidate list might well be diverse but if you see that those who are looking likely to be shortlisted are all non-diverse check why and what can be actioned based on feedback.

Cristina Catania Talent attraction is the first step to sustaining a pipeline to fill CFO roles long term. For finance there is a need to create multiple role model examples to inspire young women to join this career path which is increasingly at the centre of key company decision-making. We know from our study that when employees believe that their company offers both fairness and opportunity they are three times more likely to remain at the company be fully engaged and recommend the company to a peer. What we know about the experiences of women at entry levels in financial services indicates that a perceived lack of fairness and opportunity could be contributing to the steep drop-off in female representation between entry-level and middle management roles.

Specifically women early in their careers are less likely to aspire to top positions. This could be due to a lack of female role models but women also report less interest in executive roles due to concerns about balancing work and family and the perceived pressure that accompanies top jobs. Even when women do aspire to the top positions they typically do not receive the sponsorship support that would enable them to succeed.

Our 2017 Women in the Workplace research shows that women who receive advice from senior leaders on career advancement are more likely to be promoted and yet earlier-tenure women receive less encouragement and support from senior leaders than do their male counterparts.

The programmes that are showing impact in creating a sustainable pipeline of women start with the creation of a more ‘inclusive’ workplace created through HR parental policies (applicable also to fathers which in turn allows for shared parental responsibilities) and doubling-down on additional welfare services like in-office daycare.

Other measures include removing gender biases in assessing criteria for being eligible for a promotion flexibility arrangements leveraging maternity as an upskilling moment the introduction of sponsorship programmes and measuring and publishing target setting. And all steps need to be truly sponsored and promoted by the CEO and cascaded throughout the whole organisation.

Hanady Khalife Increasing opportunities for women to advance to leadership roles in the organisation begins with understanding the internal pipeline to identify barriers and obstacles to advancement and in turn establishing measurable goals for building equity.

Organisations need to develop corporate cultures that support women who wish to achieve a healthy work/life balance rather than breed cultures that penalises them for attempting to balance priorities. But while firms need to focus on more affirmative action to ensure gender equality whether through quotas or recruitment programmes they also need to pay more attention to how women can be mentored better to keep pace with new and emerging industry requirements.

Maggie Xu Organisations can be more purposeful in levelling the playing field for women and by changing the emphasis from fixing things bottom up to top-down effects will take place faster. We believe there are three core elements in this effort: inclusive leadership starts at the top so educate your existing leadership and motivate them to be change agents; target D&I like a business to get more results; and double down on sponsorship improving the effectiveness of senior leaders’ sponsorship of the women.",,,,,,,,,

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

IT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping shopping shopping often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?

Stephen Procter a ceramist specializing in art for the garden has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.

Stephen who is Vermont-based has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together and how.

sculptural pots in the garden with stephen procter

Margaret Roach: Hi Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].

Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.

Margaret: I know whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels your pots and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story I keep looking around my garden with a different eye I have to say thanks to you. So: thanks to you.

Stephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.

Margaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens didn’t you? About 20 years ago.

Stephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny I’ve been to several pottery events recently and I don’t really feel like a potter even though I work in clay.

People say potter or pottery and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah they are. They are. So again I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them although they do have a hole a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of we’ll say discussion but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter] about functional ceramics functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is whether it’s art or not.

Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.

Margaret: Yeah decorative. So yours are decorative but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?

Stephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people they define spaces they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.

Margaret: Well but I think the garden is I mean to me what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating is it? I mean hopefully it elevates us and the space.

Stephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way especially it in a certain sense reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.

Margaret: Yeah. Well when we did the “Times” story you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens whose work I’d read but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it but it was beautiful.

Stephen: Sadly I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.

Margaret: Right. And so from that I wrote down one line I remember “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it no longer wild.”

Stephen: Oh I love that line.

Margaret: And so there’s that sort of there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship yeah?

Stephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden which is already cultivated is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation to my mind.

Margaret: Right. Now I said in the introduction that yours because they’re this very high-fired stoneware they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration not just the placement and the scale and so forth but also the durability. And yours can do that.

Stephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.

Margaret: [Laughter.] Yeah if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element a non-plant element of another substance but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed and it changing the wilderness people kind of rise up to it too when they see one of these don’t they [laughter]?

Stephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts and apparently other people do too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious and I see that happening and I always feel like oh the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.

Margaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play and how do we figure it out where to place such a statement.

So if someone contacts you and says so I’m thinking I want something but I don’t know what or where you sometimes go and go on a walk with them I guess or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean what’s the beginning of that process of that exploration process?

I mean I always say one of the most important things about garden design and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles is don’t forget besides walking around outside don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors because I’m indoors a lot right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration like the placement not just from the outdoor experience but from key views within the living space.

Stephen: Absolutely I do. And it can make a big impact oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont Judith Irven who was talking about she and her husband in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes and the wind.

Margaret: And I think some of this people may think oh right I’ve used sometimes a pair of well-placed chairs is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow and especially in the snow there’s just something so it’s like “Ooh someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.

Stephen: Yes exactly.

Margaret: Yeah that come hither kind of but not right now kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says I think I want something but I don’t know what and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?

Stephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of I think of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.

At the inside bend of a path along a garden pathway is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter] if you will as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are I think of as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.

And then there are more interesting and I think more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that and reveals only part of itself creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.

Margaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.

Stephen: Well exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured it’s a very geometric herb garden and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple which I think would be a really interesting … I mean it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.

Margaret: You were just mentioning two pots and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.

Stephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting and it’s not just my own experience but people I work with and when we place pieces in the garden it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases this has been a surprising discovery for me a very relatively small piece say a globe of 24 inches tall maybe even a little shorter if it relates to a larger vessel it can hold its own in a large space because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost if it has a big brother [laughter] it can tag along.

Margaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens and I think this is a good time I don’t know rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at and I feel like before I get distracted by oh those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view creating almost axial endpoints like “Ooh look up there.”

And I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance but let’s look out there too.

Stephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.

Margaret: Well and it’s interesting that you say that because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years one of the things they’ve told me when I was like “Oh well I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like “Yes that’s a great idea. But along the way maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis not a literal path but a visual path maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements spots of gold to help you travel there.”

So that sort of duet again or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas I guess is what I’m saying come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.

Stephen: In a sense they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another to another to another to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned a particular palette of plant you’re using to accomplish a similar thing.

Margaret: You just said choreograph and you’re giving yourself away because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?

Stephen: Yes I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.

Margaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that and you’re teaching not only I think at your place but elsewhere including I think in Europe this year for the first time maybe?

Stephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June which I’m really looking forward to.

I want to qualify slightly what you said there Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years against my better judgment I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly I discover “Oh my gosh your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]

Margaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.

Stephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay self-taught and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.

Margaret: I didn’t ask you yet but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now I know that it’s smallish and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas or is there so updates ahead?

Stephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter] she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.

Margaret: And is there any new planting going to go on or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?

Stephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.

Margaret: And now a third requirement which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]

Well I’m so glad to talk to you again and as I said I hope that this will just some of these thoughts from your experience working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you Stephen.

Stephen: Thank you so much. It’s been a pleasure.

Wade,"The Supreme Court is hugely important in these shifts of course but what’s often lost in the breathless coverage of the Court is that constitutional law does not simply emanate from the highest court in the land. Changes in society also percolate into the Court’s thinking. And even if abortion opponents do succeed in putting a stake through Roe that won’t be the end of the story. Constitutional law can never be completely stable on matters of liberty and equality on abortion or otherwise. A decision on Dobbs could speed the rollback of abortion rights across the country—but if abortion advocates heed the lessons of the campaign that got it here it could just as easily trigger a backlash that ultimately writes abortion rights into black-letter law.

The long story of the fight against Roe is in part a strategy cobbled together from disparate ideas and approaches that once proved useful for abolitionists civil rights activists and gay rights advocates.

Some of this connection is symbolic: Anti-abortion leaders have deliberately invoked the struggle for equal rights for Black people in a bid to rally wider political support for their own cause portraying “the unborn” as a class of people with no other voice in American politics. (Dr. John Willke the so-called “father of the pro-life movement” even wrote a book called Abortion and Slavery: History Repeats.) In the aftermath of Roe this appeal was an effort to lend legitimacy to a cause on which neither political party had firmed up a position. Conservative evangelicals many of whom deeply opposed abortion kept their distance from what they saw as a Catholic movement. Comparing their work to the clear moral good of abolitionism however made it easier for abortion foes to appeal to evangelicals Mormons and other religious conservatives helping to mainstream anti-abortion activism and open the door to a partnership with the Republican Party.

In a campaign to shift the scope of constitutional rights marrying a social movement to formal power is always a critical step. Nineteenth-century anti-slavery activism and 20th- century anti-segregation efforts were grounded in churches and civic groups but truly took off once their goals were incorporated into the reform agenda of a major political party. So too anti-abortion activism has been sustained by a potent union with the modern GOP.

In the 1980s with Roe on the books and a constitutional amendment to ban abortion seemingly out of reach abortion opponents rethought their approach to dismantling precedent looking not to the 19th-century abolitionist movement but to the 20th-century civil-rights lawyers who took on school segregation. Groups like Americans United for Life brought a series of cases designed to chip away at Roe and make it seem increasingly incoherent.

While anti-abortion absolutists hoped for an outright ban (and focused on revising the text of the Constitution) other abortion foes increasingly proclaimed themselves to be incrementalists—an approach taken by lawyers like those in Thurgood Marshall’s NAACP whose legal savvy led them to wait patiently for the right moment to strike.

Efforts by anti-abortion activists at the state and local level also reflect the use of a strategy that has already proved successful for gay rights advocates—one that focused on changing local laws one step at a time to make the values written into an earlier case appear to be out of step with contemporary constitutional law as well as public sentiment.

In 1986 gay rights suffered a setback when the Supreme Court decided Bowers v. Hardwick rejecting the argument that liberty encompassed the right to engage in sexual activity between two people of the same sex. What followed was a concerted series of popular efforts to undermine that ruling. These took many forms but one potent strategy entailed state and local organizing to decriminalize sex between consenting adults and to extend civil rights protections on the basis of sexual orientation.

In 2003 when the Court eventually overruled Bowers in Lawrence v. Texas Justice Anthony Kennedy cited the repeal of sodomy laws and enactment of pro-equality laws as one reason why the logic of the earlier decision had “sustained serious erosion.” He also pointed to the fact that other legal rulings “contradict its central holding.” In other words the social facts upon which precedent had been based were either wrong then or later proven incorrect. And he encouraged further use of out-of-court mobilization to erode precedent when he wrote that “As the Constitution endures persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.”

Anti-abortion forces have employed the exact same strategy by convincing legislatures to enact laws that reject the assumptions and values contained in Roe. In the 1980s anti-abortion leaders focused on the idea of establishing “fetal personhood” as a national norm pushing for fetal protection well outside the abortion context: in homicide laws personal injury law even child abuse law. These efforts proved remarkably successful: 38 states now treat an unborn child as a person in non-abortion homicide cases. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia treat drug use by pregnant people as child abuse lending support to arguments about the dignity of unborn life.

In the 1990s anti-abortion leaders took a new tack setting out to prove that Roe’s original grounding in women’s health and equality had it backwards because abortion allegedly made women sicker more vulnerable and less free. Groups like Americans United for Life fought for state laws that required women to hear highly disputed statements about the risks of abortion—including its supposed connection to post-traumatic stress regret infertility and breast cancer. Red states from Texas to South Dakota passed such laws which though medically disputable did contribute to a new set of legal norms. At the same time they chipped away at the accessibility of the procedure itself; 23 states have since passed so-called TRAP laws (for “targeted regulations of abortion providers”) adding sometimes onerous new requirements for doctors and clinics.

So in 2021 not only has the Court’s personnel changed but it’s weighing abortion questions in a new legal and political landscape. None of this means that Roe is certain to be repudiated in next year’s Supreme Court term or ever. Nor does it tell us exactly where lines will be drawn by individual judges. But politics can alter the broader conditions in which cases are decided generate new social facts and understandings for judges to ponder and perhaps embrace and create pressure to repudiate what once seemed like settled law.

The current focus on “viability”—the question at the heart of the Dobbs case—is a new step in this politics of repudiation. In Roe v. Wade the Court has held that there is a right to abortion until fetal viability which now falls around the 24th week of pregnancy. Advances in neonatal care might move up the date of viability somewhat but until now the point has held: Any future limits on abortion right would have to observe that line in the sand. The Court has preserved this “viability” line even as it repeatedly tinkered with abortion rights in response to politics.

To chip away at the “viability” norm states have rushed to ban abortions much earlier in pregnancy—the Mississippi law now before the Supreme Court prohibits the procedure a full eight to nine weeks before viability. Georgia recognizes fetal personhood at six weeks. Alabama has sought to ban abortions outright regardless of gestational time. Anti-abortion activists then point to all these moves as evidence that the viability norm encoded in Roe just like the sexual-behavior norm encoded in Bowers has now become an outlier—a relic of a time when American beliefs around abortion were far more permissive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMTIvbnlyZWdpb24vcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmVzLWRlbW9jcmF0cy1ueWMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Has New York Hit a Progressive Plateau?

In 2016 an influential Agency Manager of Prudential Assurance Company Singapore (“Prudential“) orchestrated a mass exodus of over 200 agents to a competitor Aviva Financial Advisors Pte Ltd (“Aviva“). Prudential in turn sued the Agency Manager for up to S$2.5 billion in damages in a high-profile case which attracted significant media attention in Singapore.

In Prudential Assurance Co Singapore (Pte) Ltd v Tan Shou Yi Peter and another [2021] SGHC 109 the Singapore High Court (SGHC) rendered its decision on the dispute providing important guidance on issues of among other matters breaches of contract and fiduciary duties.

In this case note we briefly examine the SGHC’s decision and offer some key takeaways from the case.

Contents

Key takeaways

Parties to an agency agreement or employment contract may be subject to a duty of non-solicitation even if those express words are not used in a contract. Such a duty may arguably be imported by the use of more general wording such as was used in this case (e.g. to conduct business with “integrity and honesty”).

If employers impose certain restrictive covenants on employees via their employment contracts and not others (e.g. a non-compete clause but not a non-solicitation clause) they may find it difficult to argue that the excluded covenant is in any event an implied term. In this case the SGHC held that the fact that parties included non-compete obligations but not non-solicitation obligations showed that they clearly applied their minds to which restrictive covenants should apply.

While unilateral variation clauses (i.e. clauses permitting one party to amend a contract without first obtaining the consent of the other party) are not unlawful per se a party seeking to unilaterally vary the terms of a contract post-formation should ensure that such a right is clearly provided for in the contract. In the present case while Prudential had expressly reserved the unilateral right to amend certain rules regulations and instructions the SGHC found that it could not unilaterally amend the contract itself by imposing a non-solicitation clause.

Parties should not assume that all non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) will be upheld by default. NDAs purporting to conceal breaches of contract or fiduciary obligations will be struck down as being void and/or unenforceable.

Background

The first defendant Peter Tan Shou Yi (“Peter“) was a successful Master Group Agency Manager (“Master GAM“) of the plaintiff Prudential. As Master GAM he ran Peter Tan Organization (PTO) which was the most successful group of agents selling Prudential’s insurance products. As of 2016 there were about 500 agents in PTO contributing about 10% of Prudential’s entire agency sales.

In May and June 2016 Peter met some of his Agency Leaders (ALs) and discussed a potential move to Aviva. The ALs who attended these meetings signed NDAs with Peter.

On 1 June 2016 Peter incorporated the second defendant PTO Management and Consultancy Pte Ltd (PTOMC). Between 15 and 17 June 2016 195 Prudential agents gave notices of termination of their agency agreements. Peter gave notice of termination of his own agency agreement on 8 July 2016. Prudential responded by summarily terminating Peter’s agency agreement alleging breach of the same.

On 23 July 2016 Aviva Peter and PTOMC entered into a Distribution Advisory Agreement under which PTOMC would be the exclusive provider of certain services to Aviva for a period of 10 years. PTOMC would in turn engage Peter to perform these services.

By February 2017 a total of 241 agents from PTO had terminated their agency agreements with Prudential.

In proceedings before the SGHC Prudential claimed that Peter took preparatory steps to leave Prudential and bring with him other agents in PTO to join Aviva (“Preparatory Steps“) and subsequently solicited agents in PTO to leave Prudential en masse and join Aviva (“Acts of Solicitation“). Prudential claimed that these steps breached Peter’s contractual obligations and fiduciary duties owed to Prudential. Prudential also claimed against PTOMC for dishonestly assisting Peter to breach his fiduciary duties.

Peter in turn made several counterclaims against Prudential for: (a) wrongful termination of his agency agreement with Prudential; (b) wrongfully inducing the ALs who attended the meetings with him to breach their NDAs with him; (c) breach of its equitable duty of confidence to him by disclosing the confidential information obtained from the ALs; and (d) conspiring with the ALs to cause loss to Peter by unlawful means.

The decision of the Singapore High Court

Breach of contract

The SGHC found that Peter had in fact carried out the Preparatory Steps and Acts of Solicitation and was thus in breach of his contractual duty to Prudential to “conduct his insurance business with integrity and honesty.” The SGHC held that the scope of this duty required Peter to serve Prudential with good faith and undivided interest and that meant that he would not do anything during the currency of the agency which may harm Prudential. This included a duty not to solicit Prudential’s agents to join a competitor.

Prudential had separately argued that it had the contractual right to unilaterally impose a non-solicitation obligation on Peter by issuing an “agency instruction.” The SGHC held that Peter was not bound by the non-solicitation clause in one of Prudential’s agency instructions even though the clause was found to be reasonable and enforceable as the clause had not been validly incorporated as part of Peter’s agreements with Prudential. The agreements required Peter to comply with Prudential’s instructions but the inclusion of the non-solicitation clause was not an instruction but an attempt to unilaterally amend the contract. According to the agreements such variations had to be in writing and signed by both parties. There was no such mutual consent in this case and Peter had in fact objected to the non-solicitation clause.

Finally the SGHC declined to imply a term of mutual trust and confidence into Peter’s agreements with Prudential as the legal requirements for implication of a term were not satisfied. In its analysis the SGHC noted that Prudential had pleaded that the proposed implied term would encompass an obligation not to entice or attempt to entice Prudential’s agents to leave Prudential (essentially a non-solicitation obligation). As the agreements already contained restrictive covenants (in particular non-compete obligations) without referring to non-solicitation obligations the SGHC held that the parties must have contemplated but chose not to explicitly deal with the issue of non-solicitation obligations.

Fiduciary duties

The SGHC held that Peter did not owe fiduciary duties to Prudential. The evidence pointed to the fact that Peter had operated PTO as an independent business and managed the agents in PTO for his own account subject to the terms of his agreements with Prudential. Prudential did not entrust Peter with the management and control of the agents in PTO. Consequently the relationship between Peter and Prudential was purely commercial and there was no relationship of mutual trust and confidence such as to give rise to fiduciary obligations.

In particular the SGHC reiterated the Court of Appeal’s cautionary words in Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo Boong Hua and others [2018] 2 SLR 655 that the courts “will and should be slow in imposing fiduciary obligations on parties to a purely commercial relationship because it is normally inappropriate to expect a commercial party to subordinate its own interests to those of another commercial party.”

Peter’s counterclaims

Peter’s counterclaims were wholly dismissed. In particular Peter’s counterclaim against Prudential for inducing breaches of the NDAs was dismissed as the SGHC found that the NDAs were unenforceable since they had been entered into for an unlawful purpose namely for the purpose of deceiving Prudential and concealing Peter’s breach of his contractual obligations to Prudential. The SGHC observed that in the circumstances allowing a claim based on the NDAs would “make a mockery of the law.” As the NDAs were illegal and unenforceable Peter’s counterclaim for breach of confidence was also dismissed.

Damages

Damages for breach of contract are ordinarily assessed in terms of the claimant’s expectation loss which refers to the value of the benefit that the claimant would have obtained if not for the breach of contract.

Prudential’s claim for up to S$2.5 billion in lost business value and profits was premised on the counterfactual in which Peter would have remained with Prudential until his retirement and that PTO would remain intact and continue to generate profits for Prudential. Peter disagreed arguing that he would have left Prudential in any case after the appropriate notice period and that he would have solicited all the ALs and agents who left to join him as soon as it was legally permissible to do so.

The SGHC held that Peter’s counterfactual was the appropriate one to apply in this case. The SGHC noted that Prudential’s assumption that Peter would have stayed with them until retirement was too speculative especially since the parties would have had to renegotiate and agree on terms of renewal. Similarly it was too speculative to predict whether PTO would persist in perpetuity even in Peter’s absence.

Conclusion

The Singapore High Court’s ruling and observations have significant implications for individuals subject to agency agreements or employment contracts.

The IFSB General Assembly is an apex representative body with 87 members including 81 regulatory and supervisory authorities 10 international intergovernmental organizations and 96 market players which include financial institutions professional firms industry associations and stock exchanges operating in 57 jurisdictions.

According to a statement issued here on Friday Dr. Baqir’s appointment was approved by the IFSB General Assembly in its 19th meeting held on June 09- 2021.

Dr. Reza Baqir is currently serving as the Deputy Chairman of the Council of IFSB a senior executive and policy making body comprising heads of the regulatory and supervisory authorities on Islamic finance.

On the appointment as Chairman for the 20th General Assembly Governor SBP expressed his gratitude to IFSB Council and General Assembly members for their expression of confidence on him to steer this august forum and resolved that IFSB would continue to serve as one of the leading standard setting bodies in Islamic finance at global level.

Adding further he said that standards developed by IFSB would help to augment the regulatory and prudential frameworks for Islamic finance globally.

The IFSB established in 2003 at Kuala Lumpur Malaysia is an international standard-setting organization that promotes and enhances the soundness and stability of the global Islamic financial services industry by issuing prudential standards and guiding principles for the industry.

To strengthen the regulatory and supervisory infrastructure for the Islamic banking industry the State Bank of Pakistan has over the years adopted various IFSB prudential standards and guidelines after necessary customization in light of the prevailing local legal and regulatory environment.

There are currently 5 full-fledged Islamic banks in Pakistan and 17 conventional banks operating with standalone Islamic banking branches offering a wide array of Shariah compliant financial solutions.

As of March 31 2020 the market share of the Islamic banking industry assets and deposits in the overall banking sector stood at 17% and 18.7% respectively and the branch network of Islamic banking institutions comprises over 3456 branches and 1638 windows.

The SBP in its 3rd five years strategic plan 2020-25 has set a target of 30% market share of Islamic banking in the overall banking industry with special emphasis on increasing financing to agriculture and SME sectors.

SBP has also received several global accolades in promoting Islamic banking in the country."

The company recently won the Israeli government's ""Nimbus"" computing tender along with Google Cloud. The two companies were selected by the Ministry of Finance and the Government Computer Authority as providers of cloud services to the government of Israel and the IDF for the next seven years in a tender estimated to be worth some NIS 4 billion.

After losing in the tender software giant Microsoft with its Azure cloud computing service and computer technology company Oracle filed administrative petitions with the aim of leaving an opening for a future legal appeal against the results of the tender but no direct legal proceedings are taking place to annual the outcome. Microsoft and Oracle stress the fact that they are continuing their efforts to set up datacenters in Israel.

Oracle announced that it would open its cloud center located in the Jerusalem area this summer. Microsoft which announced in early 2020 that it would open its datacenter in 2021 later announced that it would open only in the first half of 2022. Google which has also officially announced that it will set up a regional cloud datacenter has not stated when it will start to operate.

Amazon's regional cloud like the others is not intended for government use only but for the entire Israeli economy. In its announcement on Friday the company stated: ""The AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region will enable even more developers startups and enterprises as well as government education and non-profits to run their applications and serve end-users from data centers located in Israel. Additionally the government of Israel announced that it has selected AWS as its primary cloud provider as part of the ""Nimbus"" contract for government ministries and subsidiaries. The Nimbus framework will provide cloud services to Israeli government ministries including local municipalities government-owned companies and public sector organizations with the aim of helping to accelerate digital transformation. It will be instrumental in driving innovation and enabling new digital services for the citizens of Israel.""

In August 2020 it was announced that AWS was working on setting up datacenters at three sites in Israel each with an output of 16 megawatts. AWS began to advance the project together with Azrieli Group Ltd. (TASE: AZRG) and US company Compass. The sites according to the report are at Bet Shemesh Shoham and in Hefer Valley. The real estate deals involved were estimated at NIS 300-400m and the project as a whole at about NIS 1 billion.

Accountant General Yali Rothenberg said """"We congratulate AWS on their winning bid in the first tender of Project Nimbus a multi-year flagship project led by the Israeli Government Procurement Administration to provide a comprehensive framework for the provision of cloud services to the Government of Israel""

""The new AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region will empower more public and private institutions innovative startups and global companies to deliver built-for-the-cloud applications that help fuel economic development across the country.

""It is the latest in our list of AWS Regions across Europe and the Middle East which includes existing regions in Bahrain Ireland Italy France Germany Sweden and the UK as well as regions under development in Spain Switzerland and United Arab Emirates"" said Peter DeSantis Senior Vice President of Global Infrastructure AWS.

""The new region is a continuation of our investment to support enterprises of all kinds help startups scale and grow enable technical skills development and create cloud literacy"" DeSantis continued. ""Cloud technology is at the heart of the Israeli government’s digital transformation program and their approach highlights the importance of setting a strong course for cloud adoption and leading by example to re-invent citizen services.""

AWS considered the world's leading cloud services provider set out in its announcement how its global datacenter network is structured and its advantages for users. ""AWS Regions are comprised of Availability Zones which place infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations with enough distance to significantly reduce the risk of a single event impacting customers’ business continuity yet near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that leverage multiple Availability Zones. Globally AWS has 81 Availability Zones across 25 geographic regions with plans to launch an additional 21 Availability Zones and seven AWS Regions in Australia India Indonesia Israel Spain Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.

""Each Availability Zone has independent power cooling and physical security and is connected through redundant ultra-low-latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones and across multiple regions to achieve even greater fault tolerance.

""The addition of the AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region will enable local customers with data residency requirements to store their data in Israel with the assurance that they retain control over the location of their data. Organizations using this region will also be able to access advanced technologies from the world’s leading cloud with the broadest and deepest suite of cloud services to drive innovation including analytics compute database Internet of Things (IoT) machine learning mobile services storage and more.""

Like other cloud companies AWS provided a list of some of its most prominent customers among the Bank Leumi Migdal CyberArk Fiverr monday.com Hashavshevet (Wizsoft) the Rami Levy group and the Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv (Ichilov Hospital).

AWS has a Partner Network (APN) Partners consisting of tens of thousands of Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and Systems Integrators (SIs) around the world. AWS Partners build innovative solutions and services on AWS and the APN helps by providing business technical marketing and go-to-market support. APN SIs consulting partners and ISVs working in Israel help enterprise and public sector customers migrate to AWS deploy mission-critical applications and provide a full range of monitoring automation and management services for customers' environments on AWS.

According to the company's announcement among AWS Israel Partners are Alcide AllCloud AppsFlyer Automat-IT BigPanda Bringg Checkmarx CloudBuzz Matrix CloudZone Comm-IT Continuity Software CloudRide DoIT International Guardicore Kaltura MidLink Namogoo Nice Orca Security Perimeter81 Quali Radware Sapiens TeraSky and Trax Retail.

The collaboration with AllCloud for example was reported in December 2020 and includes investment of some $30 million in transferring Israeli companies to AWS cloud services.

The regional cloud represents a continuation of AWS’s activity in Israel which includes Amazon CloudFront edge locations. Amazon CloudFront is described as ""a highly secure and programmable Content Delivery Network (CDN) that accelerates the delivery of data videos applications and APIs to users worldwide with low latency and high transfer speeds.""

In 2020 AWS also launched AWS Outposts and AWS Direct Connect in Israel. AWS Outposts is a fully managed service that offers the same AWS infrastructure AWS services APIs and tools to virtually any data center co-location space or on-premises facility for a truly consistent hybrid experience. AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from customers’ on-premises infrastructure to AWS infrastructure. Using AWS Direct Connect customers can establish private connectivity between AWS and their data center office or colocation environment which can reduce their network costs increase bandwidth throughput and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.""

The company also mentioned its AWS Activate program for cooperation with startups in Israel which has been in operation since 2013. ""This program gives startups access to guidance and one-on-one time with AWS experts as well as web-based training self-paced labs customer support third-party offers and up to $100000 in AWS service credits - all at no charge. This is in addition to the work that AWS already does with the venture capital community startup accelerators and incubators to help startups grow in the cloud. In Israel AWS works with accelerator organizations such as 8200 EISP F2 Venture Capital - thejunction and TechStars as well as venture capital firms like Aleph Pitango TLV Partners and Viola Ventures to support the rapid growth of their portfolio companies"" the AWS announcement said.

The majority of the articles were from Asia and Africa three from Europe and one from South America. The pooled prevalence rates obtained from the included studies was 77% (95% CI; 67–88) for medicine storage and 15% (95% CI: 0.08–0.21) for real wastage suggesting most of the urban households worldwide have unnecessary home medicine storage.

In our systematic review the paucity of studies from Western Europe and American countries should not lead to underestimate the problem in that region or it means that medicine storage and wastage are not relevant to them. Moreover many studies have recently been published indicating that a significant amount of medicines remained unused in European and American communities where some parts of them were returned to pharmacies or health facilities and the rest of them were inappropriately disposed [77787980]. We have not included these studies because of differences in their data collection method while we believe that investigating their results would clarify many challenges in their societies.

Notably 77% of households worldwide had storage which was the highest rate among Southwest Asia (95%) and the lowest one in Sub-Saharan Africa (67%). Despite that the high prevalence among countries were explained by disease pattern and the associated health problems such as a high proportion Gastrointestinal tract medicines in Jordan [62]; malaria and anti-infective medicines in Tanzania [67] Iran [75] Ethiopia [73] Uganda [23] and Nigeria [25]; and cardiovascular and diabetes medicines in Palestine [24] India [68] and Mexico [81]. However in most of the countries the medicine storage and wastage were due to inappropriate prescription practice and inadequate patient adherence to treatment [3 16 23 24 27 69 73 82]. Patient attitudes and social values were mentioned as underlying factors stimulating medicine storage and wastage in different settings. According to the studies performed in Saudi Arabia Kuwait UAE Qatar Oman and India patients gratify drug prescription as the outcome of their visit to public health facilities [16 68]. The role of patient’s attitudes has been confirmed in studies by Hu et al. and Norris et al. where immigrants from developing countries such as China India Korea and Egypt had different perceptions towards accessing and use of medicines compared to European and American counterparts [83 84]. Gedif et al. in their study attributed the lower prevalence rate of medicine storage among Ethiopian households to the community’s confidence on traditional medicine relative to pharmaceutical products [45].

This review also found some evidences confirming that expired medicines are being used by households in low- and middle-income countries [25 69]. Dayom et al. reported that more than 97% of expired medicine items found in households are either being used or are kept for future use [25]. As well the same evidence has been reported from high-income countries [30 85]; confirming that Australian households believe that the medicines could be used for either 1 year or longer after their expiration [85]. These findings highlighted the need for efforts on public education regarding the rational use of medicines particularly with respect to medicine expiry date in order to prevent the problems linked to public health [86].

Based on the literature to some extent medicine wastage is inevitable because of several reasons such as patient death treatment failure medicine change and side effects [7]. Then in different studies solutions such as producing medicines in smaller packages as well as prescription of medicines for shorter time lags were endorsed as effective approaches [3 67 73 75 80 87 88]. Ekedahl et al. in their study proposed a feasible way to decrease the volume of unused medicines in which a small “starter pack” is prescribed whenever a new treatment is initiated. Of note if the consumption stopped only small volumes would be stocked or discarded [26]. Additionally a recent study by Bach et al. reported 27 to 30% wastage in 3.5 mg vials of bortezomib compared to 1.5 mg vials [88].

The first and most stored medicines were group J (17.4%) among which Antibiotics are the most known medicines. Despite the fact that in many health systems antibiotics were authorized as prescription-only drugs they are easily purchased with no prescription [3 16 23 28 65 75]. The gap between the legislation and daily practice over expectation about antibiotics effectiveness low awareness regard to antibiotic resistance adverse event and high cost of physician consultation have been cited as reasons for antibiotics storage [8990919293]. The same evidence has been reported by Sawair et al. indicating that patients visited the second physician because they did not receive any antibiotic from the first physician [94]. Kelly et al. in their study have cited microbial resistance as a significant public health concern and highlighted that one way of tackling microbial resistance is to limit both the prescription and use of anti-infective medicine for non-bacterial infections especially in societies with lower health literacy level [85].

Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) belonging to group N was the most stored medicine by households. This finding is unsurprising because the paracetamol is the first-line treatment for pain and fever management [1 24 62 63]. However the availability affordability convenience marketing and misconception about its safety compared to NSAIDs (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) has made the paracetamol family the first choice of self-medication among people [1 24 62 63 65]. Although a few studies reported that keeping a limited stock of these medicines might be cost-saving due to lower physician visit [3 28 65 66] more studies warned about the rising rate of self-medication as well as medicine wastage and its undesirable consequences [28 959697].

According to the results of analysis reported by 6 studies covering 4580 households medicine storage and wastage were found to be positively associated with households purchasing power; indicating that in households with higher income or in countries whose medicine price is lower both storage and wastage are more prevalent. This finding has also been confirmed by studies from high-income countries reporting that this problem exists in all over the world and there are factors beyond real health needs that are associated with demand and utilization medicines [30 79 98 99].

Insurance coverage was recognized as a positive motive for more storage and wastage of medicines among households [75]. This finding suggested that although having medical insurance could financially protect household members against catastrophic health expenditures the lack of strict control on prescription selling and demand of medicine could encounter health systems to the increased cost of unnecessary storage and wastage of medicines. Moreover Sweileh and Zargarzadeh in their study reported a stronger correlation between having medical insurance and medicine storage [24 75].

The impact of education on drug storage is interestingly different from that on wastage. Most of the literature reported a positive association between the level of education of the household’s head and the amount of medicine storage [3 24 62 74 75]. However the number of medicine wastage was reported as higher for illiterate or less educated counterparts [3 25 74]. Accordingly it is obvious that education level could prevent drug wastage through better compliance with the treatment or better storage practice [3 23 28 62 74]. Nevertheless according to the previous studies educated people more tend to purchase more medicines from retail pharmacies and store medicines for future use so they are more prone to self-medication [23 28 62 74].

Some significant differences were found between men and women in terms of medicine storage modality amount and wastage. Notably the higher the rate of in-home storage among women [23 64] the lower the wastage rate linked to households who stored medicines and were organized by female subjects [70]. Other studies have confirmed high storage rates among women [70 99 100] by stating some reasons such as gender-related physiopathology lifestyle contact to the health system and other biological differences like pregnancy [100 101]. However other variations such as women’s tendency to excessive purchase and self-medication lacks medical reasoning so they can potentially be considered as the focal point for improvement [102]. A study by Becker showed that wasted medicine was more frequently used by men compared to women [87].

Considering our findings there was a considerable variation in medicine storage place among households in all geographic regions. Since the storage location was reported to be associated with the decreased adherence to treatment unfavorable clinical outcomes and potentially hazardous consequences [103104105] WHO guideline [76] seems to be a good solution to solve this problem in which the appropriate place is keeping medicine in an enclosed and cool or dry place which is inaccessible for children.

The majority of the studies (75%) highlighted that most countries have no guidelines for disposal of medicines which not only imposes a financial burden on society but also creates environmental hazards through the accumulation of chemical ingredients in landfills and freshwater resources. In most developed health systems several schemes have been developed for the disposal of unused medicines that could be adopted as a practical solution by low and middle-income countries. For example the National Return and Disposal of Unwanted Medicines (Nat RUM) scheme in Australia can be named that provides a route to return leftover medicines to community pharmacies [77]. Studies conducted in Sweden and Australia suggested a unitary medicine take-over system or educational campaigns at the national level instead of state-run programs [77 106]. In Nebraska especial boxes are placed in pharmacies that allow consumers to return their excessive medicines to the pharmacy [107]. Arkaravichien et al. [108] and Yang et al. [109] in their studies proposed that the national health system can provide financial incentives for pharmacies and households participating in take-back schemes.

Strengths and limitation of the study

This systematic review focused on the most important part of the consumption chain which is before medicine wastage as well as its related harms to the environment. Furthermore most of the home storages were reviewed and then reported so we believe that our study’s results can provide evidence for decision-making at both individual and community levels. Since all the included studies have focused on quantitative analysis of medicine storage so the household’s preferences or their experiences as one of the key influential factors on establishing inappropriate storage and wastage has not been addressed decently. Therefore future research investigating this gap seems to be beneficial.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRheS5jb20vbXVzaWMvMjAyMTA2MTMvYS1tYWQtc2NpZW50aXN0LWluLXRoZS1tdXNpYy1zdHVkaW8tdGhpcy1zdGFycmFoLWlzLXJpc2luZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A mad scientist in the music studio this Starrah is rising,"Grammy-winning songwriter Starrah poses for a portrait in Beverly Hills Calif. on Sept. 16 2020.

Freshly minted Grammy-winning songwriter Starrah has long helped others be stars. Now it's her turn to shine.

The hitmaker for the likes of Drake Rihanna Maroon 5 Camila Cabello Nicki Minaj Halsey and Katy Perry recently released her debut full-length album a natural extension for the self-taught studio prodigy.

“I just really love hearing new sounds and experimenting with music” she says. ""I just feel like a little mad scientist in the lab when I put stuff together and just see what it does.”

The 13-track “Longest Interlude” showcases her command of R&B hip-hop and pop skills all delivered in an achingly personal collection she likens to opening her diary.

“I personally feel like the only thing that’s missing from a lot of music right now is just the raw emotion and honesty like vulnerability” she says. “Everybody wants to be cool. Nobody wants to be vulnerable.”

Starrah has tapped some musical royalty for producing help including James Blake Skrillex Boi1da and Nile Rodgers. She recorded some of the songs at Abbey Road Studios where the Beatles recorded. She says it's all a bit surreal.

“The only time I heard about the Beatles was a music class so it’s crazy to think that I recorded my music in the studio that they worked with Rodgers — a legend” she says. “It’s hard to wrap my mind around it sometimes but it’s really cool. It’s like a dream.”

She's co-written songs that have over 14 billions streams among them Cabello’s “Havana” Maroon 5’s “Girls Like You” Drake’s “Fake Love” Halsey’s “Now or Never” Maroon 5 and SZA’s “What Lovers Do” and Perry’s “Swish Swish” featuring Nicki Minaj.

More of her songs include The Weeknd’s ""Starboy"" album cut “True Colors” Rihanna’s “Needed Me” and Beyoncé’s “Already” from “Black Is King.” She also worked on multiple tracks for Madonna’s latest album “Madame X.”

Starrah won a Grammy this year for working on Megan Thee Stallion’s “Savage Remix” featuring Beyoncé. She previously scored a 2018 ASCAP Pop Music Songwriter of the Year award — becoming the first woman in nearly two decades. She also landed a spot in Forbes' 30 Under 30 in 2019.

Not bad for a Black and LGBTQ woman in a male-dominated field who was working in public storage when she first got noticed. “To see her go from public storage to the Forbes list is something nobody can take away” says her manager Nick Jarjour.

She grew up as Brittany Hazzard in a small town in Delaware the youngest of eight brothers and sisters. Music was always a big part of her life. She used to fall asleep to music and wake up to it the next morning. “When I was a kid I just used to just play around with music all day” she says.

Starrah experimented with online music programs like FruityLoops and Audacity watching YouTube tutorials and learning how to loop instrumentals. “Anything I could do to try to learn how to make beats or learn how to make music” she recalls.

Jarjour remembers first hearing Starrah while listening to a college radio R&B show. Her song “Drank Up” came on and he immediately spent hours searching her SoundCloud profile.

“From the first second I heard her chills went through my whole body and I couldn’t believe what I was hearing” he says. “It is really astonishing to see how far she’s come but it’s no surprise because she had that drive inside her from the beginning.”

Her appetite for music is broad. As a kid she was raised on a sonic diet of Britney Spears Eve Ruff Ryders and Lil’ Bow Wow. These days she feeds her “eclectic palate” everything.

“I don’t limit myself to what I listen to honestly"" she says. ""One day I could be listening to NBA YoungBoy or Kodak Black. And the next day I’m listening to Marvin Gaye and Sam Cooke or Coltrane or Skrillex.”

Trust and mutual respect are key whenever Starrah decides to help someone on their song not the popularity of the artist and she hopes for just “good vibes.” She’s currently working on Normani’s next album and the upcoming animated musical “Century Goddess.”

“When I’m writing for an artist I feel like it’s important for me to sit down and have a conversation with them and see where they’re at in life and just what kind of music do they want to make” she says. “I’m highly empathetic so I can pretty much put myself in that person’s shoes and write if necessary for them from their perspective.”

Despite her impact she usually shuns the limelight even preferring to distort photo portraits or partially cover her face. She says she values her privacy and didn't get into the music business for fame.

“If you think of anything other than the music it’s a distraction to me. If you’re focused on a personality attached to the music it just takes away from the music” she says. “I just feel like that should be the focal point.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9yb3RvcnVhLWRhaWx5LXBvc3QvbmV3cy9idWlsZGluZy1jb25zZW50cy1yb3RvcnVhcy1tY2RvbmFsZHMtZmVudG9uLXN0LXRvLWdldC0yNm0tbWFrZW92ZXIvM0dZNUs0M0lVSVlJN0paMllNUFAyUUFTUEUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Building consents: Rotorua's McDonald's Fenton St to get $2.6m makeover,"An artist's impression of what the new McDonald's on Fenton St could look like.

Rotorua's Fenton St McDonald's restaurant is getting a $2.6 million makeover.

The Rotorua Lakes Council issued a building consent valued at $800000 for alterations to the Fenton St fast food restaurant.

But McDonald's Rotorua franchisee Rob Parry said the project would cost about $2.6m all up once complete.

""It's pretty exciting news for us. It's going to be a fairly big transformation for our restaurant.""

The McDonald's do-over is among commercial and residential building consents valued at $14862672 issued in May.

Parry said the makeover would include a lot of new equipment and a brand new playground.

""We're giving the entire restaurant a complete spruce up with new decor etc.""

It would be the Fenton St restaurant's second spruce up in about 17 years.

""Design trends have changed. We need to stay with the times.""

He said the restaurant planned to keep all of its original Māori carvings.

""We are working with Te Puia getting QR codes made which will tell customers what each carving means. It will take them on a bit of a journey.""

As part of the refurbishment Parry said the restaurant was also looking to hire more staff.

He said the makeover will start on Monday and was going to take the best part of about 23 weeks. The restaurant will stay open throughout the renovations.

""We should be completed by mid-November.""

Te Ngae Shopping Centre's newest tenant expanding

Meanwhile Rotorua's newly-spruced up Te Ngae Shopping Centre is now expanding.

The Rotorua Lakes Council has issued a building consent valued at $400000 for a new building at the shopping centre on Owhata Rd.

Local developer Tony Bradley from TPB Properties said the new building was an expansion for the centre's newest tenant Safeguard Self Storage and will include 100 new outside units.

""Stage 1 was tidying up the other shops and stage 2 is the new attached building.""

Bradley bought a chunk of the buildings last year and had since given the shopping centre a ""facelift"".

""It has come up quite well.""

The building housed the former Smiths City and the current Coin Save business a hairdresser a bakery and St Vincent de Paul.

""It has been derelict for five years. The building had good bones but it just looked a bit tired.

""I have re-roofed it and repainted and given it a bit of a face-lift. It looks like a new building.""

Bradley said the new building planned to be completed at the end of July.

Safeguard Self Storage operations manager Michelle Hope said the business opened their 180 inside storage units inside the former Smiths City building last August.

The extension would include outside units which Hope said were desperately needed as demand for storage grew.

""It's been very busy here. We're almost at capacity. We can't wait for our outside units.""

Hope said when the business opened last year there were already people on the waiting list for the soon-to-be-built outside units.

Cutz4u owner Cynthia Walker said the spruce up and the newly-tenanted building had made a ""huge difference"" to the centre.

""It has been sitting empty for quite some time. We've been waiting for someone to take it over. I'm glad someone has.

""It's always better to have a filled building than an empty one.""

Walker said the hair cutting bar which has been in the centre for 10 years has had its shop outside painted.

""It makes it look more loved. We badly needed it.""

Ann Blakeloc from St Vincent de Paul said their building had received a fresh coat of paint and a new roof.

""The spruce up has done wonders for the building. It's tidied it up.""

Blakeloc said the ""busy little shopping centre"" needed a spruce up.

""It's just brightened everything up.""

She said it was also great to see Safeguard Storage occupy the empty building.

""We use the storage shed to store all our clothing too.""

This chip has gone on to become the most sort after flagship processor. However an upgrade of this processor is already in the works. Not long ago a new Qualcomm U code-named SM8450 “Waipio” appeared online. This chip attracted the continuous attention of many industry insiders and netizens. According to reports this chip will be the successor of the Snapdragon 888. Furthermore there are reports that this chip will arrive in the second half of this year.

A few days ago popular Weibo leakster @DCS claims that several Chinese manufacturers already have samples of the SM8450 chip. Furthermore he claims that the progress with this chip may be a little bit faster than last year.

According to previous reports SM8450 will be built with a 4nm process. This chip will integrate Kryo 780 CPU core based on ARM Cortex v9 technology Adreno 730 GPU and Spectra 680 ISP. It will also support a four-channel package LPDDR5 RAM and also integrates Snapdragon X65 5G baseband.

Snapdragon 888 Pro is coming

In addition not long ago a device called “Qualcomm Lahaina” appeared on the GeekBench running sub-platform. Judging from the running score data its single-core running points hit 1171 while the multi-core running points hit 3704. This is not much different from the Snapdragon 888 model but the CPU frequency has been increased to 3.0GHz. The X1 super-large core has been increased from 2.84GHz to 3.0GHz the other core frequencies remain unchanged. The Prime CPU core (Cortex-X1) will be the one with 3GHz the 3x Performance Cores (Cortex-A78) will have 2.42 clock speeds and the 4x Efficiency CPUs (Cortex-A55) will go up to 1.8GHz. However there is no information on the GPU frequency. At present the score is not much different from the normal version.

Recently Honor CEO Zhao Ming attended the Qualcomm Technology and Cooperation Summit 2021. At the meeting he announced that Honor 50 will launch the Snapdragon 778G chip. At the same time he also revealed during the interview that Honor Magic 3 will use the industry’s most advanced flagship chip. Initial reports claim that Chinese manufacturers are already testing the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 Pro chip. The expectations are that smartphones with this chip will be available in the third quarter of this year.

The reports so far are that Honor will be one of the manufacturers to launch a new smartphone with the Snapdragon 888 Pro. Just like Xiaomi Honor likes to debut processors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbmNlcHQtcGhvbmVzLmNvbS9odWF3ZWkvaG9ub3ItNTAtbGVha2VkLWluLW11bHRpcGxlLXJlbmRlcnMtc3BlY3Mv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29uY2VwdC1waG9uZXMuY29tL2h1YXdlaS9ob25vci01MC1sZWFrZWQtaW4tbXVsdGlwbGUtcmVuZGVycy1zcGVjcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Honor 50 Leaked in Multiple Renders Specs,"Honor was sold by Huawei in December 2020 and it’s now operating as a separate company. Their biggest launch since the separation is the one that’s about to happen on June 16th. That’s when the Honor 50 series becomes available. It’s going to include the Honor 50 Honor 50 SE and Honor 50 Pro models which have just leaked in full.

The Honor 50 SE is going to use a MediaTek CPU while the Honor 50 and Honor 50 Pro opt for Qualcomm chipsets. A Pro+ version may also be in the cards according to some rumors. Honor 50 Pro stands out through the fact that it’s going to offer 100W charging. Keep in mind that these phones get Google services after the separation of Honor from Huawei. The designs are sort of pre-emptive for the future Huawei P50 Series with a figure 8 shaped back camera that includes a bunch of sensors in each ring.

There’s also a dual selfie cutout for the front camera. Let’s see the specs now:

According to a Bloomberg report citing South Korea’s Electronic Times the suspension of the smartphone was due to a shortage of Qualcomm’s application processors worldwide. Old reports state that the South Korean tech giant aimed to launch the smartphone in August alongside Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 – its other two unannounced yet much-anticipated devices. Back in March 2021 Samsung was among the largest tech giant to voice concerns over “serious imbalance” in the semiconductors industry. Samsung co-CEO Koh Dong-Jin even said that the company might skip a Galaxy Note refresh for this year as a result of its semiconductor supply globally.

The latest development comes just weeks after the smartphone purportedly appeared on the Geekbench website with the processor “Lahaina” which is the codename for Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 6GB of RAM and Android 11. Before that the moniker of the smartphone also reportedly appeared on Samsung Mexico’s official website. Notable tipster OnLeaks had also shared alleged high-res renders of the Galaxy S21 FE where the smartphone borrowed the same design from the vanilla Galaxy S21. The renders show a triple-rear camera and an Infinity-O hole-punch display. However the tipster hinted that the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE would come with a 6.4-inch flat display larger than the Samsung Galaxy S21’s 6.2-inch panel. Most recently another South Korean publication named Herald claimed that the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE would carry a price tag between KRW 700000 (roughly Rs 46000) and KRW 800000 (roughly Rs 52500). In comparison the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE was launched in South Korea for KRW 899900 (roughly Rs 59000). In India the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE debuted at Rs 49999 for the sole 8GB RAM + 128GB storage variant. The India variant carries the Exynos 990 SoC. Samsung is yet to officially confirm these developments.

Dave Meltzer spoke on The Rock potentially appearing at Survivor Series and beyond on today’s Wrestling Observer Radio.

According to Meltzer WWE officials wants The Rock at Survivor Series but WWE will never be The Rock’s “top priority” due to his film and TV commitments. However The Rock vs. Roman Reigns is still a match WWE wants to build towards. Both The Rock and Roman Reigns have publicly spoken on the potential matchup and sounded open to making it happen.

Additionally Meltzer stated that WWE abandoned the idea of making the match happen at the last two WrestleMania events due to the pandemic. WrestleMania 36 was held at the WWE Performance Center and was closed to the general public and Reigns withdrew from the show due to the ongoing pandemic. This year’s WrestleMania 37 was held at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Florida with live fans in attendance but capacity was limited due to pandemic and social distancing restrictions.

Also Meltzer stated when he spoke to WWE sources about The Rock vs. Reigns at WrestleMania they said 2021 “was not the year” with WrestleMania 37 only being able to hold 20000 people because of capacity restrictions. However with WrestleMania 38 scheduled for April 2022 at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington Texas WWE would want The Rock to come back to face Reigns for that event with a potential attendance of up to 80000 people. That said it will also depend on The Rock’s entertainment schedule.

The Kepler lineup has been supported since 2012 but the support is now coming to an end along with support for older Windows operating systems.

NVIDIA Kepler GPU Architecture (GeForce 600 / 700) Series Driver Support Officially Ends on 31st of August Windows 7/8/8.1 Drivers Also To Be Discontinued

The NVIDIA Kepler GPU architecture has been supported for generations but as time goes by older GPU architectures are removed from official support lists. This was reported in our previous article which confirmed that NVIDIA's LTSB (Long-Term Support) drivers for the Kepler GPUs will maintain support for the said architecture for 3 years after which it would be retired along with the GPUs.

NVIDIA ended driver support for its Fermi (GeForce 400 / 500 Series) back in 2018 moving it to legacy status. The same is expected to happen with the Kepler-based GeForce 600 / 700 series when NVIDIA moves beyond R470 drivers. NVIDIA has officially confirmed that the driver support will end on the 31st of August 2021.

Looking back at Kepler the GPU architecture brought NVIDIA back in the fight with mainstream chips competing against flagship parts from AMD. NVIDIA also focused a lot on efficiency which made it win in latter generations such as Maxwell and Pascal. The Kepler series did take a huge blow when AMD fired back with its Hawaii GPUs in 2013 but lept back in the game with Maxwell a year later.

The Kepler GPU generation was also the first to introduce Titan class products which are still running to this day and the most latest iteration being the Titan RTX which was introduced in Turing GPU generation. The RTX 3090 serves as this generation's Titan-class product though its labeled as a GeForce variant.

The following chart from NVIDIA shows the CUDA and driver support plan for current GPU architectures:

Note: The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 Ti and GeForce GTX 750 aren't based on the Kepler architecture but in fact based on the Maxwell architecture and hence won't be retired with the upcoming driver update.

It is not just the Kepler GPUs that are being retired. NVIDIA has also confirmed that it would no longer support older Windows operating systems such as Windows 7 Windows 8 & Windows 8.1.

Effective October 2021 Game Ready Driver upgrades including performance enhancements new features and bug fixes will be available for systems utilizing Maxwell Pascal Turing and Ampere-series GPUs. Critical security updates will be available on systems utilizing desktop Kepler-series GPUs through September 2024. A complete list of desktop Kepler-series GeForce GPUs can be found here. Effective October 2021 Game Ready Driver upgrades including performance enhancements new features and bug fixes will be exclusively available for systems utilizing Windows 10 as their operating system. Critical security updates will be available on systems utilizing Windows 7 Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 through September 2024.

Q: Why is NVIDIA dropping support for Kepler desktop GPUs?

A: Kepler-based desktop GPUs initially launched in March of 2012. Since then gaming technology has evolved dramatically with technologies like DirectX 12 Ultimate and NVIDIA DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling). Moving forward NVIDIA’s software QA team will be focusing on hardware that supports newer technologies. Q: Why is NVIDIA dropping support for Windows 7 Windows 8 and Windows 8.1?

A: Microsoft has officially ended support for Windows 7 and Windows 8 with Windows 8.1 nearing the end of its lifecycle as well. The vast majority of our GeForce customers have migrated to Windows 10 OS. In order to ensure GeForce owners experience the best possible security support and functionality NVIDIA will now focus on Windows 10 operating system.

It appears as though Intel's upcoming NUC 11 Extreme ""Beast Canyon"" kit is now in the wild as it has made an apparent 3DMark benchmark cameo with a newfangled Tiger Lake-B series processor in tow. According to two separate listings the Beast Canyon system is also wielding a full-size NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card 16MB of DDR4 memory and a 1TB WN Black SN750 NVMe SSD.





You may recall that Intel teased its Beast Canyon NUC during this year's virtual Computex event. At the time Intel was short on details saying only that it will be available with 11th Generation Core i9 i7 and i5 processors and will support full-length graphics cards including NVIDIA's latest generation GeForce RTX 30-series and AMD's Radeon RX 6000 series.









Then more recently a photo and details of Intel's upcoming NUC were posted to Twitter. It was said to feature a Core i9-11900KB processor which is one of a handful of Tiger Lake-B CPUs that Intel quietly added to its portfolio a couple of weeks ago.





As things stand the newly minted Tiger Lake-B series consists of four models including the Core i9-11900KB Core i7-11700KB Core i5-11500B and Core i3-11100B. These are essentially desktop models in ball grid array (BGA) form that are soldered directly to the motherboard. They also features some decently fast clocks.





Regarding the Core i9-11900KB specifically the top-end model is an 8-core/16-thread CPU with a 3.3GHz base clock 4.9GHz max turbo frequency and a 5.3GHz Thermal Velocity Boost clock. It also sports 24MB of L3 cache Intel Xe graphics with 32 execution units clocked at 350MHz to 1.45GHz and a configurable 55-65W TDP.

Leaked Intel Beast Canyon NUC Benchmarks With a Core i9-11900KB CPU

What about the 3DMark leak? Let's have a look...













Both listings identify the motherboard as an ""Intel Corporation NUC11DBBi9"" leaving little doubt that someone benchmarked a Beast Canyon NUC. This suggests a launch is likely right around the corner at this point especially with the aforementioned leaked photograph of the actual system making the rounds on Twitter.





Looking at the performance numbers it gets tricky to compare because (A) we did not benchmark this system so we are relying on someone else's effort and can't be 100 percent sure of the settings and (B) 3DMark's database is a little unwieldy to navigate. That said we found an entry for a desktop PC with a Core i9-11900 and GeForce RTX 3060 that appears to be running at stock clocks. Here's how the Time Spy scores break down...

O,Realty Income,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzEyLzMtZGl2aWRlbmQtc3RvY2tzLXlvdS1jYW4tdHJ1c3QtdG8tcGF5LXlvdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Dividend Stocks You Can Trust to Pay You,"These three dividend stocks have shown consistent earnings growth while increasing their payouts annually.

When searching for dividend stocks there are a few things you want to consider. Of course you want a company that has an attractive dividend yield and anything above 2% to 3% is generally considered to be pretty good. High yield isn't everything though -- you also want to make sure the company has a history of steady earnings growth. Increasing profits provide a company with stability which allows it to not only make consistent dividend payments but also to raise those payments on a consistent basis.

These traits are ideal in dividend stocks and they're why Arbor Realty Trust (ABR 0.30%) Cincinnati Financial (CINF 0.20%) and United Bankshares (UBSI -0.06%) are all great dividend stocks you can trust to pay you year after year.

Arbor Realty: A REIT with a high yield

Arbor Realty is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on the multifamily housing sector with 81% of its total loan portfolio made up of these loans. The multifamily housing space has high barriers to entry which gives Arbor Realty a competitive advantage and provides stability to its earnings.

Multifamily loans tend to be less cyclical than single-family housing which can fluctuate depending on market conditions. In times of recession individuals are less likely to take out mortgages for single-family units. However housing is always in need and those individuals would be more likely to look toward multifamily units to rent. That's why multifamily housing tends to weather recessionary conditions better than single-family housing.

Not only that but multifamily loans are protected against prepayment. This means you don't see a big rush of refinancing in the space when rates are lowered. As a result earnings don't see such large fluctuations as single-family real estate companies.

Arbor Realty has done a good job of growing its loan portfolio which is up 29% on a compounded annual basis since 2015. This strong portfolio growth has resulted in net interest income growth of 15% compounded annually and 29% compounded gains in net income since 2015. Thanks to its stellar growth rate Arbor Realty has increased its dividend payout for nearly a decade straight and pays investors a 7.1% yield to boot -- making it a high-yield dividend stock you can trust.

Cincinnati Financial: A Dividend King

Insurance companies are another good source of income stocks. That's because insurance is a relatively straightforward business -- companies underwrite policies and if they manage risk properly they make an underwriting profit. With these excess profits companies put the money to work in the financial market to generate some form of investment income. Insurance companies can be a cash cow and a great source of yield in your portfolio as well which is why Warren Buffett has often called the insurance industry Berkshire Hathaway's ""most important sector.""

Cincinnati Financial is a property and casualty insurer that has increased its dividend payout for 61 years straight. This makes it a member of the exclusive Dividend Kings group of stocks. A Dividend King is a company that has increased its dividend payout for at least 50 years straight and only 27 companies currently hold the title.

The insurer has managed to increase dividends for so many years thanks to its capital management and underwriting profitable policies. Last year the company posted a combined ratio of 98.1%. Combined ratio is an important measure of profitability in the insurance industry; anything under 100% means you are earning an underwriting profit. In the past five years Cincinnati Financial has achieved an average combined ratio of 96.1%.

As a result it has seen its earned premiums grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6.2% -- above average for its industry. Continued growth in premiums coupled with underwriting profitable policies make Cincinnati Financial another trustworthy income stock that yields investors a solid 2.1%.

United Bankshares: The unheralded income stock

United Bankshares isn't a Dividend Aristocrat but it's not for a lack of increasing its dividends. The regional bank has raised its dividend payout for 47 years straight. The only reason it's not included with the Dividends Aristocrats is because it's not an S&P 500 company -- making this regional bank an under-the-radar dividend stalwart.

Last year it increased net income by 11.1% despite the pandemic. This was boosted by its mortgage banking activity as well as its expansion into the Carolinas with its purchase of Carolina Financial.

In the first quarter this year interest income was up 14% compared to last year to $206 million. The bank was boosted by a drastic reduction in provision for credit losses as well as income from mortgage banking activities. This helped net income increase 166% over last year to $107 million.

United Bankshares has done a stellar job of increasing net interest income and net income over the past decade as well achieving compound annual growth rates of 10% and 14% respectively. Not only that but it pays out a solid 3.7% dividend yield making it another solid dividend stock you can trust.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vdmlkZW8vbm8tcHJvYmxlbS1jb25ncmVzcy1nb3ZpbmQtc2luZ2gtMDY1NTA3NjYzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'No problem in Congress': Govind Singh on 'rumours' of infighting in Rajasthan,"If you're taking a required minimum distribution from an IRA 401(k) or other tax-deferred account and don't need the money to cover living expenses where should you stash that unneeded cash?

Rollins was trying to earn FBS scholarships at the time so the move from tackle to guard may have appeared on the surface to possibly negatively affect his recruiting outlook. But Rollins embraced the challenge dominated the position and his unselfishness led to unprecedented individual and team success.

His move helped make the Spartans a better team as they went on to win their first state title since 1972. Rollins meanwhile landed a full-ride scholarship to play at BYU making him the first FBS scholarship player from Montana since Bozeman’s Will Dissly in 2014.

“What I was most proud of was he realized the benefits of having a successful team and how much that benefits the individual” Sentinel coach Dane Oliver said.

“Not to say he was selfish as a young kid but he grew as a vocal leader and I realized he’s wise beyond his years. Anytime you have leadership from kids it’s special for the team. He’s a great person and when your best player is your best person and hardest worker you see the rewards we got and he got.”

Rollins soared high with the individual accolades while flying under the radar as an offensive lineman who did the dirty work in a non-glamour position. He was named the Montana Gatorade football player of the year a Sports Illustrated All-American finalist and collected 16 Division I football offers.

When Rollins moved to guard he found himself right alongside Montana Grizzlies signee Geno Leonard who became a first-team all-state selection at center. Leonard saw how hard Rollins worked on the line and even had to go up against him in practice because he was also a first-team all-state linebacker the position he’s projected to play at UM.

“Dylan is the type of guy who will make you better at practice and in the weight room constantly competing” Leonard said. “Dylan is a vocal leader who could get anyone ready to go to battle with him and he does things the right way.

“Me playing linebacker I’d have to try and get past Rollins all the time at practice and winning that battle was few and far between but I’ll always be grateful for that competition with Dylan because without it I wouldn’t have had as much success as I have had.”

Now heading to college Rollins appears to be moving back to tackle but might also see playing time at guard — another case of him filling whatever role the team needs. He even received high praise from BYU offensive line coach Eric Mateos.

“He’s versatile but we’re going to start him out playing tackle just because of his length” Mateos said when Rollins signed in December. “Again another guy who’s very tough a little mean-spirited. Looking for that edge that we want on the offensive line at BYU he fits that mold. We had to recruit him a long time but we sure are excited to have him.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9jZW50cmUtY29sbGVnZS1kZWRpY2F0ZXMtdGhlLXJvdXNoLWNhbXB1cy1jZW50ZXItaW4taG9ub3Itb2YtZm9ybWVyLWZpcnN0LWNvdXBsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Centre College dedicates the Roush Campus Center in honor of former first couple - The Advocate-Messenger,"Centre College dedicates the Roush Campus Center in honor of former first couple Published 7:55 am Saturday June 12 2021

Nunnelly also shared that the lawn between Old Centre and the Roush Campus Center will now be known as the Susie Miller Roush Lawn. A reception in celebration of their tenure at the College followed the Baccalaureate service.

Later that evening the Centre College Board of Trustees also thanked the former first couple at an outdoor dinner near Craik House the longtime home of Centre presidents. As part of the event a tribute video was shown celebrating their 22 years of dedicated service to the College.

John Roush gave the Commencement address the next day during Centre’s 197th Commencement ceremony as well as the Godspeed to the Class of 2020. During the ceremony both John and Susie were presented with honorary degrees from the College. Susie offered a heartfelt expression of gratitude in remarks appropriately titled “Grateful.”

The campus center was a favorite destination for the Roush’s who enjoyed sharing meals with students in the main dining hall. An official portrait of the former first couple in addition to a dedication plaque now grace the halls of the Roush Campus Center.

As first lady Susie was fully involved in caring for the campus and was honored in 2012 by David and Marlene Grissom with a $500000 gift to create and endow the Susie Roush Beautification Fund. After a devastating ice storm in 2009 she helped plant more than 100 new trees shrubs and plants.

The extended Roush family shared in the celebration over the weekend including six grandchildren and both sons and daughters-in-law.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy51bi5vcmcvZW4vc3RvcnkvMjAyMS8wNi8xMDkzNzky0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First Person: An on-air antidote to misinformation in the Central African Republic,"Fighting misinformation

“When people call in to the radio station they might be telling the truth but they could also be spreading hate speech and people often ask me to tell them if some piece of information they have heard is true or false.

This is why reporters need to travel throughout the country so that we can see with our own eyes what is really happening on the ground and how communities are struggling to survive on a daily basis.

Many people in the capital have no idea of what is going on in the interior of the country. They can eat and drink what they want and walk around in peace and security but when you travel inland you can see that there is a crisis. People are not free to express themselves or to go about their business freely.

I joined MINUSCA with the aim of doing my bit to bring peace to my country and I think that my work with Guira-FM is having a positive impact but sometimes it can be frustrating. People will come up to me and say ‘we need you to help us we need you to be able to support us but you can't solve our problems.’ All I can tell them is that help will come later and it breaks my heart that I can’t do more. So it’s important to share the stories of the people we have met and spoken to on Guira-FM.

Transforming women’s lives

When I was assigned to Kaga-Bandoro which is around 300km from Bangui I was the only woman from Guira-FM working in the field. Sometimes being young and female with a family far away in the capital can be an advantage. People want to help and because I’m young other young people find it easier to talk to me and tell me things that older people wouldn’t.

But women in places like Kaga-Bandoro face many challenges. Many of them want to learn professions but in some areas only boys are allowed to study and in others there are no schools.

So we started to use the local time slots made available by the national radio

station to make programmes that focus on women and we seem to have made an impact. If you go to Kaga-Bandoro today you will see that women are really starting to contribute a lot more. Not just in trades like sewing or hairdressing but even on construction sites you can see that women are working among men who no longer think the industry is only for them.

'One day peace must return’

Central Africans need to see that we are all from one nation and that we must work together to rebuild this country.

When I think of peace I think of what I saw at a camp for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Birao which is more than 1000 km from the capital near the border with Sudan.

I was trying to interview someone when an 18-month-old child came up to me completely naked. The child just wanted was to be with me so I took her into my arms and carried on with the interview.

I thought to myself if there was peace this child would not be at an IDP camp she would be with her family in their home living in peace maybe in Bangui. There are some many children like that in IDP sites who want to return home but can’t because of the lack of security. One day peace must return so that these children can find their place.”

“It was enough for me to come down and see what’s going on” Dixon said while reviewing his job offer Wednesday at Great Work! Employment Services on East Market Street in Akron.

The 33-year-old machinist said the regional staffing agency always finds him good-paying jobs. But he’s never earned $16 an hour in his life.

He made $12.50 an hour a year ago at a window and door factory in Cuyahoga Falls. When the pandemic hit his employer required masks then made work voluntary.

News:Employers making jobs 'as enticing as possible' but 'Help Wanted' pleas going unanswered

Enhanced weekly unemployment benefits from the federal government which began at $600 and continue at $300 through June 26 in Ohio on top of traditional payments made the decision to stay home an easy one especially for workers like Dixon who rode a bus.

After working as a convenience store cashier when the economy first reopened Dixon is hoping to cash a decent paycheck in time to celebrate July 4 with his family.

“I got kids” he said. “I got stuff to do.

“Time to get back to work.""

An economy that doesn't work

Since the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' current tracking began in 2000 there has never been more job openings in America. Wages for all industries in Ohio jumped 12.5% last year climbing five times faster than they did the year before.

Employers and staffing agencies say wages are going up even faster in 2021. Jobs that paid $10 or $11 an hour last year are paying $14 or $15 today. But it’s still not enough to fix a job market that in many ways isn’t working.

Fact check:Unemployment rate hit historic high not low during pandemic

Many restaurants and shops are now responding to a labor shortage by cutting hours or closing dining rooms — even as business picks up and state health orders have been lifted.

""None of these light switches have been going on anytime they change something"" said Michael Trecasso who own's Trecaso's Mary Coyle restaurant and ice cream shop a landmark in Highland Square for 84 years.

The restaurant had to layoff three freshly hired employees when the pandemic hit. They reopened with half the dining room seats in storage last May.

With the state health orders gone this month booths inside remain spun around to let customers know the dining room is still closed because they can't find workers to wait tables. Trecaso said he prays some days for rain because his family including two daughters who help out working their full-time jobs are getting burnt out with just the patio open.

""It's crazy"" said Marwan Lahham who owns the Aladdin's Eatery across the alley. The restaurant closed on Monday for a time and is operating shorter hours.

Now hiring:Staffing shortages leave Akron-area restaurants struggling to stay open

""I didn't want to overwork my people and burn them out"" said Lahham who has servers regularly pulling doubles and filling in as shift managers.

Lahham and Trecaso like other employers and several staffing agencies no longer let people take job applications home. They must be filled out and returned on the spot. The business owners say some unemployed people want the applications not the jobs so the state doesn't cutoff their unemployment assistance.

'It’s just unbelievable'

With seven offices in Northeast Ohio GreatWork! Employment Services is seeing more and more walk-ins every day. But the agency still is only getting about 25% of the job seekers it had before the pandemic President Tia Ramlow said.

On the Wednesday morning that Dixon decided to accept his new job three other people with appointments never showed. The industry calls that “ghosting.”

One staffing agency said it recently had 13 clients sign job offers but only two showed up to work.

Employers and staffing agencies now find themselves at the mercy of workers who are demanding some of the best jobs and pay they’ve ever had.

Help (Really!) Wanted:Restaurants go from shortage of customers to shortage of employees

“Every associate we work with we’re fortunate to have them because we’re all vying for the same labor pool” said Lenny Nowakowski who manages the Akron branch of Safe Staffing of Ohio. Nowakowski estimates the staffing agency’s five regional locations are serving 300 job seekers as opposed to 600 before the pandemic.

“Unfortunately we’ve been in this slump for lack of better word for at least the past year. And we would anticipate or at least hope that these things turnaround here with the additional unemployment money getting cutback” he said.

“Hopefully that gets the workforce in gear” said Nowakowski. “But as of now it’s just unbelievable.”

Workers ""can name their price and be extremely choosy in selecting what they want. I think that’s what they want"" he said.

Job recruiters say the silver lining in this pandemic-induced labor shortage is that employers are raising wages and considering applicants with non-violent criminal records.

Ramlow said the owner of a distribution center in Akron increased his entry-level rate to $11 in July “which was a big deal back then and he also became a second-chance employer."" The employer then upped the pay to $11.50 in September $13 in March $14 in May and $15 in June. And there’s a $1-an-hour bonus for employees who stick around for 60 days and get hired on.

News:If workers don't return to offices in Akron what will happen to the municipal income tax?

“They are raising rates like there’s no tomorrow” Ramlow said. “And that’s just one client. It‘s not unusual across the board.”

Akron Family Restaurant owner Dean Corpas said he had no trouble hiring five employees last month as business picked up.

""We're just paying more. Everybody's screaming about help. Pay them more and they'll come in right? I mean dishwashers — we're paying them $12 an hour (to start).""

Competing with unemployment

Frank Hodges a bartender at Pub Bricco in Akron’s Merriman Valley regrets going back to work at least financially.

“Honestly the only reason I still do this is because I enjoy it” Hodges said after mixing two martinis on a slow-going Wednesday afternoon.

Originally from Strongsville the 25-year-old college graduate lost a bartending job in Columbus during the pandemic. So he moved back to Northeast Ohio where it’s cheaper to live.

He and co-workers said they lost their unemployment benefits the day they started working again because they earned too much but not as much as unemployment was paying. Hodges now bar tends part-time and works full-time as a medical assistant making $15 an hour at the Cleveland Clinic.

He recently took home $15 in tips for an entire Sunday shift.

Even with his full-time job and bartending Hodges said he would still make more per hour after taxes on unemployment.

Why aren't people working?

There's no shortage of reasons for the labor shortage.

The Beacon Journal knocked on doors this month to find a couple out-of-work residents who spoke on the condition of anonymity about their lack of employment.

A man in Highland Square said he had a job lined up through a temp agency but came down with COVID-19. So he's restarting the job search process.

An immunocompromised woman who rents an apartment in the Merriman Valley said workers at the corporate office where she prepared sushi before the pandemic are still working from home. She's got eight years of experience cooking but would prefer a job working from home if she could find one.

Concerns about the virus persist.

No mask no service?:As state lifts pandemic health orders businesses set their own rules

Robert Half a national job-recruiter with six locations in Northeast Ohio surveyed thousands of workers in April. While the agency caters locally to the manufacturing industry most clients offer office jobs from administrative assistants information technologists customer service representatives and accountants to six-figure executive positions.

The survey found that 52% of respondents want colleagues to wear masks and think employers should require vaccinations. And 53% said they would feel uncomfortable sharing space with co-workers.

Child care is also a ""big issue"" said Jen Claxon a branch manager for Robert Half. Low wages have presented a particular challenge to finding workers for daycare centers.

""We're also seeing a shift in the way certain companies treated their employees or what happened with employees during the pandemic"" she said.

Workers demanding dignity

Employers and job recruiters recognize that workers have the upper hand and they’re using that newfound clout to turn down jobs they've hated for years.

“The restaurant industry has been notorious for abusing…hourly workers for decades"" said local restaurant owner Dave Sharp. ""And now they (the workers) feel that they have the advantage and they’re taking advantage of it. And I can’t say that I blame them but it makes my life very stressful.""

Sharp owns the Bricco locations in Kent which is doing alright with college students available to hire and downtown Akron which will remain closed for the foreseeable future. Sharp can't find 20 qualified employees to reopen it and he doesn't think there's enough business downtown for another restaurant right now.

Now You Know Akron podcast:Life after COVID a roundtable discussion

“A lot of people who are out there looking are going to the privately owned restaurants” said Amy Flener a waiter with 20 years in the industry. “We want our holidays off. They're (private restaurants) giving you benefits. They’re giving you opportunities to work your way up much more than corporate restaurants.”

Flener like others in the restaurant business got four-hours notice when Gov. DeWine and the Ohio Health Department shuttered their industry last year. Flener went back to the corporate restaurant where she worked and instantly made too much for unemployment.

She's now making between $20 and $25 an hour though some nights are slow. And she sees colleagues in the industry who see short-staffed restaurants with impatient customers and wonder ""Why would anyone come back to that?""

Mike who asked that his last name not be used to speak candidly about his employment situation quit his job as a furniture store manager just before the pandemic hit.

He was making $21 an hour as an assistant manager who felt abused by his employer. So he started running food delivery orders through third-party apps in July. He said he’s on pace to earn $60000 this year before expenses and taxes.

With no medical benefits but in good health for now he’s applied to several retail management jobs. If he gets through the online filter he seldom gets a call back. When he does he balks at the $14 an hour they're offering.

“Never in my life have I had a problem finding another job” he said. “Usually it happens in a couple weeks. This has gone on too long. Quite honestly I’m fed up.”

The national labor shortage is more complicated than people simply not wanting to work he said.

“They’re flat-out wrong"" he said of the headlines. ""They (the workers) are fed up with corporate America. They're trying to find a different direction. In retail they don’t want to work their holidays anymore or their weekends. I know a lot of people in these businesses who’ve switched. Even before the pandemic it was hard to find retail help.”

For thousands of remote employees during the pandemic working from home became the best thing they never knew they always wanted. We get it. Pants without zippers fewer distractions folding laundry while you Zoom saving money by not commuting. The list goes on and on.

While many companies may never have a Monday through Friday in-office requirement again others are already reverting back to the daily nine-to-five grind. As you can imagine that option will no longer work for everyone.

“I’m definitely hearing from people who don’t want to go back into the office” said Karen Silins a career coach in Kansas City. “They don’t want to go back because they are more productive and they found they really enjoy working from home. The other big issue is health. The vaccine does not completely protect you from COVID. It’s like the flu shot… so a lot of people are still really nervous.”

A new study by global staffing firm Robert Half shows about 1 in 3 professionals (some 34%) currently working from home because of the global health pandemic would look for a new job if required to be back in the office full time. Other research has shown similar results.

So if you work for a company that is DONE offering flexibility what are your options?

Determine your true needs

Before making a snap decision like firing off a quick letter of resignation take time to assess your personal situation to figure out what you might lose or gain from leaving an office setting permanently.

When making big decisions says Andres Lares managing partner at Shapiro Negotiations Institute on Decision Making it’s helpful to use a decision-making model which can include physically listing out all of the things that are important to you and then picking the few that are most important. For example do you most value face-to-face team collaboration and communication or much more flexibility in your workday?

Once you figure out the most important criteria for the decision give each a value. Then narrow it down to the most important. Using 5 or 10 as values is often easiest he says. Don’t worry about getting the number perfect but spend a little time trying to figure it out and try to focus on relative scores.

Understand the cost opportunity

If you decide that one option for you is to return on a staggered or hybrid schedule then the score for health and safety might be high but you might score low on team collaboration and communication since there won’t be as much overlap between colleagues if you’re still working from home for part of the week.

Evaluate choose then sleep on it

Work through your list objectively as you come to a decision. Then and this is really important sleep on it. Lares said this is a way to gain more clarity in your decision-making because you allow yourself the opportunity to view the choice through two lenses both short and long-term.

Because our mood often impacts our decision-making it’s best to put some time between your first choice — especially when it can be life-changing — and moving forward with the decision. “Take your time to make the decision” he says “but when you finally make it be confident and swift about implementing it.”

Offer specific alternative plans

If you decide you are open to other work options including hybrid schedules that would allow for some time in the office and some time working remotely it won’t hurt to ask your supervisor or human resources representative if they would consider alternative plans at least in the short term.

The best way to go about this Lares says is to provide specific solutions that show you have considered their point of view as an employer. You could say “If you are open to other options I have a couple of ideas to share that would work better for me at this time.’’ Then list them out. Even if they don’t seem receptive before you ask for flexibility you lose very little by asking.

Demonstrate your productivity at home

If you want to continue working from home and don’t want to find a new employer another option is to show your boss what you have been able to accomplish away from the office.

“If you are a person who can be more productive or as productive prove it” Silins says. Give examples of projects completed on time or early show how losing your commute has meant more hours spent on work projects at home. Demonstrate that success can happen away from a cube farm.

Can you afford to leave your job?

While some people manage to save a bundle while working from home or have an emergency fund stashed away others may not be in a place where they can spend a month or more looking for a new job that’s completely remote.

Silins the career coach says she typically counsels clients not to leave their job until they find a new one unless they can really afford to do so. However she has had a few clients in toxic environments who couldn’t afford NOT to leave. “You are stronger in the job market when you have another job” she says “but when it becomes a danger to your health and you are suffering from heart problems and anxiety issues it’s not worth staying.”

Many times Silins says her clients who left the toxic job without another one already lined up felt so much better they were able to get a new job in a month or less.

Employers need to be aware she says that when they start requiring people to come back to the office some employees will begin looking for other jobs. Some of her clients have already left jobs where they had to show up to an office in favor of 100% remote employment.

“Half of my clients are working remote jobs” Silins said. “They found things that required them to either have hybrid work environments or they went fully remote.”

Start searching for a new job

If your respectful request to stay remote is turned down and you simply cannot go back to an office right now start your job search immediately. Before you write a letter of resignation update your resume and freshen up your LinkedIn profile. Make sure to tidy up any other social media accounts too.

Don’t forget to let your family friends and trusted colleagues know you are in the market for new work opportunities. Online job sites currently highlighting remote work include Indeed.com Ziprecruiter.com and FlexJobs.com. Consulting a career coach is another option. Silins is a member of the Professional Association of Resume Writers and Career Coaches.

Kieffer Moore cancelled out Breel Embolo’s second-half header and Page urged Wales to build on the draw when they face Turkey here in Baku on Wednesday.

Italy top the group after beating Turkey 3-0 on Friday but Page is adamant his side are in a strong position after surviving a late scare against Switzerland when Mario Gavranovic’s late strike was ruled offside.

“To get off to a positive start was important for us” said Page the interim Wales manager. “I’ve said to the players that’s the foundations now. If we have to dig a trench and put our tin hats on at times we will do it and we proved we can do that as well as play. It feels like a win in the changing room. I am so proud of the players. We got a little bit of luck towards the end but that is the start we are after.”

Page praised Danny Ward’s outstanding display in goal and said he had no concerns about Daniel James frustration’s upon being substituted a minute after Moore’s equaliser. Page insisted the Manchester United winger’s withdrawal was for the greater good. “I liked the fact he was angry” Page said after complimenting James on the work he had put in.

“If players are pleased to come off the pitch that says they are not interested and don’t want to be on there. It is not about keeping individuals happy – at times you have to make difficult decisions. I get his frustration and I have no problem with that whatsoever. He’s a great lad and he cares. He wants to play for his country and he wants to play every minute. He gave us everything.”

The Switzerland manager Vladimir Petkovic said he had no regrets over substituting Xherdan Shaqiri after 66 minutes at which point they led courtesy of Embolo’s header. “He showed a good performance but I also thought about the next matches where we need him and I wanted to create more stability in midfield” Petkovic said.

“We became a little more passive but this is not only our fault because Wales had to risk more and they had to put in a stronger performance. Our opponents showed some excellent qualities.”

The economic toll of strict mandates to slow the spread of COVID-19 was high. For years to come there will be grand debates over the government’s pandemic policies.

California is down 1.4 million workers since we learned the word “coronavirus.” Yes California’s economy is huge and recovering but April’s job counts are only 92% of February 2020’s pre-pandemic levels.

Only five states — Hawaii New York Nevada New Mexico and Massachusetts — and Washington D.C. are further behind.

But let’s not forget why the state limited business so harshly: to contain the pandemic that killed nearly 64000 Californians. On a per-capita basis California’s death toll was below the national average and better than 30 states.

California this year has slowly allowed many businesses to return to some normalcy. The “official” June 15 grand reopening of commerce will serve as a major opportunity to reverse much of the economic pain.

Like any financial pivot the impact will not be universal.

It may be business as usual for many niches already near their pre-pandemic pace. For several industries it will be a much-needed lifeline. And for certain businesses reopening may herald surprising challenges.

Let’s look at California’s potential winners and losers as the throttle is taken off the economy.

WINNERS

The unemployed: New choices

California has 676000 more people “officially” unemployed than it did just before the coronavirus crushed the economy.

Fully reopening should mean the jobless have more options for work. UC Berkeley economics professor Jim Wilcox says job opportunities may blossom in manufacturing.

Businesses making goods in short supply will be hiring he says. One example is the limited inventory of computer chips that are as important to our vehicles as an engine.

“If you got a few chips missing you can’t make that car” Wilcox says.

Travel and leisure: More fun ahead

If any businesses will rebound in a reopened economy it’s leisure industries.

The lockdown and a widespread reluctance to travel hammered the state’s tourism businesses in the last 14 months.

Combined California’s hotels amusement attractions recreation facilities and entertainment venues are down 303000 jobs in the pandemic era. This “fun” industry is at only 62% of pre-virus staffing.

The reopening will motivate travel and trim attendance limits in what will be a big boost to employers.

“Hotels along the coast are achieving some of the best revenues in May that they have ever seen so fully opening is only going to add another match to that fire” says tourism expert Alan Reay at Atlas Hospitality.

As for full-service business hotels he says “It will take time but you will now see future bookings start to spike up.”

The office market: Refilling

Any move from the pandemic’s tidal “work from home” shift back to traditional workplaces will bring life back to many empty office spaces.

In San Francisco 16.7% of offices were vacant in 2021’s first quarter vs. 5.2% at the end of 2019 according to the JLL brokerage. In Los Angeles it’s 17.5% vacancy now vs. 13% pre-pandemic.

Yes there’s plenty of conjecture about how many workers return to old workspaces. And it’s not just coming from the bosses.

A JLL survey of 3000 workers found 33% of the workforce wants to end WFH up from 28% in October 2020. A desire for remote work fell to 1.5 days a week vs. 1.9 days in October.

June 15’s eased rules mean many employers will quicken returns to the office says Peter Belisle JLL’s director for Southwest U.S. markets.

“Office landlords are seeing more tours with prospective tenants as well as less sublease space come on the market” he says.

Restaurants: Shifting patterns

The virus changed where we dined out. It became a fast-food takeout world.

Just look at employment in the sector. “Limited-service” jobs at eateries statewide are at 90% of pre-pandemic staffing levels vs. 69% at full-service restaurants and 60% at bars.

First-quarter sales at fast-food chains were down 4% in a year vs. a drop of 10.5% at their peers operating sit-down restaurants says a study by restaurant financier Trinity Capital.

Sit-down restaurants competed by getting better at takeout meals and delivery. Reopened dining rooms will get more customers indoors. Serving more drinks and selling more side dishes and desserts will boost owners’ bottom lines.

“As dining rooms began to open in May some of the restaurant sales enjoyed by the (quick-serve) segment began a slow but steady migration to sit-down restaurants” Trinity Capital writes.

LOSERS

Employers: Help wanted

The reopening may get employers thinking “be careful what you wish for.”

Where are the workers who’ll service this renewed rush of customers?

Labor shortages have forced some employers to scramble for staff using incentives such as pay hikes to lure new hires. Recent unemployment trends may tell us more about why it’s so hard to hire.

Bosses’ employment costs in Southern California rose 4.8% in the year ended in March the nation’s biggest jump according to a federal index. The region’s combined unemployment rate was 9.2% in April.

But in the Bay Area costs rose just 2.1% with unemployment only at 5.6%

UC Berkeley’s Wilcox isn’t buying the argument that expanded unemployment benefits are keeping workers from the job market — especially in hospitality and construction. Rather he thinks “there are better jobs to be had with higher pay making the things.”

Housing: Time to slow down?

Shopping for a house or refi? Get the pandemic’s cheap financing while it lasts.

Historically lows rates fueled a buying binge that pushed California’s median sales price for an existing single-family home to a record $813980 for April — up 40% from February 2020.

“Our expectation is for the market to remain strong but fall into a healthier less feverish pace in the coming months” said Ali Wolf chief economist at Zonda.

Remote schooling and working from home nudged many households to seek larger living quarters sometimes in distance communities. Will a return to the office dull this slice of demand?

Plus the home price surge has created affordability concerns. Monthly house payments are up because rate drops aren’t equal to appreciation. And a nation’s worth of reopenings should generate enough economic momentum to force up mortgage rates — further eroding the notion of affordability.

“If/when rates rise the extent and swiftness is critically important” Wolf says. “A gradual increase could favor housing enticing those on the sidelines to jump in. A rapid and meaningful rise would quickly cool the market.”

Drivers: A double whammy

Gas prices are at a level not seen in seven years (save two weeks in 2019) but buying a vehicle might be even more painful to your wallet.

An average gallon of regular California gasoline was $4.08 last week up $1.44 or 55% from the pandemic low according to federal energy stats.

Drivers will see the reopening further fill freeways and parking lots. Rebounding travel put a key ingredient crude oil at its highest price since the fall of 2018. But growing supplies could stabilize pump prices — or even lower them a bit.

”From an inventory perspective there is plenty of gas in the tank to support what people want to do” says David Hackett of Stillwater Associates.

If you need wheels finding new cars will be challenging thanks to those chip shortages. So used cars are a hot commodity.

California’s average used car cost 18.7% more in April than 12 months earlier according to the iSeeCars buying service. Only 15 states had larger increases.

“Car prices will remain elevated for the rest of the year meaning shoppers should hold off switching vehicles” says Karl Brauer executive analyst at iSeeCars.

Shoppers: Paying the price

Remember early in the pandemic when merchants slashed prices?

Discounts have been on the wane for months and the reopening should bring more customers to stores. Other business owners will likely boost prices to recoup the higher costs of stocking their stores.

Look at local inflation. In Los Angeles-Orange County May’s inflation rate was 3.9% the highest since October 2018. For the Bay Area its most recent rate of 3.8% in April was the highest in two years. And it’s not just California: Nationally May’s 5% inflation rate was the highest in 13 years.

A rebound from last year’s weakened locked-down economy is part of the story. But some price hikes will stick.

“We already have significant inflationary pressure but reopening the economy will exacerbate it” says Jim Doti a Chapman University economics professor.

The infected guests apparently (according to guests aboard the ship who have contacted us) have to remain in a hotel once the ship returns to St. Maarten until their test results are negative. It is unknown whether the two infected guests require medical treatment although the cruise line’s media reports stress that they are asymptomatic. I imagine that they will then fly home when they receive their negative test results wherever that might be.

The question naturally arises who will pay for the costs of the medical treatment (if any) and international travel back home?

These questions should be asked by any family thinking of taking a cruise during the ongoing pandemic whether they are vaccinated or not.

The conditional sailing orders (CSO) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) require (for cruise leaving from U.S. ports) that cruise line submit proof of the companies’ agreements with port authorities that they have arranged housing for the quarantine of guests as well as arrangements for medical treatment of the infected. The cruise lines or course have not produced copies of the agreements to the public or otherwise clearly disclosed who will be responsible for paying for any necessary medical treatment their guests require off of their ships or for the costs of their guests flying back from wherever they are quarantined.

Of course the CDC’s CSO’s apply only to cruising from U.S. ports so there are no such agreements that the cruise lines have to make for cruises leaving ports in the Caribbean such as the Celebrity Millennium which left from St. Maarten. But the issue nonetheless exists who pays when cruise guests test positive during a cruise?

A Royal Caribbean ship the Adventure of the Seas left the port of Nassau today. This is another cruise where 100% of the guests (except children) are suppose to be vaccinated. I understand that Royal Caribbean also required negative COVID tests before the guests boarded the cruise ship.

I am reading lots of comments on Twitter and Facebook from cruise fans who express their excitement about finally returning to cruising. Some brought their unvaccinated kids aboard the cruise ship today. How many of them have inquired what will happen if they or their close contacts test positive for COVID-19? Will they be quarantined off the ship? Who will pay for their medical expenses off the ship and who will pay for their flights home?

Regarding medical expenses homeowner’s insurance policies typically exclude coverage for liabilities on ships. Most medical insurance does not cover illness or injuries outside of the U.S. And many policies of travel insurance exclude coverage for illnesses related to pandemics. The last thing that a family wanting to spend a relaxing week at sea wants is to think about potentially incurring uninsured expenses for repeat testing and medical treatment required off of the ship and flights to get their families home.

So today I asked Royal Caribbean via Twitter these basic questions. I quickly received a pleasant response: “Onboard our ships the health and safety of our guests is our top priority” followed by this response: “this means there are certain and specific protocols in place to avoid this from happening aboard our ships. In the event this was to happen certain instructions and protocols would be given once you’re onboard.”

What are procedures when a guest tests positive for #COVID19 during the #cruise? Who pays for housing & food during quarantine off ship? Who pays for any medical treatment and repeat testing? and for expenses associated with flying home? @RoyalCaribbean or guest? — James (Jim) Walker (@CruiseLaw) June 12 2021

Sounds good I'm just wondering who pays for the housing & food during quarantine any medical treatment and flight back home? — James (Jim) Walker (@CruiseLaw) June 12 2021

Sounds expensive. — James (Jim) Walker (@CruiseLaw) June 12 2021

So What Are Royal Caribbean’s Legal Obligations?

In considering the contractual obligation owed by a cruise line to a guest courts look at the terms and condition of the cruise ticket and related documents prepared by the cruise company. Most cruise lines typically deny all responsibility for medical expenses related to shipboard illnesses and injuries.

Based on the terms and conditions set forth in Royal Caribbean’s cruise tickets and internet site it appears that the cruise line may be able to avoid paying for all of the medical expenses incurred off of the ship and most of the flights back home.

Sources of Information

There are three sources of information which a guest needs to read and understand regarding this issue. First there are terms in the cruise line’s “Healthy Sail Center.” Secondly there is the ROYAL CARIBBEAN GROUP REFUND* AND CANCELLATION POLICY FOR COVID-19 (caps in original). Thirdly there is Royal Caribbean’s “Cruise/Cruisetour Ticket Contract.”

Medical Expenses on the Ship – Yes; Off the Ship – No:

I know that at one point Royal Caribbean stated in the terms and conditions of its cruise ticket for its cruise from Singapore for example that it will pay up to $20000 for medical expenses incurred by a guest on the cruise ship. Of course Singapore has virtually no community spread of COVID cases. And cruises from Singapore are limited to citizens of that country. So its not much of a risk to guarantee payment of shipboard medical expenses where all of the guests are from a country with no COVID exposure. Shipboard medical expenses are unlikely to ever reach that amount in the first place.

For Caribbean sailings such as from the Bahamas the shipboard medical care is free on the ship but not ashore either if the guest is quarantined on a Caribbean island or when they return home.

The Healthy Sail Center information includes this initial language regarding medical expenses: “Onboard SARS-CoV-2 evaluation and testing that is performed on recommendation of the onboard medical team is free of charge. COVID-19-related medical treatment provided onboard should treatment be necessary is also free of charge.” But there is no such responsibility for COVID evaluation and treatment when its required off of the ship either during a quarantine during the cruise or after the guest return home.

Of course medical care on the ship is limited. Guests can reasonably assume that anyone who becomes acutely ill will be transferred off of the ship. This is where the problems begin. Medical treatment in Caribbean ports of call is also limited particularly during this pandemic and very expensive. Hospitals in the Caribbean typically require upfront payments. Guests should prepare to turn their credit cards over in order to receive treatment. No insurance company back home in the U.S. will reimburse these expenses. It is also questionable whether a guest’s medical insurance will cover intensive care treatment ventilators and expensive medicine and therapies if the guest contracts COVID at sea outside of the U.S. and become ill.

Uninsured medical expenses for medical care in the U.S. which is needed to severe COVID infections contracted on a cruise ship could be catastrophically high.

Airfare Back Home – Watch Out For the Fine Print!:

Royal Caribbean will pay for some guests’ airfare back home but not for all guests largely depending on whether the guest booked their flights through the cruise line. The language in the Healthy Sail Center (which is arguably not part of the contract between the cruise line and guest) states in general terms:

“If you test positive for COVID-19 during the cruise Royal Caribbean will cover the costs of COVID-19 related medical treatment onboard any required land-based quarantine and travel home for you and your Travelling Party” (defined as “your family members living with you in the same household and travelling companions assigned to your stateroom on the cruise”). The Healthy Sail Center also says: “Royal Caribbean has developed transport protocols to ensure impacted guests get home safely.”

But this broad language is narrowed by the fine print in the terms and conditions of the ROYAL CARIBBEAN GROUP REFUND* AND CANCELLATION POLICY FOR COVID-19 which obligates the cruise line to pay the airfare for guests who tested positive for COVID only if the guest “purchased flights through the cruise line.” But for guests who handled their own flights the cruise line “will not be responsible for any associated costs” (such as “airline change fees and any difference in the airfare”).

This is a perfect example of a popular saying by Tom Waits — ‘The large print giveth and the small print taketh away.’

Royal Caribbean’s Catch-All “Obligation to Comply with RCG COVID-19 Policies and Procedures”

The cruise line’s “ROYAL CARIBBEAN GROUP REFUND* AND CANCELLATION POLICY FOR COVID-19” contains language permitting the company to deny paying for or providing assistance “of any kind” when it determines that guest failed “to comply with the RCG COVID-19 Policies and Procedures in effect at the time of the cruise.” It is less than clear exactly what these policies and procedures may be. In light of the fact that the company recommends its quests to become vaccinated does a passenger risk forfeiting all of the rather limited payments and assistance by ailing to become vaccinated?

The Bottom Line: Guests who booked their own flights and require medical treatment ashore and back home are largely on their own

Forbes recently reported that:

“Only half of Americans (50%) are confident that the cruise industry can reopen safely coming out of the pandemic according to a recent Harris Poll Covid-19 tracker survey fielded May 26-28 to 1999 U.S. adults . . . When asked whether they were confident that various industries could keep customers safe respondents rated the cruise industry dead last . . .”

Providing gobbledygook responses to legitimate questions posed regarding the health and safety of cruise passengers and the economic consequences of testing positive for COVID or becoming ill at sea is not the way to bolster consumer confidence.

One would think that any family thinking of taking a cruise during a pandemic would check and double check the details of the cruise line’s policies and protocols (and the fine print) and know exactly what will happen and the financial consequences if they or other guests on the ship test positive for COVID.

But it wasn't a nightmare either.

That's my quick take on the new boarding process for Adventure of the Seas -- the first Royal Caribbean ship to restart operations in North America.

From the moment I began the process on Saturday in Nassau Bahamas in advance of the vessel's first sailing in 15 months to the time I stepped into my cabin almost exactly one hour passed.

That's about four times longer than the ""15 minutes or less"" that Royal Caribbean used to tout as the typical time it would take passengers to get through the boarding process. The line has long prided itself on getting passengers checked in and onboard ships quickly.

But in this new era of mandatory COVID-19 screenings to access all sorts of vacation spots -- from cruise ships to theme parks to musical venues -- it didn't seem all that bad.

The boarding process definitely was different -- and right from the start. Instead of heading straight to the ship at the pier complex in downtown Nassau for check-in passengers were told to go to the British Colonial Hilton which is a few streets away.

There we had to undergo a quick temperature screening just to get into the building — done with an electronic temperature reader.

My temperature was 97.0 degrees Fahrenheit which apparently was just what they wanted to see. I was immediately allowed inside.

With a temperature of 97.0 degrees I was allowed on to the next step of boarding. (Photo by Gene Sloan/The Points Guy)

From there I was directed up a set of stairs to a conference room to undergo a rapid antigen test for COVID-19 -- an extra level of screening the line added to the procedure with just a few days' notice. I only found out about the test requirement on Thursday when I received an email from Royal Caribbean. I had to quickly register online for the test which was conducted by a Bahamian health system called Doctor's Hospital and paid for by Royal Caribbean.

Only passengers who tested negative were allowed to board Adventure of the Seas.

This day-of-boarding COVID-19 testing was the biggest factor in the longer boarding time for the sailing. After initially checking in at the British Colonial Hilton I was immediately led to a nursing station without a moment of waiting to undergo the test -- the kind where a nurse twirls a swab in your nostrils. But I then had to wait more than 30 minutes for the results of the test to come back before continuing on with the boarding process.

Both the COVID-19 testing and the waiting took place in conference rooms in the hotel. Per Bahamian rules we all were required to wear masks through the entire process.

The conference room where I was told to wait for my test results also had a bank of tables where I finished the check-in process for the ship.

The day-of-boarding COVID-19 test requirement is on top of a requirement that all passengers 16 years and older must be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 to sail and it was in this conference room that a Royal Caribbean representative asked to see my vaccine card scanning it into an iPad-like device.

Starting Aug. 1 all passengers age 12 and older will have to show such a vaccine card -- a requirement that Royal Caribbean is implementing for many but not all sailings as it restarts operations. Sailings starting up out of the Bahamas; Cyprus; the U.K.; and Seattle and Galveston in the U.S. are among those where a vaccine will be required for all passengers eligible for one. Royal Caribbean CEO Michael Bayley said in a Facebook post this week that the line also hopes to have a vaccine requirement for initial sailings out of Bayonne N.J. in the New York area.

On this sailing there are 1068 passengers on board of which 94% are vaccinated according to a Royal Caribbean representative. The 6% of passengers who are not vaccinated are children not eligible for a vaccine.

Like dozens of other passengers in the waiting room I received my (negative) COVID-19 test results in an email from Doctor's Hospital that I then had to show to a Royal Caribbean representative to continue on with the check-in and boarding process. From the waiting room I was directed down stairs and out of the British Colonial Hilton to a shuttle bus station where I boarded a shuttle to the Nassau piers.

From there it was just a short walk down one of the piers past a colorfully costumed group of local Bahamian musicians and dancers to the ship. I was soon on board.

TPG is one of just a handful of travel outlets on this first Royal Caribbean sailing in North America. We paid for the trip ourselves and booked anonymously.

The trip is notable for several reasons. In addition to being the first Royal Caribbean sailing in North America since the COVID-19 pandemic began it is the line's first-ever sailing out of Nassau. Indeed it's the first sailing by any line out of Nassau which doesn't have its own indoor cruise terminal to facilitate departures (hence Royal Caribbean's use of the British Colonial Hilton as an initial check-in location for arriving passengers).

Adventure of the Seas also is just the second big cruise ship to resume operations in North America since March 2020. Royal Caribbean's sister line Celebrity Cruises began sailings out of St. Maarten (the Dutch side of the island of St. Martin) last Saturday with a single ship Celebrity Millennium.

Several more major lines are scheduled to restart operations in North America in the next few weeks.

The sailing thus offers one of the first glimpses of what cruising in North America really will be like when more cruise vessels restart operations.

Like many cruise lines Royal Caribbean -- the world's biggest cruise brand -- has designed a long list of new health protocols to implement on its vessels as they return to service to make sure that COVID-19 doesn't spread on board.

In addition to the COVID-19 testing and temperature checks mentioned above all passengers boarding Adventure of the Seas had to answer a list of questions about their health the day before arriving at the ship. The questions were on an online form only available at the Royal Caribbean App.

Passengers boarding Adventure of the Seas have to complete an online health form the day before arriving at the ship only part of which is shown here. (Screenshot of form by Gene Sloan/The Points Guy)

Adventure of the Seas will depart Nassau late Saturday on a seven-night trip to Cozumel Mexico; and Perfect Day at CocoCay Royal Caribbean's private island in the Bahamas. It'll also stop at Grand Bahama Island for a day.

South Florida Sun Sentinel

Fort Lauderdale Fla. — The first major cruise ship to sail from the U.S. in more than a year will be Celebrity Edge from Port Everglades.

Celebrity Cruises announced it had received to OK from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to begin seven-night Caribbean sailings from the Fort Lauderdale port beginning June 26 according to the company.

“For the past 15 months our conversations with friends and loved ones about seeing the world have been accompanied by the phrase ‘someday.’ I’m beyond proud and excited to say that day has arrived” said cruise line CEO and President Lisa Lutoff-Perlo in a release.

When the ship sets sail it would make it the first major cruise vessel to sail from a U.S. port since CDC orders shut them down in March 2020.

“It’s fun to be first. But most importantly we are ready for cruising to restart safely” said Port Everglades CEO Jonathan Daniels. “We have worked with our cruise line partners for the past year toward a safe return to cruising and now it is finally here.”

The cruise industry came to a halt as the global coronavirus pandemic took hold. Cruise lines have been working to get their ships back sailing from U.S. ports navigating COVID-19 safety protocols put forth by the CDC.

Part of those included allowing ships that commit to 98% vaccinated crew and 95% vaccinated passengers skipping over the test sailings other lines will have to perform in order to get their Conditional Sailing Certificate.

Celebrity mostly caters to adults and the Celebrity Edge cruises will require any U.S.-based passengers 16 and older to have proof of vaccination according to the release. Beginning Aug. 1 that requirement will include those 12 and older.

Just how that stance will mesh with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ executive order and forthcoming law that goes into effect July 1 that bans vaccine passports has raised questions.

“We’ve been very clear the law is clear in Florida” Taryn Fenske spokesperson for the governor told The Miami Herald. “You can’t mandate vaccine passports. We are interested to see how the CDC works with them so that they don’t get these exorbitant fines.”

The law threatens fines of up to $5000 per violation.

Celebrity Cruises spokesperson Susan Lomax sent a statement to the Herald saying “We are working with the Governor’s office to align on the path forward.”

Richard Fain though chairman of Celebrity’s parent company Royal Caribbean Group said the decision was the result of collaboration among the CDC elected officials and industry group Cruise Lines International Association.

“We’ve consulted with the brightest minds in the health industry to ensure that our passengers and crew feel safe and comfortable on our ships while enjoying the uncompromised experience they know and love” Fain said.

The ship will offer a selection of either Eastern or Western Caribbean itineraries.

In addition the line announced Celebrity Equinox will also sail from Port Everglades on Caribbean itineraries beginning July 18 which means nine of the 15 ships in Celebrity’s fleet will be sailing worldwide in 2021.

The line already had announced plans for sailing in Alaska as well in July as Celebrity Millennium from new home port of St. Maarten the first major line to return to the Caribbean when it begins voyages on June 5.

Several other lines have announced vaccine-required sailings in Alaska starting in July or August. Alaska does not have a ban on vaccine passports. As far as Florida goes Royal Caribbean announced it had received the OK from the CDC to sail a test voyage in late June.

The simulated voyages aim to prove out cruise lines’ COVID-19 health protocols to ensure they can sail safely amid the pandemic. If all goes well the CDC can approve the test sailing and allow that ship to sail with paying customers.

Lines that cater to passengers that include younger children would not be able to hit the CDC’s high-percentage vaccination goals since no vaccine is currently available for those 11 and younger.

Officials at Port Canaveral said they were optimistic that the CDC would give similar approvals soon for simulated sailings that could in a best-case scenario begin in late June.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlcmFkaW8ubmV0L3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1hZHZlbnR1cmUtb2YtdGhlLXNlYXMtc2FpbHMtZnJvbS1uYXNzYXUtYmFoYW1hcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Another First as Royal Caribbean Ship Sails From Nassau,"Saturday was another good day for the cruise industry as Royal Caribbean’s Adventure of the Seas set sail from Nassau in the Bahamas. This was the first time a ship from the company’s fleet has departed from a North American port since the industry shut down well over a year ago.

“We Are Extremely Excited”

The departure of Adventure of the Seas came only a few hours after Celebrity Millennium returned to Saint Maarten following her first sailing from that port. (Celebrity is a division of Royal Caribbean Group making Millennium and Adventure sister ships or at least first cousins.)

READ MORE: Update on Celebrity Millennium’s Sailing COVID cases

Adventure of the Seas arrived in Nassau earlier this week to much fanfare. “This vessel and all the hope that this first voyage will carry out to sea on Saturday have been a long time in coming” said Mike Maura CEO of Nassau Cruise Port.

This sailing is a particularly big deal given that while cruise ships routinely make stops in Nassau this is the very first time it is being used as a homeport.

“As you can imagine” said Maura “we are all extremely excited and working overtime to ensure that this launch is successful.”

And successful the ship’s departure was made all the more dramatic because Adventure left the port after dark allowing her lights to cut through the night making for a truly impressive sight.

The ship which is sailing at just under 50 percent capacity with all passengers having provided proof of vaccination will visit Freeport Grand Bahama; Cozumel Mexico; and Royal Caribbean’s private island Perfect Day at CocoCay.

In fact the ship’s summer sailings will feature back-to-back days at CocoCay.

Although guests originally were told they would not be able to book independent shore excursions during port visits the cruise line changed that policy only a few weeks before Saturday’s sailing.

Carnival Cruise Line

This year Carnival Cruise Line became the latest brand to introduce a new livery. In May the company announced that the new hull design of the new Mardi Gras will become a feature across the fleet as the company prepares to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2022.

The livery is highlighted by a stately navy-blue hull inspired by officers’ uniforms along with vibrant red and white accents running the entire length of the ship.

After the Mardi Gras the Carnival Magic (pictured above) was the first vessel to receive the new colors during a drydock in Marseilles.

Royal Caribbean International

Royal Caribbean International updated its livery in 2020 adding a larger name on the hull of the new Odyssey of the Seas. Unusually big the vessel name runs 87.4 meters down each side of the ship.

It’s the second new look for Royal Caribbean in the last decade.

The Quantum of the Seas launched in 2014 debuted a new color template for the company with a light blue hull.

The color scheme was later added on selected vessels including the recently “Amplified” Freedom of the Seas.

Celebrity Cruises

As part of the Celebrity Revolution program Celebrity Cruises is adding a new livery to its fleet. While undergoing the upgrades the company’s existing ships also receive the color scheme of the new Edge-cClass vessels that have a dark blue hull.

The livery has been added to seven of the 11 Celebrity ships.

Princess Cruises

Princess Cruises introduced a new livery in 2016 adding a giant version of its “sea witch” logo to the hull of the 2013-built Royal Princess.

The fresh look which also includes the repositioning of the ship’s name was later added to other vessels and is now present on the entire fleet.

Costa Cruises

In 2018 Costa C became another Carnival Corporation brand to introduce a revised livery. The subtle change saw the name of the ships painted on the bow with a specially designed new font in larger lettering as well as the addition of a stylized Italian flag.

The livery was created to mark the 70th anniversary of the Italian brand and has since been added to the entire fleet.

P&O UK

With the introduction of the 2015-built Britannia P&O Cruises also introduced a new paint scheme to its fleet.

The brand’s traditional funnels were repainted in blue with the addition of P&O’s rising sun logo. As part of the new livery the hulls across the fleet saw a stylized British flag added.

P&O Australia

In 2016 P&O Australia announced the addition of a stylized Southern Cross to the hull of its latest vessel the Pacific Explorer. Along with a new color and a new logo on the funnel the five-star constellation image became P&O’s new livery.

More recently the look was added to the Pacific Encounter the newest ship in the fleet.

Silversea Cruises

Silversea is introducing a new hull color to its fleet with a light gray adorned on the hulls of select ships.

Three vessels are currently sporting the updated color scheme including the new Silver Origin.

Under construction in Italy the newbuild Silver Dawn already shows the new gray hull as well.

Marella Cruises

To mark the addition of the former Splendour of the Seas to its fleet the TUI-owned Marella Cruises introduced a new livery in 2016.

Then called Thomson Cruises the brand created a new “wave design” in-line with TUI’s airplanes.

According to Marella the new branding was meant to keep the consistency across all markets and is now present on the entire cruise fleet.

Fred. Olsen Cruise Line

In 2015 Fred. Olsen debuted a new look on its fleet.. The new color scheme and livery represented the change of position for its product within the premium market the company said at the time.

The gray hull is a throwback to Fred. Olsen’s heritage when the first Black Watch and Black Prince were launched in the 1930s according to the company. The use of the “Cartier” red line refers to the company’s “Red Carpet” service level for every guest."

Did a worm eat Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s brain?

The third-party presidential candidate said in a 2012 deposition that a doctor suggested a parasite hurt him.

We spoke to an expert who said a brain-eating tapeworm larvae would be impossible.

Brain-eating worms? Not likely.

A shocking report in The New York Times on Wednesday revealed that independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested in a 2012 deposition that doctors had found a dead worm in his brain.

In the court proceeding — part of his divorce from his second wife — Kennedy said that he had short-term and long-term memory loss according to The Times.

Kennedy said he had visited doctors in 2010 who thought he had a brain tumor but another doctor suggested that a dark spot on Kennedy's brain scan was ""caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died"" The Times reported.

Kennedy argued in the deposition that he couldn't make as much money due to his health and also revealed that he had mercury poisoning around the same time.

Kennedy has portrayed himself as the younger more healthy alternative to the other two men running for president Joe Biden and Donald Trump.

His campaign's press secretary confirmed that Kennedy was infected with a parasite 10 years ago and said it was resolved. His campaign told Business Insider that Kennedy is in ""robust physical and mental health"" and said questioning his fitness is a ""hilarious suggestion given his competition.""

But could a parasitic worm even cause that kind of damage? One medical expert told Business Insider that Kennedy's version of events doesn't quite add up.

Dr. Janina Caira a University of Connecticut professor and tapeworm specialist told BI that Kennedy's parasite sounds more like the larvae of a pork tapeworm.

That would be rare Caira said in an email. Humans can be infected with the adult worm by eating undercooked pork but can only be infected with the larvae after eating food or drinking water contaminated by the feces of someone with an adult tapeworm infection.

""This typically happens in areas with poor sanitation"" Caira said. ""So it is possible that he could have contracted the infection in South Asia if he came into contact with food or water contaminated with eggs of the tapeworm.""

But there's no way the larvae could have consumed Kennedy's brain tissue.







""Absolutely not"" Caira wrote.

She said the larvae don't have mouths or digestive systems. Instead they absorb nutrients through the surface of their bodies. While Caira said it is possible that a worm could do some ""mechanical damage"" to nearby brain tissue the larvae are very small and a single one ""would not cause much damage.""

That lines up with what experts who were skeptical of the details told The New York Times.

However Dr. Peter Hotez a pediatrician and global health advocate who is a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology & microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine wrote on X that ""neuroparasitic diseases"" and ""parasitic worms have a huge impact on the human brain.""

Hotez said the diseases are seen in poor populations with a ""surprising amount of illness"" in southern states and Texas. He said his team at the National School of Tropical Medicine is working on low-cost vaccines to prevent the conditions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvYXJ0cy90ZWxldmlzaW9uL2xhdGUtbmlnaHQtcmZrLWpyLXdvcm0uaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Late Night Reacts to the Worm in R.F.K.

Kennedy Jr. was told the memory loss and mental fogginess he was experiencing might have been the result of a brain tumor according to a report by the New York Times.

The author and trial lawyer had consulted neurologists who found a dark spot in his brain scans. Ultimately a doctor from New York-Presbyterian Hospital suggested his condition “was caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died” Kennedy said in a 2012 deposition reviewed by the Times.

Kennedy 70 has marketed himself as a younger fitter choice for president  as he runs against President Joe Biden 81 and former President Donald Trump 77. Tweets of Kennedy doing push-ups shirtless in jeans went viral last summer.



The Kennedy campaign confirmed to U.S. News Wednesday that Kennedy did have a parasite but said it no longer impacts his health. “The issue was resolved more than 10 years ago and he is in robust physical and mental health” says press secretary Stefanie Spear. “Questioning Mr. Kennedy’s health is a hilarious suggestion given his competition.”

U.S. News caught up with Dr. Peter Hotez  professor of pediatrics and molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine to learn more about brain parasites including how they get into their human hosts and the symptoms they cause.

While Kennedy’s press secretary suggested the presidential candidate picked up the worm during his travels outside the United States Hotez who is also dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor says there are two brain parasites that are “quite common” in America as well. “These diseases are not rare” he tells U.S. News.

The following interview has been edited for length and clarity:

How does someone end up with a parasite or worm in their brain?

One of the two diseases is called toxocariasis and the other one is called neurocysticercosis and they're transmitted slightly differently.



The Week in Cartoons May 6-10 View All 12 Images

In the case of toxocariasis these are diseases contracted ultimately from stray dogs and cats. What happens is those stray dogs and cats are infected with an intestinal roundworm called toxocara and that roundworm is producing thousands and thousands of eggs that contaminate the soil. The eggs are ubiquitous in the soil and around sandboxes or playgrounds or just in the dirt and kids – or adults – get contaminated with the dirt containing eggs swallow those eggs. And then the eggs hatch in the gut and they give rise to larvae worm larvae that migrate through the lungs. They can cause wheezing and asthma and they migrate through the brain to cause cognitive disturbances developmental delays and seizures. And it’s actually quite common in the United States and people don’t know about it.

Now the other one is called neurocysticercosis. It's typically a household member who's got a tapeworm that is in the gastrointestinal tract and segments of the worm are dropping off that contain the eggs and then the eggs are released into the environment. Then the eggs get dispersed you swallow the eggs and the same kind of thing happens.

Once that larval tapeworm is in the brain while it's alive it's actually almost not even recognized by our immune system or inflammatory system. It's living but it's silent. And it's not really feeding on brain tissue … but it's living there. And as that worm exceeds this natural lifespan in the brain then it dies and as it’s dying it loses its ability to camouflage itself from the host immune system. And you start seeing inflammation around it. And that's what triggers the seizures. So neurocysticercosis basically produces a seizure disorder.

How do parasites migrate to the brain?

The [toxocara] larvae that hatch out of the eggs in the gastrointestinal tract penetrate the intestinal lining and eventually get swept through the blood circulation and probably get carried to the brain through the blood. And the larvae are just a few millimeters in length but they can cause mechanical damage and they also elicit inflammation. And that's been shown to lead to kids’ developmental delays and seizures as well as in adults can cause cognitive disturbances.



The [tapeworm] larvae again can go through the gut lining and then make their way through the blood circulation to the brain.

What are the symptoms of having a parasite in your brain?

Neurocysticercosis can be clinically silent for years. And then oftentimes the first presentation is having a seizure. With toxocara it's oftentimes more subtle: developmental delays cognitive disturbances sometimes seizures. And there you have to have a high index of suspicion to think about doing the blood test for it.

Can you take steps to avoid these two parasites?

One is to be cognizant of your surroundings and know if you're living in an area that's known to be endemic. Clearly handwashing is going to be very important as a preventative step. In the case of toxocariasis it's controlling the stray dog and cat problem and/or deworming stray dogs and cats.

What areas are endemic?

(For toxocara) Brazil is a big big-time problem. It’s more in the Southern United States. Although we even found it in the Bronx as well.



Neurocysticercosis we see it in the Southern United States and Texas Southern California even. And typically it's (tied to) having another person in the home with this adult tapeworm.

What is the treatment for brain parasites?

Toxocariasis is treated through several days of a specific drug that kills the worm called albendazole. For just neurocysticercosis you need a much longer course of albendazole.

(With neurocysticercosis) eventually that worm dies and it becomes calcified. But the problem is it can still continue to trigger seizures. So oftentimes people who have neurocysticercosis have to not only go on anticonvulsants but they sometimes require going on treatment for anticonvulsants for years afterwards even though it's a dead worm.

Can these infections impair cognitive function?

Both toxocariasis and neurocysticercosis cause cognitive impairments. The evidence for neurocysticercosis is not as clear-cut.

And how long would cognitive impairment last?

You know it's not as well-studied. There's so much focus on the seizures that people only started recently looking at cognitive impairment with neurocysticercosis. (With toxocariasis) it could be for years. And then the next question is could it produce permanent deficits? And the answer is potentially.

What else do I need to know?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL3N0ZXBoZW4tY29sYmVydC1tYXJ2ZWxzLWF0LXJvYmVydC1mLWtlbm5lZHktanJzLWJyYWluLXdvcm0tZGlhZ25vc2lz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stephen Colbert Marvels at RFK Jr.'s 'Brain Worm' Diagnosis,"“Let’s dig in” said The Late Show host Stephen Colbert at the start of his monologue “just like that worm did to RFK Jr.’s delicious frontal lobe.”

Colbert was responding to the news on Wednesday that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. once had a parasitic worm squirming around in his brain.

“Today The New York Times published some newly discovered health records for the independent presidential candidate” Colbert explained. “Turns out back in 2010 RFK Jr. went to a doctor because he was experiencing some cognitive symptoms like ‘memory loss and mental fogginess’ as well as a tiny voice in his head going ‘Let’s see what wine pairs best with cerebellum?”

For his impression of the worm Colbert chose the voice of Lowly from the ’90s cartoon The Busy World of Richard Scarry which received cheers of recognition from the audience.

It was a fitting reference given how the monologue was preceded by a cartoon clip called “The Amazing Adventures of Worm in Brain-Man” which parodied the Spider-Man theme song. “He’s got a worm in brain” the song goes “Insanity now explained!”

Colbert’s jokes at RFK Jr’s expense come after multiple monologues throughout the past year where he’s warned viewers not to trust (or vote for) the candidate. Colbert has criticized RFK Jr. for being a vaccine conspiracy theorist and for not even having the support of his own family.

Colbert summarized more of the Times’ reporting on the story explaining how “Bobby Jr. got a brain scan which showed an abnormality” which turned out to be the result of “a worm that got into RFK Jr.’s brain and ate a portion of it and then died.”

Colbert concluded “Cause of death? Starvation.”"

Since Halo however the Federal Circuit’s views on what ‘willful’ means lack consistency.”

On June 13 2016 the Supreme Court decided Halo Elecs. Inc. v. Pulse Elecs. Inc. addressing standards for recovery of enhanced damages for patent infringement pursuant to Section 284 of the Patent Act under which a “court may increase the damages up to three times the amount found or assessed.” In Halo the Supreme Court rejected damages-related requirements imposed by In re Seagate Tech. LLC a 2007 decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

With patentee litigants freed from what the Supreme Court called Seagate’s “inelastic constraints” in favor of a totality-of-circumstances approach a consensus developed that Halo would facilitate recovery of enhanced damages. Statistics suggest alignment with that view. The orange line in the graph below indicates that for completed post-Halo years 15 judgments for enhanced patent damages issued in each of 2017 and 2018 13 in 2019 and 14 in 2020. Those totals markedly exceed the 7 6 and 8 enhancement judgments reported for 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively.

Yet Halo generated new questions. How does one now plead a willful infringement claim? Did Halo resurrect opinions of counsel as a hedge against willfulness claims? If so how does that resurrection square with 35 U.S.C. § 298 which bars patentees from arguing that the absence of such opinions indicates willfulness? Recent post-Halo cases address such questions though courts remain divided on another question – whether post-suit knowledge can predicate a willfulness claim.

Halo’s Main Holdings

The Supreme Court disagreed with Seagate’s threshold requirement that the patentee prove “objectively reckless” conduct by the infringer which had allowed the infringer to escape a willfulness finding by advancing a reasonable defense at trial. The Court observed that Section 284 “contains no explicit limit or condition” on exercise of discretion by the trial court. It further faulted this Seagate requirement because “[t]he existence of such a defense insulates the infringer from enhanced damages even if he did not act on the basis of the defense or was even aware of it.” Thus the Court announced that subjective willfulness alone could predicate an award of enhanced damages with “culpability [ ] generally measured against the knowledge of the actor at the time of the challenged conduct.”

The Federal Circuit’s requirement (in Seagate and in preceding Federal Circuit decisions) that the patentee prove willfulness by clear and convincing evidence also troubled the Halo Court. The Court noted that Section 284 omits mention of any specific evidentiary burden. It continued: “[N]othing in historical practice supports a heightened standard.” The Court quoted its Octane Fitness decision concerning recovery of attorney’s fees under the Patent Act there stating that “patent-infringement litigation has always been governed by a preponderance of the evidence standard.” Added the Halo Court: “Enhanced damages are no exception.”

Halo “eschew[ed] any rigid formula for awarding enhanced damages under §284” but announced that “such punishment should generally be reserved for egregious cases typified by willful misconduct.”

Willfulness and Enhancement Analytical Frameworks Resulting from Halo

A patentee can now present a willfulness claim using a totality-of-the-circumstances approach under a preponderance evidentiary standard. Since Halo however the Federal Circuit’s views on what “willful” means lack consistency.

In SRI Int’l Inc. v. Cisco Sys. Inc. a 2019 opinion modified on other grounds the Federal Circuit remarked that a showing of willfulness under Halo requires the patentee to prove that the infringer committed misconduct that “rose to the level of wanton malicious and bad-faith behavior.” This requirement arguably stems from Halo’s characterization of enhanced damages under Section 284 “as a ‘punitive’ or ‘vindictive’ sanction for egregious infringement behavior.” Halo however did not define “willful” this narrowly.

the patentee to prove that the infringer committed misconduct that “rose to the level of wanton malicious and bad-faith behavior.” This requirement arguably stems from Halo’s characterization of enhanced damages under Section 284 “as a ‘punitive’ or ‘vindictive’ sanction for egregious infringement behavior.” Halo however did not define “willful” this narrowly. In Eko Brands LLC v. Adrian Rivera Maynez Enters. (2020) the Federal Circuit remarked: “Under Halo the concept of ‘willfulness’ requires a jury to find no more than deliberate or intentional infringement.” This quote reflects Halo more faithfully than does SRI and it harmonizes with a district court’s recent formulation of post-Halo willfulness pleading requirements (see block quote below).

In WBIP LLC v. Kohler Co. a post-Halo 2016 decision the Federal Circuit reiterated: “Knowledge of the patent alleged to be willfully infringed continues to be a prerequisite to enhanced damages.” The patentee’s “totality of the circumstances” evidence must therefore include proof of such knowledge. Such proof though meeting that prerequisite will not by itself establish willfulness (see Justice Breyer’s concurring opinion in Halo). In a post-SRI 2019 opinion the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware allowed patentees to establish knowledge by proving “willful blindness” distilling pleading requirements for seeking enhanced damages as follows:

And since the doctrine of willful blindness applies in patent cases see Global-Tech [Appliances Inc. v. SEB S.A.] 563 U.S. [754] 766 [(2011)] a willful infringement-based claim for enhanced damages survives a motion to dismiss if it alleges facts from which it can be plausibly inferred that the party accused of infringement (1) had knowledge of or was willfully blind to the existence of the asserted patent and (2) had knowledge of or was willfully blind to the fact that the party’s alleged conduct constituted induced or contributed to infringement of the asserted patent.

If the patentee’s willfulness claim survives pre-trial challenges then the finder of fact (i.e. the jury in jury cases) decides whether the infringement was willful. As an example of factors considered Eko evaluated a willfulness jury instruction telling the jury to “consider all the facts” that “may include but are not limited to”:

(1) Whether or not ARM intentionally copied a product of Eko that is covered by the Eko 855 patent;

(2) Whether or not ARM reasonably believed it did not infringe or that the patent was invalid;

(3) Whether or not ARM made a good-faith effort to avoid infringing the Eko 855 patent for example whether ARM attempted to design around the 855 patent; and

(4) Whether or not ARM tried to cover up its infringement.

The Eko litigants patterned the above jury instruction on the Federal Circuit Bar Association’s (“FCBA”) National Patent Jury Instructions (“NPJI”) No. 4.1 (now No. 3.10) for willful infringement. The Federal Circuit cautioned: “There is no claim that the FCBA model instructions are afforded special status nor could there be since these instructions have not been endorsed or approved by this court.” The Federal Circuit did not however criticize the portion of the jury instruction listing factors (1)-(4) above remarking that “the latter half of Jury Instruction 40 provides a list of facts that the jury could properly consider.” As a result the listing of factors in NPJI 3.10 should provide useful guidance to patentees as to what kinds of facts can viably support a willfulness claim.

If the fact-finder reaches a conclusion of willful infringement then upon a post-trial motion by the patentee for enhanced damages under Section 284 “the issue of punishment by enhancement is for the court and not the jury.” (Eko). Halo reiterated that a judge could even deny an award of enhanced damages altogether despite a fact-finder’s willfulness conclusion.

In exercising his/her discretion when undertaking an enhancement analysis a judge “consider[s] the particular circumstances of the case to determine whether it is egregious” as stated in Presidio Components Inc. v. Am. Tech. Ceramics Corp. (2017). Judges traditionally apply a 9-factor enhancement test first announced in 1992 by Read Corp. v. Portec Inc. though Presidio held that Halo did not require application of the Read factors. Nevertheless the Federal Circuit in Polara Eng’g Inc. v. Campbell Co. (2018) reiterated that the judge “‘is obligated to explain the basis for the award particularly where the maximum amount is imposed’” (quoting Read Corp.).

Renewed Relevance of Opinion Letters to Combat Willfulness Claims

Commentators including one in May 2017 hailing Halo as a “game changer” accurately observed that the Supreme Court’s rejection of Seagate restored the strategic importance of opinion letters in attempting to avoid enhanced damages. Subsequent decisions solidify that viewpoint.

In September 2017 on remand of the Halo case following the Supreme Court’s opinion the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada denied Halo’s motion for enhanced damages. It viewed two opinion letters of noninfringement and invalidity as “powerful evidence that Pulse was not intentionally infringing Halo’s patent.”

In Omega Patents LLC v. CalAmp Corp. (2019) the Federal Circuit left little room for doubt on the relevance of opinions of counsel in willfulness determinations declaring: “As to willfulness an accused infringer’s reliance on an opinion of counsel regarding noninfringement or invalidity of the asserted patent remains relevant to the infringer’s state of mind post-Halo.” However if the accused infringer knew of the asserted patent before the filing of the lawsuit any opinion may only be relevant if it was obtained at that time as the Federal Circuit added: “Bailey’s written opinions to CalAmp after the current suit was filed were appropriately excluded since they were not contemporaneous with the infringing activity.”

In C R Bard Inc. v. AngioDynamics Inc. (2020) the Federal Circuit stressed that an invalidity opinion while a relevant willfulness determination factor “was not dispositive and the question of whether [the accused infringer] reasonably believed that the asserted claims were invalid was a question of fact for the jury.”

Although an opinion of counsel once again factors in a willfulness determination the absence of such an opinion does not. Section 298 of the Patent Act provides:

The failure of an infringer to obtain the advice of counsel with respect to any allegedly infringed patent or the failure of the infringer to present such advice to the court or jury may not be used to prove that the accused infringer willfully infringed the patent or that the infringer intended to induce infringement of the patent.

In SRI the Federal Circuit characterized an accused infringer’s decision to not seek an opinion of counsel as “legally irrelevant under 35 U.S.C. § 298.” A 2020 district court decision echoing that quote refused to accord such facts any weight in opposition to a successful motion for summary judgment of no willful infringement.

As judicially recognized despite Section 298’s impact upon a fact-finder’s willfulness determination Section 298 does not bar a judge from considering the absence of an opinion of counsel in his/her enhancement determination. Post-Halo courts continue to regard such absence as relevant to Read factor #2 (“whether the infringer . . . investigated the scope of the patent and formed a good-faith belief that it was invalid or that it was not infringed”). For example en route to doubling damages awarded under Section 284 a 2018 district court decision (Alfred E. Mann) discussing that Read factor observed: “It is also undisputed that [the defendant] did not rely on the advice of counsel in developing a good-faith belief of non-infringement.”

Courts Split on Whether Post-Suit Knowledge Counts Toward Willfulness

In March 2021 the District of Delaware observed: “District courts across the country are divided over whether a defendant must have the knowledge necessary to sustain claims of indirect and willful infringement before the filing of the lawsuit” and that “[n]either the Federal Circuit nor the Supreme Court has addressed the issue.”

Since a court can consider a wider array of circumstances in enhancement determinations than in willfulness determinations (see the Halo remand) weighing post-suit activities in this context has apparently not spurred controversy. A late-2016 Northern District of New York decision as well as Alfred E. Mann assessed a Read factor focusing on “the duration of the misconduct” and held that “continuing to sell the infringing products after notice of infringement and during the course of litigation supports enhancement.”

As post-Halo jurisprudence continues to evolve it will be interesting to observe whether either the Federal Circuit or the Supreme Court will resolve the current split of authority on post-suit knowledge in willfulness determinations and whether we will continue to see judgments of enhanced damages at numbers remaining above pre-2017 levels.

At 11 a.m. Sunday Tug Manitou will arrive at the USS Cod hooking up to the 312-foot long submarine and transporting it on an 18-hour tow to Erie Pennsylvania for a drydock maintenance period.

You can watch the USS Cod depart from Cleveland in the player below:

During its service the USS Cod sank more than twelve enemy ships and was awarded seven battle stars before it officially arrived in Cleveland in July 1959.

USS Cod last departed out of Cleveland for drydocking in Lorain in 1963.

As soon as the USS Cod is in the open channel during her departure on Sunday the submarine will follow Navy traditions including a signal from the recently restored horn to announce departure and firing a deck gun salute to the city of Cleveland.

""When we take in the lines securing Cod to the pier the flag will be taken down at our stern and flown from the submarine's battle gaff or flag pole located on the mast"" said Cod's president Paul Farace. ""All Navy ships do this when they get underway... hopefully we will not be held in place by nearly 60 years of silt accumulation at our pier.""

Normally the USS Cod holds summer tours but that will be put on hold for the next six to eight weeks as the maintenance is conducted.

""We hate to leave our fans and supporters for even a day much less six weeks in our busy season but the 78-year-old sub needs some new steel at her water line and a new high-tech hull coating system furnished in partnership by another Cleveland institution Sherwin-Williams Paint Company"" Farace said.

The hull preservation and restoration work will take place in Erie Pennsylvania at the Donjon Shipbuilding Company and is estimated to cost around $1 million. A signification portion of the funds is being provided by the National Park Service's Save America's Treasures Program however most of the funds will come from the USS Cod's endowment which has been saved over the decades from tour fees and donations from citizens veterans and corporations.

As the USS Cod departs from her home in Cleveland a welcome home party is already being planned for her return in August.

Peanut butter has a long and interesting history. Evidence points to the Incas being the first people to grind peanuts and the first person who made peanut butter in the United States was John Harvey Kellogg who invented a form of it in 1895 (via National Peanut Board). Jif was born more than half a century later in 1958 (via Jif).

Of all of the peanut butter brands on the market Jif with its colorful and easily recognizable logo is one of the most widely known manufacturers of the creamy sticky lunch staple. A couple of years ago that logo made the internet have something of a meltdown when people on social media pointed out the fact that it looks quite similar right-side-up as it does upside down. A representative for J.M. Smucker the jam manufacturer that purchased the brand in 2002 indicated that this feature was unintentional (via Insider). Next time you decide to make yourself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich give your Jif jar a flip and decide whether that reversible logo really could have been done without trying.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Stardew Valley and Wargroove did the same with other Nintendo classics missing on PC to great success and indie game Beasts of Maravilla Island looks like a treat: it's an adventure game about exploring a strange and photographing its wildlife. It stood out to me on Saturday's Wholesome Games Direct and what do you know: it's actually out on Steam right now.

Game director Michelle Olson described Maravilla Island as ""a game about discovering extraordinary creatures learning their behaviors and most importantly photographing them."" But there's a bit more to it than some other photography games: you'll be solving puzzles as you go and climbing around the environment to find some well-hidden creatures.

Also there are birds that disguise themselves as bananas. That's a quality critter.

A few more features courtesy of the Steam page:

Includes over 50 extraordinary creatures and plants to photograph each with their own appearance and behavior such as the Sparkling Lamp lily the Maravillan Mango Kakapo and the Prism-Winged Butterfly.

Complete puzzles that rely on your cooperation with animals including playing hide and seek with an Otter Crocodile or helping a Bird Monkey find his perfect match.

When asked about family planning King confirmed at the time that Kirby is currently pregnant.

Chris Hemsworth who plays Thor in the MCU shared a picture of his ‘number one Chris’ in an Instagram post where he wished a happy birthday to Evans.

“Happy 40th birthday Chris Evans you’ll always be number 1 in my book” wrote the Australian star in the caption.

Except the image in the post wasn’t of Evans at all. It was Chris Pratt who is currently filming Thor: Love and Thunder alongside Hemsworth.

This little gag harkens back to a debate from a few months ago when Pratt’s Marvel friends rallied around the Guardians of the Galaxy actor after swathes of people named him as their least favourite Hollywood Chris mostly due to his supposed political leanings.

Hemsworth sly dig at Evans has already received more than 3 million likes at the time of writing and many comments thought his joke was hilarious.

“Nice one” wrote Rudhraksh Jaiswal who stars alongside Hemsworth in Netflix action movie Extraction. Another person said: “Man Chris have changed over the years.”

It remains to be seen what Evans will say in response but he’s never short of a witty reply on social media.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdlby50di9sYXRlc3QvMzU0ODQ2LWF5ZXphLWtoYW4tcHV0cy1uYXR1cmFsLWJlYXV0eS1vbi1kaXNwbGF5LWluLWxhdGVzdC1zbmFw0gFWaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2VvLnR2L2FtcC8zNTQ4NDYtYXllemEta2hhbi1wdXRzLW5hdHVyYWwtYmVhdXR5LW9uLWRpc3BsYXktaW4tbGF0ZXN0LXNuYXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ayeza Khan puts natural beauty on display in latest snap,"Ayeza Khan puts natural beauty on display in latest snap

The Chupke Chupke star took to the photo and video sharing platform to share a gorgeous snap of herself in a white button down which she accessorised with a chunky gold necklace.

She captioned the post with a simple could emoji most likely an ode to the recent cloudy weather in Karachi.

Needless to say fans couldn't help but compliment the star.

Chris Hemsworth is having some birthday fun with Chris Evans.

In honor of his Avengers costar's 40th birthday on Sunday Hemsworth 37 hilariously trolled Evans by sharing a heartfelt message alongside a photo of another Hollywood Chris.

""Happy 40th birthday Chris Evans you'll always be number 1 in my book 🎉🎉 @chrisevans"" Hemsworth wrote in the post which he paired with a photograph of Chris Pratt instead of Evans.

The photo shared by Hemsworth appears to be a behind-the-scenes shot from the forthcoming Thor: Love And Thunder film in which both Hemsworth and Pratt 41 are both set to reprise their Marvel roles.

As Schwarzenegger 73 popped into the chat he referred to Pratt as his Marvel costar before quickly correcting himself. ""Hello Chris Evans"" he said at the time. ""Not Chris Evans sorry. I've screwed up this whole thing right from the beginning. Chris Pratt.""

Pratt laughed at the entire ordeal as Schwarzenegger apologized. ""Sorry about that. I should know your name that's for sure - you're my favorite son-in-law"" Schwarzenegger said before Pratt quipped ""I'm your only son-in-law! I better be your favorite."""

Screenshot by ZDNet

Business travel is coming back.

I know this because I just saw a headline in the Wall Street Journal that read: ""Business travel is coming back.""

Then again Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky insists: ""Business travel as we know it has changed forever.""

I confess I recently took my first cross-country business trip for a very long time and concluded that the changes were slight. Other than the mask it all felt very normal.

Some airlines though had already raced ahead with changes long before the pandemic began. One that causes perhaps some of the more severe friction is the seatback screen.

American Airlines insists everyone should use their own device and stream content to their phones over a superb Wi-Fi connection. (Please continue dreaming. Life will be perfect one day.)

Delta on the other hand has pursued a strategy of seatback screens giving customers the freedom to use their devices for other things while watching their choice of horror action or miserable documentary.

United Airlines one of the most important for Silicon Valley as it's the dominant carrier in the Bay Area seemed firmly aligned with the idea of taking out seatback screens. Airlines believe it saves them money and that's far more important to them than say earning the passionate loyalty of customers.

I was taken aback therefore that United seems to have endured a change of heart. As The Points Guy reported United is unveiling new spiffily updated Boeing 737 Max 8 planes.

A seatmap slipped onto United's site just last week -- and soon disappeared -- and what is it we see there? Why the phrase: ""Seatback on-demand and personal device entertainment.""

Yes at every seat. Even the one at the very back right next to the toilet.

This is all disturbingly odd. After all United's Max 9 planes -- I flew them a couple of times pre-pandemic and they weren't exactly comfortable -- proudly forced passengers using their own technology to make their own entertainment.

Now though muttered rumors are sniffing that United will gasp retrofit some of its planes to return the seatback screens to their former perch.

Naturally I asked United why it might be undergoing such a radical volte-face. I received a tantalizing reply. A spokeswoman told me: ""We don't have anything to share on this right now. We will keep you posted.""

Some might translate this as: ""It was an oopsie to let it slip onto the website but yeah we're doing it.""

Many might think reversing course and adding screens inordinately wise.

Why force a family of five to each have their own device on the flight and ensure they're sufficiently charged for entertainment purposes? In any case many United planes don't have any power outlets in seats beyond First Class and Economy Plus. (And please don't tell me business travel is only performed in fancier seats.)

Why too force business travelers to use their own devices when sadly the majority get on the plane instantly open their laptops and pour over Excel spreadsheets for five hours?

At least give them the choice of being able to look up occasionally and watch a miserable documentary.

The idea of your personal device performing every needed function is quite popular currently. Why Apple wants you to use your iPhone to open your front door.

But if you're going to make people feel good in an extremely confined space -- and most planes these days offer precious little space at all -- why not use technology to make things easier for them not harder?

After all when you're reducing legroom putting in thinner seats and generally sardining passengers it's nice to give them something they like.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2FpcmxpbmUtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA2LzEyL2RlbHRhLWZsaWdodC1kaXZlcnRlZC1va2xhaG9tYS1hdGxhbnRhLWxhLXVucnVseS1wYXNzZW5nZXItZGV0YWluZWQtcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy1jcmV3Lzc2Njc5MTEwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta flight diverted after incident with off-duty flight attendant,"A Delta Air Lines flight was forced to divert Friday after an ""unruly passenger"" got ahold of the plane's public announcement system and told passengers to get back in their seats saying oxygen masks would deploy soon.

On Monday Delta spokesman Eric Zeugschmidt confirmed the passenger was an off-duty Delta flight attendant and inactive employee who had been on leave before the incident. Zeugschmidt said Delta is taking the matter very seriously and working with authorities to reach the employee's emergency contacts.

Over the weekend Zeugschmidt said crew and passengers helped detain the man on Delta Flight 1730 from Los Angeles to Atlanta and the aircraft landed “without incident"" in Oklahoma City where the man was taken into custody by law enforcement.

The plane arrived in Atlanta around 5:09 a.m. on Saturday four hours later than scheduled according to Delta's website.

“We apologize to our customers for the delay and any additional inconvenience this caused"" Zeugschmidt said via email.

The incident is just the latest in an uptick of unruly passengers which has forced a crackdown by the Federal Aviation Administration as travel volumes pick up. The Transportation Security Administration screened more than 2 million people for the first time since the onset of the pandemic on Friday.

Earlier this month a passenger on Delta flight from L.A. to Nashville reportedly tried to breach the cockpit forcing the plane to divert to New Mexico airport officials in Albuquerque said. And last month a Southwest Airlines flight attendant ended up in the hospital after a passenger punched her in the face.

Some airlines including Southwest and American have delayed plans to start selling alcoholic drinks in the wake of the high-profile incidents and calls by flight attendant unions to limit alcohol sales on board. Delta has been serving alcohol in regular economy since mid-April.

For those for feel cooped up and in need of a vacation CVG has it covered.

The Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport has been busy the past months with several announcements of new passenger carriers and nonstop destinations. Many flights that were halted due to the pandemic will also make their return.

News:New nonstop flights to Key West arrive at CVG Airport

In 2020 CVG only saw 40% of its pre-pandemic 2019 passenger traffic but they are already looking to begin their post-pandemic comeback.

In a May episode of our ""That's So Cincinnati"" podcast CVG CEO Candace McGraw said they expect to reach as high as 80% of their pre-pandemic passenger volume.

In June the airport reached 79% of its 2019 levels and July is expected to rise to 81% said Mindy Kershner CVG spokesperson.

News:American Airlines will start direct flights from Cincinnati to Austin; Phoenix to resume

Eager leisure travelers are responsible for much of that quick return. Corporate travel on the other hand may be slower to recover. Once that sector picks up McGraw told the Enquirer that even more carriers will resume their pre-pandemic flights.

Check out the recent additions from Key West to Minneapolis that bring CVG's offerings to a total of 12 carriers and 50 nonstop destinations.

Air Canada

Nonstop flights to Toronto are scheduled to restart on September 7 via Air Canada. This development is subject to change though depending on demand and any international travel restrictions Kershner said.

Alaska Airlines

Alaska Air is one of two new carriers coming to Cincinnati. Although the nonstop daily service to Seattle was supposed to begin pre-pandemic it launched in May 2021.

Allegiant Air

Allegiant Air's new biweekly nonstop flight to Key West Florida started June 9 at CVG. The fares for the Wednesday and Saturday flights can be as low as $59 although availability is not guaranteed.

American Airlines

There are several updated flight opportunities in store for American Airlines travelers this summer and fall. First the carrier's nonstop daily flights to Phoenix will relaunch on August 18. Second twice-daily non-stop flights to Austin are set to begin September 9. Lastly in April American Airlines announced a thrice-daily nonstop service to Boston starting November 2.

Delta Air Lines

Bonjour et bienvenue à Paris! On Sept. 8 Delta's nonstop daily flight to Paris is scheduled to resume Kershner said. As with Toronto the restart date is not set in stone. McGraw also hinted that pre-pandemic talks about a new international carrier coming to Cincinnati may be resuming in a May episode of ""That's So Cincinnati."" You heard it here first!

Southwest

The airline industry’s recovery from the pandemic passed a milestone as more than 2 million people streamed through U.S. airport security checkpoints on Friday for the first time since early March 2020.

The Transportation Security Administration announced Saturday that 2.03 million travelers were screened at airport checkpoints on Friday. It was the first time in 15 months that the number of security screenings has surpassed 2 million in a single day.

Airline bookings have been picking up since around February as more Americans were vaccinated against COVID-19 and – at least within the United States – travel restrictions such as mandatory quarantines began to ease.

The recovery is not complete. Friday's crowds were only 74% of the volume compared to the same day in 2019. However the 2.03 million figure was 1.5 million more travelers than the same day last year according to the TSA.

The 2-million mark represents quite a turnaround for the travel industry which was hammered by the pandemic. There were days in April 2020 when fewer than 100000 people boarded planes in the U.S. and the CEO of Boeing predicted that at least one major U.S. airline would go bankrupt.

Most of the airlines are still losing money. Southwest eked out a narrow first-quarter profit thanks to its share of $64 billion in federal pandemic relief to the industry and others are expected to follow suit later this year.

The fear of large-scale furloughs has lifted. United Airlines which lost $7 billion and threatened to furlough 13000 workers last fall told employees this week that their jobs are secure even when the federal money runs out in October.

That's because airlines like United are upbeat about salvaging the peak summer vacation season. International travel and business trips are still deeply depressed but domestic leisure travel is roughly back to pre-pandemic levels airline officials say.

The airlines are recalling employees from voluntary leave and planning to hire small numbers of pilots and other workers later this year.

Hotel operators say they too have seen bookings improve as vaccination rates rise.

Mike Gathright a senior vice president at Hilton said the company's hotels were 93% full over the Memorial Day weekend. He said the company is “very optimistic” about leisure travel over the summer and a pickup in business travel this fall.

“The vaccine distribution the relaxed travel restrictions consumer confidence — all of that is driving occupancy and improvement in our business” Gathright said.

Prior to the pandemic TSA screened on average 2 million to 2.5 million travelers per day. The lowest screening volume during the pandemic was on April 13 2020 when just 87534 individuals were screened at airport security checkpoints.

By the middle of last month TSA's average daily volume for screenings was approximately 65% of pre-pandemic levels.

As the summer travel season approaches TSA is advising passengers to arrive at the airport with sufficient time to accommodate increased screening time as traveler volumes are expected to approach and in some cases exceed pre-pandemic levels at certain airports."

Stanley Black & Decker Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $0.56 expectations were $0.55. Stanley Black & Decker Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange you may begin.

Dennis Lange: Thank you Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 first quarter webcast. Here today in addition to myself is Don Allan President and CEO; Chris Nelson COO EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning Don Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.

And as we normally do we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO Don Allan.

Don Allan: Thank you Dennis and good morning everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy. We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022.

Story continues

Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results. Specifically we have captured 1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024 consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations. We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months.

As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20% which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business. We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as widebody plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.

We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023 ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award. Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.

Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29% up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50 up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. On April 1 we completed the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet. Looking forward in 2024 we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.

I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.

Chris Nelson: Thank you Don and good morning everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor first quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion down 1% organically versus prior year as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand which pressured volume. Pricing was relatively flat consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Now turning to the product lines.

Power tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand. Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data which showed an early start to the season versus prior year. We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last two years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory which pressured shipments in the quarter.

We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the UK.

We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America Brazil Mexico Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary for Tools & Outdoor we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands market activation and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to the long-term shareholder returns.

I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure. Within the Industrial segment Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening. Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1% an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity.

A toolbox filled with an array of different tools representing the professional products of the company.

This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.

DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site. Additionally our TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive.

We believe these innovations coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT Craftsman and STANLEY. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.

Pat Hallinan: Thanks Chris and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately 145 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the period bringing our aggregate savings to approximately 1.2 billion since program inception. As we focus our portfolio streamline our business structure and transform our operations our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.

Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming which are more event-driven will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.

We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025. And -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter which affected five sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year. Regarding product platforming this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.

In aggregate our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024 improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately 360 million where we've traditionally averaged a roughly 700 million increase in the first quarter of the year.

Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024 we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives.

These items combined with organic cash generation support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent investing in organic growth and our transformation funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024 and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year.

We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.

Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024.

These are designed to accelerate innovation market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley brands. This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.

Our adjusted EPS range remains $1 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely relating to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024 with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.

Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25% with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile. In summary we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion cash generation balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don.

Don Allan: Thank you Pat. As we report another quarter of progress our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands particularly DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2x to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening. We are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. With that we are now ready for Q&A Dennis.

Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks Don. Shannon we can now start the Q&A please. Thank you.

Starbucks is being renovated while Blenz Bowls and Cheese Louise are introducing new dine-in locations.

Starbucks

The Starbucks located on the first floor of the Ferg is being renovated and manager Kacie Smith said it’s the location’s biggest renovation yet.

“We’ll have brand new espresso machines nitro cold brew and mobile ordering” Smith said. “It’ll still be one of the biggest Starbucks lobbies you’ll find on a college campus.”

Smith said she hopes the additions to the store will help the Ferg Starbucks compete with the location on Paul Bryant Drive.

“As of right now there will not be another Starbucks on campus that will have all the equipment we have” Smith said. “So we’re actually going to be a step ahead of Bryant this semester.”

She said the convenience of mobile ordering will increase accessibility and reduce order time.

Aiden Mathes a senior majoring in communicative disorders who works at the Ferg Starbucks said she’s excited but nervous about the grand opening.

“It should make the Starbucks busier but it should help the lines better” Mathes said. “I think a problem with the [Bryant] Starbucks right now is it’s cafe only…Bryant has the drive through though and we can’t really have one.”

Currently a Starbucks pop-up kiosk that offers a limited menu is located on the second floor of the Ferg by the student help desk. Smith said the kiosk will be removed once the renovations downstairs are completed which she anticipates happening before the fall semester.

The chain has a back-up plan in case the renovation goes off-track.

“This kiosk will be here up until that store is up and running” Smith said. “So even if we don’t make it to that first day of school this will still be here.”

Smith said she hopes the renovation as well as the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions will allow the Ferg Starbucks to host in-person events like poetry nights.

Blenz Bowls

As the renovations at Starbucks continue one local chain has introduced a location at the Ferg.

Blenz Bowls was launched in 2018 by two UA alumni Zac Rogers and Riley Voce. The food truck serves smoothies and acai bowls across campus. Almost three years after its debut the company has its own location at the Ferg.

Its new location is an addition to its food truck services.

Emma Claire Cohen a UA junior majoring in business who started working for Blenz Bowls in August 2020 said she believes the new location will be great for a large demographic of their customers: freshmen.

“I think it’s so cool that we were able to [be established] in the Ferg because freshmen love Blenz and mostly come to the Ferg to eat” Cohen said.

Cheese Louise

Topio’s a long-standing pizza parlor fell from the Ferg’s restaurant lineup last year. It was located across from Chick-fil-A.

After closing for most of the spring semester the restaurant has been replaced by a Cheese Louise dining location.

Cheese Louise is a food truck business that offers a variety of grilled cheese sandwiches. Aside from its signature classic the menu features the Yellowhammer the Godfather and a toasted peanut butter and jelly option.

The Ferg location is not a replacement for its food truck services. Cheese Louise’s Ferg location is open Monday through Thursday between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.

Food truck schedules for Blenz Bowls and Cheese Louise can be found on the Bama Dining website.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL2ZpbmNoYW5uZWwuY29tL3N0YXJidWNrcy1icmluZ3MtYmFjay1wZXJzb25hbC1yZXVzYWJsZS1jdXBzLXRvLXN0YXJidWNrcy1jYWZlcy1pbi10aGUtdS1zLzgwODczL2NvcnBvcmF0ZS1zb2NpYWwtcmVzcG9uc2liaWxpdHkvMjAyMS8wNi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks brings back personal reusable cups to Starbucks cafes in the U.S.,"The FINANCIAL — Personal reusable cups return to Starbucks stores in the U.S. on June 22. Customer adoption of reusable cups is one part of Starbucks ongoing commitment to reduce single-use cup waste and goal to reduce waste by 50% by 2030 Starbucks notes.

Beginning June 22 Starbucks is safely reintroducing personal reusable cups across company operated stores in the U.S.

As part of Starbucks ongoing commitment to prioritizing partner and customer safety the company developed a completely contactless new method – eliminating any shared touch points between the customer and Starbucks partners (baristas).

Bringing back personal reusable cups is a key part of Starbucks ongoing commitment to reduce single-use cup waste and goal to reduce waste by 50% by 2030. At Starbucks pre-COVID 80% of beverages are enjoyed on the go. To encourage customers to choose reusable and reduce single-use cup waste Starbucks will continue offering customers a $.10 discount on their beverage of choice.

Starbucks held extensive trials and has adopted this new process using a ceramic mug to transport the reusable cup through the bar in EMEA and Asia Pacific to reintroduce reusable cups with confidence.

Only clean cups will be accepted; Starbucks partners will not be able to clean them for customers. In addition the company is currently testing safe options for allowing personal reusable cups via the drive thru but for now personal reusable cups will only be accepted in stores. Starbucks will also be reinstating For Here Ware for customers who choose to enjoy their food and beverages in-store where indoor dining is available.

How it works

Cleanliness of cup is checked by your barista retain your lid

Efforts to reduce single-use cup waste is not new to Starbucks. We have offered the option for customers to enjoy their beverage in For Here Ware or to BYOC (bring your own cup) for a discount since the 1980s. And yet the majority of our beverages in the U.S. are served in single-use cups with only a small amount being recycled or composted due to waste processing infrastructure limitations according to Starbucks.

Starbucks continues to explore scalable options to reduce single-use cup waste and has acted through powerful partnerships – including our work with Closed Loop Partners and their NextGen Consortium and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy Global Commitment – to research and test solutions that will make our cups lids and straws easier to recycle and compost. This complements our work with municipalities to improve recycling and composting infrastructure.

Starbucks continues to make progress against this goal around the world. Earlier this month Starbucks EMEA announced they will offer a reusable cup share program in all Europe Middle East and Africa stores by 2025. In July Starbucks South Korea will launch Borrow a Cup program in stores and recently committed to eliminating single-use cups by 2025.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2NvZmZlZS1jaGFpbi1zdGFyYnVja3MtYXBwbGllcy1mb3ItbmFtaW5nLXJpZ2h0cy13aXRoLXVzLXRyYWRlbWFyay1vZmZpY2UtMTIxMDYxMjAwMDA5XzEuaHRtbNIBmQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9jb2ZmZWUtY2hhaW4tc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWFwcGxpZXMtZm9yLW5hbWluZy1yaWdodHMtd2l0aC11cy10cmFkZW1hcmstb2ZmaWNlLTEyMTA2MTIwMDAwOV8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coffee chain Starbucks applies for naming rights with US trademark office,"By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) -Starbucks Corp has applied with the U.S. trademark office for the right to use its name on a sports stadium or training facility.

In a June 2 application the coffee chain sought approval to use its name in ""providing stadium and training facilities for sports and entertainment activities"" and ""promoting business sports and entertainment events of others.""

Approval could enable Seattle-based Starbucks to join companies such as AT&T Bank of America Canadian Tire FedEx Oracle PPG Paints Target Toyota and United Airlines whose names already adorn professional stadiums and arenas.

""Either it is actively looking to make a deal to sponsor a venue or it wants to protect its right to potentially use its name in that manner"" said Ashley Dobbs a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia who specializes in intellectual property.

Starbucks declined to comment.

Naming rights agreements often run for decades and can cost several or tens of millions of dollars annually.

Amazon.com Inc took a different path from most corporate sponsors when it named an arena in downtown Seattle the Climate Pledge Arena.

That building will house the Seattle Kraken expansion team in the National Hockey League and the Seattle Storm of the Women's National Basketball Association.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office plans by early September to assign a lawyer to review Starbucks' application.

If the office has no objection Starbucks will have six months to show it is using its mark in commerce. The company may apply for extensions.

The most criticised of all season 8 was said to be the worst finale that any show as magnum opus as GoT would get. Not to forget there were demands of remaking the final season. What added to the already existing heated fire was that one coffee cup yes that damn cup and Emilia Clarke aka The Dragon Mother has decided to reveal who’s property it was once again.

If you haven’t already noticed or heard there was literally a coffee mug which is allegedly a Starbucks one was spotted in the episode Last Of Starks when all the living were celebrating their victory over the dead. Now we all know coffee wasn’t the choice of drink for the people in Westeros and Starbuck definitely doesn’t date back that long ago. So clearly this was a goof-up no one will ever forgive the makers for. Emilia Clarke now says the mug belonged to creator Dan Weiss. Read on to know more about the same.

Emilia Clarke aka Daenerys Targaryen aka The Dragon Mother from Game Of Thrones was again asked about the coffee mug goof up as it was right in front of her in the scene. As per Comicbook this time around she said it belonged to showrunner Dan Weiss and wasn’t hers. Clarke said “It’s not Starbucks spoiler” Clarke said. “I’m going to say it again for the record: was not mine. Looking at you Dan Weiss.”

Meanwhile in the past the Game Of Thrones actor on The Jimmy Fallon Show had said that the cup belonged to Conleth Hill who plays Varys on the show. Emilia Clarke said “Here’s the truth We had like a party before the Emmys recently and Conleth [Hill] who plays Varys who’s sitting next to me in that scene he pulls me aside and he’s like ‘Emilia I’ve got to tell you something. I’ve got to tell you something love. The coffee cup was mine!’ It was his! It was Conleth’s coffee cup. He said so.”

Emilia Clarke explained why Conleth Hill did not come forward all this while. “He’s like ‘I think so I’m sorry darling I didn’t want to say anything because it seemed [like] the heat was very much on you'” she says. “And I was like ‘What?!’” Clarke said.

The Indianapolis businessman couldn’t help but notice there was a perfectly good office building on the site. Having formerly moved buildings for a living he got an idea.

Several months later the building is now off its foundation and atop an arrangement of steal beams and hydraulic jacks. Soon a network of integrated dollies will take the structure down the block and around the corner where it will be part of a larger planned business development.

The building formerly housed F.C. Tucker Company’s Greenfield real estate office which finished moving into its new location at 928 N. State St. last month. Work on a new Crew Carwash will begin after the building is moved.

After his doctor’s appointment Van Treese and his wife Joyce visited Greenfield to look at available sites and consider potential routes for getting the two-story approximately 70-by-68-foot building there. When they came to the empty lot at 1615 Fields Boulevard Van Treese saw a sign for local RE/MAX agent Mark Dudley with whom he’s worked in the past.

“I knew Mark would fight for me in order to do my project because he knew my background of moving buildings” Van Treese said.

Not long after that he reached out to Crew Carwash about his idea and eventually received the go-ahead to move the building.

“It was very well built” Van Treese said of the structure which was constructed in 1997.

He and his longtime business partner Keith Matthews have enlisted the services of Wolfe House & Building Movers a company based in Bernville Pennsylvania with outlets across the country including northern Indiana.

“They’re pros” Van Treese said. “They got the really nice equipment.”

Devin Hirt an estimator with Wolfe’s Indiana team said jobs generally begin by digging and trenching under buildings to get a system of steel I-beams hydraulic jacks and cribbing blocks underneath to raise the structure. Once it’s ready to go dollies will be added that are coordinated together and steered remotely via Wolfe’s patented technology.

“It’s a really good system” Hirt said. “We don’t pull it with a truck. It’s smooth. There’s no jerking motion just a smooth move.”

The contractor will slowly roll the approximately 800000-pound building about 700 feet south down State Street before turning west onto West McClarnon Drive and on to the destination off Fields Boulevard where it will be set on its new foundation. The job is slated for 2 a.m. so as not to disturb traffic too much on a date to be determined. Van Treese hopes for the trip to take about two hours.

Initially the route was planned to be a much shorter distance by heading south down Muskegon Lane and then between Big Lots and the drainage pond to the store’s north before reaching the site. Big Lots would only give permission to go in front of the store however which changed the route to south down Muskegon Lane and onto West McClarnon Drive. That would have required cutting through the parking lot of the property housing Miller’s Jewelry Greenfield Shoe Repair and Tyner Pond Farm Store whose owner didn’t grant permission.

Sherry Haines manager of Miller’s Jewelry and whose family owns the property said their insurance company advised the risk was too great particularly to the parking lot and underground gas line nearby.

“I think it’s a great idea to be able to re-purpose that building for something else” Haines said. “We’re all for bettering our community and seeing Greenfield grow but it was just too much of a risk determined by our insurance. We not only own the business but we also own this building. We had to look at what was in our best interest and what was in the best interest of our tenants.”

When Van Treese initially started mulling paths one that included State Street was furthest from his mind.

“The reason I didn’t pick this route first was because of the construction going on” Van Treese said referring to the work on State Street that began this spring. “We didn’t know how long it was going to take them to get the median in and I knew there was no way the state was going to give me a permit to move this 700-foot stretch while they were doing this construction.”

The median is in now and won’t be an obstacle during the move Van Treese said.

He added he’s grateful for Crew Carwash’s patience as a route was settled and for allowing for the opportunity to prevent the building from going to waste.

A set of power lines that cross over State Street will have to temporarily come down to allow the building through as well as another set over McClarnon Drive. Wires holding a sign over State Street and two of the traffic light setups at State Street and McClarnon Drive will have to temporarily come down as well.

Van Treese said steel plates will be placed atop areas over underground utilities that the building will be traveling on as well as over the sidewalks along McClarnon Drive which will need to be crossed to get to the destination.

Once the building is at its new address Van Treese plans to seek a tenant or tenants for the building. He also plans to pursue adding another building of about 30000 square feet available for small businesses to rent office and warehousing space. The development will be called the Fields Business District.

Van Treese is thankful for all the help he’s received throughout the endeavor including from Philip Going of Acura Land Surveying and Bill Kershaw who did the new location’s foundation.

“The reason this whole project happened is because of relationships” he said."

In this generation Intel’s newest processors offer a lot more for single-socket systems and Supermicro is taking advantage of the advancement. At the same time this is designed to be a “cost-optimized” platform for Supermicro while retaining expandability due to its WIO design. If “WIO” is not recognizable we will show why this is important in our review.

Supermicro SYS-510P-WTR Overview

As we have been doing recently we are going to split our review into the external overview followed by the internal overview section to aid in navigation around the platform.

Supermicro SYS-510P-WTR External Overview

The system itself is a 1U server that is 25.6″ or 650mm deep. Practically that makes the server short enough that it will fit into almost any rack. At the same time it is also deeper than the very short-depth platforms so we still get a lot of expandability.

Starting with the front of the system we get four 3.5″ hot-swap bays. These may be 3.5″ bays that one immediately may think of as being designed for hard drives. While the bays themselves can handle SATA and SAS3 (with a SAS HBA/ RAID controller installed) they can also take NVMe SSDs by installing optional NVMe cables.

On the rear of the system we have a number of features. First we have the redundant 500W 80Plus Platinum power supplies. Those will work for the single-socket platform since we do not have a second high-power CPU.

The rear I/O is a serial port a dedicated IPMI port two USB 2.0 and two USB 3.2 Gen1 ports. There is also a legacy VGA port.

On the rear of the system the two RJ45 LAN ports are actually dual 10Gbase-T ports. Using the Intel X550 controller we get 10GbE built-in.

Something we will quickly note is that the rear expansion slots are relatively plentiful for a 1U short-depth system. There are two full height/ length slots that are PCIe Gen4 x16. We also get a PCIe Gen4 x16 low profile slot.

Two quick items of note here. In the previous generation we would have been limited to PCIe Gen3 on these slots so we get around twice the bandwidth. Also 3 x16= 48 PCIe lanes which is the total amount one has available on a second-generation Intel Xeon Scalable platform. With the newer 3rd generation Ice Lake platform we have enough PCIe lanes to drive this type of configuration whether it is for 100GbE/ 200GbE NICs DPUs accelerators or even for external storage controllers.

Next we are going to get to the internal overview where we will see what is inside and even how Supermicro is able to fit all of those expansion slots.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Pallas Foods founded in Co. Limerick has completed a major revamp of the company this week.

The Food services company founded by the Geary Family in Newcastle West in the 1980s is now officially called Sysco Ireland.

Sysco first acquired Pallas Foods in 2009 and has since expanded nationwide with an €8m upgrade of the Newcastle West facility recently.

CEO of Sysco Peter Jackson explains why now was the right time to complete the migration.

This word strikes fear in Colorado. Our state is facing its worst fire season ever. This summer may be as dangerous as any we have faced and we are all in a hypervigilant state to prevent fires. Compounding the threat is the unprecedented proliferation of 5G cell towers.

According to Tony P. Simmons P. E. an electrical engineer who is a subject matter expert on electrical safety in California and Nevada “Many people are not aware that electrical equipment including all cell towers and 5G small cell sites pose a fire threat that must be mitigated by a recognized electrical fire safety expert. Every electrical device is going to fail at some point. The goal is to ensure that failures do not imperil life health and property.”

Three fires in California have been started either in part or in whole by telecommunications equipment failures: Silverado Woolsey and Malibu Canyon.

The cause of the 2020 Silverado Fire appears to be shared responsibility between Southern California Edison (SCE) and telecom giant T-Mobile. SCE admits the fire started at the location of one of its utility poles but has pointed its finger at T-Mobile for the failure of a telecommunications lashing wire on an SCE utility pole as the suspected cause.

In 2018 a lashing wire belonging to an unknown carrier appears to have been the cause of at least one of two ignition points for the Woolsey Fire which destroyed over 400 homes in Malibu and caused residents to flee into the ocean because the three routes of exit out of the city were blocked by traffic and fire. The carrier at this point is unknown because the Woolsey Fire remains under criminal investigation. Over $6 billion in damages was inflicted before the fire was finally extinguished. SCE and the telecom that owned the lashing wire have shared responsibility for the Woolsey inferno.





The 2007 Malibu Canyon Fire was caused by the failure of an SCE utility pole that was overloaded with telecom equipment owned by AT&T Verizon and Sprint (now T-Mobile). These four and NextG now owned by telecom infrastructure builder Crown Castle International Inc. was accused of misleading investigators and eventually settled with the California Public Utilities Commission for over $60 million.

5G TALK Tom Lankering and Kathleen Fors are writing a monthly series on 5G for The Aspen Times; the next installment on July 11.Their previous installments can be found here: April: History of 5G and what people should know May: People deserve to know about the health effects of 5G and EMFs

Cell tower fires are infrequent but devastating when they do occur. Susan Foster writer and honorary firefighter with the San Diego Fire Department who now lives in Colorado told us in an interview that “electrical fires cannot be fought through conventional means until the power has been cut. Firefighters or anyone else trying to put water on an energized cell tower fire will be electrocuted.

“Imagine this scenario” Foster explains “a cell tower catches on fire with winds gusting at 50 miles an hour. This fire is going to spread until the utility cuts the power and that can take between 10 minutes and one hour.” Foster cautions cities to establish residential setbacks from all wireless installations so that people have time to escape in the event of a fire.

To regulate the design of cell sites to protect the public from electrical hazards Cellular installations must be viewed for what they are: electrical installations.

“Frankly the promise of 5G is hype and the fire danger of having cell towers close to our homes schools and places of business can have devastating consequences” Foster says. “Electric fire safety experts were not involved in the 5G mandate but telecom executives and attorneys were. They had different priorities. I want my family to be safe. Telecom wants their market share to increase.”

We have witnessed how fast and uncontrollable a fire can spread not only with the fires we had in Basalt and Glenwood Springs but also in other areas in Colorado. We have no desire for the “promise of 5G” to add to the existing fire risks our state already faces.

The April 2021 recall of 2.5 million hotspots by Verizon due to fire risks and the recent collapse of an AT&T cell tower due to electric arcing on a high school campus in Chula Vista California demonstrates that it is irresponsible for local governments to trust the engineering of the telecom companies. The most effective way to protect Colorado from wildfires caused by telecommunication equipment is to regulate the design of a cell site with the same rigor most cities already require from their building officials but did not realize they had the right to demand of telecoms.

But in the face of a historic drought it's important to understand what we can as we think about how we use water in our homes businesses farms ranches and public spaces.

READ: Water restrictions long-term solutions contemplated in Utah drought emergency

First thing to understand: if you live in any of the American Southwest's big metropolitan areas including Utah's Wasatch Front you rely on the Colorado River.

That's not obvious at first blush.

Wasatch Fronters look to the magnificent mountains rising above their homes and it's understandable to assume the water comes from there.

Some of it does.

But more of it comes from the Uinta Mountains — far from any big city.

Those of us old enough to have been in Utah when some reservoirs like Strawberry and Jordanelle were completed have a sense of what the Central Utah Project (CUP) is but even we might not think too much about its relation to the Colorado River.

So here are the basics: the Wasatch Mountains contribute crucial water to the Wasatch Front but the current population of nearly three million people from North Ogden to Spanish Fork could not be sustained on water from the Wasatch Mountains.

WATCH: Students work to save water during Utah drought

The Central Utah Project created the dams tunnels and aqueducts that run water from the Uintas to Salt Lake and Utah counties — UNDER the Wasatch Mountains.

Still it's not so obvious we're talking about Colorado River water because the Colorado enters Utah far south of any portion of the CUP.

Here's the thing: a river isn't one thing. It's a merger.

Like corporations when two rivers join they take the bigger river's name. A lot of Sprint cell phone customers are slowly learning they are now T-Mobile customers after a merger.

The Green River is Sprint to the Colorado River's T-Mobile.

The snowmelt from the Uintas joins with snowmelt from the Wind Rivers in Idaho and to make the Green the second biggest waterway in the Southwest. Then the Green meets the Colorado in Canyonlands National Park a handshake and a stock swap and the Colorado becomes its fully united corporate titan self.

Of course like T-Mobile the Colorado is still a scrappy stream compared to the Mississippi and Columbia Rivers (think AT&T and Verizon) of the world.

OK let's leave that tortured metaphor and mention that Utah's 2nd biggest concentration of population is in Washington County quenched by the water of the Virgin River. And that's a Colorado River tributary too!

So two for two so far Utahns rely on the Colorado.

But it won't be three for three because Cache Valley has a river that actually runs through it (sorry to the Jordan and Provo but we all know those are creeks in any non-arid place right?).

Cache Valley has the Bear River which carves its own path through its corner of the world from the north slopes of the Uintas saying hi to Wyoming and Idaho up north before turning south in a slow slog through northern Utah to the Great Salt Lake. It's the longest river in America that doesn't end up in an ocean and the Great Salt Lake relies on it for about two thirds of its water.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbGFzdmVnYXNzdW4uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMS9qdW4vMTMvZ29sZGVuLWtuaWdodHMtYWdncmVzc2l2ZS1yb3N0ZXItYnVpbGRpbmctYWdhaW4taGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Golden Knights' aggressive roster-building again has them in Stanley Cup semifinals,"Golden Knights’ aggressive roster-building again has them in Stanley Cup semifinals

There was a magic to the Golden Knights’ inaugural season that may never be recaptured in sports.

With the exception of Marc-Andre Fleury in net there weren’t too many stars on the rag-tag group of “Golden Misfits” that captured the hearts of Las Vegas and the hockey world.

The thing about a magical season is that it’s hard to do again.

The Golden Knights haven’t been back to Stanley Cup Final but they’ve twice reached the semifinals where they host Montreal Monday in the third round playoff series at T-Mobile Arena.

The Golden Knights didn’t sit on their first-year laurels and instead went out and acquired one big name after another to load up an already-strong roster. They’ve never been afraid to make a splashy move and it has them once again eight wins away from winning the Cup.

“In that season most guys had their best career (year) ever right?” Fleury said. “From there on I thought we had a good core and we were able to get some experienced guys some guys to help in the next years after that had a huge impact on our team since they debuted with us.”

Fleury was the face of the 2017-18 team and several players — William Karlsson Jonathan Marchessault and Reilly Smith — enjoyed breakout campaigns.

But that initial Golden Knights squad did feature some good players even if they weren’t necessarily all-stars. James Neal came with more than 200 career goals to his name. David Perron was a consistent 40-point player. Even Tomas Tatar came with a strong pedigree when he came over at the trade deadline.

Neal and Perron both left to free agency and while some would have elected to tinker around the edges with a team that was close to a title the Golden Knights went hard in the other direction.

They signed Paul Stastny and traded for Montreal captain Max Pacioretty.

They were just getting started with significant acquisitions dealing for eventual captain Mark Stone minutes before the 2019 trade deadline and signing him to an eight-year contract extension.

He is the best skater the Golden Knights have ever acquired and the move established them as a Stanley Cup contender for years to come.

“From the time we added Mark Stone that really to me moved us from being a nice story to being a contender” general manager Kelly McCrimmon said.

The Golden Knights didn’t slow down after that acquiring Robin Lehner and Alec Martinez at the next trade deadline both of whom played key roles in helping the Golden Knights reach the 2020 conference final. Vegas lost that series and never satisfied pulled off another Stone-level splash with the signing of Alex Pietrangelo in October.

The Golden Knights do have players like Karlsson Alex Tuch Shea Theodore and others who while not homegrown in the traditional sense established themselves as NHL regulars once they came to Vegas. Look no further than the Game 5 overtime winner though — Stone from Pacioretty and Pietrangelo — as evidence that star power is a major key to postseason success.

“We’ve had a lot of situations in our four years where it would have been easy and justifiable to do nothing and we’ve never approached it that way” McCrimmon said. “We think we know what a championship team needs to look like what’s required. It’s involved making hard decisions along the way which again aren’t easy.

“If we just did what was easy we wouldn’t be sitting here today having beaten the Colorado Avalanche.”

In a sport with a hard salary cap getting players like that costs money. Stone ($9.5 million) Pietrangelo ($8.8 million) and Pacioretty ($7 million tied with Fleury) have the highest cap hits on the team so when they come in other players have to go out. Since the end of the 2018-19 season Vegas has dealt away Erik Haula Colin Miller Nikita Gusev Cody Eakin Nate Schmidt and Stastny in moves spurred by the cap.

It’s the cost of dealing in high-talent and high-priced players but the Golden Knights’ mere presence in the semifinals speaks to its effectiveness.

After all letting those top players walk out the door hurts a team arguably as much acquiring them helps it.

Vegas coach Pete DeBoer remembers what losing captain Zach Parise did to the 2012-13 Devils who went from the Stanley Cup Final the previous year to missing the playoffs the next. Ditto when he was in Florida and Jay Bouwmeester left. Joe Pavelski left the Sharks after the 2018-19 season and DeBoer was fired two months into the season.

“The addition of one great player like that to anybody’s team makes a huge difference or the subtraction of one great player” DeBoer said. “The right player and those types of players change the trajectory of your franchise.”

Some players are harder to lose than others — the Golden Knights’ angst at trading Schmidt to make room for Pietrangelo was obvious. But Vegas has also done a good job of honing in on the players it believes can help deliver a Cup and locking them up. For instance Stone Karlsson and Pietrangelo are all signed for six more years after this one while Pacioretty was handed a four-year extension the day he arrived.

The Golden Knights have never failed to acquire a star player when they have the chance. It makes for an interesting team to follow in the offseason and the trade deadline but also a fun one for fans to cheer for knowing how singularly focused the front office is on bringing the Cup to the Strip.

“Management has done it time and time again where they try pretty much to pick up the best player available whenever they get the opportunity to do that” forward Reilly Smith said. “We’ve always had a winning mentality here and I don’t see that changing any time soon.”"
TROW,T Rowe Price,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzEzL2lzLWludmVzY28tdGhlLXZhbHVlLXN0b2NrLWZvci15b3Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Invesco the Value Stock for You?,"The asset manager has seen its stock price rise soar in 2021 but it may still have room to run.

Asset management firm Invesco (IVZ 0.74%) doesnʻt get the same attention given to some of its peers but over the past decade it has quietly gained market share from them. The company has had a breakout year so far with its stock price up 68% year to date through Friday's close beating its major competitors including BlackRock and T. Rowe Price.

While Invesco has enjoyed a great run this year it is still available at a very favorable valuation. Let's take a closer look at this company to see if it's the right value stock for you.

Growing market share through ETFs

Invesco has steadily gained market share over the past decade. At the end of 2009 it was the 35th-largest asset manager and by the end of 2017 it was up to No. 25. At the end of this year's first quarter Invesco had grown to be the 16th-largest with about $1.4 trillion in assets under management.

Invesco's gains have largely been driven by its success with exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs have enjoyed a meteoric rise over the past decade and are expected to grow exponentially over the next decade. Currently there's more than $5 trillion in ETF assets in the U.S. and some estimates suggest it could grow tenfold to $50 trillion by 2030.

As the fourth-largest manager of ETF assets Invesco is in prime position to grow with the market. At the end of 2020 it had about $294 billion in ETF assets behind only BlackRock Vanguard and State Street. Its Invesco QQQ ETF is one of the largest and fastest-growing on the market. It is the fifth-largest ETF with $160 billion in assets and in 2020 had the fourth-most net inflows with $16.7 billion coming into the fund. The QQQ is a household name among investors mainly because of its superior performance. Through March 31 the QQQ had a five-year annualized return of 25% and a 10-year annualized return of 20%.

Invesco had a strong first quarter with a record $24.5 billion in net inflows led by its ETFs which had $16.8 billion in net inflows. This drove net revenues 9.2% higher year over year to $1.25 billion and net income 104% higher to $316 million or $0.68 per share.

Low valuation and M&A?

For all its growth Invesco remains undervalued by the market. It is trading at about 19 times earnings but has a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 10. It also has a low price-to-book (P/B) ratio of just under 1.3 with a P/B value of around $22 per share. That has jumped significantly since mid-February when the stock was trading at about three-quarters of book value but it's still low.

Invesco has also been involved in persistent rumors that it could be part of a merger or acquisition. The asset management industry is in a period of consolidation with a number of deals in the past year as firms look to scale up. The name tied to Invesco is Janus Henderson which has struggled in recent years. The rumors persist because last year hedge fund manager Nelson Peltz of Trian Fund Management bought 10% stakes in both companies and Trian has a history of activism -- in 2019 the firm bought a stake in Legg Mason which was acquired in 2020 by Franklin Resources. The speculation has been well received by the market as it has helped juice Invescoʻs excellent performance this year.

Invesco has carved out a terrific niche in ETFs and as one of the leading managers in that space it is in a good position to ride the ETF wave. At its current low valuation and with speculation of M&A activity it looks like a good time to consider this value stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmN0djE4LmNvbS9zdGFydHVwL2J5anVzLW5vdy1tb3N0LXZhbHVlZC11bmljb3JuLXBvc3QtZnVuZGluZy1mcm9tLXpvb21zLWVyaWMteXVhbi1vdGhlcnMtOTYzODE5MS5odG3SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjdHYxOC5jb20vc3RhcnR1cC9ieWp1cy1ub3ctbW9zdC12YWx1ZWQtdW5pY29ybi1wb3N0LWZ1bmRpbmctZnJvbS16b29tcy1lcmljLXl1YW4tb3RoZXJzLTk2MzgxOTEuaHRtL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Byju's becomes India's most valued startup post-funding from Zoom's Eric Yuan others,Edtech giant Byju's has become the most valued startup in the Indian ecosystem with a $16.5 billion valuation post a fundraise of Rs 2494 crore as per regulatory filings.The investors in the new round included Zoom founder Eric Yuan apart from others such as UBS Group Blackstone ADQ and Phoenix Rising as per regulatory filingsByju's has surpassed fintech giant Paytm which was valued at $16 billion in its last round of funding in November 2019.Byju's valuation has more than doubled since January 2020 when the company was valued at $8 billion.Byju's has raised nearly $2 billion in funding since January of 2020 from marquee names such as Tiger Global Mary Meeker's Bond Capital T Rowe Price Silver Lake and several others as per data from Venture Intelligence.The company has also been on an acquisition spree having acquired WhiteHat Jr last year for $300 million and Aakash Educational Services this year for nearly a billion dollars.

We've passed many of the major press conferences: Ubisoft and Microsoft Square Enix our own PC Gaming Show and sister broadcast The Future Games Show. But there's still more to come with E3 concluding with Nintendo and Bandai Namco on Tuesday June 15.

Of course there are still more gaming events happening later in the summer and Monday and Tuesday are going to be packed.

Here's a schedule of everything happening for E3 2021 organized by day and timezone.

When is E3 2021?

E3 has some ""official"" dates with livestreams running from June 12 - June 15 2021. But many publishers and even indie developers have decided to host their own independent events around the E3 timeframe. The first big E3 stream this year was Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest Kickoff Live on June 10 and it set a high bar for this year's streams with an Elden Ring gameplay trailer and release date.

Below we've listed every summer gaming event being held in June (and a few announced for next month too).

The easiest place to watch

How do I just watch every E3 event on one stream?

If you're confused by the difference between ""official"" E3 events and other gaming livestreams happening this June you're definitely not alone. It's confusing for us too. But all that really matters is knowing where you can stream everything without missing out on any of the events.

From June 12 - June 15 you'll be able to watch every gaming event on the official E3 streams.

Key expectations at E3 2021

Ubisoft Forward

Ubisoft is undoubtedly one of the biggest game publishers around the world and it has revealed most of what it plans to showcase here. Ahead of its official keynote it will host a pre-show which will include live showcases of updates coming to existing Ubisoft titles such as Brawlhalla For Honor The Crew 2 Trackmania and Watch Dogs: Legion. At the actual session Ubisoft is set to reveal new content for Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla plus new footage for the much anticipated Far Cry 6. Even Rainbow Six: Quarantine is expected to get new visuals. Speculations also expect some sort of teasers or visuals on the much anticipated (and very delayed) Prince of Persia: Sands of Time (Remake).

Microsoft at E3 2021

Microsoft will have a lot to talk about at its showcase so it’s only natural that its keynote is being looked upon as the most anticipated. Expected announcements include a showcase of upcoming Bethesda titles such as Indiana Jones and Elder Scrolls 6 among others. IGN states that a Deathloop demo isn’t out of question either. Beyond Bethesda Microsoft is expected to showcase the next Forza game as well as an official announcement on Halo: Infinite. There will also likely be plenty of Xbox indie games showcased during the session.

Square Enix

Next up in chronological order is Square Enix which may excite games with showcases of Final Fantasy Origin Final Fantasy XVI and Dragon Quest XII. Also in line are visuals from Forsaken their upcoming game. Most speculations also suggest that teasers or demos of Life is Strange: True Colors as well as the next Tomb Raider game should also be in tow. A new unnamed game from the Eidos Montreal game studio is also said to be incoming.

Take-Two Interactive

There is surprisingly low excitement around Take-Two’s presentation which it could completely blow to smithereens by announcing GTA 6. Wishful thinking aside though what can be realistically expected from Take-Two would be remasters of GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption – which probably explains the limited hype around its keynote. Still speculations around GTA 6 will not die down until Take-Two’s session is over.

Capcom

Camcom is expected to showcase more visuals from the very scary Resident Evil: Village alongside other titles such as the Monster Hunter series. Also expected is a remake of the popular Resident Evil 4 which may be in line with Capcom’s strategy of late.

Nintendo at E3 2021

Finally the last big keynote is expected to be hosted by Nintendo. The biggest expectation from Nintendo is actually hardware with a larger OLED display to be specific. The Nintendo Switch Pro has been in rumours for a while and what better platform to launch it here? However even if it doesn’t expect Nintendo to have plenty to offer games – with new Pokemon titles and upgrades to multiple other game franchises that it owns.

This year celebrations and parades across the world have moved online to Zoom TikTok and YouTube. But criticism for “rainbow capitalism” in which corporations are accused of profiting socially and financially by selling LGBTQ+-themed products has never been louder.

“Just because a company slapped on a rainbow doesn’t mean they support the LGBTQ+ community” tweeted Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday following a surge of social media users vocally attacking brands for selling crass rainbow-themed goods but doing little to give back to LGBTQ+ communities.

Chris Stedman author of digital anthropology book IRL (in real life) went viral online after singling out US store Target for its “ugly as sin” attempt to bandwagon on Pride month. Speaking to the Observer he said: “The reason this stuff often feels like such a violation to many of us is that the language these brands are slapping on to mugs emerged in spaces we built for ourselves because we weren’t welcome elsewhere.”

Often the collections feel inauthentic and appropriated robbing the community of their agency he said. “Our in-group language and imagery evolved as a way for us to care for ourselves. So to have it used by brands that have little to no stake in our wellbeing feels like it cheapens and ultimately ‘defangs’ the language that we have used to empower ourselves. They think ‘hey we can just slap some rainbows on this and call it a day’. It’s dehumanising.”

On TikTok critique was even blunter. “All of the major corporations only care about us two months a year. It’s straight fashion [with] rainbows on it I’ll pass” wrote one user mocking rainbow-designed T-shirts featuring slogans “Come to the gay side we have rainbows” and “I can’t even think straight” from Walmart. Another wrote: “Don’t buy any Pride stuff from a big box store. They don’t care about us except in June. They want our money. They don’t help us.”

Writer and producer Fran Tirado who has worked on LGBTQ+ strategy at Netflix Out and Vice says that while advocating for queer and trans communities has become a corporate norm it’s often just lip service. “All companies are doing it so much every June that now brands are called out when they don’t do something for Pride. Understanding that why have corporations not really changed their strategy at all when it comes to Pride?” he said. “They’ve been doing the same thing for decades. The way companies conceive Pride campaigns is such a failure of the imagination.”

Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell described the rainbow capitalism row as damaging to LGBTQ+ communities. “Sometimes it feels like a box-ticking PR exercise to make the company look good and win over LGBTQ+ consumers. It is very off-putting and damaging. Many of us feel exploited.” Speaking to the Observer Tatchell added that if Pride merchandise is to be made LGBTQ+ creatives should be designing it. “They know the community” he said “what works and what is appropriate.”

Most critics call for consistency from brands. Matthew Breen an LGBTQ+ media and advocacy consultant believes the integrity of a company comes to light after Pride month. “Brands view Pride as a time to change their logos to rainbows sell merch and convey a message of inclusion and an embrace of LGBTQ+ communities and customers” he said. “But as queer people we can’t turn off our LGBTQ+ status when the logos go back to normal so it’s important we examine whether brands support us year round.”

The issues of corporate accountability in fashion came into focus following the murder of George Floyd last year. Many companies were called out for performative “black square” posts on Instagram that were not accompanied by systemic changes in the structures of their businesses. There’s a link to the expectations around Pride month.

“With issues around how fashion engages with social justice there needs to be a much deeper engagement than an Instagram post of their Pride collection” said Dr Ben Barry an activist and professor of fashion gender and sexuality at Ryerson University in Toronto. “How is that organisation changing their workplace culture to include LGBTQ+ folks in a real way?”

The question of who profits from rainbow capitalism is a sticky one. Labels such as Balenciaga which is donating 15% from the collection to LGBTQ+ charity the Trevor Project and Calvin Klein which has pledged an undisclosed sum to charities including The Trevor Project and the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund have signalled some meaningful commitment. But Breen says it is too shallow: “Companies should be allocating a much larger share of profits on that Pride merchandise to LGBTQ+ causes – why not 100%? If a company puts a flag on a collection it shouldn’t be 10% going back it should be the whole thing going back to the community.”

To engage with the community sincerely and advocate for LBGTQ+ rights say Pride supporters there is an onus on brands to put their money where their merch is donate to LBGTQ+ causes year round and invest in company structures to maintain equality and integrity for sexual minorities.

“It’s about a 12-month process of implementing change not just a month” said Barry. He believes that real change could occur with a total rethinking of what Pride month means in public spaces. “It’s reframing how we celebrate Pride beyond a Pride collection: here’s the work we’ll do and how we will commit to system transformation.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZnV0dXJpc20uY29tL3RoZS1ieXRlL2NvcnBvcmF0aW9ucy1hZHZlcnRpc2VtZW50cy1pbi1kcmVhbXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corporations Want to Put Advertisements In Your Dreams,"“Our dreams cannot become just another playground for corporate advertisers.”

Targeted Dream Incubation

Scientists have a stark warning for us: Companies want to target your dreams with advertisements — and they're already doing it.

40 sleep researchers have signed an open letter calling on legislators to regulate ""targeted dream incubation (TDI)"" according to Science Magazine. In it warned that large corporations such as Coors’ and Burger King were actively attempting to engineer the dreams of potential customers.

""TDI-advertising is not some fun gimmick but a slippery slope with real consequences"" the researchers wrote in their letter. ""Planting dreams in people’s minds for the purpose of selling products not to mention addictive substances raises important ethical questions.""

They continued ""Our dreams cannot become just another playground for corporate advertisers.""

Dreaming of Beer

The letter authors specifically cite an instance in which Molson Coors — the parent company of Coors Blue Moon and Miller beers — used TDI to advertise in people's dreams in the days leading up to the Super Bowl.

For that they invited willing participants to watch a ""dream inducing video"" created with the help of a sleep scientist that included images and sounds of ""waterfalls mountains and of course Coors"" before they fell asleep according to a press release by Molson Coors.

Participants could also get a 12 pack of Coors for free if they sent a link of the video to a friend so they could also have their dreams incepted.

Check out a video of their efforts below:

Dark Cyberpunk Implications

Having a corporation needle its way into your dreams is definitely a scenario you’d see play out in a cyberpunk story — but it’s actually happening in reality.

Though dream engineering currently requires our active participation sleep researchers warn that this could usher in a new dark reality where corporations employ passive TDI tactics through things like smart speakers.

""[It] is easy to envision a world in which smart speakers [...] become instruments of passive unconscious overnight advertising with or without our permission"" the letter authors said. ""These tailored soundtracks would become background scenery for our sleep as the unending billboards that litter American highways have become for our waking life.""

For now we'll have to wait and see if legislators do something about this. If the researchers are right though this could end up being a slippery slope where we aren’t even safe from big corporations in our sleep — and that’s enough to keep anyone up at night.

For ex 05/20 = May 2020).



Then if it is magically/automatically fixed later on reply to update how it got fixed and post your software version again.



If we all did this then others can benefit from this thread later on...



It could be a bug in software if many are seeing it unless all of these were built the same time and it is some sort of manufacturing defect/alignment thing.



Frameless windows should lowered before the door is opened and only go back up fully after the door is closed again. I do not know Tesla's logic and how these are controlled hardware only system vs software+sensors but they should be using the door latch mechanism as part of that decision to know when the door is fully closed again so it can close the window. So perhaps that latch is not fully open when the door opens or a wire from that latch has come off or there is a software bug not seeing that open latch and the MY thinks the door never opened?



Those having issues are the doors closing fully flush when closed? Perhaps the latch needs to be adjusted? When the door is opened look at the latch and see if it is opened all the way if not then perhaps try to gently open it a bit more and see if that lowers the window. If fooling around with the latch fixes the problem you know what to tell the service guys.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamFtZXNtb3JyaXMvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9pcy10aGUtdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwtcy1wbGFpZC10aGUtYmVzdC1jYXItb24tdGhlLXBsYW5ldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is The Tesla Model S Plaid The Best Car On The Planet?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesmorris/2021/06/12/is-the-tesla-model-s-plaid-the-best-car-on-the-planet/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvamFtZXNtb3JyaXMvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9pcy10aGUtdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwtcy1wbGFpZC10aGUtYmVzdC1jYXItb24tdGhlLXBsYW5ldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMS8wNi8xMi90ZXNsYS1kb3duZ3JhZGVzLXJhbmdlLWJyYW5kLW5ldy1tb2RlbC1zLWxvbmctcmFuZ2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla downgrades range of brand new Model S Long Range,"Tesla has downgraded the range of its brand new Model S Long Range which also happens to be Tesla’s longest-range electric car just a few days after launching the vehicle.

The event Tesla held at its Fremont factory on Thursday was more about the Model S Plaid the new top performance Model S but it was also the official launch of the new Model S which also includes the cheaper Model S Long Range.

It was only briefly mentioned by CEO Elon Musk during the presentation when discussing the version’s longer range.

He joked about almost having 420 miles of range:

“In the Dual Motor configuration it got a 412-mile range… 420 give or take.”

412 miles of range was indeed what Tesla was advertising since starting to take orders for the new Model S in January.

However last night just a day after Musk’s presentation Tesla has updated the Model S online configurator to change the Model S Long Range’s advertised range to 405 miles:

It’s a small 7-mile downgrade over the previously advertised range by Tesla for the new $80000 version of the Model S.

The official EPA estimated ranges for the new versions of the Model S are not on the agency’s website but Tesla appears to have received the official results – leading to the change in advertised range.

You can see a small difference of Tesla listing the Model S Long Range’s range as “EPA estimate” versus just “estimate” for the Model S Plaid:

In a comment to Electrek last week Musk said that he doesn’t see a need for an electric vehicle with a range of more than 400 miles:

“What we are seeing is that once you have a range above 400 miles more range doesn’t really matter. There are essentially zero trips above 400 miles where the driver doesn’t need to stop for restroom food coffee etc. anyway.”

The comment was criticized for not accounting for the fact that a 400-mile range is closer to 250-300 miles in colder climates and depending on the conditions.

However Tesla seemed to have an answer for that during the launch of the new Model S this week with a new thermal system with heat pump that Musk claimed could increase cold-weather range by 30%.

Despite the slight downgrade in range Tesla still dominates rated EPA ranges for production vehicles but several new electric vehicles coming to market are starting to close the gap.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy81MTM2NjEvdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwtMy10b3RhbC1jb3N0L9IBQ2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZXZzLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy81MTM2NjEvdGVzbGEtbW9kZWwtMy10b3RhbC1jb3N0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exactly How Much Is A Tesla Model 3 With All Costs Included?,"One of our favorite new Tesla YouTube influencers – Carter Jones – puts together helpful videos for EV owners. In this recent video she dives into Tesla Model 3 cost of ownership. Carter writes:

""This video answers the question: How much is a Model 3 and what are all Tesla costs? I purchased the 2021 Tesla Model 3 6 months ago and these are all the costs to consider before purchasing. Tesla maintenance and Model 3 charging costs are two of your biggest expenses to consider. I also will compare Tesla maintenance vs regular cars.""

Demand for Tesla's cars is reportedly through the roof so there's no doubt many people are probably wondering if they can fit a Model 3 into their budget. The Model 3 is currently Tesla's cheapest offering with a starting price of $39990. It's also the most popular electric car on the planet.

With that said many people who are shopping for an EV are eyeing the Model 3 but if they're brand-new to electric cars they likely have plenty of questions.

What should you expect related to maintenance? How much does it cost to charge? Will your home electric bill skyrocket? Are Superchargers really expensive? What equipment do you have to install at home how much does it cost and how much should you budget for the labor?

Sure electric cars will save you money over gas cars but the cars themselves are expensive and there are other costs that come with being an EV owner.

You may remember media coverage about the ""Tesla stretch."" This was basically the media reporting that people are going way over budget to get into a Tesla spending much more than they would on any other car and most of these folks were just buying the Model 3.

If you're going to buy a new car and you plan to spend more than you typically do it's critical to crunch the numbers and make sure it works with your budget.

After you've had a chance to watch the video leave us a comment. Do you have any advice that could help prospective EV owners?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjEvanVuLzE0L3Rlc2xhLXdpbGwtcmVzdW1lLWFjY2VwdGluZy1iaXRjb2luLXdoZW4taXQtdXNlcy1tb3JlLWNsZWFuLWVuZXJneS1zYXlzLW11c2vSAX9odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS8yMDIxL2p1bi8xNC90ZXNsYS13aWxsLXJlc3VtZS1hY2NlcHRpbmctYml0Y29pbi13aGVuLWl0LXVzZXMtbW9yZS1jbGVhbi1lbmVyZ3ktc2F5cy1tdXNr?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bitcoin price back above $40000 after Elon Musk comments,"The price of bitcoin hit a three-week high on Monday climbing back above $40000 after Elon Musk said that Tesla would resume allowing transactions made in the digital currency once crypto mining becomes greener.

The electric car company’s latest change of direction on its acceptance of bitcoin once again highlighted the continuing ability of Tesla’s billionaire chief executive to influence the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

“When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend Tesla will resume allowing bitcoin transactions” Musk said in a tweet on Sunday.

The price of one bitcoin climbed to a high of $41033 (£29063) on Monday before slipping back to $40580 still up more than 12% from its price before Musk’s tweet.

Musk one of the most high-profile proponents of cryptocurrencies also said that Tesla sold about 10% of its holdings to confirm bitcoin could be liquidated easily without moving the market.

He announced in May that Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin for car purchases citing long-brewing environmental concerns for a swift reversal in the company’s position on the cryptocurrency. In February Tesla revealed it had bought $1.5bn of bitcoin and would accept it as a form of payment for cars. But the cryptocurrency’s production is at odds with the company’s mission toward a “zero-emission future”.

Bitcoin fell more than 10% after Musk’s tweet in May. He said that he believed cryptocurrency had a promising future but it could not be at great cost to the environment.

The energy used to produce bitcoin alone is equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of Argentina according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index a tool from researchers at Cambridge University that measures the currency’s energy use.

Bitcoin mining – the process in which a bitcoin is awarded to a computer that solves a complex series of algorithms – is deeply energy-intensive. Because there is a finite number of bitcoins that can be mined – 21m – computers have to solve harder and harder algorithms in order to get bitcoin. The special equipment and intense processing power use a lot of electricity – as much as some entire countries.

The concerns over energy use aside cryptocurrencies have split opinion among investors and financial regulators for other reasons including the rollercoaster ride sparked by their frequent swings in price.

Despite bitcoin’s recent rise it is still trading about a third lower than the record high of $63000 which it reached in April. A year ago bitcoin’s value was under $9500.

Earlier in June the Central American country of El Salvador became the first in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender as part of its technology-loving president’s proposals to use the cryptocurrency to promote “financial inclusion” investment and economic development.

However others remain unconvinced and cryptocurrencies remain controversial. Global regulators are sceptical on account of their volatility and vulnerability to theft or hacking.

The Bank of England has previously warned that the rise of digital currencies could set off a flood of withdrawals from high-street banks risking financial stability and the wider economy and cautioned that investors risk losing their money.

According to various measures bitcoin is undervalued at current prices said Alexandra Clark a sales trader at the digital asset broker GlobalBlock although she added: “Many analysts are still on the fence when it comes to determining whether the digital asset is ready to continue its uptrend.”

Tesla’s decision to sell 10% of its bitcoin holding “has brought about fresh accusations of pumping and dumping by Musk and reiterated the need for an investigation by the SEC [US Securities and Exchange Commission]” Clark said.

The US securities watchdog warned Tesla last year that Musk had twice violated a settlement requiring his tweets and material public communications to be preapproved by company lawyers the Wall Street Journal reported at the start of June."

Designers can look at the energy density and battery storage to monitor and prevent overvoltage or over-temperature phenomena. An increase in battery size can directly affect the weight cost and safety of the EV making a well-equipped battery management system (BMS) one of the best methods of shrinking the size of the battery.

A general overview of a standard BMS. Image used courtesy of Toradex

Over time Analog Devices (ADI) has showcased an extensive portfolio of BMS products through 5-generations of consistent updates. Keeping up with its trend ADI recently introduced two multicell battery monitors. These monitors are Automotive Safety Integrity Level-D (ASIL-D) certified with new low-power features to enable continuous battery monitoring even after the car has been turned off.

This article aims to explore ADI's monitors and how it looks compared to a few competitors like Texas Instruments and NXP.

ADI’s New Multicell Battery Monitor

Since 2008 ADI has designed and manufactured BMS solutions to meet the growing demand for effective EV technology and keeping safety in mind enough to achieve an ASIL-D rating. ADI's latest addition to its BMS portfolio claims to handle 6-18 cell modules with low-power consumption.

Utilizing ADI's 8 or 12 channel monitors in a BMS allows for continuous verification of each battery cell's charge even after the EV is turned off. It takes roughly 304 μs to measure all cells in a system.

ADI's ADBMS6815 multicell battery stack monitor is optimized for 12 series-connected battery cells with data accumulated under high noise mitigation. Meanwhile the second product announced the ADBMS6817 is identical in characteristics only differing in handling 8 series-connected battery cells.

Wiring diagram of ADI’s 12-Channel Multicell Battery Monitor which is designed for use in ISO 26262 applications for ASIL-D compliance. Image used courtesy of Analog Devices

ADI has improved battery cell monitor technology by having the daisy-chained cells be bidirectional. This ability can help diagnostics locate faults that could occur on the communication line that connects each cell. Each cell has a dedicated pulse-width modulation (PWM) duty cycle control that adds passive cell balancing to the equation.



With its past innovations ADI certainly has the attention of EV manufacturers in addition to its latest stackable battery monitors; however there may be some competition that holds advantages and disadvantages over them.

Texas Instruments’ BMS Features Wireless Communication

Texas Instruments (TI) is a distinguished manufacturer in the vast world of electronics known for creating affordable semiconductors for various applications. For decades TI has been designing hybrid and EV powertrain systems that include BMS technology. TI was also the first BMS manufacturer to receive an ASIL-D rating.

TI’s 16 in series cell monitoring IC is coupled with a battery balancer that is fully autonomous with auto-pause and resumes abilities for robust cell balancing. Screenshot used courtesy of Texas Instruments

As for some specifications TI's battery management integrated circuit (BMIC) offers 128 μs accurate cell voltage measurements across all 16 channels. The option for 12 14 and 16 series-connected cells offering more design flexibility than ADI's latest battery monitor.

Since the ability to extend EV's driving range comes from having a more prominent battery source TI holds a slight advantage compared to ADI by having 12-16 cell options.

Both BMS solutions offer daisy chain communication for optimal monitoring and share a similar balancing current. Also they can both filter for unwanted distortions and have a passive balancing architecture.

One increasing benefit is how TI states it has implemented a wireless data transfer that removes several connectors and cabling from the BMS.

With TI being at the forefront of that specific technology ADI has yet to announce a wireless BMS product that can compare to TI; however it does have a line of wireless power transfer products including receiver/chargers and transmitters.

Keeping that in mind it might be possible for EV manufacturers to see ADI developing a wireless BMS product in the foreseeable future.

Removing the wireless aspect to the BMS another comparison is with NXP's latest BMS.

NXP’S 14-Channel Battery Cell IC

NXP's 14-channel battery cell controller (BCC) IC can monitor between 7 to 14 in series cells through daisy-chained communication or capacitor isolation. What stands out about NXP is the scalability expectations; NXP's BCC could be on the cusp of becoming a game-changer for future battery design with potentially 800 cells per daisy chain.

Compared to ADI and TI's battery monitors NXP's BCC MC33771C has an isolated communication speed of 4 Mbps double the speed and offers a two-wire twisted pair versus a single use for Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication. This SPI is advantageous since a faster SPI can boost the short-distance comms for the BMS.

This battery monitor component can be easily integrated into energy storage systems (ESS) and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for EVs and industrial applications. In addition NXP's BCC is equipped with passive balancing and can operate in sleep mode just as ADI's solution.

Through looking at the different options for BMS it becomes prevalent to see how vital this system is and how so many top companies are approaching it in similar yet drastically different ways.

The Importance of BMS

An EV is only as good as its battery system. The aesthetically pleasing features within the cabin can draw customers in but what gets people to invest in the transition to renewable energy-based transportation is the driving range and price.

To drive longer on a single charge requires an extensive enough battery and storage system. No one wants a trunk-filled battery supply which is why designers and engineers are addressing the battery setup. The fundamentals of a robust and efficient EV powertrain is a well-equipped BMS.

ADI TI and NXP all share the concept of stackable battery cells with daisy-chained communication to save on space and bring design flexibility into the equation. Temperature control becomes essential when the heat begins to dissipate from the multicell configurations.

Each manufacturer offers a product that can easily monitor temperature and run diagnostics for potential faults from cell to cell. In addition NXP and TI have discussed ways of going wireless or cloud-based to free up more space for potentially more battery cells.

The global focus on EVs can bring more and more technology like BMS further into the future. As a result newer and more innovative systems are sure to be on the horizon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybGluZ3Rvbm1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9leHRyYW9yZGluYXJ5LXRlZW4tYXdhcmRzLTIwMjEvMTMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arlington Magazine Extraordinary Teen Awards 2021,"Mira Rizk

Bishop O’Connell High School

When you foster as many interests as Mira Rizk it’s tough to pin down a career path. Why not just pool them all together and shoot for the stars?

“I always tell everybody I want to be a space doctor because I want to go to space while also being a doctor” says the University of Virginia-bound senior.

It’s not as crazy as it sounds. Rizk 18 was able to marry those passions last summer when a team from Bishop O’Connell’s engineering club entered a NASA/Texas Instruments competition. The challenge: invent something to help improve the lives of International Space Station astronauts.

“We created a space pillow which basically would provide the astronauts with the feel of a pillow from home” she explains “while also triggering fans that would take away excess CO2 from around their heads.” Her team placed in the top 25 in the 2020 competition.

While working on the ISS might be her dream job the McLean teen developed a deep interest in medicine closer to home when her diabetic father underwent open-heart surgery two years ago. “It was a really intense procedure and the recovery was very long but I was able to help him through it” Rizk says. “I found out that caregiving was something that I genuinely love.”

Grateful that her parents who are from Lebanon worked so hard to provide her with so many opportunities the honors student (she finished her senior year with a 4.6 GPA) likes to give back whenever possible. Just Sweets Bakery the nonprofit online bakery she started last summer with her cousin—featuring goodies ranging from muffins to madeleines—donated $2000 to the Lebanon Red Cross and $800 to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. She also belongs to the Keyettes service club makes grocery and soup deliveries to people who are homebound or homeless and founded the Outdoors Club at her school.

Rizk says her parents have sometimes urged her to pare down her activities concerned about overload. But she remains undaunted: “I just find myself never really wanting to stop.” –Rina Rapuano

Few bands have had a bigger impact on electronic music than Kraftwerk. Even almost 50 years later “Autobahn” “Trans Europa Express” and “Computerwelt” are considered musical milestones and continue to inspire musicians across the world. Which synthesizers and other gear did Kraftwerk use and which alternatives are there today? We’ve compiled a list.

Moog Minimoog

Analog synthesizers dominated the band’s early records. Did the Moog Minimoog become the most famous synth of all times because it was used by Kraftwerk? We can only guess but it probably didn’t hurt. The Minimoog was a fixed staple in the band’s arsenal throughout their career and is even pictured on the back of the album “Ralf und Florian” – the first one on which Kraftwerk used synths.

Because the Minimoog is such an icon there are now quite a few hardware and software emulations available. Moog used to make its own replica but discontinued it four years ago. A much cheaper option is the Behringer Model D or its polyphonic cousin Poly D.

Over the years Kraftwerk replaced the Minimoog with a variety of other hardware and software synths especially on stage. The band has used the Creamware Minimax ASB and the Studio Electronics SE-1 which came out in the early 1990s. The updated version SE-1X is being sold again and Studio Electronics has just announced the SE-3X which adds a 3-voice paraphonic mode and additional filters among other things. And of course there’s the Roland SE-02 which was developed in cooperation with Studio Electronics and also draws inspiration from the Minimoog.

In terms of Software there are also many great emulations available with the Moog Model D iOS app Arturia Mini V2 Softube Model 72 Native Instruments Monark and GForce Minimonsta being among the most popular.

ARP Odyssey

The second era-defining mono synth of the 1970s the ARP Odyssey was used by Kraftwerk on the album “Autobahn”. Like the Minimoog it helped to create a new generation of compact instruments which brought synthesizers within reach of a much wider spectrum of musicians. And just like for the Minimoog you now have several options if you want an Odyssey in your studio.

First and foremost there’s the official reissue developed by Korg which was and is available in a variety of sizes and colors. In addition to the slim-keyed version Korg produced a limited full-size edition which is now sold out. In addition the Korg ARP Odyssey is available as a desktop module and even as an iOS app. And needless to say Behringer has made its own version too.

EMS Synthi-A

Another analog synth of the 70s that has been used by Kraftwerk is the EMS Synthi-A. With its pin matrix the Synthi is an ultra-compact modular system in a convenient carrying case which allows you to patch up its components as you wish. As of today there’s no modern clone of the Synthi-A readily available but chances are that Behringer will have something along those lines soon.

Sequential Circuits Prophet-5

Moving on to polyphonic synths the legendary Prophet-5 was used by Kraftwerk during the “Computer World” tour in 1981. After a long list of other synths named Prophet which included the Prophet 08 Prophet 12 Prophet-6 Prophet REV2 and Prophet X its inventor Dave Smith was finally able to bring back the Prophet in its original form last year. The new Prophet-5 and Prophet-10 are both available as desktop and keyboard versions.

Electronic drums

When it came to drums Kraftwerk were incredibly inventive right from the start. The band used a variety of modified rhythm generators for home organs like the Farfisa Rhythm Unit 10. The band also constructed its own electronic drum set which was played with metal sticks which closed the electrical circuit. This was used to trigger the sounds of a Maestro Rhythm King – another analog accompaniment machine from the home organ era.

While you cannot buy these one-off instruments anywhere luckily there’s now a big selection of analog and digital drum machines again. For example the analog MFB 501 Pro has roots that go way back to the 1970s. But it too goes with the times: The latest version even lets you load samples.

There’s also a big selection of drum pads and electronic drums. Even Simmons is back! We know that Kraftwerk used the Simmons SDS-V drum pads at one point. But the new electronic drums sold by Simmons only share a name with those classics.

Sequencers

While the first Kraftwerk records were played by hand the band began to use sequencers on “Trans Europa Express” after some initial reluctance. Their famous Synthanorma Sequencer was custom-made by Synthesizerstudio Bonn Matten & Wiechers and pioneered quantized control voltages (Intervallomat). Later Kraftwerk used various sequencers by Doepfer including Regelwerk Schaltwerk and the MAQ 16/3.

After a period during which the days of hardware sequencers appeared to be numbered the selection is now larger than ever largely due to the unprecedented popularity of modular synths. For example the Doepfer Dark Time offers a workflow that’s very similar to what an early sequencer looked like.

Vocoders

What comes to your mind first when you hear the name “Kraftwerk”? There’s a good chance that you instantly hear the band’s characteristic robot voices in your head. Over the years Kraftwerk used a variety of vocoders including the EMS Vocoder Roland SVC-350 and Roland VP-330.

Just like analog synthesizers the vocoder has recently seen a new surge in popularity – partly due to the fact that Korg built one into the inexpensive Microkorg which in itself has become a modern classic. There are many interesting options now including the Arturia MicroFreak with the microphone accessory and the Behringer VC340 a clone of the aforementioned VP-330. And if you have the cash there’s also the spectacular reissue of the Moog Vocoder.

Or you could invest in a special vocal effects unit for mangling your voice. The Roland VT-4 Voice Transformer or the TC Helicon VoiceLive series are popular options. These units give you many other effects in addition to the vocoder. And if you can’t be bothered to record your own there’s always samples like the Robot Voices sample library.

Toys calculators odds and ends

Nobody was talking about circuit bending at the time but Kraftwerk were masters at it. For its entire career the band has been known for using all sorts of devices that weren’t designed to be musical instruments. One noteworthy example is the voice in “Computerwelt” which came from a Texas Instruments electronic translator. And “Musikant mit Taschenrechner in der Hand” isn’t just a rhyme as the Casio FX-501b calculator was actually used as an instrument.

Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang-Studio was also home to all sorts of musical “toys” like the “Bee Gees Rhythm Machine” by Mattel and the Dübreq Stylophone. The unique stylus synth went on to become a cultural icon and is now available again.

Kraftwerk’s long cooperation with Dieter Doepfer which resulted in the MAQ 16/3 among other things also gave life to MOGLI another spectacular creation. The unique controller glove which was based on the Nintendo Powerglove gesture controller from 1989 was years ahead of current products like the Neova MIDI ring or Genki Instruments Wave. Controlling MIDI devices with gestures? What some start-ups are still pitching as a revolutionary idea was already being done by Kraftwerk decades ago.

Under the project a National Consortium of Oxygen is enabling the national level supply of critical raw materials such as zeolites setting up of small oxygen plants manufacturing compressors final products i.e. oxygen plants concentrators and ventilators the government said. The consortium is not only looking forward to providing immediate to short-term relief but also working to strengthen the manufacturing ecosystem for long-term preparedness the Office of Principal Scientific Adviser said.

A committee of experts has been evaluating critical equipment such as oxygen plants concentrators and ventilators from a pool of India-based manufacturers startups and MSMEs in partnership with FICCI MESA and others. The manufacturing and supply consortium also includes Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL); Tata Consulting Engineers (TCE); C-CAMP Bengaluru; IIT Kanpur (IIT-K); IIT Delhi (IIT-D); IIT Bombay (IIT-B) IIT Hyderabad (IIT-H); IISER Bhopal; Venture Center Pune; and more than 40 MSMEs.

The second wave of covid-19 saw an increase in demand for medical oxygen in different parts of the country. While meeting the current demand manufacturing medical oxygen also became important to ensure India has adequate supply in the future.

The consortium has started to secure CSR/philanthropic grants from organizations like USAID Edwards Life sciences Foundation Climate Works Foundation etc. Hope Foundation American Indian Foundation Walmart Hitachi BNP Paribas and eInfo Chips are procuring oxygen concentrators and VPSA/PSA plants as part of their CSR efforts to aid the consortium’s work. NMDC Ltd has agreed to fund the procurement of raw materials like zeolite for the manufacturers in the consortium.

Apart from oxygen generation the covid-19 cases surged in different parts of the country leaving infrastructure in hospitals under immense pressure. The government is also looking at modular hospitals which are an extension of hospital infrastructure and can be built adjacent to an existing hospital building.

Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser invited private sector companies donor organizations and individuals to support various projects of national importance. Project Extension Hospitals is one such initiative. The office of PSA identified requirements of close to 50 hospitals in states where the highest number of covid-19 cases were reported.

Modulus Housing a startup incubated at Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M) developed the MediCAB hospitals. This enables building a 100-bedded extension facility in 3-weeks’ time. MediCAB hospitals are designed with a dedicated zone of Intensive Care Units (ICUs) that can accommodate various life-support equipment and medical devices. These negative pressure portable hospitals have durability of around 25 years and they can also be shifted in the future for any disaster response in less than a week.

“These rapidly deployable hospitals will plug a major health infrastructure gap in India’s fight against covid-19 especially in rural areas and smaller towns. The O/o PSA has been actively working towards securing CSR support to implement these projects in different areas across the nation"" said the government in a statement.

Modulus Housing has started deploying MediCAB extension hospitals with the help of the American Indian Foundation (AIF). Mastercard Texas Instruments Zscaler PNB Housing Goldman Sachs Lenovo and NASSCOM Foundation have also extended CSR support. The first batch of 100 bedded hospitals is being commissioned at Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh); Amravati Pune and Jalna (Maharastra); Mohali (Punjab) and a 20-bed hospital at Raipur (Chhattisgarh). Bengaluru (Karnataka) will have one each of 20- 50- and 100-beds in the first phase.

The Office of PSA has also collaborated with Tata Projects Ltd to deploy modular hospitals at multiple sites in Punjab and Chhattisgarh. They have initiated work on 48 bedded modular hospitals in Gurdaspur and Faridkot (Punjab). Expansion of ICU at multiple hospitals in Chhattisgarh including Raipur Jashpur Bemetara Kanker and Gaurella are also underway.

April and May saw a sudden rise in covid-19 cases reaching up to 450000 a day and deaths touching as high as 4000 each day. Several patients had harrowing times in procuring oxygen while many died due to lack of hospital beds oxygen and medical treatment.

India has reported 80834 fresh covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours. The country’s active caseload on Sunday stands at 1026159. A net decline of 54531 is witnessed in the last 24 hours and active cases are now only 3.49% of the country's total positive cases. Cumulatively India has conducted over 378.1 million (378132474) tests so far.

The cumulative number of covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the country exceeded the 250 million mark on Saturday under the Nationwide Vaccination Drive. Nearly 3484239 vaccine doses were administered in the last 24 hours.

And if the vehicle’s water trials go well then it could become the Marine Corps’ Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle.

The Marine Corps badly needs a replacement for its rapidly-aging Light Armored Vehicle. Could this new vehicle be the solution?

The Marine Corps is on the hunt for a reconnaissance vehicle that would be able to replace their LAV-25 the Light Armored Vehicle that originally entered service with the Marine Corps in the early 1980s. The LAV has a lot to offer—it is amphibious sports a 25-millimeter Bushmaster autocannon and can transport six fully-equipped Marines in addition to three crew members. Still the vehicle is quickly approaching forty years old and is in some ways a throwback to Cold War-era planning.

The LAV is relatively lightly armored and while it can offer protection from Russian 14.5-millimeter armor-piercing rounds as well as a variety of small-arms fire it is decidedly vulnerable to larger caliber munitions. Since the LAV’s Cold War introduction it has been up-armored though at a steep cost: its amphibious capabilities. To the Marine Corps—traditionally amphibious by nature — this is a dealbreaker.

A replacement is in the works however: the Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle. The Marine Corps’ ARV program seeks to find a LAV replacement and one offering from Textron might just be the vehicle for the job.

The USMC has listed quite a few stringent program requirements for a successful Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle prototype. The ARV should pack more firepower than the LAV and the Corps has suggested a 30-millimeter weapon system might do the job. It should also be highly armored able to neutralize “close-in heavy armor threats.”

In addition to a modern command and control setup as well as a variety of sensors to aid in surveillance and reconnaissance the ARV should excel both on land as well as in the water. More specifically it should have a shore-to-shore capability—that is the ability to leave a naval ship and cross a littoral water zone under its own power—that does not require a connecting naval vehicle.

This is where Textron’s Cottonmouth vehicle comes in. Although some of the specific features of the Cottonmouth vehicle are not publicly known several inferences can be made by what is available.

Company promotional material shows a six-wheeled presumably all-wheel-drive vehicle armed with what appears to be a remotely operated Javelin anti-tank missile as well as a .50 caliber heavy machine gun both of which are mated to the vehicle’s roof. Though the Javelin is indeed a powerful anti-tank missile it is possible that future Cottonmouth vehicles will sport something more powerful than a single-shot anti-tank missile as well as the United States’ oldest machine gun in service.

A variety of sensors and antennas cover the roof of the vehicles likely as part of the USMC’s surveillance and reconnaissance requirement. And like all things Marine the Cottonmouth sports dual water jets at the rear is happily amphibious.

This summer it’s likely that the Cottonmouth will undergo amphibious testing. And if the vehicle’s water trials go well it could become the Marine Corps’ Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle.

Early June 2021 the US agreed to sell a yet unknown number of Beechcraft T-6 Texan II trainer aircraft to the Không quân Nhân dân Việt Nam (VPAF Vietnam People's Air Force).

Three aircraft are expected to be delivered in mid-2023 as part of a package including basic pilot training programme. The complete programme is modelled after that of the USAF with supply/support packages for training engineering logistics and spare parts needed to maintain the aircraft while in service with the VPAF.

Already in 2019 two Vietnamese CASA C295 pilots were trained with the USAF's Aviation Leadership Programme at Columbus AFB (TX). Among these two pilots was Senior Lieutenant Dang Duc Toai which has flown the Beechcraft T-6 Texan II for more than 167 hours at this moment.

According to high Vietnamese officials the VPAF will have a new 5-year aviation training programme which would be implemented in the coming years to replace the traditional 4-year programme. In this new programme the Texan II would most likely be used to train Air Force Officer Cadets expected to fly the western transport aircraft such as the C295 and C212. The future selected fighter pilots start basic flight training on either the Texan II or the Yakovlev Yak-52 before moving on to the Aero L-39C/L-39NG and from there on to the Sukhoi Su-22 Fitter and Sukhoi Su-27/30 Flanker. The new ordered Yakovlev 130 trainers are to train pilots in preparation for future aircraft acquisition (which is rumoured to be the Sukhoi Su-35). For more information on the new jet training aircraft see the Scramble Magazine news items of 1 November 2020 (Yak-130) and 19 february 2021 (Aero L-39NG).

The T-6 Texan II is a turboprop aircraft built by the Raytheon Aircraft Company (which became Hawker Beechcraft and later Beechcraft Defence company and was bought by Textron Aviation in 2014). The trainer aircraft based on the Pilatus PC-9 has already replaced the USAF's Cessna T-37B Tweety Bird and the US Navy's T-34C Turbo Mentor. The T-6A is used by the USAF for basic pilot training and Combat Systems Officer (CSO) training the US Navy and USMC use the trainer for primary Naval Aviator training and primary and intermediate Naval Flight Officer (NFO) training.

The T-6C Texan II is used for training by the Mexican Air Force Royal Air Force Royal Moroccan Air Force and the Royal New Zealand Air Force. The Vietnam People's Air Force will become the newest user of this aircraft.

There has been a failure to attract enough girls to doing science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects in secondary school and in college according to Brid Horan chair of Balance for Better Business.

And while she says a lot is being done with different sectors tackling the issue she hears “horror stories”.

“A significant issue is around career guidance. I still hear horror stories of attitudes that come through in career guidance it is essentially unconscious bias where teachers are more inclined to see a boy as potentially doing engineering or indeed pharmaceutical than girls” Ms Horan said.

And while the world of science is “making really good strides” when it comes to gender equality a worrying issue is that students start losing interest in STEM-related subjects at around age 11-13 according to Bronwyn Brophy global president immunodiagnostics at Thermo Fisher Scientific Ireland.

To help counter this Thermo Fisher Scientific has a number of outreach programmes where it brings its scientists into schools.

“Because it’s not all about the textbook: sometimes it’s about seeing how science works in the real world in a company like ours.”

A graduate of international marketing and languages at DCU Ms Brophy says that throughout her career she has benefited greatly from “great mentors male and female who really encouraged me every step of the way”.

She is keen to emphasise the importance of having good mentors both in a formal and informal capacity.

“When it comes to mentorship [it’s important] that you choose people from diverse backgrounds diverse profiles and a variety of ages. I actually think it’s much more enriching if you do it that way and also it helps to eliminate blind spots. I’m a big big fan of mentorship” Ms Brophy says.

The Covid pandemic has had heart-breaking consequences for hundreds of thousands of people around the global. However one positive to come out of it has been increased collaboration within the pharma industry.

Ms Brophy was involved at an early stage of the Covid pandemic in “ensuring that we collaborated across the company to support healthcare providers and governments all across the region to scale up their testing to source PPE to distribute vital therapeutics” she says.

“Then we also pretty rapidly commenced vaccine development with many of our pharmaceutical and biotech partners” she says.

“It has really in many ways forced or expediting the need to collaborate. The reality is it would have been very difficult for any one company to find a full solution to Covid it would have been impossible.”

In the future Ms Brophy expects to see “a lot more collaboration”.

The speed at which a vaccine was developed highlighted just how powerful this form of collaboration can be.

“Multiple stakeholders from around the world came together to develop the vaccines as expeditiously as possible this is an example of the power of collaboration. Within our own company here we rapidly expanded our capacity” she says.

Thermo Fisher Scientific is currently supporting more than 200 projects that are focused on developing Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics.

“That’s one company alone – our company – involved in over 200 projects on vaccines and therapies. So there was just a huge coming together… it was very much ‘all shoulders to the wheel’.”

Once a vaccine against Covid-19 was developed supply became a major issue at times leading to geo-political tension as well as domestic criticism in a number of countries.

“The reality is the global demand for vaccines far outstripped the supply. So it was always going to be complex” Ms Brophy says.

“There are only a finite number of glass vials there are only a finite number you know the list goes on so it’s very very much capacity constrained.”

However supply of vaccines is growing and increasing numbers of people are being vaccinated.

“I do think the ramp-up in capacity is starting to kick in but we were always going to have the challenge of demand outstripping supply by such an extent and it’s going to take time to work through that” Ms Brophy adds.

This year will continue to be a “difficult one” in getting as many people vaccinated as possible.

“But I do think as vaccine capacity starts to increase personally I would be hopeful that supply and distribution is going to become increasingly equitable. That’s not me being an idealist. I do I do think that a lot of the sort of wealthier Western countries do want to share and do want to be part of the solution” she says.

“I mean the reality is if we don’t vaccinate populations around the globe we’re not going to solve the issue so it’s in everybody’s vested interest.”

Her comments come against the backdrop of an announcement by the G7 nations yesterday that they will donate one billion Covid vaccines to the poorest countries in the world by next year.

Meanwhile Nuala Murphy president of clinical research services at Icon says increasing diversity is a key area of focus for Icon both in terms of patient diversity and diversity in the organisation.

“It’s about how to ensure that you can have diversity of a patient population in a trial. It’s also about how do we ensure that we are hiring diversity into the organisation ensuring that our teams are diverse. We’re in a very high-risk area an area that requires a lot of skill sets it’s also about having diverse thinking diverse skills within the organisation” Ms Murphy says.

She was part a team that was “very fortunate to be involved in the race to finding a solution and also the fight against Covid.”

“We were very proud to be a partner of Pfizer’s. We deployed over 1000 people across the globe to deliver on what was clearly the first positive vaccine coming to the table. And it was also a record time of just under 250 days” Ms Murphy says.

“It’s just one example of how we’ve been supporting the cause. But we’ve been working on many opportunities whether it’s a vaccine or indeed whether it’s treating symptoms.”

Vaccines against Covid-19 were developed very rapidly and Ms Murphy says she was “seriously impressed as to how the industry collaborated.”

The biggest learning for Ms Murphy over the past 12 months has been around how the company operationalises clinical trials.

“We’re trying to be far more decentralised [in how we deliver them] and that will really impact the agility it’ll impact how fast we can actually conduct the trials as much as making it really easy for patients to be in trials” she says.

“It’s also about easing the burden if you don’t have to come to the clinic the trial comes to you” Ms Murphy adds.

“It’s clearly fantastic for patients.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbWluaW5nZGlnaXRhbC5jb20vc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLWFuZC1vcGVyYXRpb25zL21hYWRlbi1yZWFjaGVzLW1pbGVzdG9uZS1kb2xsYXI2NGJuLXBob3NwaGF0ZS1wcm9qZWN00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ma'aden reaches milestone on $6.4bn phosphate project,"Saudi Arabian mining company Ma’adenhas completed utilities commissioning on a $900mn ammonia plant in Ras Al-Khair industrial City. Construction completion is expected in the fourth quarter of 2021 with full activation in Q1 2022.

The ammonia plant is the first project in the $6.4bn ‘Phosphate 3’ expansion to Ma’aden’s phosphate fertilizer portfolio which encompasses the full mine-to-market development process of phosphate fertilizers.

Abdulaziz Al Harbi CEO Ma’aden

Ma’aden CEO Abdulaziz Al Harbi commented: “This is a tremendous milestone for our phosphate portfolio. The ammonia plant expansion will add over 1 million tonnes ammonia production to reach 3.3 million tonnes making Ma’adenone of the largest ammonia producers east of the Suez Canal”.

The ‘Phosphate 3’ expansion will add 3 million tonnes of phosphate fertilizer production capacity to Ma’adenportfolio bringing that to a total production capacity of more than 9 million tonnes. This will make Ma’adenone of the top three global phosphate fertilizer producers and Saudi Arabia the second largest phosphate fertilizer exporter worldwide.

“We have been moving ahead with the construction during the COVID-19 pandemic and thanks to the dedication of the Ma’adenteam and our partners construction has been completed for the utility section and pre-commissioning activities started” added Al Harbi.

“Safety has remained a priority for us throughout the project and I am pleased to say that over 4000 employees invested 14 million+ safe man hours to deliver the construction on the Ammonia 3 project over 32 months.”

Ma’aden is among the top three producers of phosphate fertilizers in the world

Ma’adenbegan commercial production of fertilizers in 2011 and has since become one of the top three largest producers of phosphate fertilizers globally catering to the biggest fertilizer markets and meeting the food requirements of hundreds of millions of people. Ma’adenis committed to empowering farmers by providing high quality products that improve crop quality and yield and supporting Saudi Arabia’s contribution to achieving global food security in line with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.

Ma’aden’s mine-to-market phosphate business consists of three mega projects in Saudi Arabia: Wa’ad Al Shamal – the center of the Saudi phosphate industry; Ras Al Khair a phosphate and bauxite processing superhub; and Phosphate 3. In 2019 Ma’adenexpanded the reach of its phosphate business in sub-Saharan Africa through the acquisition of fertilizer distribution company Meridian Group enabling faster and better service for local customers in Africa.

Ma'aden is making a commitment to sustainability

In line with Ma’aden’s sustainability commitment phosphate operations at Ras Al Khair Industrial City draw all its process water from one of the world’s largest desalination plants and utilize a natural engineered wastewater treatment (NEWT) system. Around 60-80% of the treated water gets reused as process water and the rest for local landscape irrigation.

The resulting “artificial wetland” created by NEWT has proven to be a sustainable and effective natural method to treat wastewater on municipal and industrial levels and as an added benefit has become an important habitat for wildlife especially shore birds in line with Saudi Arabia’s commitment to combat climate change under the Saudi Green Initiative.

Ma'aden recently highlighted its achievements as Saudia Arabia celebrated the fifth anniversary of the launch of Vision 2030.",,,,,,,,,

The female manager of the store in Eustis on Thursday afternoon spotted 33-year-old Arthur Steve Weingartner taking his pants off in the men’s section of the store according to an arrest report from the Eustis Police Department. She asked him what he was doing but he ignored her and continued to remove his pants. He was also drinking a beer.

The manager said she felt “very nervous” because of the way he was acting and he was disrupting other customers.

When an officer arrived at the store and tried to talk to Weingartner he walked away. The officer threatened to taser Weingartner but ended up taking him to the ground before handcuffing him.

A pat down turned up a folding knife and a set of metallic knuckles.

The Baltimore Sun via AP

ABERDEEN Md. — In February 2020 following a snowfall 7-year-old Presley Goins took her chicken Blueberry sledding.

Presley’s mother Alexa Felts snapped a photo of the little girl lying on her back in the sled both arms supporting Blueberry who stood on her human friend’s chest. As the pair slid down a slight slope together Presley stared up at the chicken’s beak her face rapt. Blueberry not a feather askew appeared completely unruffled.

Moments like that are exactly why Presley’s grandmother Patricia Felts fought for three years to persuade the Aberdeen City Council to allow residents to own hens within city limits. The legislation which permits up to six hens per half acre of land took effect Aug. 16.

“Chickens make great emotional support animals” said Patricia Felts who owns seven of the birds.

“They use chickens in nursing homes. They have been good for my grandkids especially since COVID-19 has been keeping everyone at home. You can sit there and watch them and interact with them and it’s amazing how calm that can make you feel. Now the girls are focused on something other than not being in school. They feed the chickens and water them and help socialize them. They hold them and love them. If they could bring the chickens inside to sleep with them at night they would.”

Since the pandemic descended on Maryland in spring 2020 activities related to sustainability and in particular to in-home food production have experienced an upsurge of popularity. Packets of vegetable seeds flew off the shelves. There were monthslong delays in purchasing such major appliances as refrigerators and ranges and a nationwide shortage of canning jars and lids.

And increasing numbers of Marylanders began experimenting with raising their own flocks.

Tractor Supply in Fallston couldn’t keep enough fluffy baby chickens ducks and turkeys in its two high-rise coops to satisfy the public demand according to Katelyn Mosmiller a team leader for the store which sells poultry annually between March and September.

“Last year we sold twice as many birds as we did in a normal pre-COVID year” she said. “For a while I couldn’t get enough chickens in. This year the demand has remained really high.”

More than 279 poultry premises (including backyard flocks) are registered in Harford County according to the Maryland Department of Agriculture or 3.3% of the total establishments statewide.

A Facebook group Phelps started called Aberdeen Backyard Chickens had 148 members in August. By April the group had grown by 64% to 230 members.

According to state officials the number of poultry premises in Maryland increased 26.4% during the pandemic from 6770 as of July 1 2019 to 8561 in April.

The vast majority of poultry premises — 88.9% — are small backyard flocks where Marylanders are raising their own chickens ducks and turkeys.

Individual municipalities make their own rules regarding the keeping of livestock.

In Annapolis residents can have up to five hens (no roosters) but only if the neighbors with whom they share property lines sign off. The city of Baltimore allows up to four chickens as long as the coop is at least 15 feet away from the nearest home. Prince George’s County generally prohibits all animals that aren’t customary household pets though there are exceptions.

In Aberdeen chickens had been banned since the 1950s. Opponents who testified last year feared that backyard flocks would tarnish the city’s image and would make it more difficult to turn down requests from residents wishing to own other unconventional pets.

The opponents argued that there was no shortage of cheap eggs. Then the pandemic hit.

“When we moved into our new home last May I wanted to make our new property more purposeful and self-sustaining” said Laurena Fringo 37 of Havre de Grace.

“We all got a real glimpse of what it would be like when you couldn’t buy food in the store. The shelves were pretty bare. My store ran out of eggs and sometimes I had a hard time finding milk.

“And even when you could find everything you needed if you were self-sustaining and grew your own food at home you wouldn’t have to risk going out to the store.”

Some may debate which comes first in the hearts of flock owners: the chickens or the eggs.

Style maven Martha Stewart is often credited with helping revive the interest in backyard chickens nationwide. Beginning in the 1980s her publications showcased rare heritage breeds that laid eggs ranging from white to a deep brown from speckled olive to bright copper to robin’s egg blue.

“They’re natural Easter eggs” said Fringo who has started selling some eggs from her three dozen chickens and ducks to friends.

Suddenly owning chickens became a status symbol as chronicled in a 2009 article in The New Yorker magazine “The Rise of the It Bird” in which the writer Susan Orlean chronicled her own obsession with her feathered friends.

But there’s no question that for many poultry owners the birds are their pets.

They name them. They throw birthday parties for their flocks. When the birds become ill the owners stay up all night feeding them by hand. Fringo’s favorite chicken Henny sits on her shoulder for their daily walk to the mailbox at the end of a long driveway.

Flock owners report being charmed by the birds’ often quirky personalities.

“A few years ago we had a chicken who would knock on our front door with her beak every single day” said Sarah Hindle 35 who keeps 40 chickens on her property outside Aberdeen.

“One day when my grandma was over we heard a knock. My grandma opens the door. It’s the chicken and she just lets it in the house.

“‘Grandma what are you doing?’ we asked.

“And she said: ‘Well it knocked.’”

Hindle initially resisted having chickens saying she’d been afraid of birds ever since she was a kid and her friend’s pet parakeet flew into her hair.

But her daughter Emmalyn now 8 begged. And her husband thought that having a pet that makes breakfast would be cool. About five years ago Hindle succumbed.

“And then all of a sudden chicken math kicked in” she said. “And now I’m the chicken lady.”

Chicken math?

“Chickens are like potato chips” explained Hindle who is in the process of getting certified to run her own hatchery.

“You can’t have just two. I originally bought four babies. Then when I was buying food for them there were two that were dying and I had to rescue them. Then I saw one that was a different color but they only sold them in twos. And then I found one that lays blue eggs.

“I started out with four chickens and now I have 40. That’s chicken math.”

Jennifer Dorsey 52 was in the Fallston Tractor Supply this April supplementing the flock she keeps at her home in nearby Kingsville just across the Baltimore County line.

Dorsey has found that the cheeping balls of fluff are a perfect teaching tool for her students at A World of Friends the preschool she runs in Baltimore. As a bonus many of the eggs she collects from the 28 chickens four ducks and two turkeys go home to the families of her 4-year-old pupils.

“Some of these kids are really sheltered” Dorsey said. “They don’t get outside much.

“They don’t know what a horse or a sheep is. They don’t know that a cow says ‘moo.’ I take them on hikes. I show them nests and teach them that they can eat dandelions. They are very very interested. If you show them birds soon they start to notice other things: flowers and plants and bees.

“Three little chickens can rock their world.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYW5jYXN0ZXJmYXJtaW5nLmNvbS9mYXJtaW5nLW5ld3MvbmV3cy9jb21wb3N0aW5nLXNob3dzLXByb21pc2UtYWdhaW5zdC1zd2luZS12aXJ1cy9hcnRpY2xlX2ViODNlMDMxLTY5NzYtNWJkNS04OTE4LWFmZWJjMTQ0NzU1Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Composting Shows Promise Against Swine Virus | Farming and Agricultural News | lancasterfarming.com,"If African swine fever strikes the United States some farmers will suddenly need to dispose of a lot of dead pigs.

And they’ll have to do so in a way that prevents the disease from lingering in the environment.

Composting the carcasses might be the answer researchers said May 18 during the Virtual International Symposium on Animal Mortality Management. The event was hosted by North Carolina State University.

Composting uses microbes and the heat they generate to break down all kinds of organic matter from old produce and manure to weed seeds and some pathogens. Many dead chickens were composted in huge piles during the 2015 avian influenza outbreak in the Midwest.

Since then African swine fever has produced animal carnage across a much broader territory — from Eastern Europe to Southeast Asia. Experts predict a U.S. outbreak could cost the swine industry billions of dollars.

As a result USDA and other federal agencies have formed a task force to speed up the development of a vaccine improve diagnosis and surveillance and — this is where compost comes in — find the best ways to clean up after an outbreak.

The virus that causes African swine fever is a bit of a challenge to kill. It can survive for a long time in dead animal tissue and is stable over a wide pH range said Lindsay Gabbert a research microbiologist with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security who is part of the composting project.

Few U.S. labs are authorized to study African swine fever directly and field studies are off limits.

So to attempt composting of contaminated pigs Gabbert’s group at Plum Island Animal Disease Center built their compost pile inside a high-containment laboratory.

Plum Island which sits on a nub of land at the edge of Long Island Sound is the primary federal installation for researching foreign animal diseases.

Still making compost indoors raised a lot of questions such as whether insects would scamper out of the pile into the secure room and whether the hot compost would pose a fire hazard.

“We’re not composting experts. We’re virologists and microbiologists so that was something kind of new to us” Gabbert said.

Having satisfied their initial concerns the team sought out an essential ingredient for good composting — a carbon feedstock.

They obtained municipal wood chips local horse manure and bedding — as well as baled pine shavings from Tractor Supply Co.

The group built the windrow indoors around four 120-pound pig carcasses that were infected with African swine fever and left over from a USDA vaccine study.

The researchers cut up the pigs’ spleens — large organs with high concentrations of the virus — and placed them in sampling bags that were restored to the pigs’ abdomens.

The idea was to have pieces of the pigs to sample while mimicking field conditions as much as possible Gabbert said.

The scientists let the pile compost for 37 days before unearthing what was left of the pigs — mainly bones ears marrow and bits of muscle.

“We did end up with a pulled pork-like end product which was quite interesting” Gabbert said.

More important was what happened to the virus particles. By the fifth day the team could not detect any live virus in the pig tissue.

Virus DNA was still present late in the study though it had degraded considerably over time.

The study wasn’t long enough to determine if composting can completely destroy the viral DNA Gabbert said.

An Option for Small Farms

While Gabbert is about planning for a potential swine fever outbreak Duc Hoang Minh has been working on responding to an existing one.

African swine fever was first documented in Duc’s native Vietnam in February 2019. Since then nearly 9000 outbreaks have been recorded reaching all of the country’s provinces according to the World Organisation for Animal Health.

Burial has been the most common disposal method for large numbers of pigs. Burning has been used for very small groups and in places with high groundwater or risk of flooding said Duc a member of the veterinary faculty at Vietnam National University of Agriculture.

Unfortunately many localities failed to collect and dispose of pigs from small farms which have had most of the outbreaks due to poor biosecurity. As a result some farmers have dumped their contaminated pig carcasses in rivers or by the side of the road.

“It seemed like the burial and the incineration was not convenient enough for farms especially for the small farm to dispose (of) their infected pigs by themselves” Duc said.

He believes composting could be a reasonable do-it-yourself disposal option for these little operations. For one thing Vietnam has plenty of rice hulls rice straw and sawdust to use as the carbon feedstocks.

Duc composted several infected pigs outdoors for 144 days by which time most of the pig tissue had decomposed.

He did not find the virus itself by day 3 in rice hull compost and day 7 for sawdust compost. Duc and his team found DNA from the virus in all samples for the first month but they are continuing to crunch the numbers from the project.

So far though the results from both the U.S. and Vietnam suggest composting might make sense as a disposal method — though it would be far better to keep African swine fever out of America in the first place.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uZ3kvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi81MDBtLWluLWNvbnRyYWN0cy1pbmtlZC1mb3ItdHJhY3Rvci1yZWhhYi13b3Jrcy1hY3Jvc3MtZ3V5YW5hL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$500M in contracts inked for tractor rehab. works across Guyana,"Six contracts totalling close to $500 million were signed with several contractors on Friday for the supply of tractors and for a variety of rehabilitation works to be carried out over the next few months.

The contracts were signed in the boardroom of the Ministry of Agriculture in the presence of the subject minister Zulfikar Mustapha.

Of the contracts inked three were for the National Drainage and Irrigation Authority (NDIA); it also included the construction of a drainage channel and the reactivation of an existing sluice along the right bank of the Abary Creek in Region Five; the rehabilitation by mechanical excavation of 35 collectors’ drains; the building of adjacent embankments of these channels as well as the rehabilitating of other structures within the Black Bush Polder area on the Corentyne Coast.

Minister Mustapha in brief remarks reminded the contractors that the ministry will not be granting project extensions urging them to ensure that the works are completed to the best of their ability. He added that the timely completion of the works will aid the ongoing flood relief efforts as the country battles the disaster.

“As I said that people are looking forward to us to deliver the services and Government will ensure that we take steps to ensure the contractor deliver and deliver on time.

“We will not tolerate these things. We at the Ministry of Agriculture have a service to provide we have a program to execute and we want to ensure that we do it and do it properly” the Minister commented.

The six contracts are as follows:

Rehabilitation of drainage and irrigations channels at Blackbush Polder Region Six awarded to Kascon Engineering Services at $58880860.

Repairs to intake structure at Den Amstel West Coast Demerara Region Three awarded to Khan’s Construction and Transportation Services at $27071500.

The country’s share of overseas travelers fell from 13.7% in 2015 to 11.7% in 2018 as potential visitors chose other destinations and a US Travel Association forecast expects a further decline to 10.4% by 2023. In 2016 international visitors actually decreased about 2% from 2015.

There’s no one reason for the decline and some is due to the rise of other countries as appealing destinations and strength of the U.S. dollar. Some however is attributable to the policies and rhetoric of former US president Donald Trump like the “travel ban” on certain Muslim-majority countries and a perceived hostility toward foreigners. But some travel executives warn that the visibility of mass shootings hate crimes and racism could also tarnish the US’s image with potential visitors.

While US president Joe Biden has arguably improved the US image abroad and made a point to undo controversial policies some travel executives are urging the industry not to assume a change in the White House is a panacea. Considering a full recovery of international visits will likely take years the stakes are high.

“I think we’ve got lots of work to do to restore the appeal of the United States as a global travel destination” Marriott International CEO Anthony Capuano told MSNBC’s Ali Velshi during a recent interview at the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing’s annual conference. The hotel chain posted a $267 million annual loss in 2020—its first since 2009.

Foreign travelers are still eager to visit

Despite the image problems in recent years airlines hotels and destinations still say they’re expecting to see pent-up demand from international visitors as soon as borders open.

The vaccine rollouts on US soil have stimulated domestic travel but international flights have still been largely suspended while immigration health and aviation officials work to reopen cross-border flights.

Travel companies are sending a clear message to the US government: Come up with a plan to reopen international travel safely and fast.

The urgency makes sense. The US earns more money than any country from international tourists who spend an average of $4200 on each overseas visit. But even with half of US adults vaccinated and back to maskless mingling this summer most international travelers are still waiting for the green light to visit.

Under a best-case scenario inbound international travel to the US is expected to recover in 2024 according to the most recent data from Tourism Economics a research company.

The US welcomed 79.4 million international visitors in 2019 based on statistics from the US Department of Commerce’s National Travel and Tourism Office—a slight drop from 2018 but higher than about 77.2 million people in 2017. But in 2020 the US counted only about 19.4 million visits from abroad.

The US was the world’s third-most popular tourist destination in 2018 behind France and Spain according to the World Tourism Organization. The top markets for international visitors to the US are Canada Mexico and the UK.

The lost travelers translated into a huge financial hit for the tourism industry. According to a May 11 letter from the US Travel Association to Biden the country has lost $150 billion in export income last year. And 2020 was the worst year on record for US hotels with only 44% occupancy according to data from Smith Travel Research (STR) which tracks hotel supply and demand statistics.

But international traffic should open up soon from select countries provided that issues like COVID-19 variants don’t derail those plans.

The European Union recently announced it would lift quarantine rules for vaccinated travelers and allow people to travel in the region using digital “passports” and the US and UK are setting up a task force to look at restarting air travel between the two countries but have not announced a date when it might resume.

A more welcoming climate for tourists

Biden has already taken steps to invigorate US tourism by revoking Trump’s policies. In January he ended the travel ban originally directed at citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries calling it “a stain on our national conscience.”

Destinations within the US are also trying to signal that the climate for tourists is different.

New York City which welcomed 13.5 million international visitors in 2019 turned up the volume on its messaging about being a welcoming place during the Trump years.

“There’s no doubt about this that some of the policies that were put in place by the Trump administration—the protectionist policies—created a lot of challenges for us” said Chris Heywood of NYC & Company the city’s official destination marketing organization. He was speaking from Mexico City where the organization was holding its first in-person media event since the pandemic started.

NYC & Company had to activate all of its advertising and marketing resources to reinforce its welcoming spirit said Heywood. “I don’t think we would have had to do that if we had a president that was pro-tourism and pro-welcome.”

And yet despite headlines that the travel industry was suffering from a “Trump Slump” it’s not clear the extent to which the former president affected travel. Several other factors like strong US currency and travel trends in emerging markets likely played a role as well.

“One of the big reasons [was] because the growths are from the Asia-Pacific area where people tend to travel to nearby countries rather than long-haul countries like the US” said Bing Pan an associate professor at Penn State who studies tourism and recreation.

Some markets did show declines in US visitation that appear linked to the former president. Germany which went from being the third-largest US overseas market in 2012 to the sixth in 2018 lost its appetite for US travel in favor of visiting places like Egypt Thailand and the United Arab Emirates according to data from the US Travel Association. In 2017 Bloomberg cited a survey indicating that almost half of Germans who wanted to travel to the US had changed their mind because of Trump.

And when Trump started a trade war with China in 2018 Chinese visitors to the US fell 5.7% that year after a period of steady growth. China had also warned citizens about possible harassment from US officials as well as frequent shootings and robberies in the country.

But concerns about losing potential visitors are not new. The US Travel Association refers to the period between 2000 and 2009 as “the lost decade” estimating the US missed an opportunity to attract 68 million visitors because it didn’t have a marketing strategy as international travel started booming globally. The numbers were compelling enough to convince Congress to pass a new law known as the Travel Promotion Act in 2010 which created the destination marketing organization known as Brand USA. The public-private partnership is partially funded by the application fees tourists pay for visa waivers.

The role of hate crimes and gun violence

Even if Trump’s disparaging comments about immigrants are no longer flooding the airwaves the US still visibly struggles with issues like racism gun violence and hate crimes. While it’s hard to tie any one of those issues to visitor numbers anecdotal evidence shows these factors could discourage tourists.

In a recent study from Temple University nearly half of 214 Asian American and Pacific Islanders across the US said they were concerned about traveling locally domestically and internationally after a surge in hate crimes.

“I think one way to view this is that some of the domestic social issues that the US is having will have a ripple effect on international travel to the US” said Robert Li director of Temple University’s US-Asia Center for Tourism and Hospitality Research.

Tourism officials in regions with unwelcoming politics are also worried about the impact on international travel. Nashville calculates that international travelers make up 5-7% of its overnight visitors in a typical year. Though the city is known for being more progressive than other parts of Tennessee anti-LGBT bills have made their way through the state legislature.

Butch Spyridon CEO of the Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp. said he hasn’t seen factors like mass shootings police violence or discriminatory state laws dramatically affect the US tourism industry’s bottom line yet but that they “certainly could.”

“All of those [issues] combined make the international traveler question ‘Is the US safe?’ He said. “I think so far they mostly conclude [that] yes we are still a welcoming safe country. But the more issues come up and the more often eventually if we ignore it it will have an impact on us.”

Yet for some visitors the most unwelcoming vibes come from security and immigration procedures at the airport.

“You feel like they look at you like a criminal” said Jana Isaza from the Dutch Caribbean island of Bonaire. She said she’d pay more for a flight connection that doesn’t transit through the US because the security procedures are so uncomfortable.

Peter Cain a traveler from Australia who loves visiting the US for its natural diversity national parks and friendly people agreed that the immigration and security procedures can be intimidating.

“I love going [to the US]—absolutely love it” he said. “But the immigration people scare the crap out of me.”

Looking for solutions

The public has put the world’s biggest companies under a microscope to prove they’re making good on their commitments to diversity equity and inclusion and the tourism industry is no exception.

Marriott’s Capuano said groups are increasingly digging into what kind of action the hotel chain has taken on issues like sustainability gender and race equality before booking meetings there. Tourism organizations like NYC & Company and Destination D.C. are adding more content to their websites to showcase their cities’ multicultural attractions and commitment to diversity.

“We’re proud that Washington D.C. is known as a destination for people to peacefully express their First Amendment rights” Destination D.C. president Elliott Ferguson said in an emailed statement.

Another tactic to attract more people to the US is making it easier to enter. One way to do this could be growing the list of 39 countries in the US Visa Waiver Program which allows visitors to enter the country for 90 days after filling out a quick $14 application good for multiple trips.

For citizens of other countries getting a tourist visa typically involves paying a bigger fee and making an appointment for an interview with immigration officials well ahead of a trip. Embassy closures due to the pandemic have led to long wait times in cities like Bogotá where the current average wait time for an appointment to secure a visitor visa is 616 days.

When organizing a vacation to Italy there are a few things you should know in order to have a safe and enjoyable getaway. First-time travelers take note: these are some of the things you consider for your Italian adventure.

1. Figure out what kind of trip you want to have

Italy's got it all: 4600 miles of coastline lined with hundreds of gorgeous beaches numerous tourist attractions lively cities charming villages and sprawling vineyards. From low-cost to luxury Italy has accommodation restaurants and activities to fit every budget whether it's renting a yacht off the coast of Capri staying in an affordable hostel in Rome or enjoying a Sicilian farmhouse getaway.

Or think about destinations. For each week you have of vacation you can comfortably squeeze in two destinations (maybe more if you're a very active traveler).

If you love art and tourist attractions consider Rome and Florence.

If you love fashion but also want to relax consider Milan and one of the northern lakes.

If you want pizza cityscape and coastal charm consider Nap les and the Amalfi coast.

If you want to dig into Italy's food and wine scene consider a road trip through Tuscany or Piedmont.

If you love skiing consider a visit to Milan and the Italian Alps.

If you're looking for romance consider exploring Verona and Venice.

If you need a beach vacation consider exploring an island like Sardinia or Sicily.

If you have 10 days or more and want to enjoy the most typical tourist circuit consider a trip to the big three: Rome Florence and Venice -- some of the country's most popular spots for visitors.

Note that while you can find various price points around the country for lodging dining and activities typically costs are lower in southern Italy than in northern Italy.

2. Pick the right season

In general Italy has wonderful weather. Many areas of the country see lots of sunshine and temperatures are mild even in winter though summers can be steamy. Depending on what you plan to do make sure to consider the season. Beach visits are best in the summer though months like May and September see fewer crowds and still have great weather.

Avoid larger crowded cities like Rome in the heart of summer unless you're prepared for extreme heat. Harvest season/autumn is the ideal time to visit the wine region and southern Italy can be mild throughout the winter. Many deals can be found in the low season but know that winter in the north can be cold and rainy.

If you do go to Italy between March and October bring sunblock and a hat -- don't underestimate those Mediterranean rays.

3. Do your research when it comes to tourism

Although Covid-19 has put a dampener on tourism during busier times attractions like the Vatican may see up to 30000 visitors per day. That means you may have to wait a long time in line to buy a ticket and enter. Add Rome's scorching sunshine to the mix and you may end up sunburned exhausted from queuing all day and never get the chance to step foot in the Sistine Chapel.

If visiting big-name tourist attractions is important to you buy tickets online. Skip-the-line tickets or guided tours may also be worth the price: evaluate your options and decide.

City passes are another alternative. The Milan city pass offers things like discounts on popular attractions free Milan public transport and a free drink at a local Milanese bar. The Rome tourist card has fast-track entry benefits and free access to the Vatican and the Colosseum. Florence's city pass includes skip-the-line entry to Galleria degli Uffizi and Galleria dell'Accademia plus tickets for the hop-on hop-off bus tour.

So think about what you want to do and see do the maths and purchase ahead.

4. But don't forget about local spots too

Visiting Italy's most famous attractions should hold a firm spot on your bucket list. That being said plan to take some time to get off the tourist track a bit. Consider exploring more local neighborhoods or visiting a small village or a less-popular spot like Lake Maggiore instead of Lake Como. Seeing all the big-name hotspots is a must but experiencing the beauty of true Italian culture and cuisine may be even better.

5. Take the train

The Freeciarossa runs between some of Italy's best destinations. These high-speed trains from company Trenitalia are affordable fast and comfortable. Traveling up to about 180 miles per hour trains are one of the best and quickest ways to get from A to B. And you won't have to deal with learning the Italian rules of the road or the hassle of car rental agencies. Taking the train is easy: You can purchase tickets easily online ahead of time or last minute depending on your travel style. You can visit spots like Milan Rome Florence Venice Turin and Naples on the Frecciarossa trains.

6. Don't discount the islands

Italy's island culture goes beyond just the beach. And there are over 450 of them! Sicily has a whole sub-culture of its own and far-flung spots like the Tremiti islands or the Aeolian islands will ensure you get sufficiently off-the-beaten-path. If it's luxury you desire Sardinia's Costa Smeralda is a hotspot and nothing looks sexier on an Instagram feed than Capri.

7. Familiarize yourself with the language and culture

You might get lucky when it comes to a larger city like Rome where many locals speak English.

Southern Italy or smaller villages are a different story. Luckily Italians are a friendly bunch and will do their best to communicate with you despite any language barriers. Come prepared with a few key phrases and your favorite translation app downloaded.

Even the modern city of Milan has some cobblestone streets. (Photo by Busà Photography/Getty)

Italy is old and so are its streets. Many are made of cobblestone. While locals (Milan here's looking at you) may jog by in designer stilettos you should wear comfortable footwear. Make sure to dress modesty especially when visiting churches. You won't be allowed into spots like Vatican City if your knees and shoulders aren't covered.

While mealtimes aren't quite as late as Spain's Italians tend to eat slightly later. Expect lunch around 1:00 p.m. and dinners around 8:30 p.m. or 9:00 p.m.

8. Money-saving tips

While it's normal to make a tourist faux pas or two (especially on your first trip) here are some things you should avoid:

Tipping at restaurants if it's already included on your bill (many spots add in a 10% service charge).

Heavily tipping taxi drivers (rounding up to the nearest euro is normal).

Save a little by enjoying a coffee at the bar. (Photo by Zero Creatives/Getty)

Save even more money with the following:

Take advantage of apertivo hours in northern Italy. These are happy hours that offer free buffet food for a few hours pre-dinner time in the early evening. Order a drink or two to gain access to the snacks.

Stand at the bar to drink your espresso. Table seating at breakfast has an additional charge and even more if you want to eat outside.

Beware of the ""coperto."" This is a service charge for simply eating at the restaurant usually a euro or two per person.

Don't eat or drink in the main city square. These spots are usually overpriced tourist traps.

9. Be alert for travel scams

Watch out for those trying to take advantage of unsuspecting tourists with scams:

Pickpockets;

Gladiators: If you take a photo of or with them they'll expect a tip;

Taxi scams: Insist the meter be turned on or make sure you're aware of any flat-rate pricing;

Unauthorized tour guides or ticket helpers at train stations; and

Anyone who approaches you with lavender flowers or a pizza box. Just walk the other way.

Bottom line

(Saudi Ministry of Media via AP)

DUBAI--Saudi Arabia has restricted the annual Haj pilgrimage to its own citizens and residents for the second year running in response to the coronavirus pandemic the state Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported on Saturday.

Only people aged between 18 and 65 who have been vaccinated or immunized against the virus and are free of chronic diseases will be able to take part the ministry that manages the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca said in a statement carried by SPA.

It also set a maximum of 60000 participants.

""The decision (was made) to guarantee the safety of haj amid uncertainty over the coronavirus"" the kingdom's health minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah said in a televised press conference carried by SPA.

""Despite the availability of vaccine there is uncertainty over the virus and some countries still record high numbers of COVID cases the other challenge is the different variants of the virus hence came the decision to restrict haj"" al-Rabiah said.

The minister said only approved COVID vaccines from Pfizer Astrazeneca Moderna and Johnson & Johnson will be valid for the haj.

Sources told Reuters in May a plan was being considered to bar overseas pilgrims from performing Haj a once in a lifetime duty for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it.

Before the pandemic enforced social distancing globally some 2.5 million pilgrims used to visit the holiest sites of Islam in Mecca and Medina for the week-long haj and the lesser year-round umrah pilgrimage which altogether earned the kingdom about $12 billion a year according to official data."
TRMB,Trimble Inc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdlb3NwYXRpYWx3b3JsZC5uZXQvYXJ0aWNsZS9yaWdodC1vbi10cmFjay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Right on Track,"With the help of Trimble track survey and scanning solutions Monarch Surveyors and Engineering Consultants Pvt. Ltd. was able to complete work on multiple railways projects.

Pre and post tamping surveys of railway tracks are crucial for their maintenance. A railway track settles with the passage of traffic but not always evenly leading to an uneven track formation that can result in rough riding or even train derailment. For India-based Monarch Surveyors and Engineering Consultants Pvt. Ltd. pre and post tamping surveys posed multiple challenges concerning data collection and processing until they started using Trimble track survey and scanning solutions.

From manual to automated Set up in 1992 Monarch Surveyors provides professional comprehensive services in the field of civil engineering infrastructure projects. “Over the years we have worked closely with the Indian Railways on several projects across regions and have been responsible for surveying and scanning of tracks” says Sunil Kokre Director Monarch Surveyors. Moving away from the manual process the company began using Trimble GEDO for railway projects in 2020. The Trimble GEDO Scan System is a modern efficient tool to collect detailed information about track and surrounding features. It allows the user to quickly gather precise high-resolution data for use in track clearance assessments and facilities management.

“Trimble GEDO has a particular application in track geometry or track improvisation. Railway tracks deteriorate periodically and there is a provision in the railway guidelines that calls for tamping or bringing the track back to the original level every two years. Earlier we mostly relied on manual techniques of measurements to ascertain a shift or lift in the track on each sleeper. However since we started using the GEDO trolley the process has become automated. One of the key benefits has been higher data quality” adds Kokre.

Experiencing a complete solution

Trimble GEDO Scan System consists of a track survey trolley (Trimble GEDO CE 2.0) and a highly precise IMU (inertial measurement unit) that is the key for running an efficient track survey and asset data collection. To enable usage of further applications and to guarantee best performance additional components and sensors can be added to it as well. One of them is the Trimble R8s an integrated GNSS system that lets building a system tailored to a specific job. As job requirements change the Trimble R8s adapts accordingly. It is available in post-processing base only rover only or base and rover configurations and features advanced satellite tracking with Trimble 360 receiver technology.

On the other hand the Trimble Business Center field-to- finish survey CAD software helps surveyors deliver high-accuracy GNSS data create CAD deliverables and leverage full data traceability throughout a project’s lifecycle. “In conjunction with each other Trimble’s GEDO R8s system and Business Center software work seamlessly to provide a smooth and complete track and periphery surveying experience to the user. From feasibility studies through construction and operation efficient alignment planning and accurate mapping of fixed assets to precise track measurement and construction Trimble positioning solutions help rail managers meet the demands of today and expectations of the future” says Amit Saxena Regional Sales Manager Geospatial SAARC Region Trimble.

Availing multiple benefits

While using Trimble GEDO in the pre and post tamping surveys of the newly laid tracks between Lohna Road and Nirmali stations and Bridge number 4 to Bridge number 133 Nirmali End in the Samastipur Division of the Eastern Central Railways Monarch Surveyors realized that the data collected can be uploaded to the tamping machine without any manual interference. All errors were eliminated data capturing was fast and accurate and block time decreased considerably leading ultimately to increased track utilization.

Since 2020 the company has completed nine to ten projects using Trimble GEDO. “As far as response and feedback from users particularly section engineers and railway engineers is concerned we have received appreciation. After using GEDO for tamping track geometry has improved considerably. We have even received repeat orders and our client is happy with the track geometry produced using the combination of GEDO trolley and tamping” says Kokre.

“Trimble solutions enable advanced process and workflow integration for a more streamlined operation. They offer multiple benefits to keep rail operation running smoothly and safely” concludes Saxena.",,,,,,,,,,,,

And to top it all off he’s shining on the mound. The start of the 2021 campaign has been terrific for Wright who grew up in Scotland

Not only is Mike Wright back in the states after a memorable 2020 season pitching in Korea but he’s back near his hometown. And to top it all off he’s shining on the mound.

The start of the 2021 campaign has been terrific for Wright who grew up in Scotland County NC about two hours from Charlotte. Through his first six starts of the season the North Carolina native has been one of the top pitchers in Triple-A this year. And he has come up big when his team has needed a victory.

Signed as a free agent by the Chicago White Sox on December 24 2020 the 31-year-old right-hander has excelled each time he’s been given the ball this season for the Knights. And he's getting better each start out.

After five innings pitched in each of his first two starts -- and six innings in his third start -- Wright has now pitched in the seventh inning in each of his last three starts en route to much-needed wins for the Knights.

His seven-inning performance on May 28th snapped Charlotte’s six-game losing streak and his start on June 4th snapped the team's four-game losing streak. Even more impressive his seven shutout innings on June 4th stopped the red-hot Nashville Sounds from winning a franchise record 16th-straight game.

In his next start on June 11th he pitched 6.2 solid innings to lead the Knights to their first win of the series against the Durham Bulls and helped stop a three-game losing streak.

For the season Wright is now 3-1 with a 2.21 ERA in six starts and 36.2 innings pitched with the Knights. He ranks among the Triple-A East leaders in a number of categories. He’s third in ERA (2.21) tied for fourth in strikeouts (42) third in batting average against (.178) and second in WHIP (0.90).

Over his last four starts @Mikewright_Os is 🔥🔥🔥



3-0 1.69 ERA (26.2 IP 13 H 5 R 5 ER 6 BB 27 SO)

Over his last four starts he has been nearly unhittable. Over that span (since May 19th) he is 3-0 with a 1.69 ERA (26.2 IP 13 H 5 R 5 ER 6 BB 27 SO).

Last season Wright helped guide the NC Dinos of the Korean Baseball Organization (KBO) to the franchise’s first Championship. On the field he made 29 starts for the Dinos and went 11-9 with 125 strikeouts. It was a solid year for Wright on the mound but also for his family. In the process of being overseas – during a pandemic – his son was born.

It has certainly been a great start to the year for Wright. He's back pitching in front of family and friends in a place that is not too far from where he grew up. With a career that has now spanned parts of nine seasons in the minors five in the majors and one overseas his 2021 success is well deserved.

MORE ON MIKE

He was originally drafted by the Baltimore Orioles out of East Carolina University (ECU) in the third round of the June 2011 First-Year Player Draft. He made his major league debut with the Orioles on May 17 2015 and earned the win after tossing 7.1 scoreless innings against the Angels. He later went on to record a 14.1 scoreless innings streak to begin his career the longest by a O's pitcher since Dave Ford (1978).

PROSPECT STATUS

Baseball America rated him as as a Top 10 Prospect in Baltimore's organization for five consecutive seasons (2012-2016). He was the number eight prospect in Baltimore's organization in 2012 2013 and 2015. He was ranked seventh in 2014 and 10th in 2016.

WRIGHT STATE OF MIND

Along with his sister Tiffany Mike co-founded Wright State of Mind an organization that raises awareness for those affected by dementia in honor of their mother Sherry. She was diagnosed in 2014 with Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia.

Depending on workers’ seniority with the company bonuses will range from $300 to $700 per employee. The bonuses are in addition to the more than $500 million the company has invested in wage increases and bonuses for employees over the past year.

Donnie King president and chief executive officer said the bonuses are intended to show workers how much they are appreciated and part of additional efforts the company has planned for the coming year.

“This is yet another way for us to say thank you and show how grateful we are for our front-line teams’ efforts to keep each other safe our company strong and our world fed over the past year” said King. “While 2021 presented many challenges our entire Tyson team continued to meet them head on.”

In the coming year Tyson is experimenting with other incentives to ensure job satisfaction among its workers including offering more accessible health care flexible schedules and childcare at some plants in addition to implementing a paid sick leave policy which will be effective Jan. 1 2022.

“Tyson wants to be the most sought-after place to work period” King said. “Our front-line team members tell us higher pay is important but that’s only a part of the story—they also want more flexibility and more say over their time. In rural parts of the country they don’t want to have to drive miles to see the doctor. Everything we’re doing is because our team members are the heart of our business and its future success.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qb3BsaW5nbG9iZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbF9uZXdzL2ZhbWlsaWVzLWdhdGhlci1pbi1jYXJ0aGFnZS1mb3IteW91dGgtYWdyaWN1bHR1cmUtc2hvdy1jYW1wL2FydGljbGVfYTc1YTYyZjQtY2JlOC0xMWViLTlkYWItNzM3YmIxNGMyMzlhLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Families gather in Carthage for youth agriculture show camp,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

The biggest driver of concern was a Facebook-led effort launched in 2019 to build a global payments network using crypto technology. Though that effort is now much narrower it demonstrated how the private sector could in theory create a massive currency system outside government control.

Now central banks around the world have begun exploring the idea of issuing their own digital currencies — a fiat version of a cryptocurrency that would operate more like physical cash — that would have some of the same technological benefits as other cryptocurrencies.

That could provide unwelcome competition for banks by giving depositors another safe place to put their money. A person or a business could keep their digital dollars in a virtual “wallet” and then transfer them directly to someone else without needing to use a bank account. Even if the wallet were operated by a bank the firm wouldn’t be able to lend out the cash. But unlike other crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ether it would be directly backed and controlled by the central bank allowing the monetary authorities to use it like any other form of the dollar in its policies to guide interest rates.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Digital Currency Initiative are aiming next month to publish the first stage of their work to determine whether a Fed virtual currency would work on a practical level — an open-source license for the most basic piece of infrastructure around creating and moving digital dollars.

But it will likely be up to Congress to ultimately decide whether the central bank should formally pursue such a project as Fed Chair Jerome Powell has acknowledged. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are intrigued particularly as they eye China’s efforts to build its own central bank digital currency as well as the global rise of cryptocurrencies both of which could diminish the dollar’s influence.

Democrats have especially been skeptical about crypto assets because there are fewer consumer protections and the currencies can be used for illicit activity. There are also environmental concerns posed by the sheer amount of electricity used to unlock new units of digital currencies like Bitcoin.

Warren suggested the Fed project could resolve some of those concerns.

“Legitimate digital public money could help drive out bogus digital private money while improving financial inclusion efficiency and the safety of our financial system — if that digital public money is well-designed and efficiently executed” she said at a hearing on Wednesday which she convened as chair of the Senate Banking Committee’s economic policy subcommittee.

Other senators highlighted the potential for central bank digital wallets to be used to deliver government aid more directly to people who don’t have bank accounts. A digital dollar could also be designed to have more high-tech benefits of some cryptocurrencies like facilitating “smart contracts” where a transaction is completed once certain conditions are met.

Neha Narula who’s leading the effort at MIT to work with the Boston Fed on a central bank digital currency called the project “a once-in-a-century opportunity to redesign the dollar” in a way that supports innovation much like the internet did.

Still there are a slew of unanswered policy questions around how a digital dollar would be designed such as how people would get access to the money or how much information the government would be able to see about individual transactions. The decision is also tied to a far more controversial policy supported by Democrats like Warren and Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown to give regular Americans accounts at the Fed.

“What problem is a central bank digital currency trying to solve? In other words do we need one? It’s not clear to me yet that we do” Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said. “In my view turning the Fed into a retail bank is a terrible idea.”

And “the fact that China is creating a digital currency does not mean it’s inevitable that the yuan would displace the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency” he said.

For their part banks fear a Fed-issued digital currency could make it easier for customers to pull out large amounts of deposits and convert them to digital dollars during a crisis — the virtual equivalent of a bank run — putting financial stress on their institutions and making less money available to provide credit for people businesses and markets.

It could also potentially deprive them of customers something the lenders say would interfere with lawmakers’ vision of increased financial inclusion.

“While it is true that deposit accounts are often the first step towards inclusion the benefits of a long-term banking relationship go well beyond a deposit account” the ABA said in its statement. “The same is not true of a [central bank digital currency] account with the Federal Reserve which would not grow into a lending or investing relationship.”

The Bank Policy Institute which represents large banks has also argued that many of the benefits of a digital dollar are “mutually exclusive (because they are predicated on different program designs) or effectively non-existent (because the program design that produces them comes with costs that are for other reasons unbearable).”

“The decision on whether to adopt a central bank digital currency in the United States is appropriately a long way off” BPI President and CEO Greg Baer said. “There are also complex and serious costs that will need to be considered.”

But many lawmakers think it’s worth the effort to look into it.

“The Federal Reserve should continue to explore a digital [currency]; nearly every other country is doing that” Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) said at the hearing citing the risk for the U.S. to lose its ability to deploy economic sanctions as effectively with decreased usage of the dollar.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvd3QuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMTIvb21haGEtcG9saWNlLWxvb2tpbmctYmFuay1yb2JiZXJ5LXN1c3BlY3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Omaha Police looking for bank robbery suspect,"OMAHA Neb.

NEW YORK: Investing in bitcoin and other digital currencies remains a risky game where the rules could change significantly but the payoff could be big.In response to this dilemma several leading US financial heavyweights are staying on the sidelines while an increasing number are proceeding cautiously into the growing world of crypto assets ""My own personal advice to people: Stay away from it"" JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said recently before adding ""That does not mean the clients don't want it.""JPMorgan the biggest US bank by assets is currently assessing how it can help clients transact in cryptocurrency  Dimon said last month at the bank's annual meeting.Formerly something of an investment sideshow dominated by computer geeks cryptocurrencies are sparking greater interest among mainstream investors after a big jump in bitcoin prices in 2020 and early 2021.On Thursday the venerable giant State Street announced the creation of a new digital finance division.On Wednesday the head of online trading firm Interactive Brokers vowed to establish online trading of cryptocurrencies on the platform by the end of the summer.Like its rivals Charles Schwab and Fidelity Interactive Brokers does not now offer bitcoin trading on its platform although it does give clients the option to invest in some assets that include cryptocurrencies or bitcoin futures.Investors who want to trade bitcoin can currently turn to Robinhood or the cryptocurrency specialist Coinbase.ForUsAll a platform that manages retirement accounts for small businesses on Monday announced an agreement with Coinbase that allows clients to invest up to five percent of their balances in cryptocurrencies.Investment bank Morgan Stanley in March said it would allow wealthier clients to invest in bitcoin funds while Goldman Sachs recently established a team dedicated to trading cryptocurrencies.The chief executives of Wells Fargo Citigroup and Bank of America said at a congressional hearing in late May that they are approaching the cryptocurrency landscape with caution.Fidelity Investments which established a digital assets division in 2018 to execute cryptocurrency trades for hedge funds and other institutional investors filed papers with US securities regulators for a bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF).The move could potentially expand cryptocurrency investments to a broader range of individual investors.Still many financial players are reluctant to dive into an investment realm associated with black markets that has sparked interest from US and global regulators.There is also remarkable volatility with bitcoin beginning 2021 at around $30000 and hitting $63000 in April before falling back to $34000 in June.""Speculators and those suffering from FOMO (the 'fear of missing out') will surely continue to flock to cryptos in the hopes of achieving huge returns"" said Ian Gendler of research firm Value Line.But Gendler urges clients to avoid cryptocurrency investments citing the elevated risk and the lack of a tangible asset compared with putting money into commodities or a company. Bitcoin and other digital money is also not backed by governments he noted.""Cryptocurrencies are only worth what the next investor is willing to pay"" he said.Still many in finance do not see cryptocurrency as a transient phenomenon.""We do believe bitcoin and more broadly crypto assets are a new and emerging asset class that will likely be here to stay"" said Chris Kuiper vice president at CFRA Research.CFRA expects ""the large banks as well as smaller financial institutions to continue to adopt them particularly as the infrastructure and legal/regulatory framework continues to be built out"" Kuiper added.The Basel Committee which coordinates regulation among central banks this week proposed new rules that would require banks to set aside capital for cryptocurrency investments.Gary Gensler the new head of the Securities and Exchange Commission has also said he wants to bolster protections for cryptocurrency investors telling CNBC that such investors ""don't have full protections that they have in the equity markets or in the commodity futures market.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIxLzA2LzEyL2NpdGlncm91cHMtY2VvLXNheXMtdGhpcy1kaXZpc2lvbi1pcy10aGUtYmFua3MtY3JvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citigroup's CEO Says This Division Is the Bank's Crown Jewel. Will It Pay Off for Investors?,"Investors love Citigroup's treasury and trade solutions unit and would like to see it become a bigger part of the bank.

While its new CEO Jane Fraser is attempting to turn the bank around Citigroup (C 1.21%) is trading at a very cheap valuation compared to its peers and the broader industry. Not only does Citigroup need to address regulatory issues but Fraser is also looking to refresh the bank's strategy which has held it behind the other big U.S. banks for years.

A key part of that refresh will likely involve a heavier emphasis on Citigroup's treasury and trade solutions (TTS) division which Fraser recently called the ""crown jewel"" of the bank and a big driver of valuation going forward. Let's take a look at how this division currently fits into the broader bank and whether it can help Citigroup deliver for shareholders.

What is the TTS division?

Of the four largest U.S. banks by assets Citigroup is the most difficult to understand and analyze in my opinion. Its business model is more global than those of JPMorgan Chase Bank of America or Wells Fargo and it has the smallest lending operation of any of the four. But these two factors are likely why Citigroup has developed a world-class treasury and trade division.

The TTS division is part of Citigroup's larger institutional clients group but it essentially helps businesses all over the world run their operations. TTS solutions help clients carry out import and export operations manage liquidity and process payments using analytics to help them run more efficiently. The TTS group operates in 160 countries and 140 currencies and processes roughly $3 trillion in daily transactions.

At a recent conference Fraser said:

Having run Latin America I saw companies can't operate without us multinationals on the ground. So it really becomes this network we have in cash management in foreign exchange and trade and lending. ... Just given the dynamics in the world and you know the competitive position that the business has it's very hard to unseat this.

In 2020 TTS generated more than $9.5 billion of revenue for Citigroup. At the end of the first quarter of 2021 loan balances from the TTS group reached close to $71 billion while deposits from the division totaled $649 billion.

Does TTS drive valuation?

To a certain extent TTS has been a driver of valuation because it's a part of the bank that investors and analysts cite as a huge positive at Citigroup along with the bank's investment banking and credit card operations. But the $9.5 billion in revenue Citigroup made from TTS only made up about 13% of total revenue in 2020 and it hasn't been enough in recent years to overcome issues with other parts of Citigroup's operations such as parts of its global consumer bank.

Citigroup recently just exited its consumer banking operations in 13 global markets that were inefficient used too much capital and ran into credit quality issues during the pandemic. Investors overall seemed pleased with the move but there is still work to do in Citigroup's U.S. retail bank which in general does not have nearly the same scale as the other large U.S. banks like JPMorgan.

At the same conference where Fraser spoke analyst John McDonald of Autonomous Research noted that investors have told him it would be great to see TTS become a bigger part of Citigroup's business. Unfortunately since it only makes up a smaller portion of total revenue TTS has had a difficult time overcoming some of the pitfalls from the global consumer bank. Additionally Citigroup's profits from its credit card and other investment banking capabilities are still a larger piece of the pie so TTS does not really drive the bank's valuation right now although it contributes.

The good news is Fraser seemed to indicate that the bank recognizes this and will put more investment and effort going forward in order to create unmatched platforms and TTS capabilities in the future.

Can it drive valuation?

While TTS is clearly the ""crown jewel"" of Citigroup it still needs to scale further if it's truly going to drive the bank's valuation. If Citigroup does invest more in the unit and make it a larger portion of total revenue I am sure investors will reward Citigroup with a much more attractive valuation and stock price than it currently has. And with Citigroup refreshing its strategy and starting to exit businesses and geographies it either hasn't succeeded in or doesn't have the scale to compete in it should be able to focus more on areas like TTS moving forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdG9wLWZpbmFuY2Utc3Rvcmllcy1qdW5lLTctZmludGVjaC1iYW5rZXJzLWNyZWRpdC1zdWlzc2UtZXhpdHMtMjAyMS020gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS90b3AtZmluYW5jZS1zdG9yaWVzLWp1bmUtNy1maW50ZWNoLWJhbmtlcnMtY3JlZGl0LXN1aXNzZS1leGl0cy0yMDIxLTY_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top finance stories week of June 7: Top fintech bankers HSBC hires Credit Suisse traders,"Hello readers

Uber is handing its flying car project Uber Elevate to the air taxi start-up Joby Aviation the two companies said on Tuesday. Uber will also invest $75 million in Joby’s effort to build a flying taxi while agreeing to become partners with the start-up when the flying car reaches the market.

By taking the two technology projects off the books Uber management under pressure to make the company profitable is dumping initiatives that critics said were money pits while focusing on the company’s core ride-hailing service and one of the few bright spots in the pandemic: a fast-growing delivery service. Uber recently completed the acquisition of its competitor Postmates allowing the company to double down on deliveries.

Air taxis like autonomous cars are unlikely to make a significant impact for several years and their yearly development costs run into the tens of millions if not hundreds of millions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbm5lc3NlYW4uY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyMS8wNi8xMy9uYXNodmlsbGUtdWJlci1kcml2ZXIta2lsbGVkLWFmdGVyLXN0b3BwaW5nLWhlbHAtZHJpdmVyLTI0Lzc2NzkyODYwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nashville Uber driver fatally struck while helping with flat tire,"Police have identified the Uber driver who was fatally struck on Interstate 24 Sunday as Alaa Alhashimi of Nashville Metro Nashville Police Department spokesperson Kris Mumford said. He was 38.

A driver swerved into a group of people trying to fix a flat tire leaving Alhashimi dead and critically injuring a passenger early Sunday police said. Ekene Amaefuna 26 of Nashville said he drove his Honda Pilot off course when another driver cut him off according to MNPD.

The crash happened after Marcus Utley 38 stopped his Honda Fit on I-24 near Murfreesboro Pike. He was working as an Uber driver and asked his two passengers to call for a new driver due to a flat tire.

Passengers Nathan Hood 42 and his wife Samantha Crews-Hood 42 were greeting their second driver — Alhashimi — on the shoulder when the Pilot SUV rounded a curve into the group.

Alhashimi died at the scene.

Crews-Hood was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center with critical injuries. Her husband was treated and released with minor injuries. Utley suffered minor injuries and was not taken to the hospital.

Amaefuna was not injured. Police said a witness disputes his claim that he was forced off the road by someone else.

""The investigative findings will be staffed with the District Attorney’s Office for a determination on potential criminal charges"" the department stated.

With the update your driver will be able to see which side of the street you’re waiting on so there’s no mix-up. If you’re ready for a smoother pickup experience here’s how to use Uber’s Side of the Street feature.

The new Side of Street feature which Uber unveiled on June 9 is all about helping you say goodbye to some of the anxiety when finding your ride. All you’ll have to do is request a ride as usual in the Uber app and your driver will now not only be able to see where you are on the map but also which side of the street you’re on. Drivers will be able to see which side of the street the pickup location is through an icon at the top of their map as well as with a pin that shows where it is on the route. Prior to the update drivers could only see a pin that was placed in the middle of the street of the pickup location.

Uber is also improving your pickup experience with a few other updates. One way is by giving drivers more descriptions about the pickup location such as using certain landmarks as reference points. For example the driver will now see “Pickup near Starbucks at 100 Market St” instead of just “Pickup on 100 Market St.” If you requested a trip while at a different location than your pickup location your driver will be able to see that you’re on the way — or that you’ve moved from your OG location — so that it’s easier to find you.

Of course getting to your drop-off destination is also important so Uber has some updates for the driver’s navigation experience. Uber Navigation will give drivers the options of two routes so that they can factor in both time and distance for the best possible route. The company is also in the process of improving its traffic-based rerouting. The feature will be able to anticipate traffic jams and give drivers a route that’s less congested. As a rider you’ll still be able to track your ride in the app like before.

Since Uber will be rolling out its Side of Street feature to more drivers by the end of the year you can look forward to enjoying a smoother pickup process soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtOTY4MDg5NS9VYmVyLUVhdHMtcmVhY2hlcy00MDAtMDAwLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtZm9ybWVyLUFkZWxhaWRlLWRyaXZlci5odG1s0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS05NjgwODk1L2FtcC9VYmVyLUVhdHMtcmVhY2hlcy00MDAtMDAwLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtZm9ybWVyLUFkZWxhaWRlLWRyaXZlci5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber Eats reaches $400000 settlement with former Adelaide driver,"Uber Eats paid a sacked delivery driver a $400000 settlement before judges could make a ruling that would force it to treat its drivers like employees.

Transport Workers Union secretary Michael Kaine revealed the size of the payout at the Senate Committee on Job Security.

Mr Kaine used parliamentary privilege to detail the confidential settlement that was reached between the delivery giant and Adelaide woman Amita Gupta last year.

Ms Gupta and her partner made 2200 deliveries for Uber Eats over 18 months. In one week the couple worked 96 hours and earned just $300.

She was then 10 minutes late in delivering an order when Uber Eats cut off her access to its delivery app.

Mr Kaine used parliamentary privilege to unveil details about a confidential settlement that was reached between the delivery giant and Adelaide woman Amita Gupta (pictured) last year

The delivery driver made a claim of unfair dismissal and launched legal action before she reached a confidential settlement with Uber Eats.

'Amita Gupta even if she had won an unfair dismissal case would've been entitled to a maximum of about $15000 for six months' work' Mr Kaine said.

'The settlement was made of $400000.'

Ms Gupta was initially knocked back twice by the Fair Work Commission which deemed she was not entitled to an unfair dismissal claim because she was a contractor and not an employee.

The TWU then appealed the decision to the Federal Court in November. The case was then settled before the court could deliver its judgement of the trial.

It is understood that if Ms Gupta had won the case then it would have set a precedent for other delivery drivers.

They might have been able to claim they were employees and not contractors and therefore become entitled to benefits such as annual leave and minimum wage.

'Uber Eats was attempting to tell the court that these workers were not employees and not even independent contractors' Mr Kaine said.

'In fact they were some kind of agent who were just there to facilitate a connection between restaurants and people who wanted to order food.'

Mr Kaine said Uber Eats made the settlement as it wanted to avoid having to pay its drivers more money.

'Uber Eats wanted to ensure that there was no risk that its exploitative system would be overturned by the full federal court' Mr Kaine said.

'And they were willing to pay an incredible amount of money a life-changing amount of money that moment did not occur.'

An Uber Eats spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia the matter was 'resolved by mutual agreement.'

'Both of the Fair Work Commission's previous rulings in this case confirmed that delivery-partners using the Uber Eats platform are independent contractors with the Full Bench of the Fair Work Commission finding that the characteristics of the Uber Eats business point 'decisively away' from a finding of employment' the spokesperson said.

'These were also consistent with previous rulings from the Fair Work Commission and Fair Work Ombudsman that drivers using the Uber app are independent contractors.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndrcm4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy91YmVyLWRyaXZlci1raWxsZWQtYWZ0ZXItYmVpbmctaGl0LWJ5LXZlaGljbGUtb24tc2hvdWxkZXItb2YtaS0yNC_SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy53a3JuLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvdWJlci1kcml2ZXIta2lsbGVkLWFmdGVyLWJlaW5nLWhpdC1ieS12ZWhpY2xlLW9uLXNob3VsZGVyLW9mLWktMjQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber driver killed after being hit by vehicle on shoulder of I-24,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wkrn.com/news/local-news/uber-driver-killed-after-being-hit-by-vehicle-on-shoulder-of-i-24/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndrcm4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy91YmVyLWRyaXZlci1raWxsZWQtYWZ0ZXItYmVpbmctaGl0LWJ5LXZlaGljbGUtb24tc2hvdWxkZXItb2YtaS0yNC_SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy53a3JuLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvdWJlci1kcml2ZXIta2lsbGVkLWFmdGVyLWJlaW5nLWhpdC1ieS12ZWhpY2xlLW9uLXNob3VsZGVyLW9mLWktMjQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Why Trust Us?

The search for the perfect lip product is endless. When it comes to most lip colors if it's highly pigmented the color comes off quickly. If it's long-lasting it'll over-dry your lips. As a medium skin-toned woman I also have the difficulty of finding a lip color that truly looks like a ""nude"" on my skin. When it came to the holy trinity of pigmentation comfort and long-wearing lip colors I spent over a decade searching for perfection to no avail till I tried NYX Professional Makeup's Shine Loud High Shine Lip Color ( ).

The two-step lipstick quickly rose to TikTok fame for being 100 percent transfer-proof despite the high amount of pigment it has. Though there are thousands of videos out there with people putting on the gloss then taking a sip of coffee right after to prove the color is actually transfer proof it only took me watching one of those videos to want to try it myself. While I do believe that some TikTok-famous products can get overhyped this one is absolutely worth it (especially considering the $12 price tag!).

It's no wonder the satin-finish high-shine lip color is almost always out of stock but when you do get the chance you'll want to snag every shade you can get your hands on. Here's why it's my favorite lip product I've ever used:

It's actually transfer-proof.

Lots of lip products claim to be transfer-proof but the second you finish your morning coffee or take a bite in to lunch the color is either totally gone or streaky. When I first tried this I actually quickly put it on before running out the door and forgot about it till I came home to take off my makeup several hours later.

I had grown complacent with seeing my bare lips at the end of most nights so was shocked to see that the high pigment lip color had remained through hours of errands dinner drinks and (the ultimate test!) even a make-out sesh. Below are pictures of me wearing the gloss at the beginning of the night and then at the end. There's practically no difference at all though my lips are definitely looking a little less glossy at the end of the night.

The shades work for my medium-toned skin.

I have medium-toned skin and a mixed range of undertones from pink and blue to yellow orange and red. While most lip colors on the mass market cater to those with a pink or blue undertone every single one of the shades I tried worked perfectly on my Indian skin.

Choosing a favorite would be like having to pick a favorite child but Global Citizen Magic Maker Cash Flow and Goal Crusher were my favorites for a brown-hued nude that will look great on medium to darker skin tones.

It's comfortable on my dry lips.

A self-proclaimed lip balm addict I was nervous about this over-drying my lips as most high-pigment lip products have done in the past. But because the two-step duo starts with a pigmented lip stain and then is sealed in with a high-shine gloss it feels super nourishing—in fact when I first used it I thought that it felt so buttery and smooth on my lips that there was no way it could also be so pigmented.

It turns out that the base coat is infused with natural ingredients like nourishing jojoba oil designed to keep lips looking and feeling comfortable all night. I won't lie—I did feel like I wanted some chap stick by the very end but it wasn't unbearable in the way I've felt with a lot of lip stains in the past. You could easily get away without reapplying this for eight hours just as I did but I think for optimal comfort and shine you'll want to do a touch-up every five to six hours.

For the price you have nothing to lose—be sure to snag every color that's in stock now while you can.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZWF0c2hlZXQuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvb25lLWRpcmVjdGlvbi1tZW1iZXItbG91aXMtdG9tbGluc29uLXNpc3Rlci1sb3R0aWUuaHRtbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who Is One Direction Member Louis Tomlinson's Sister Lottie?,"Who is One Direction member Louis Tomlinson's sister Lottie?

Louis Tomlinson rose to fame in 2010 thanks to One Direction and his own sheer talent. His family consequently also got a taste of stardom due to Tomlinson’s new fame. His sister Charlotte “Lottie” is closest to him in age and has made a career for herself in the influencer world. Find out more about the oldest Tomlinson sister — and how she has made her own name for herself throughout the years following her brother’s One Direction career.

Louis Tomlinson auditioned on ‘The X Factor’ in 2010 and became a star in One Direction

The oldest Tomlinson sibling auditioned for The X Factor in 2010 following his stint as Danny Zuko in his school’s production of Grease. He joined the group One Direction while on the show alongside Harry Styles Niall Horan Zayn Malik and Liam Payne.

Following placing third on The X Factor the five boys started their global pop denomination with the album Up All Night. They subsequently released Take Me Home Midnight Memories Four and Made in the A.M. They also released concert movies fragrances and plenty of merchandise.

Who is One Direction member Louis Tomlinson’s sister Lottie? How did Lottie Tomlinson get famous?

While Tomlinson toured from 2010 to 2015 in One Direction his little sister Lottie accompanied him. She learned from makeup artist Lou Teasdale while assisting her on tour. This gave Lottie an early lesson on all things beauty.

Years after touring with One Direction Lottie created Tanologist a vegan and cruelty free tanning water. The line has multiple products and sells at big-name stores such as Target and Ulta.

“As a make-up artist and beauty nerd I’m constantly experimenting with different products — mixing tans into my foundation and moisturiser — you name it I’ve tried it but nothing has given me that flawless glowing skin finish I’m obsessed with” she said. She developed Tanologist to provide “clean clear and streak-free results.”

Tomlinson boasts more than four million Instagram followers and is often promoting her tanning line. She regularly shares pictures of herself in bathing suits showing her product in action with her tanned skin.

Tomlinson also uses her social media to give fans an insight into her personal life. She dedicated a Mother’s Day Instagram post to her mother Johannah who died in 2016.

“Happy Mother’s Day angel still can’t believe how lucky I am to have had you” she wrote. “I’ll never stop missing you Mama x sending love to anyone who finds today difficult if anyone wants to chat I’ll be in my dms.”

What age is Lottie Tomlinson? How old was Lottie Tomlinson in 2010?

The oldest Tomlinson sister was born on Aug. 4 1998. When her brother auditioned on The X Factor she was only 12 years old at the time. She has other siblings besides Louis: Phoebe Daisy Félicité (who tragically died in 2019) Doris and Ernest.

Pato O’Ward took the NTT INDYCAR SERIES points lead with a drive full of championship-caliber mettle passing Josef Newgarden with three laps remaining to win the Chevrolet Dual in Detroit Race 2 on Sunday at Belle Isle Park.

O’Ward 22 became the first two-time winner this season in the NTT INDYCAR SERIES after the first seven races opened with different winners. He also won the XPEL 375 on May 2 at Texas Motor Speedway.

Mexican driver O’Ward who started 16th powered away from two-time series champion Newgarden’s No. 2 Hitachi Team Penske Chevrolet after the decisive pass in his No. 5 Arrow McLaren SP Chevrolet and drove to victory by 6.7595 seconds. He leads the championship by one point over Alex Palou who finished third in the No. 10 The American Legion Honda.

O’Ward dedicated his win to teammate Felix Rosenqvist forced to sit out this race due to a heavy crash in Race 1 Saturday and longtime McLaren Racing shareholder Mansour Ojjeh who died June 6.

“I talked to Felix this morning and the important thing is that he’s OK but I told him ‘I’m going to win it for you’” O’Ward said. “So this is for him and for Mansour.”

Colton Herta finished fourth in the No. 26 Gainbridge Honda. Graham Rahal placed fifth in the No. 15 United Rentals Honda – identical to his finish Saturday in Race 1.

Detroit Race 1 winner Marcus Ericsson finished ninth in the No. 8 Huski Chocolate Chip Ganassi Racing Honda slowed by contact with Rinus VeeKay’s No. 21 Sonax/Autogeek Chevrolet in a duel for position on Lap 15.

O’Ward’s charge to the front was breathtaking from the 16th starting position. He passed six cars and jumped to 10th in the opening five laps while racing on the Firestone alternate “red” tires.

But the charismatic O’Ward saved his best maneuvers for last.

Romain Grosjean stopped on course with a small fire in his left front brake on Lap 59 triggering the last of three full-course cautions in the race. On the restart on Lap 63 O’Ward was fifth behind Newgarden Herta Palou and Rahal.

But O’Ward dove under Rahal in Turn 1 for fourth and then devoured Palou and Herta for second place with defiant but clean maneuvers.

Then O’Ward set sail for Newgarden while keeping his eye on his mirrors for Herta’s pressure from behind. Herta locked up trying to pass O’Ward for second with three laps to go effectively ending his chances for victory.

O’Ward then dove under Newgarden in Turn 7 on Lap 68 for the lead with the two cars touching and drove away to glory. Newgarden led 67 of the first 70 laps with O’Ward pacing the final three trips around the 14-turn 2.35-mile temporary street circuit.

“He was coming like a freight train” Newgarden said. “What are you going to do? I just couldn’t do anything. I had so much wheelspin. My rear tires were just shot to death on the last 10 laps. Just trying to be aggressive and the restarts don’t help you. None of it played into our favor especially the first caution.”

The race began with NTT P1 Award winner Newgarden as just one of three drivers in the 25-car field to start on Firestone primary “black” tires joining teammate Will Power in the No. 12 Verizon 5G Team Penske Chevrolet and James Hinchcliffe in the No. 29 Genesys Honda.

That strategy choice forced Newgarden to stretch his first stint on the harder more durable primary tires as long as possible while most of the drivers who started on the Firestone alternate “red” tires pitted during the caution created on Lap 1 when Max Chilton’s No. 59 Carlin Chevrolet collided with the back of Hinchcliffe’s car in tight traffic.

Newgarden’s lead built to more than 12 seconds before he pitted on Lap 20 for another set of primary tires. He wanted to run longer to reduce the number of laps on the grippier but less-durable alternate tires late in the race. INDYCAR rules mandate that every driver uses the primary and alternate tires in road and street-course races.

But it was uncertain whether the stalled No. 4 K-Line Insulators/AJ Foyt Racing Chevrolet of Dalton Kellett could be removed from the track without a full-course caution and Newgarden didn’t want to lose track position pitting under yellow. So he pitted even though Kellett’s car later was cleared without a full-course caution.

“None of this played into our favor especially the first caution” Newgarden said. “We had to pit because we weren’t sure if they were going to go full-course caution and if we don’t pit we get completely hosed. So we had to put an extra seven eight 10 laps on the (alternate) tires that we didn’t want to. It would have been a lot easier if we kept it cleaner and that was our plan. But it just didn’t work our way.”

Newgarden built a lead of nearly 10 seconds over Herta during his second stint also on Firestone primary tires before pitting for slightly used Firestone alternate tires on his last stop on Lap 46.

That lead was reduced to 4.3 seconds after Newgarden’s final pit stop and Herta sliced that gap to .364 of a second on Lap 52 before Jimmie Johnson slid through Turn 1 in his No. 48 Carvana Chip Ganassi Racing Honda on Lap 54 triggering the second full-course caution and packing the field behind Newgarden for a restart.

“It’s hard not to be disappointed” Newgarden said. “I think we had the car to beat. Cautions at the end wrong tires at the end. It was a fun strategy. I think we were doing well. It was just the caution that killed us. My rears were shot and I didn’t really need that. We tried.”

A Toronto condo developer is buying hundreds of detached houses in Ontario with the plan of renting them and profiting on the housing crisis ripping across the country.

Core Development Group Ltd. is building a large-scale single-family home rental operation an unproven business model in Canada where the market is fragmented and individual investors lease a small number of their own properties for income.

Institutional house rentals have become highly lucrative in the United States with private-equity firms pension funds and big companies throwing billions of dollars into the asset class. In Canada deep-pocketed investors as well as real estate investment trusts have already acquired hundreds of apartment buildings to tap into the strong rental demand but have not moved into rental houses.

Core founder Corey Hawtin and executive vice-president Faran Latafat questioned why there wasn’t a similar business in Canada which has had a rental vacancy rate below 3 per cent since the turn of the century.

“We were trying to answer the question: Why is nobody doing this in Canada? We could not come up with an objective answer to that. In Canada it works as well or better than the U.S.” said Ms. Latafat Core’s president of single-family development.

Core’s main business is condo development and it has 14 projects in the Toronto region. Last fall Mr. Hawtin raised $250-million from investors to buy approximately 400 properties add basement apartments and turn the houses into two rental units.

Core is targeting eight midsized cities in Ontario and this year started buying properties in Kingston St. Catharines London Barrie Hamilton Peterborough and Cambridge. It will soon start buying in Guelph. Its medium-term goal is to have a $1-billion portfolio of 4000 rental units in Ontario Quebec B.C. and Atlantic Canada by 2026.

Mr. Hawtin said Core’s rental units will provide affordable housing for families and residents who do not want to live in small apartments. If Core succeeds it could spur major investors to follow suit.

Ms. Latafat and Mr. Hawtin believe a major house rental business will flourish in Canada because of decades of low rental vacancy rates desire for more space and high immigration. They also point out most of the country’s population is concentrated around a few job centres.

As well the pandemic’s real estate boom has priced even more residents out of the housing market with rentals as the only option. National home prices are 20 per cent above prepandemic levels with values 30 to 50 per cent higher in parts of Ontario B.C. Quebec and the Maritimes. The typical price of a detached house in Guelph and nearby Kitchener-Waterloo is now more than $800000 according to the Canadian Real Estate Association. That is about $200000 more than a year ago.

Economist David Rosenberg said an affordable rental house could become more attractive to a potential home buyer because house prices are so high.

“The ratio of home prices to rental rates is so extreme that new entrants to residential real estate will gravitate to the rental market” said Mr. Rosenberg who leads Rosenberg Research & Associates adding that if more potential buyers are forced to rent that could eventually reduce competition in the residential real estate market and slow home price increases.

Ms. Latafat said Core chose the eight Ontario cities because they all have strong local economies are close to larger job centres have growing populations and low housing vacancy rates.

In Barrie and Guelph the rental vacancy rate is closer to 2 per cent according to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. data. Meanwhile in the first year of the pandemic rental rates have increased in the high single digits in Barrie Guelph London and St. Catharines according to CMHC.

“They have tight vacancies like zero vacancies” said Mr. Hawtin. “Immigration is growing population is growing and buying a house or a condo has become less and less attainable. That is really compounding the rental demand in all of our marketplaces” he said.

So far this year Core has spent $50-million on 75 properties the executives said. Their two-bedroom basement apartments go for about $1600 a month and a three-bedroom above-ground unit at about $2100 a month. Those prices are higher than the average rental rate of $1407 for a two-bedroom apartment in Ontario according to CMHC data. Though Core’s rentals are newly renovated units in houses with gardens.

Institutionalized family home rentals got their start south of the border after the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007 and companies bought thousands of houses at fire-sale prices. Companies and their investors now own swaths of U.S. neighbourhoods and make money on the rent similar to apartment building owners.

Toronto-based Tricon Residential one of the largest operators of single family home rentals in the U.S. said Core’s decision to split the properties into two rental units makes sense given the price of houses in Canada.

“The problem in Canada is that homes are so expensive” said Tricon chief executive officer Gary Berman whose company has wanted to bring single family home rentals to Canada for years but has concluded that it is unworkable owing to the high real estate prices.

Tricon owns about 24000 detached houses in 18 major U.S. cities. Most are in warmer climates such as Orlando and Phoenix. Mr. Berman said that makes the houses easier to maintain compared to Canadian properties which have to withstand long harsh winters.

Tricon keeps its purchase prices below US$350000 a house and rents the entire property for about US$1500 a month. Mr. Berman said the key to the business is scale saying Tricon aims to have at least 500 rental houses in each city.

Core is also trying to build scale and is buying houses within 15 minutes of each other to form a cluster of about 50 properties or 100 rental units in each city. Ms. Latafat said it has taken Core about one month to rent their new units and their vacancy rate is below 2 per cent. She declined to comment on when the rental business would be profitable except to say that the rental units were “cash flow positive” about five months after they were purchased.

Mr. Hawtin said he expects to start fundraising for the next stage of the rental business as soon as next year and may consider going public at some point.

Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story stated that Faran Latafat is leading Core’s single-family home rental division. It has since been clarified to state that she is Core's president of of single-family development.

The mental health issues common in the deaf community include depression anxiety and severe illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

Mental illnesses are compounded in the deaf community by difficulties communicating with care providers — researchers have found that lip-reading isn't adequate interpreters who know sign language are scarce and many diagnostic tools depend on knowledge that's not common among those who are deaf.

Mental Health in the Deaf Community

Lots of people have some hearing loss — between 15% and 26% of the population according to one study. But it's a different issue to be profoundly deaf especially if you became deaf before you had a chance to learn spoken language. About seven in every 10000 people fall into this category and most regard themselves as a cultural minority that uses sign language instead of spoken language.

Struggles to function in a hearing world can lead to mental health issues. In one study involving hearing-impaired individuals some 41% said they believed that communication problems coupled with family stresses and overall prejudice could cause or contribute to suicidal depression substance abuse or violent behavior in some cases.

If your loved one is deaf and having suicidal thoughts contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor. If you or a loved one are in immediate danger call 911. For more mental health resources see our National Helpline Database.

Other studies have found that about one-quarter of deaf students have learning difficulties developmental delay visual impairment or autism. Deaf children who have trouble communicating with their families are four times more likely to be affected by mental health disorders than deaf children who have few or no problems communicating with family members.

Bullying of deaf children also may be common at school and deaf boys and girls are much more likely to be victims of sexual assault.

Communication Needed but Scarce

Mental health services are difficult for deaf people to access. One small study involving 54 people found that more than half hadn't been able to find mental health services that they as deaf people could use.

In addition psychiatric conditions such as mood disorders are frequently under-diagnosed in the deaf community in large part due to communication difficulties that include:

few experienced interpreters between English and sign language

problems in translation between spoken and sign language

differences in how deaf people display feelings and perceive mental health

Reading and writing aren't an adequate substitute for spoken language in this context. Hearing loss interferes quite a lot with vocabulary and so many deaf high school graduates read and write at a grade-school level.

In addition lip-reading is far from 100% accurate — the average deaf adult can lip-read only 26% to 40% of speech.

How to Access Mental Health Services

Because of these communication problems the majority of participants in one study of deaf individuals found that the deaf preferred a deaf professional to provide them with mental health services.﻿﻿ In addition experienced interpreters are very important ... but they're only the first step in helping the deaf access adequate mental health services.

Issues with time are important in diagnosing mental disorders — questions such as ""Have you experienced difficulty sleeping for one month or more during the past year?"" or ""for six months or more?"" are common. However these concepts are hard to describe in sign language as are phrases such as ""feeling on edge.""

Finally questions in diagnostic interviews that rely on the knowledge of what it's like to hear pose real difficulties: How does one ask someone who's been deaf his whole life if he has been ""hearing voices""?

Differences Important to Recognize

Mental health providers must also learn how to recognize and address the differences in how a deaf individual displays feelings and expressions from those who are hearing.

For example someone who is deaf may pound on the floor to get attention. While this is considered aggressive by those who can hear it is actually quite accepted and normal within the deaf community.

Also while strong emotional displays are pretty much frowned upon in the hearing community members of the deaf community count on the vivid expression of emotion to convey meaning. As a matter of fact one study found that clinicians often labeled rapid signing as a symptom of psychotic behavior rather than the change of mood that was actually indicated.﻿﻿ And there are few signs within sign language that can account for subtle changes in mood.

What Can Be Done to Help the Deaf Community?

A research study of cultural and linguistic barriers to mental health found that many deaf people have a fear of being incorrectly committed because they are unable to communicate with the staff. One participant is quoted as saying ""Even if I were just asking for directions at the information desk [of a psychiatric hospital] miscommunication could lead to my being committed mistakenly ... I don't want to go there even for a visit!""

This study further indicated that participants felt professionals erroneously consider a nominal level of communication to be adequate. One practitioner looked at bipolar disorder in patients who had become deaf before they learned to speak and found that those making diagnoses often emphasized appearance over documented symptoms and other information.

While it will be difficult to solve these problems some solutions are possible. Hearing-impaired people should be encouraged to consider careers in the mental health field and mental health professionals should secure more translators to work with the mentally ill.

The National Association of the Deaf notes that deaf people have the right to push for referrals to mental health professionals who have experience working with those who are deaf or are hard of hearing. The organization also says that deaf people have the right to communicate ""in the language and mode of communication that is effective for you"" and to clearly understand the diagnosis and recommendations for their treatment.

Clinicians who have little or no experience working with the hearing-impaired should use extreme caution and seek second opinions when diagnosing the deaf. In addition research and effort are needed to bridge the language barriers which now make it so difficult to communicate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmFpdHN0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYWZ0ZXItdGhlLXBhbmRlbWljLWEtd2F2ZS1vZi1zcGVuZGluZy1ieS1vbGRlci1jb25zdW1lcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,After the pandemic a wave of spending by older consumers,"(BLOOMBERG) - The world's emergence from the coronavirus pandemic is set to unleash a wave of spending by older consumers with increasing opportunities for investors in ageing-linked stocks.

That's the view of money managers who see huge pent-up demand from wealthy seniors for medical services and luxury goods. They also expect that the forced adoption of the Internet by older people during lockdown will open up this demographic permanently to e-commerce companies and social networks.

The number of people aged 65 and over is projected to double to more 1.5 billion by 2050 greatly increasing their economic impact. The total spending power of the older population globally was about US$8.4 trillion (S$11.1 trillion) in 2020 according to World Data Lab. That's expected to grow to US$14 trillion over the next decade.

""The pandemic has accelerated many of the issues related to aging populations and has highlighted the urgency of resolving them"" said Mr Christopher Rossbach chief investment officer at J. Stern. ""We think they will be significant drivers for growth and investment.""

Underpinning the thesis are global fertility rates that are forecast to keep falling as life expectancy rises even as the virus takes a staggering human toll. China's decision in May to allow three-child families may have only limited impact on the ageing trend in the most populous country.

Here are some key focuses of investors who argue that the ageing theme will be even more important as economies move past the pandemic.

Pent-up medical demand

From cancer screening to hip replacements and cataract surgery countless medical procedures have been postponed since the virus took hold. As this changes global healthcare spending is projected to bounce back in 2021 rising 5.8 per cent to US$8.8 trillion according to IHS Markit.

Mr Rossbach expects shares of medical device manufacturers to benefit and cited Thermo Fisher Scientific Medtronic Becton Dickinson and Alcon.

Shares of all four companies have underperformed the global stock benchmark so far this year.

Mirabaud Asset Management also likes Medtronic as well as Edwards Lifesciences for exposure to the cardiovascular diseases sector said global equities head Anu Narula.

Hearing aids are another market hurt by fewer in-person consultations with Morgan Stanley estimating sales will normalise this year following a 15 per cent decline in the market in 2020. Among businesses in this field it has an overweight recommendation on Copenhagen-listed GN Store Nord and equal-weight on Demant which have both surged this year.

""The large contingent of developed countries that have universal health coverage is being joined by an increasing number of developing markets that are establishing and/or expanding universal health-care systems especially in emerging Asian markets"" said Mirabaud's Mr Narula.

Yearning for luxury and travel

As well as long-delayed holidays the travel sector is poised to pick up with support from cashed-up seniors. ""Older or richer people tend to want to visit relatives more"" said Mr Sanjiv Bhatia founder of Pembroke Emerging Markets.

Mr Rossbach also has his eye on a rebound in luxury spending with LVMH and liquor makers Pernod Ricard and Diageo among his preferred reopening bets.

""A general point is that as people age their purchasing power increases and they become more concerned with quality not quantity of their consumption"" he said.",,,,,,

En los últimos días la diseñadora inglesa ha decidido lanzar una camiseta con motivo del mes del Orgullo Gay y está siendo todo un éxito en ventas y es que para la ocasión ha conseguido la colaboración del grupo con el que saltó a la fama cuando todavía era cantante: las 'Spice Girls'.

Un proyecto muy especial y exitoso

La esposa de David Beckham se ha convertido en los últimos días en una de las principales personalidades que han decidido mostrar su apoyo públicamente en la lucha contra la homofobia algo que desde siempre ha respaldado pero que en este mes se acentúa. Por ello ha pensado que no podría hacerlo de mejor manera que lanzando una camiseta de edición limitada que está arrasando en ventas y con la que espera obtener ese impulso tan necesario para remediar la difícil situación económica que atraviesa su negocio.

Para la elaboración de la prenda ha colaborado no sólo con las 'Spice Girls' sino también con Albert Kennedy Trust llevando uno de los éxitos más icónicos del grupo como principal lema de la camiseta. El próximo mes de julio se cumplirán 25 años del exitoso 'Wannabe' por lo que esta camiseta lleva el lema 'Proud and wannabe your lover'; un juego de palabras que está encantando a sus seguidores.

Por supuesto la recaudación de su venta irá destinada a Albert Kennedy Trust para que siga financiando la lcuha contra la falta de vivienda para jóvenes LGTBQ+ en el Reino Unido. La camiseta puede adquirirse a través de su página web por el precio de 90 euros aunque ya se han agotado las tallas más grandes. ""Estoy muy orgullosa de apoyar el Pride 2021"" escribió la propia Victoria Beckham compartiendo el diseño en los últimos días en sus redes sociales.

La reducción de las restricciones por el virus en los establecimientos y el continuo interés en los discos de vinilo les dieron a las tiendas y a los compradores un motivo para celebrar el sábado en la primera de dos fechas del Record Store Day.

Aunque muchas tiendas estuvieron cerradas al inicio de la pandemia de coronavirus la gente escuchaba discos en casa e impulsó las ventas de discos de vinilo por internet y para recogerlos en las tiendas.

Will Emanuel un estudiante de la Universidad de Maine que permaneció en su casa a las afueras de Portland compró entre 50 y 55 álbumes durante la pandemia. “Estaba ansioso de crear una colección” dijo Emanuel. “Caí en la trampa y ahora parece que no puedo salir”.

Emanuel de 20 años es parte de una nueva generación que se siente atraída al sonido cálido la carátula y al ambiente retro de los discos de vinilo uniéndose a otros estadounidenses que crecieron con el formato para aumentar las ventas.

Las ventas de discos de vinilo subieron un 29% en el 2020 a US$ 626 millones superando el ingreso de ventas de los discos compactos de acuerdo con la Asociación de la Industria Discográfica de Estados Unidos.

Los casetes de audio también están experimentando un renovado interés aunque siguen siendo una novedad en lo que respeta a las ventas totales gracias a la ayuda que han recibido de Hollywood y Netflix.

En la película de Marvel “Guardianes de la Galaxia” aparece un casete con los éxitos de la década de 1960 y de 1970 que se convirtió en un éxito de ventas mientras que en la serie “Stranger Things” de Netflix se muestra una cinta con canciones de The Clash y otros artistas de la década de 1980.

Este renovado interés por los discos de vinilo y casetes es un buen augurio para la celebración anual de las tiendas de música indie esos centros musicales locales donde la gente puede buscar discos CD y casetes y hablar de música.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsc3VkY2FsaWZvcm5pYW5vLmNvbS5teC9sb2NhbC9tdW5pY2lwaW9zL2NhZW4tdmVudGFzLWVuLXB1ZXN0b3MtZGUtY2FmZS04MC1lbi1sYS1wYXotNjgzNzExMC5odG1s0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWxzdWRjYWxpZm9ybmlhbm8uY29tLm14L2xvY2FsL211bmljaXBpb3MvY2Flbi12ZW50YXMtZW4tcHVlc3Rvcy1kZS1jYWZlLTgwLWVuLWxhLXBhei02ODM3MTEwLmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caen ventas en puestos de café 80% en La Paz,"La Paz Baja California Sur (OEM-Informex).- Caen las ventas hasta en un 80% en algunos de los negocios de café en la ciudad de La Paz. Tras 3 años en el negocio de café la señora Cristina Geraldo aseguró que la pandemia a afectado gravemente a estos negocios. Además de mencionar que ante la falta de clases presenciales y el cierre de las mismas en guarderías kínderes primarias y secundarias en los niveles más básicos de la educación los clientes han bajado notablementeasí como las ventas.

La señora Cristina Geraldo dueña de un café ubicado en la calle Licenciado Primo Verdad y calle Oaxaca señalo que la llegada de la pandemia ha afectado a muchos negocios de café quienes han bajado sus ventas de manera notoria sufriendo las consecuencias en una economía debilitada y vulnerable.

“En estos 3 años del café lo más difícil ha sido la llegada de la pandemia la cual nos tomo de sorpresa. Prácticamente no había venta los clientes no venían por el mismo miedo a los contagios y un pánico impresionante por tantas noticias tan feas que salían en los medios que nos llegaban a nuestro celular”.

Municipios ¡Llega el calor! suben ventas en hieleras de La Paz

“La verdad es que o no teníamos ventas al día o solamente vendíamos a lo mucho de un 10% a un 20% lo cual era una situación muy difícil de superar. Además nuestros clientes más frecuentes eran los de las escuelas los padres y madres de familias esto nos pego mucho al negocio porque ya no venían por el lonche porque cerraron las escuelas”.

Actualmente aseguró que las ventas bajaron en un 80% además tuvieron que cerrar por un mes y medio el negocio de café debido a que en la familia les dio esta enfermedad provocada por el virus del Covid-19 por lo cual se vieron obligados a cerrar el negocio y hacer cuarentena en el mismo hogar sin salir a ninguna parte.

“En la familia tuvimos el contagio por el Covid-19 estuvimos un mes y medio sin abrir el negocio afortunadamente pudimos superar esta enfermedad porque no nos pego tan fuerte tampoco tuvimos ningún fallecimiento en la familia una vez recuperados volvimos a abrir siguiendo todas las medidas e indicaciones de salud”.

“Ya se ve un poco mas de movimiento mucha gente tiene que ir a trabajar nos estamos recuperando un poquito pero todavía nos falta mucho para recuperarnos en las ventas. Lo bueno es que no pago renta porque aquí vivo esto me ayudo un poco a no cerrar porque en realidad muchas personas que rentaban tuvieron que cerrar por lo mismo”.

La mayor venta es de café avena burritos empanadas y sándwiches. El horario es de 6 de la mañana a 12 y media del día de lunes a sábados. Muchos de estos negocios han desaparecido al tener que pagar renta y simplemente no tener ingresos para cubrir el monto de la renta debemos de apoyar lo más posible a los negocios locales familiares para que no tengan que cerrar sus puertas y seguirnos cuidando por el tema de la pandemia."

New York cannot require internet providers to offer broadband service for low-income customers for as little as $15-a-month starting next week a federal judge ruled on Friday.

The low-income broadband consumers law passed in the state budget in April which was supposed to come into effect on Tuesday. It allowed the state’s attorney general to issue penalties up to $1000 per violation from providers.

USTelecom CTIA the New York State Telecommunications Association and other industry groups representing internet providers had sued in April arguing that the law meant they could either face penalties for not complying or be forced to provide the services “at a loss.”

U.S. District Court Senior District Judge Denis R. Hurley of the Eastern District of New York said in a preliminary injunction ""the internet's promise of access"" hinges on whether people can afford it.

But the judge said the internet providers have shown that they could suffer “imminent irreparable injury” because of the law's potential impact on their wallets. Three of the internet companies told the court that the law would reduce annual net income by at least $1 million each.

“While a telecommunications giant like Verizon may be able to absorb such a loss others may not” the judge wrote. “The Champlain Telephone Company for example ‘estimates that nearly half of its existing broadband customers will quality for discounted rates’ with each customer ‘causing a monetary loss.’”

The law also requires providers to advertise the broadband plan for low-income consumers. Verizon estimated the ad campaign would cost between $250000 and $1 million.

New York state argued those estimates aren't backed by any financial records.

But Judge Hurley said that state didn't cite any reason that the courts shouldn't rely on the internet companies' financial estimates which they submitted under penalty of perjury.

The judge questioned whether a state can tell an internet provider how much they can charge consumers. Internet providers have argued they are primarily subject to federal law which regulates interstate commerce.

In February a federal judge's ruling cleared the way for the state of California to ban internet providers from slowing down or blocking access to websites and applications that don’t pay for premium service.

But Judge Hurley pointed out that California's attorney general had argued that the state's law did “'not regulate how much providers can charge their customers.'”

The judge also noted that low-income individuals can now ask for $50 off their monthly bill under a new temporary federal benefit.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said that New York will keep defending the law.

“We always knew big telecom would pull out all the stops to protect their profits at the expense of the New Yorkers who need access to this vital utility the most"" Azzopardi said in a Friday statement. ""We are going to continue to fight for them.”"

The late royal attended a dinner hosted by then-President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan at which she danced with famous men like actor John Travolta and singer Neil Diamond.

Recently Travolta opened up about dancing with the Princess of Wales in an interview with Esquire Mexico describing the experience as a ""fairytale"" and a ""magical moment.""

""Think of the setting. We were at the White House. It's midnight. The stage is like a dream. I approach her touch her elbow invite her to dance"" he explained. ""She spins around and gives me that captivating smile just a little sad and accepts my invitation. And there we were dancing together as if it were a fairytale. Who could ever imagine something like that would happen to them someday? I was smart enough to stamp it in my memory as a very special magical moment.""

In April former White House photographer Pete Souza shared his own memory from Diana's visit to the Capitol—specifically her dance with Diamond.

⁣

""After posting my photograph of Diana and John Travolta yesterday many of you had asked to see a picture of her dancing with Neil Diamond"" Souza wrote on Instagram along with a photo of the moment. ""Accompanied by the military band Neil sang a few of his songs. I distinctly remember him singing 'You Don’t Bring Me Flowers.' My recollection–and I can’t be sure this is correct–is that he continued singing this song as he danced with her.⁣ The one rock-solid remembrance I have is that Diana was visibly blushing when she danced with Neil. In the photograph you can see that her cheeks are a bit red but in the moment it was even more obvious.⁣""

There have been two African unicorns this year Flutterwave and Chippercash with valuations of over $1billion.

Founded in 2009 by Tayo Oviosu the company processed $2.3 billion worth of transactions in 2020 and $8 billion during the past four years. It has 17 million unique users including tech entrepreneurs businesses and individuals in Africa’s most populous nation.

Paga has over 27000 agents across the country who perform similar roles like bank tellers with many retail outlets where consumers can access services like bill payments and other types of transactions.

Paga is also making its programming interface available to tech entrepreneurs for payments while expanding its consumer business through the partnership with Visa.

In a tweet made by Tayo the company crossed N3 trillion in transaction values processed since the company started operations in 2012. They reached N2 trillion in March 2020 and N3 trillion in May 2021.

The company has top investors like U.S. billionaire investor Tim Draper and former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist Jim O’Neil. Tayo in an interview with Bloomberg said that Paga could reach a valuation of at least $1 billion “in the next year or two.”

The company is looking to expand into Ethiopia and Mexico where it could also facilitate payments for the millions who lack access to banking services. Expansion into Ethiopia Africa’s second-most populous nation is set for next year.

We at Insider Monkey like to examine what billionaires and hedge funds think of a company before spending days of research on it. Given their 2 and 20 payment structure hedge funds have more incentives and resources than the average investor. The funds have access to expert networks and get tips from industry insiders. They also employ numerous Ivy League graduates and MBAs. Like everyone else hedge funds perform miserably at times but their consensus picks have historically outperformed the market after risk adjustments.

Visa Inc (NYSE:V) has seen a decrease in support from the world’s most elite money managers recently. Visa Inc (NYSE:V) was in 164 hedge funds’ portfolios at the end of March. The all time high for this statistic is 166. There were 166 hedge funds in our database with V holdings at the end of December. Our calculations also showed that Visa ranked 5th among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings).

Hedge funds’ reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds’ small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016 but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by 115 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter.

Do Hedge Funds Think V Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?

At first quarter’s end a total of 164 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock a change of -1% from the fourth quarter of 2020. Below you can check out the change in hedge fund sentiment towards V over the last 23 quarters. So let’s see which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.

Among these funds Fisher Asset Management held the most valuable stake in Visa Inc (NYSE:V) which was worth $4840.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter. On the second spot was TCI Fund Management which amassed $2976.5 million worth of shares. Berkshire Hathaway Fundsmith LLP and Akre Capital Management were also very fond of the stock becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Truvvo Partners allocated the biggest weight to Visa Inc (NYSE:V) around 33.17% of its 13F portfolio. Hengistbury Investment Partners is also relatively very bullish on the stock designating 23.42 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to V.

Due to the fact that Visa Inc (NYSE:V) has faced declining sentiment from the entirety of the hedge funds we track logic holds that there was a specific group of money managers that elected to cut their full holdings heading into Q2. Intriguingly Marcio Appel’s Adam Capital dropped the biggest stake of the 750 funds tracked by Insider Monkey valued at about $35.4 million in stock. Mendel Hui’s fund Isomer Partners also dumped its stock about $32.8 million worth. These bearish behaviors are important to note as aggregate hedge fund interest fell by 2 funds heading into Q2.

Let’s go over hedge fund activity in other stocks – not necessarily in the same industry as Visa Inc (NYSE:V) but similarly valued. These stocks are Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). This group of stocks’ market caps match V’s market cap.

As you can see these stocks had an average of 97.1 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $15485 million. That figure was $26588 million in V’s case. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is the least popular one with only 58 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks Visa Inc (NYSE:V) is more popular among hedge funds. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for V is 97.6. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks returned 17.2% in 2021 through June 11th but still managed to beat the market by 3.3 percentage points. Hedge funds were also right about betting on V as the stock returned 11.1% since the end of March (through 6/11) and outperformed the market by an even larger margin. Hedge funds were clearly right about piling into this stock relative to other stocks with similar market capitalizations.

A combination of new technology and expanding adoption are sparking meteoric growth. The analyst firm PitchBook estimates spending on AI software and hardware will reach $138 billion this year and grow at a rate of 23% in the next three years. That puts the industry at $258 billion in 2024.

All that spending fuels an equally explosive jobs market. The job search site ZipRecruiter shows 48955 artificial intelligence engineer jobs currently listed in the US. Those jobs pay very very well. ZipRecruiter shows annual salaries as high as $304500 for AI engineers with an average of $164769. There are also AI job openings for researchers human resources workers and managers.

PitchBook notes that ""the size of this market can support both large private companies as well as meaningful growth opportunities for large enterprises."" Insider previously listed salaries for some of those larger enterprises including IBM Microsoft and Oracle. Now we turn to those large startups and younger public companies which are providing a new employment sector with a central focus on AI.

Business Insider analyzed the US Office of Foreign Labor Certification's disclosure data from the beginning of 2021 through the end of March for permanent and temporary foreign workers to find out what 10 top AI companies — Snowflake UiPath Databricks DataRobot Samsara ByteDance Cruise Waymo Dataminr and OpenAI — pay engineers researchers and other professionals in the field of big data AI and machine learning.

Raja Younas Syed Naqvi and Jessica Voight who all work for tourism and hospitality-related companies in Myrtle Beach are accused of lying to get non-immigrants to the US for work.

The trio have been charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud money laundering and visa fraud according to the US Attorney's Office for the District of South Carolina in a news release on Thursday.

Many of the victims are from Jamaica and the Philippines but there are other victims from other countries officials further disclosed.

The authorities have already identified several of the victims.

The indictment alleged that Younas who is a registered agent president and chief executive of Grandeur Management Inc; Naqvi the registered agent and organiser of Rida Naqvi LLC; Voight an employee of Grandeur Management and other hospitality businesses ""devised a scheme to defraud workers outside the United States to work for the defendants”.

It is alleged that the conspirators not only submitted false and fraudulent visa petitions but also misrepresented the positions duties rates of pay working conditions and living conditions to collect unauthorised and improper fees from aliens seeking H-2B non-immigrant visas.

According to the indictment the conspirators would use separate accounts in order to pay employees differently based on their current non-immigration or alien status in the United States.

It is also alleged that despite promising the workers full-time work the conspirators provided less than full-time work and consistently paid the workers less than the amounts that are stated in the workers’ contracts and in the applications the defendants submitted to the United States Department of Labour and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services.

The grand fraudulent scheme allegedly plotted by the hospitality companies also involved the conspirators maintaining ""an established international cultural exchange programme designed on the whole to exhibit or explain the attitude customs history heritage philosophy traditions and/or other cultural attributes (arts literature language) of the participant’s country of nationality in order to obtain authorisation to sponsor Q-1 visas"" the US Attorney's Office disclosed.

But these arrangements never occurred.

Instead ""once the non-immigrant employees arrived in the United States they were placed by their visa sponsors into inward-facing housekeeping jobs with no real opportunities for cultural exchange"" the statement said.

According to the authorities Younas and Naqvi charged unlawful fees to visa seekers who wired money which the alleged scammers then pocketed among other things.

For her part Voight and others allegedly conducted interviews with the alien workers over the Internet and instructed them on how to wire unlawful visa fees charged by the conspirators and subsequently collected the unlawful fees.

Each of the three accused persons faces up to 20 years in prison on all the charges.

The accused were arraigned in federal court on Thursday and entered not guilty pleas to the charges.

The case was investigated by special agents of the US Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) and the Myrtle Beach Police Department.

Meanwhile the US authorities are appealing to those who were victimised by the defendants’ alleged scheme to contact traffickingtips@state.gov"

DeCicco

Correspondent

BERKLEY— The Crosby-Couto Memorial Basketball Court on the town common was already a success before its grand opening ceremony on June 12.

Crosby-Couto Basketball Foundation member Kim Robidoux said people started playing on the twin courts — built in memory of two Somerset Berkley Regional High School graduates who died in a car crash in March 2020 — as soon as the four hoops were installed on March 20. But the meaning behind this new construction only became obvious when the basketball coaches of the late Devyn Crosby 18 and late Christian Couto 19 retired their jersey numbers and handed them framed to their parents as the ceremony began.

That's when Devyn's mom Lisa Crosby and Christian's mom Tania Couto both had tears in their eyes — as did many people in the crowd — as the ceremony worked its way to conclude with a rendition of ""Star Spangled Banner"" sung by Emily Nawocki Devyn and Christian's Berkley schools classmate and now a student at the Berklee School of Music.

Soon after the two young men died the Crosby-Couto Basketball Foundation formed to memorialize the pair best friends who both were passionate about playing basketball by refurbishing the town common courts in their name. The Go-Fund Me page that the group began last June raised over $50000 and organizers fashioned plans that included enlarging and resurfacing the existing courts and adding benches safety fencing and most importantly of all plaques engraved with their names on a stone memorial at the head of the courts.

The grand opening happened right on schedule. Workers finished painting the court last Thursday Robidoux said. All that's left to do she said is to install the fence that will separate the two courts. The work she said was accomplished entirely with private funds and donations and materials that were either donated or bought at lower cost.

Tania Couto who was there with Christian's father Jeff Couto and 14-year-old sister Alexandria said she was amazed by the large turnout for the opening ceremony. ""I'd like to thank all those who participated in making this court happen"" she said. ""This is a great opportunity to remember them the way they should be remembered.""

She said she knew just what her son would do if he were here for the ceremony. ""He'd be astonished"" she said. ""He'd be smiling from ear to ear right now.""

Lisa Crosby who was there with Devyn's father Bruce Crosby and sister Brianna 22 said she was ""relieved"" to see the effort to create the memorial court come to a successful conclusion. ""It's amazing"" she said. ""It's wonderful. He (Devyn) would be very pleased.""

The ceremony included a blessing of the courts by Father Jason Brilhante of St. John of God's Church in Somerset. Another former classmate of Devyn and Christian Jared Painten announced he was organizing a ""three-on-three"" basketball tournament to follow the ceremony with entry fees going toward the court's maintenance fund. Painten said 69 players had signed up for this tournament and $690 had been raised — and that's not counting the proceeds expected from raffle tickets and popcorn sales.

Following the tournament he had planned a half-court raffle contest: One basketball shoot for $1; five for $3. Painten said he has played on the new court prior to June 12. ""It's the nicest court of any in any surrounding town"" he said. ""It's a beautiful court to remember them by (Devyn and Christian). I grew up with them. We're all blessed to know they've been a part of our lives.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuYWwuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvbW9iaWxlL25hbWUvbWFydGhhLXlhbmNlLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTEwNTMxOTcw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Martha Yance Obituary (1947 - 2021) - Mobile AL,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.al.com/us/obituaries/mobile/name/martha-yance-obituary?id=10531970 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMuYWwuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvbW9iaWxlL25hbWUvbWFydGhhLXlhbmNlLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTEwNTMxOTcw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zb3V0aGNvYXN0dG9kYXkuY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC8yMDIxLzA2LzEzL29sZC1yb2NoZXN0ZXItYm95cy1hbmQtZ2lybHMtd2luLXNjYy1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtdHJhY2stbWVldC10aXRsZXMvNzY1ODUwMjAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Old Rochester boys and girls win SCC championship track meet titles,"Standard-Times

The store resembles any of America's Walmarts only more spacious. Customers aren't dodging oncoming carts as often. When the store opened the Albany Business Review reported it would have a larger grocery selection than a regular Supercenter. YouTuber Antonio Maldonado a former Walmart employee toured the store and thought it offered pretty much the same groceries as other Walmarts just more of them.

In most Supercenters the groceries are tucked into one side of the store taking up roughly a quarter of the total space. In the biggest Walmart in America the first floor looks like a massive grocery store-drug store combination. You'll find school and office supplies makeup and books on the first floor. The electronics clothing and other department-store items are on the top floor. Maldonado who sounds like someone who enjoys a lot of shopping said he had never seen a Dunkin' (formerly Dunkin' Donuts) in a Walmart before but there it was on the first floor of the Albany Supercenter. The store's main attraction is something even avid shoppers may have never seen before — an escalator for your shopping cart.

How popular is the country's biggest Walmart? Not surprisingly it is the No. 1 destination for Uber clients in Albany according to Uber data reported in the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWV0aGluay5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9haS1uZWdvdGlhdGlvbtIBOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWV0aGluay5jb20vaGFyZC10ZWNoL2FpLW5lZ290aWF0aW9uP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can AI negotiate? Walmart is betting on it,"The next time a company wants to do business with Walmart they may find themselves negotiating the terms via chat — and the party on the other end of the line won’t be human. In fact said party might very well be conducting negotiations with multiple other people at the same time.

That’s because it’ll be an AI.

Walmart and Wesco International are among the first major companies to use this so-called Negotiation-as-a-Service (NaaS) product from Pactum. Logistics giant Maersk has also recently begun developing a pilot with the U.S.-Estonian startup.

“The system learns how people negotiate. It tries different strategies and tactics and gets better with each subsequent negotiation.”

Martin Rand

The company claims it’s the first in the world to roll out an automated AI negotiation tool with enterprise vendors — and bagged $11 million in funding last month to scale their capabilities.

How it works: Pactum’s AI is capable of reading contracts integrating the priorities and instructions of both parties negotiating on behalf of clients — and learning from the process.

For now Pactum is focused on enterprise customers like Walmart because this is where Pactum CEO Martin Rand sees the greatest potential for the pros of automation to outweigh the potential cons.

Pactum seeks to help large corporations with their “long tail” suppliers. These contracts aren’t typically high-value enough individually to require the attention of the company’s negotiation teams but when they’re added up across the entire company can amount to millions of dollars of lost value.

“The average Fortune 500 company has $240 million locked in inefficient deals in that long tail that people can’t renegotiate” Rand told Fortune.

A company like Walmart will have thousands of these long-tail agreements. Rand said that Walmart has increased profitability between 2.8-6.8% on deals negotiated by Pactum.

Always learning: After a company decides to use Pactum there is a process of training the AI to fit the specific needs of the respective client. Human negotiation experts from Pactum answer questions around bargaining targets details and specific terms and conditions that apply to the circumstances. Through this process acceptable trade-offs and deal-breakers are established.

Vendors engage with Pactum’s software through a chatbot interface. It uses a series of questions with the goal of revealing suppliers’ preferences then seeks to find a solution that maximizes value for the client within these parameters.

Each interaction adds more data to the AI’s training set. Over time this equips it with more tactics to use in negotiations.

“The system learns how people negotiate” Rand said. “It tries different strategies and tactics and gets better with each subsequent negotiation.”

Cold water: Pactum isn’t a person so it’s likely there will be cases in which its natural language processing doesn’t understand a term or the more human aspects of conversation like tone and subtext.

There is also the risk that vendors will feel devalued or dehumanized in the negotiation process. However Rand says that vendors that have used the system so far report feeling more heard in negotiations because the chatbot interface was more than they were offered by these companies previously.

Ben Blume a partner at Atomico who led Pactum’s latest fundraising round believes that in streamlining inefficiencies in the process Pactum can create win-win situations.

“Fortune 500 procurement leaders have told us that negotiated agreements are the backbone of their economic engagement but that their practices for managing supplier contracts are currently filled with inefficiency uncertainty and untapped value” Blume told ZDNet.

“Pactum (has) pioneered a unique approach that makes the negotiating process more supplier-friendly and improves outcomes for both parties … with the ability to create significant amounts of value for both buyers and suppliers of all kinds.”

This year celebrations and parades across the world have moved online to Zoom TikTok and YouTube. But criticism for “rainbow capitalism” in which corporations are accused of profiting socially and financially by selling LGBTQ+-themed products has never been louder.

“Just because a company slapped on a rainbow doesn’t mean they support the LGBTQ+ community” tweeted Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday following a surge of social media users vocally attacking brands for selling crass rainbow-themed goods but doing little to give back to LGBTQ+ communities.

View image in fullscreen US retailer Target’s Pride rainbow novelty suit and tie set.

Chris Stedman author of digital anthropology book IRL (in real life) went viral online after singling out US store Target for its “ugly as sin” attempt to bandwagon on Pride month. Speaking to the Observer he said: “The reason this stuff often feels like such a violation to many of us is that the language these brands are slapping on to mugs emerged in spaces we built for ourselves because we weren’t welcome elsewhere.”

Often the collections feel inauthentic and appropriated robbing the community of their agency he said. “Our in-group language and imagery evolved as a way for us to care for ourselves. So to have it used by brands that have little to no stake in our wellbeing feels like it cheapens and ultimately ‘defangs’ the language that we have used to empower ourselves. They think ‘hey we can just slap some rainbows on this and call it a day’. It’s dehumanising.”

On TikTok critique was even blunter. “All of the major corporations only care about us two months a year. It’s straight fashion [with] rainbows on it I’ll pass” wrote one user mocking rainbow-designed T-shirts featuring slogans “Come to the gay side we have rainbows” and “I can’t even think straight” from Walmart. Another wrote: “Don’t buy any Pride stuff from a big box store. They don’t care about us except in June. They want our money. They don’t help us.”

Writer and producer Fran Tirado who has worked on LGBTQ+ strategy at Netflix Out and Vice says that while advocating for queer and trans communities has become a corporate norm it’s often just lip service. “All companies are doing it so much every June that now brands are called out when they don’t do something for Pride. Understanding that why have corporations not really changed their strategy at all when it comes to Pride?” he said. “They’ve been doing the same thing for decades. The way companies conceive Pride campaigns is such a failure of the imagination.”

Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell described the rainbow capitalism row as damaging to LGBTQ+ communities. “Sometimes it feels like a box-ticking PR exercise to make the company look good and win over LGBTQ+ consumers. It is very off-putting and damaging. Many of us feel exploited.” Speaking to the Observer Tatchell added that if Pride merchandise is to be made LGBTQ+ creatives should be designing it. “They know the community” he said “what works and what is appropriate.”

Most critics call for consistency from brands. Matthew Breen an LGBTQ+ media and advocacy consultant believes the integrity of a company comes to light after Pride month. “Brands view Pride as a time to change their logos to rainbows sell merch and convey a message of inclusion and an embrace of LGBTQ+ communities and customers” he said. “But as queer people we can’t turn off our LGBTQ+ status when the logos go back to normal so it’s important we examine whether brands support us year round.”

The issues of corporate accountability in fashion came into focus following the murder of George Floyd last year. Many companies were called out for performative “black square” posts on Instagram that were not accompanied by systemic changes in the structures of their businesses. There’s a link to the expectations around Pride month.

“With issues around how fashion engages with social justice there needs to be a much deeper engagement than an Instagram post of their Pride collection” said Dr Ben Barry an activist and professor of fashion gender and sexuality at Ryerson University in Toronto. “How is that organisation changing their workplace culture to include LGBTQ+ folks in a real way?”

The question of who profits from rainbow capitalism is a sticky one. Labels such as Balenciaga which is donating 15% from the collection to LGBTQ+ charity the Trevor Project and Calvin Klein which has pledged an undisclosed sum to charities including The Trevor Project and the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund have signalled some meaningful commitment. But Breen says it is too shallow: “Companies should be allocating a much larger share of profits on that Pride merchandise to LGBTQ+ causes – why not 100%? If a company puts a flag on a collection it shouldn’t be 10% going back it should be the whole thing going back to the community.”

To engage with the community sincerely and advocate for LBGTQ+ rights say Pride supporters there is an onus on brands to put their money where their merch is donate to LBGTQ+ causes year round and invest in company structures to maintain equality and integrity for sexual minorities.

“It’s about a 12-month process of implementing change not just a month” said Barry. He believes that real change could occur with a total rethinking of what Pride month means in public spaces. “It’s reframing how we celebrate Pride beyond a Pride collection: here’s the work we’ll do and how we will commit to system transformation.”"
DIS,Walt Disney,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5kaXNuZXkuY29tL3VzLWFnYWluLWNob3Jlb2dyYXBoZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Behind-the-Scenes Look at Disney Animation Short “Us Again” With Keone and Mari Madrid,"If you haven’t heard yet the new animated short from Walt Disney Animation Studios “Us Again” is every dancer’s dream. Set in an energized city with music and dancing as its pulse “Us Again” is a beautiful love story conveyed completely through dance without dialogue. It tells the story of a longtime couple: Dot the young-at-heart supportive wife and Art the husband who’s slowed down with age. The couple who used to dance together all the time in their youth magically experience a night that reminds Art that age is simply a number and you can experience music dance love and happiness at any age. The choreography in “Us Again” was designed by World of Dance stars and choreographers Keone and Mari Madrid. The short directed by Zach Parrish and produced by Bradford Simonsen originally showed in theaters before Disney Animation’s Raya and the Last Dragon and it is now streaming exclusively on Disney+.

We had a virtual sit-down with the amazing dancers to talk about their contribution to this remarkable short film.

Thank you so much for lending your amazing talent to such a beautiful story.

Keone: It was our honor really.

Mari: Yes [it was].

Would this be considered interpretive dance?

Keone: I think you could call it that but we don’t have a particular name. I think we just recognize our foundation which started in hip-hop and then branched out into contemporary jazz and musical things in tap salsa… anything that we could get our hands on (laughs) which ultimately turned into a blend of Keone and Mari!

Is this something you always wanted to do portray your dance choreography through animation?

Mari: I think it definitely was a thing that maybe floated around especially with Disney animation but we were like “That’s never gonna happen. Maybe one day we’ll be able to be part of some project where there’s like a dance number and maybe we could do something with it way down the line.” So when we went to that first meeting and Brad and Zach presented the idea to us it was really overwhelming because it was like “Oh my gosh! This isn’t a little bit of dance this is dance throughout telling a story.” And for us that’s what we do and how we see dance.

When they reached out to you what aspect of the storyline did you fall in love with that made you say this is the one?

Keone: Well we were gonna say “this is the one” no matter what they brought to us! (Laughs) But telling the story through this older couple we resonate[d] with that so much as we are so inspired by our grandparents. Being a married couple we aspire to be together as older folks dancing still and not allowing our bodies to be a barrier to movement. We’ve done pieces in the past where we played an older couple — and that went viral — so it was right up our alley and I think that part of it was really exciting. It just felt very us in the style of the story and the meaning the intention. Also the representation of dance the representation of interracial couples all those things mean so much to us in our work that it was really just a perfect blend of a project.

Did you add any of your own input to shape the story and its message?

Mari: Someone asked us that earlier and I was like ""No not really” but then Zach was like “Actually…” (laughs) I think maybe without even realizing it? But really when we came in there was definitely an intention and a message that Zach had shaped and he was very clear about where he wanted it to land emotionally and what he wanted to interpret. So really it was just [about] navigating our contribution to that.

Keone: Yeah in our first meeting they had an idea. The plot was a little bit different but at the end of the day like Mari said the theme was there I [just] think they were still learning about what the possibilities were. Like “What’s your process?” “What do you guys think is going to work?” And I think all of those answers may have swayed this way or that but our answer was always “We could do anything. Whatever you guys see don’t hold back and we won’t hold back. Let’s just have as much context as possible before we get to the studio so that we can deliver the best work that we can for you.”

How realistic or close to the original would you say the final animation came?

Keone: Honestly I watched it and was like “They do it better than us! How did he get up on that bench that quickly?” (Laughs) That was really the point though that we wanted Zach to [embrace]. Like yes please take our movement and I know you’re going to honor it but it was very important that Art and Dot end up as their own people because obviously they have different body types. Their limbs are you know… Art’s neck is way longer than mine how is that gonna rock when he grooves? So make it work for them. There’s a saying that animators are actors with a pencil… It’s really the animators in combination with our choreography that brought the characters to life and it was really just our job to deliver an incredibly complex tutorial for the animators. They did it wonderfully down to the tiniest finger movement to how Dot touches Art at the end. All of those things matter so much.

I noticed the lamppost scene was a nod to the great Singin’ in the Rain but were there any other movies that you watched or borrowed inspiration from when creating the choreography?

Mari: I don’t think specifically when we were creating the choreography; it’s definitely the spirit of [them] though in general in our choreography… We grew up watching [films from the] Golden Age [of] Hollywood and there’s something really magical about how dance and film worked together during that time. So I think the spirit of that also lives in our choreography and then having characters like Art and Dot it just made sense to have that present.

You mentioned earlier that you played an older couple before. What nuances did you add to the choreography or movement to showcase the differences in age as they got older?

We sort of think of it as a diagram — you have young Art and Dot you have old Art and Dot and they sort of meet in the middle with their style of dance which is through our movement. But as an older couple [the changes] have a lot to do with posture. Also [there are] these micromovements that almost feel wiser to some degree… it’s got to be a smarter choice. They’ve lost the physical capabilities to do that huge lift to do all the grabby bendy things so sometimes you just have to be smarter and wiser about the choices yet you can still do those tricks to wow the audience. It’s like the effects of a close-up — you have to focus a little bit more especially in that [closing] dance.

Were there any significant challenges that you faced in the animation process that would normally not be an issue?

Mari: No I think maybe our only challenge was having a baby throughout the whole process. Having our first child.

Keone: Yeah [Mari] was 5 months pregnant at the first meeting and when we had our reference shoots our daughter was 4 or 5 months old. We were choreographing the piece with her sometimes strapped to us in the videos that we would send to Zach. So that was probably the most challenging thing but still wonderful …

Do you think being a married couple made it easier to tell this story?

Mari: I think so as there’s a comfortability with it — playing a married couple and being one. Also being a married couple watching our grandparents and older couples… There’s just something about that kind of love that has sat and aged with understanding no fluffers on it. It’s like you know it so well. We really wanted to try to capture those nuances like when your spouse is just being [difficult] and you’re just like “Fine we can talk later.” Or that moment when you’ve been missing each other then when you reconnect and find each other again how the bond somehow grows even stronger. We really tried to capture those things as best we could in the choreography.

Captured it they did.

Let’s take a look:

More paneling has been put up recently on the porte-cochère roof. We hope for this piece to be completed soon and lifted back over to The Great Ceremonial House.

The concrete pillars are being primed halfway covered in a shade of pink.

The set on the opposite side has recently been painted brown likely the finished product.

More paneling has been added to the right-side of the roof over the monorail entrance as well.

The roof covering the walkway to the monorail has painted in different shades of dark and light tan. White wrap has been added around the columns supporting the roof as well.

Guests staying at the Polynesian are very eager for monorail services to resume once more.

Recently Disney also announced that the fan-favorite restaurant ‘Ohana will be returning to serve guests once more starting July 9th for both breakfast and dinner. Hopefully this also signals that more of these construction updates will be completed by then or at least the full reopening later in July.

No major changes here recently other than a few pieces of equipment being moved off of the concrete walkway and the grass area.

On our way out we spotted an owl friend taking a quick snooze in the shade. He’s doing a great job overseeing all of the construction.

Disney faithful know that the two properties have always had their differences even in non-pandemic times. It should come as no surprise that new differences have emerged in 2021 largely due to the very divergent ways Florida and California have approached the pandemic and are currently regulating businesses.

Disney World has had a significant reopening head start on its California cousin. Disney World unlocked its gates in July 2020 and has been operating continuously ever since. In contrast Disneyland just reopened on April 30 2021. Naturally Disneyland has quite a bit of catching up to do in terms of more fully reopening and scaling up once it is fully permitted to play catch up under state rules.

Disneyland with its tighter 1950's era walkways and queues has unique challenges in an era of social distancing that will continue to play a role in perpetuating some differences even once the state guidelines eventually become less disparate.

For now at least here are the major distinctions between visiting Disney World and Disneyland as the summer 2021 travel season starts.

Resort availability

Disney World:

Even after about a year of its reopening process most -- though not all -- Disney World resort hotels have reopened.

Properties such as Port Orleans All-Star Movies All-Star Sports and Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge – Jambo House remain closed. On many weekends holidays popular summer travel dates and around the park's 50th-anniversary celebration that begins in October there will be far more Disney resort hotels showing as sold out than there still are available.

While there are some discounts available at select Disney World resorts for the most part despite some amenities and services still being suspended guests are paying roughly the same rates they were for Disney World resorts as before the pandemic -- if not even higher in some cases.

To put this another way a stay at Disney's Yacht Club doesn't yet come with nightly housekeeping and amenities such as the arcade and spa are still closed but it will routinely set you back $400 - $500 per night.

Related: Here's what to expect on a Disney World hotel stay

Disneyland:

Disneyland always has a much smaller number of on-property hotels but resort availability in California is extremely limited at the moment. There is currently only one Disney on-property hotel open Disney's Grand Californian Resort & Spa which reopened with the parks at the end of April.

The next of the three Disney-owned resorts to reopen will be Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel scheduled for June 15 2021. The namesake Disneyland Hotel is scheduled to reopen on July 2. So far the open rooms have not been selling out on most dates so the supply is sufficient for the current demand but prices are on the high side with the most budget-friendly of the three Paradise Pier starting at $400 on many summer nights and Grand Californian frequently starting at over $700 per night for a standard room.

Amenities and dining at the Disneyland on-property hotels are few and far between even though the hotels are commanding full price.

Outside of location the only advantage these hotels have for now is that they give guests access to a separate bucket of theme park reservations with close to wide-open availability (much more so than the on-property reservations calendar at Walt Disney World).

For last-minute planners this benefit is significant. For those who can plan ahead and secure theme park reservations through the regular channels off-property hotels offer better values.

Entry requirements

Disney World:

When Disney World reopened in summer 2020 it introduced the need for Disney Park Pass reservations made in advance of visiting the parks. While this wasn't a huge hurdle when demand was still low it has become more of an issue as demand has returned. In fact Disney's Hollywood Studios has been selling out of Park Pass reservations almost two months in advance. Epcot is generally the most available of the four Disney World theme parks.

There are different availability buckets depending on if you have an annual pass an on-property resort reservation or just individual park tickets. While it wasn't always this way currently those with an annual pass have access to the best availability.

Disneyland:

Like at Walt Disney World Disneyland requires daily theme park reservations in addition to a park ticket for admission. Reservations help keep the parks capacity-controlled each day. While Walt Disney World travelers can book reservations all the way into 2023 the Disneyland reservations calendar is only open 120 days in advance.

The speed at which reservations ""sell-out"" at Disneyland varies quite a bit. Disneyland park books up quickly (often over a month in advance) while Disney California Adventure park often takes a few additional weeks to fill. With so many Southern California locals attending initially weekends were the first to book up. With summer dates approaching and more guests coming from farther away for longer trips demand is now spread more evenly throughout the week.

COVID-19 rules

Disney World:

As Florida is fully reopened Disney World is open to anyone who can get there with no state residency requirements.

The park has steadily been increasing park capacity decreasing social distancing buffers and eliminating some of the precautions it took earlier in the pandemic. For example on most attractions the park now fills all of the rows of shows and rides. The requirements for temperature taking when entering the park or restaurants has also ceased.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Masks are no longer required for the fully vaccinated while indoors or outdoors at Disney World unless you are on Disney buses monorails or the Skyline. Nearby Universal Orlando has dropped its mask requirements for vaccinated guests entirely (no verification of vaccination).

Disneyland:

While Florida is wide open to all travelers the state of California still has a COVID-19 travel advisory in place for anyone coming from out of state. For this reason Disneyland currently only permits California residents to visit. However this will change on June 15 2021 when out-of-state guests will again be welcome.

Other COVID-19 precautions at the California parks are strict but mostly of the to-be-expected kind.

The parks conduct temperature checks right before the security checkpoints to enter Downtown Disney. Masks are required everywhere except when actively eating and drinking while stationary. While Disney World has relaxed its mask rule outdoors Disneyland is not able to do so yet.

The Disneyland parks had been operating at no more than 25% capacity while Orange County was assigned to the state's orange tier. However Orange County's COVID-19 statistics continued to improve and the county is now in the yellow tier where 35% theme park capacity is permitted. Operating at 35% brings its operations more in line with what Disney World offered for the last few months.

Disneyland also must operate under significant restrictions on the time guests spend indoors. All ride queues are outdoors and most dining is as well. Thankfully Southern California's heat isn't quite as oppressive as Florida's because AC breaks are few and far between. Most of these state-mandated capacity and queuing restrictions disappear on June 15 but it remains to be seen how Disneyland will further modify its operations in response if at all.

Ride modifications

Disney World:

While Disney World ride vehicles aren't back to full occupancy they are getting close. Single rider lines to pack every square inch of a row have not yet returned but generally speaking each row of a vehicle will be full. There is often plexiglass added between rows on vehicles such as the indoor boat rides. You'll also find lots of plexiglass in the queues that twist and turn on themselves.

Only Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance within Galaxy's Edge is using a virtual queue but otherwise all of the waiting for an attraction is done the old-fashioned way -- in the usual lines that can stretch inside or outside. There is no FastPass+ or Extra Magic Hours available.

(Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

Some attractions that traditionally have pretty packed preshow rooms -- such as at the Haunted Mansion and Tower of Terror are skipping that part of the normal experience.

Disneyland:

While Walt Disney World is now packing its rides current ride modifications at Disneyland still look much like how Disney World first operated during its reopening in the summer of 2020.

With California requiring six feet of distancing queues are very stretched out. Unlike at Walt Disney World where many queues make use of space inside unused show buildings the queues at Disneyland must be entirely outdoors due to state regulations.

Attractions like Pirates of the Caribbean that usually have indoor queues have substantial modifications. The line for Pirates now stretches all over the terraces of New Orleans Square. Disneyland has also started offering a virtual queue for Indiana Jones some of the time to limit chokepoints caused by excessively long queues.

This brings the total number of virtual queues in use at Disneyland to three -- Rise of the Resistance WEB SLINGERS and Indiana Jones.

Also impacting operations is that ride vehicles at Disneyland are filled to only a fraction of their capacity. Larger boat rides like Pirates of the Caribbean and it's a small world seat only two rows. Roller coasters are spaced one party per car often resulting in two empty rows between smaller parties on attractions like Space Mountain and Thunder Mountain.

Other rides look more like their Walt Disney World equivalents. Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance for example has plexiglass between the two rows of the eight-seater ride vehicle just like Florida added last fall.

There is only one ride at Disneyland that has arguably fewer COVID-19 safety modifications than its Walt Disney World equivalent: Haunted Mansion. While guests walk through and skip the traditional show in the stretching room in Orlando the ride's layout at Disneyland makes skipping it entirely impossible.

Instead Disneyland loads a very limited number of parties in each corner of the room as it descends.

Food & beverage modifications

Disney World:

Like with the Disney World hotel resorts while many Disney World restaurants have reopened some are still shuttered. And those that have reopened may still have more limited menus than normal or not yet back be back to full staffing levels. This means that there is decent competition to snag a booking at one of the top reopened spots.

You can again dine with characters at a few Disney World spots such as Topolino's Terrace Garden Grill and Chef Mickey's. The characters keep their distance but they have returned to a few restaurants.

Advance dining reservations are available 60 days in advance instead of the usual 180 and popular spots do book up.

Garden Grill (Photo by Summer Hull/The Points Guy)

If you prefer a grab-and-go meal know that the counter service restaurants pretty much require you to order and pay using the My Disney Experience app.

During busy days the time to come back and pick up your order can be an hour or two from when you make your purchase so you may want to plan in advance and order your lunch and its return time before your morning coffee fully wears off.

Disneyland:

Like at Walt Disney World the food and restaurant options have been reduced quite a bit at Disneyland. Because Disneyland is still in the early phases of calling cast members back to work its dining operations lag behind where Disney World is now. Plans to open more restaurants and expand menus are taking shape quickly.

Much more of the dining at Disneyland is of the counter service variety. With indoor operations limited more than in Florida very few table service restaurants are open for now. In fact there are only three open at each park at the moment.

When it comes to counter-service restaurants at Disneyland mobile ordering is a must. Return windows at peak meal times book up early so guests need to mobile order well in advance to be able to eat at their time and restaurant of choice.

Amenity modifications

Disney World:

There are still no fireworks no nighttime shows no FastPass+ no scheduled parades and most tours or special events are still suspended at Disney World.

However there are unannounced mini-parades (aka cavalcades) that frequently take place throughout the Disney World parks. These can include music characters floats and dancers -- just like the longer parades but shorter.

And while there hasn't been any formal word yet on the return of fireworks or FastPass+ Disney World did recently announce a Halloween-themed after-hours Boo Bash event that will begin in August and run through October. This is the first event of that type to return to Disney World.

It was also just recently announced that Disney Club Level will return to some of the Disney World resort hotels beginning in September.

And while it isn't all back to normal live entertainment shows have started to return. Just recently the popular Festival of the Lion King show returned to Disney World's Animal Kingdom.

Disneyland:

The many amenities and extras of a typical Disneyland vacation are very much on pause in 2021.

All the tricks and shortcuts to dodge long lines from Fastpass to MaxPass to single rider are on hiatus. Thankfully the lines for most rides aren't that long at the moment making this absence not quite as painful.

Fireworks and all nighttime spectaculars remain closed as well. There are no parades or shows with live performers just yet either although two indoor theater attractions -- the Tiki Room and Mickey's Philharmagic -- are open to guests.

Character sightings at Disneyland are modified as well. Like at Walt Disney World there are a number of distanced character meet and greets and photo opportunities. In fact Disneyland seems to have a greater number of these per park square foot than Walt Disney World. And the new Avengers Campus is just teeming with character experiences.

What Disneyland lacks however is the two other character opportunities Walt Disney World offers: character dining and character cavalcades. The tighter walkways and parade routes of Disneyland likely would make cavalcades (which are essentially mini-parades without published schedules) a bigger challenge.

Park hopping restrictions

Disney World:

After remaining on hiatus throughout last year park-hopping returned to Disney World at the beginning of 2021. If you have an eligible (pricier) park hopping ticket you can go to the park you have made your advance reservation for in the morning and then hop to a second park without a reservation to that park beginning at 2 p.m.

After visiting your first designated park you can hop around as much as you want starting at 2 p.m. as long as there is availability in each subsequent park.

Disneyland:

Just like at Walt Disney World park hopping is alive and well at Disneyland.

Guests at Disneyland are able to hop an hour earlier at 1:00 p.m. daily. So far at least there has not been a problem with either park reaching capacity resulting in park-hopping guests being turned away or made to wait.

Because there are only two parks in California in close proximity to one another the movement of guests is a bit less even at Disneyland. More guests move from California Adventure to Disneyland park than make the opposite switch resulting in noticeably higher (although still mostly manageable) crowds in Disneyland for a few hours in the afternoon.

The recent opening of Avengers Campus in California Adventure provides a bit more balance in park-hopping demand although it creates new operational challenges all its own.

Bottom line

While neither park is back to true normal Walt Disney World has more open and operating right now than Disneyland with fewer COVID-19 restrictions in place.

But Disneyland has the temporary advantage of somewhat lower crowds and shorter ride lines. The situation at both parks likely will evolve rapidly this summer with more offerings opening up and more guests returning to both resorts. We are also at an inflection point where pandemic-related precautions and requirements are rapidly evolving on both coasts.

Right now if you want a more normalized theme park experience with the options of character dining mini-parades no required masks some live entertainment and more filled ride vehicles Disney World is the better bet.

If you want access to a more capacity-controlled environment are most comfortable with more stringent mask and distancing requirements or simply want to ride Disney's newest ride -- WEB SLINGERS: A Spider-Man Adventure -- then Disneyland is the current park for you.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkLmNvbS9rcmlzdGVuaGFycmlzMS9zdG9yaWVzLWJlaGluZC1kaXNuZXktbW92aWVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 Disney Movie Behind-The-Scenes-Stories,"10.

With Disney’s latest animated feature Raya and the Last Dragon currently streaming on Disney+ now is a fun time to look at some random facts about some of Disney’s most colorful comic fun and sometimes fierce characters.

1. Those familiar with Chinese mythology will recognize the biggest star of Raya and the Last Dragon Sisu (voiced by Awkwafina) was inspired by the Southeast Asian dragons called Naga. Nagas have slender snaky bodies and no wings and are often bound to the element of water. Sisu and her siblings certainly know their way around the element.

2. Another dragon inspired by Chinese mythology was the diminutive dragon Mushu from the animated feature Mulan. Mushu was originally going to be a type of yin-yang personality to be voiced by two actors Joe Pesci and Richard Dreyfuss. It was only after Pesci got in the studio that it was realized the voice and character didn’t fit and Mushu got a one-voice reboot with Eddie Murphy.

3. Dragons have been a part of the Disney parks’ magic for some time and those who remember the original logo for Walt Disney World Resort’s Animal Kingdom may remember a dragon in the middle. This dragon was to be a big draw for a section called the Beastly Kingdom. The area would have a riverboat ride featuring a menacing fire-breathing dragon complete with the remnants of melted knights’ armor. Early guests may remember some “coming attractions” effects but eventually this area never happened and Pandora popped up in its place.

4. Dragons are tricky creatures and one Disney Park dragon that has given them a little trouble was the Maleficent Dragon the center star of the Fantasmic show at Disneyland Park since 1992. When the show received an update around 2009 then there were many technical problems reimagining a more impressive 45-foot animatronic dragon. The new show even started without a dragon and when the dragon first appeared again it had to take another hiatus after malfunctioning several times. Due to the many delays and problems the dragon was nicknamed “Murphy” by fans after “Murphy’s Law.”

5. Maleficent’s dark magic must be strong as another popular Maleficent dragon the beautiful steampunk style fire-breathing Maleficent Dragon float had to take an eight-month vacation when it caught fire during a parade in 2018. No one was hurt except the poor dragon. It is an impressive float and fans were happy to see its return.

6. One of the scariest dragons in the Disney parks is Disneyland Paris’s sleeping dragon located in the La Taniere du Dragon below the Sleeping Beauty Castle. This dragon was at the time Disney’s longest animatronic feature ever built when it first debuted in 1992 measuring for passing guests.

7. Not all Disney dragons are menacing as many of Disney’s animated dragons tend to be friendly and lovable. The earliest example is the 1941 hybrid film The Reluctant Dragon featuring a mix of live-action and animation. Humorist Robert Benchley plays himself trying to find Walt Disney so he can share his idea for turning Kenneth Grahame’s book into a film. Many Disney animators make an appearance and the last section of the film is the resulting animated short for The Reluctant Dragon.

8. The original Pete’s Dragon another hybrid of animation and live-action debuted in 1977 but Disney originally purchased the story from a Hollywood writer in 1955. The animated pink-haired Elliot was said to “20 feet long” and “40 feet high” but according to Disney fandom sites he only looked to be about 12 feet tall.

9. Pete’s Dragon got a non-musical debut in 2016 and as the original Elliot is said to be “part reptile” and “part mammal” the new CGI Elliot was completely furry. This was an intentional move as the film’s director David Lowery wanted him to be entirely different than the frightening Game of Thrones type of scaly dragon. He said in an IGN interview he wanted the rebooted Elliot to be “the kind of dragon you really want to give a hug to.”

10. Many Disney dragons may larger-than-life but Mushu isn’t the only small dragon in Disney films. In Pixar’s fantasy-meets-suburbia feature Onward there are plenty of dragon references (including the high school’s mascot) but the show-stealing dragon is a terrier-sized fire-spitting pet dragon Blazey. This dragon gets her personality from a real-life dog Carol belonging to Pixar animator Dan Scanlon.

11. Another small Disney dragon Figment is a favorite character often seen at Walt Disney World’s Epcot as part of the Journey Into Imagination attraction and in photo op “meet and greets” being carried by his steampunk style handler Dreamfinder. Figment is one of the first Disney characters made exclusively for a theme park and his purple color was the result of not wanting to create a “green dragon” on an attraction originally sponsored by Kodak film. Green was the main color in Fuji film labeling a competitor of Kodak who had bright yellow packaging.

12. With so many fantasy characters and segments in both Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 only one dragon is prominently featured. He is seen in the Fantasia 2000 “Pomp and Circumstance” segment along with a unicorn and a griffon laughing at the other animals boarding Noah’s Ark before the flood.

13. Dragons are the fiercest animals of the shape-shift dark fairies and witches in Disney’s classic films. This includes the purple dragon that the cheating Mad Madam Mim transforms herself into during the “Wizard’s Duel” with Merlin in The Sword and The Stone. Her dragon is no match for the smallest of creatures as Merlin takes her down by transforming into a germ (a rare disease called “malignalitaloptereosis” to be exact) which she caught!

14. The first animatronic dragon seen at any Disney park was actually underwater; it was the Submarine Voyage’s Sea Serpent. The serpent was 48-feet long and six feet high and became part of a Disney collector Richard Kraft’smpoolside decorations after the ride closed (pre-Finding Nemo era). When Kraft sold off most of his collection in 2018 in a well-publicized auction the serpent sold to an anonymous buyer for $80000.

15. In 2012 a “real” firebreathing dragon flew over Disneyland as part of a publicity event for the grand opening of the New Fantasyland. The dragon was actually a modified ultralight manned vehicle and made only a one-night appearance.

However thanks to the internet his flight was well-documented.

Regardless of what direction the Disney parks and movies take in the future let’s hope they always make room for dragons.

WBD,Warner Bros Discovery,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMTIvb3Bpbmlvbi9hdHQtd2FybmVyLWJyb3MtZGlzY292ZXJ5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion | AT&T Went Back to Basics by Cutting WarnerMedia Loose,"Hold the phone. Or at least hold on to the phone. Sell everything else.

That’s essentially what AT&T told investors last month in announcing the spinoff of its WarnerMedia division which will merge with Discovery owner of HGTV TLC Eurosport and other networks. This new global media company will be called Warner Bros. Discovery with the tag line “The stuff that dreams are made of.”

Bad dreams in AT&T’s case. In announcing the deal AT&T’s chief executive officer John Stankey declared himself “capital allocator in chief” and decided he had better uses for AT&T’s cash than HBO Max “Godzilla vs. Kong” N.B.A. games or CNN. This is a curious designation from a guy who was part of the executive team that allocated more than $85 billion to buy WarnerMedia three years ago on the belief that pairing distribution with content was a compelling strategic plan.

AT&T now becomes a “pure play”: a telecommunications company as it was in 1984 when the Justice Department broke up its predecessor. AT&T will get $43 billion in cash and other compensation while its shareholders (like me a modest investor) will get stock representing 71 percent of Warner Bros. Discovery when the deal closes which is expected to be in 2022. Investors disconnected sending AT&T’s stock down more than 10 percent. At a recent stock price of around $29 more than $20 billion in value has been erased since the deal was announced.

We’ve seen this diversify-then-divest movie before. It’s the “Four Weddings and a Funeral” of corporate America without any uplifting ending. C.E.O.s take the capital generated by their successful businesses and then buy others that they can’t manage or are poor fits in the first place. The rationale is that they are adding scale growth adjacencies or serving what they discern to be customer needs. “We’ve known for decades that there’s a diversification discount” says Rohan Williamson chair of international business at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University. So do C.E.O.s to little apparent effect. “That’s the way managers think. In their minds it’s ‘this time it will be different.’”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vYWlybWFpbC5uZXdzL2lzc3Vlcy8yMDIxLTYtMTIvdGhyZWUtcmluZy10aXRhbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Battle for the Big Top' by Les Standiford: Review,"Battle for the Big Top: P.T. Barnum James Bailey John Ringling and the Death-Defying Saga of the American Circus by Les Standiford

In late May 2017 Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey’s “Greatest Show on Earth” heir to a circus created by P. T. Barnum 146 years before turned its lights out for the final time. Those who missed news of the venerable circus’s closing can be forgiven. It came in the dizzying first months of the Trump presidency with those scary stunts clownish mishaps and cast of freaks laying hourly claim to the world’s attention. Even the Greatest Show on Earth had a hard time breaking through.

But in the closing of the circus the writer Les Standiford cleverly spotted the end of one of the great American showbiz stories. His book Battle for the Big Top: P.T. Barnum James Bailey John Ringling and the Death-Defying Saga of the American Circus is an entertaining business drama that places Barnum Bailey and Ringling in the pantheon of American media moguls.

Barnum of course steals the show. When he entered the circus business in 1870 the showman was already a massive global celebrity having wowed the public with outlandish curiosities such as “the Feejee Mermaid” actually the carcass of a sturgeon-like fish with the torso of an orangutan sewed to its back. Lending his name and promotional acumen to a traveling show that used America’s expanding rail network his Greatest Show on Earth quickly became the most famous circus in the world.

Barnum’s success was the envy of James Bailey a canny circus entrepreneur. Bailey’s lucky break came in March of 1880 with the birth of “Little Columbia” an Indian-elephant calf said to be the first captive of the species born on American soil. Impressed Barnum offered $100000 for the calf. Bailey declined and raced to print flyers: “Come see what Barnum would pay a king’s ransom for!”

Tasting his own medicine the pragmatic Barnum saw a worthy partner. In August of 1880 he and Bailey announced a merger of their interests a kind of Warner Bros. Discovery for the big-top era.

On Top of the World

Like so many mega-mergers Barnum and Bailey’s Greatest Show struggled under its own heft and suffered against scrappier competitors such as the earthy show founded by five of the seven Ringling brothers of Baraboo Wisconsin. (Standiford quotes a Ringling descendant explaining their success: “Perhaps it wasn’t that the [brothers] were so smart but just that there were just so Gad-damned many of them.”) In 1907 with Barnum and Bailey both dead the Ringlings pursued a purchase of the Greatest Show on Earth creating the combined enterprise that would dominate the circus world for much of the next century.

That show was always centered around elephants and other animals and Standiford’s narrative contains haunting glimpses of their suffering. There is a vivid appalling account of the demise of “Jumbo” Barnum’s famed 13000-pound African elephant killed in a collision with a speeding locomotive in an Ontario rail yard in 1885.

Justice for Jumbo came in 2015 when after years of hounding from animal-rights groups the Greatest Show on Earth agreed to remove elephants from its act. Though circuses like the global juggernaut Cirque du Soleil had found a model for success in the YouTube era Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey cratered without its signature quadrupeds. Talking to reporters a few days before the Greatest Show’s final performance in 2017 its ringmaster mourned the passing of “the last safe space” and “the last pure form of entertainment there is.”

“Pure” is not exactly the first word that comes to mind after reading about the things Barnum and the other circus gurus did to fill seats. Still it’s worth mourning the death of any enterprise that embodied so many essential American qualities—hustle and self-promotion showmanship wonder and deceit. It’s not that hard to imagine a Greatest Show on Earth adapted for modern sensibilities—cruelty-free robotic elephants anyone? Perhaps in the hands of an audacious 21st-century mogul the big top could rise again.

A Thelwell movie sets to bring the cartoon to life and the franchise are now on the hunt for the starring roles!

Norman Thelwell is best known for his hilarious cartoons of little girls on plump ponies. First featured in Punch Magazine in the 1960’s the cartoon is now making its way to the silver screen.

Striking a deal to transform the cartoon into a live-action feature film the Thelwell family hope that the deal will breathe life into the beloved cartoon and attract a new generation of Thelwell lovers.

So the search has been launched for a girl to play the enthusiastic rider Penelope. Meanwhile a cheeky pony is also being headhunted for the movie to play the rebellious Merrylegs.

The casting team are looking out for Shetlands and Welsh Mountain ponies to be cast as Merrylegs. It is encouraged that anyone who thinks they have a pony that would make the perfect Merrylegs should contact the production company Blenheim Films.

The film will be called Merrylegs: The Movie and will be set in the foothills of Snowdonia North Wales. Filming will begin later this year.

Recently speaking to the Telegraph Penny Thelwell’s daughter and inspiration for the main character of his cartoons explained the shift from paper to screen;

There are a lot of fans who say ‘My grandmother gave the book to my mother they’re in the attic somewhere.’ And there are a lot of people who like to follow his work and they know the ponies but they don’t know the name ‘Thelwell’.” “They know the designs but the name has become a bit of a thing of the past so it’s a wonderful way to bring it back to a new generation while being very nostalgic for the people who grew up with it.”

Continuing to discuss the illustrator’s influences for the cartoon Penny added;

He loved knowing what was going to happen and with a horse you never know. But he absolutely loved drawing them. In his work animals are always the wisest.”

Thelwell was further passionate about the environment. Therefore director Candida Bray who will be leading the cinematic piece has assured to recognise this theme throughout the film. Candida has previous directed environmental documentaries such as Trashed. She is currently working with ponies and their trainers to understand what animals can be trained in and what will be added later through special effects.

The film is set for release in 2023 marking Thelwell’s 100th birthday. A TV series based on his autobiographies is also in development. You may also like to read Ride Like a Girl – NEW Equestrian Movie Released this August"

By Sharon Aron Baron

It’s never too early to learn how to recycle garbage properly.

Waste Management assisted students at Renaissance Charter School at University in Tamarac with their Recycle Challenge challenging each other to recycle all their clean and dry plastic bottles cans and paper at home and in school.

The Recycle Challenge was the last two weeks of school and the students collected two eight-yard dumpsters worth of recyclables.

They learned plastic bags cannot be recycled curbside and placed the items loosely in the Waste Management dumpster.

Open burning of cables and manual disassembly of lead-acid batteries are still widely used practices causing significant environmental pollution and damage to human health.

In Ghana an estimated 171000 tons of e-waste was generated in 2011 with a mere 0.2% processed by formal e-waste recyclers. The remaining 99.98% was handled by an informal sector consisting of a widespread network of unlicensed collectors intermediaries scrap dealers and dismantlers specializing in the manual disassembly and trading of post-consumer electronics.

PET or polyethylene terephthalate is the inexpensive versatile plastic used to make bottles food containers and other modern conveniences. Even though PET is a highly valuable and readily recyclable material there is not enough waste collection and recycling capacity in many countries in South and Southeast Asia. PET and other plastics stay in the environment for hundreds of years and when exposed to sunlight and seawater they fragment into microplastics that are consumed by marine life and eventually make their way into the food chain with unknown health impacts.



More robust global recycling efforts would go a long way toward integrating the plastics value chain into a circular economy where waste is managed as a valuable resource and reclaimed reprocessed and ultimately used as feedstock for new plastic products. That would help the environment in several ways. First it would mean less fossil fuel feedstock would be used to make virgin plastic that would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But more importantly less discarded plastic would pile up. Important progress has already been made along those lines but much more is needed if the world is going to reduce the up to 13 million tons of plastic every year that leak into the oceans.



The biggest challenge is modernizing and rationalizing waste collection and processing systems. Right now collection and segregation of recyclables is very fragmented and underdeveloped in many emerging economies -- informal waste pickers scour junkyards and landfills for sellable recyclables often operating outside of municipal solid waste management systems. Estimates vary greatly but globally at least 250 million metric tons of plastic waste is generated annually and only about 14 percent gets recycled.



Even in developed countries like Korea collection can be uneven and recycling expensive. South Korea recycles more than 50 percent of its overall waste which is one of the highest rates in the world but the country also has the highest rate of plastic consumption per capita. Given the high rate of plastic consumption the government has set an ambitious target of reducing its plastic waste by half by 2030 while doubling its average recycling rate from 34 percent to 70 percent. For PET alone Korea’s consumption was around 300000 tons in 2019 of which 245000 tons of used bottles were sorted and collected.



The paradox is that plastic waste has significant material value that is currently not being fully tapped when plastics are disposed via landfill or incineration or downcycled. This represents a lost business opportunity for the private sector especially since demand for recycled plastic is increasing globally for food and beverage applications. Plastic manufacturers and global brands spurred by environmentally conscious consumers and government regulations are helping create a new market for recycled materials. Many consumer goods companies such as Coca-Cola and Danone and retailers such as Walmart have made public commitments to increase recycled plastic content in their packaging or products. In addition the European Union has mandated a minimum 25 percent recycled content in PET bottles by 2025 and 30 percent by 2030 creating a strong enabling environment for recycled PET. In January S&P Global Platts Analytics predicted that even though higher grades of recycled PET will cost around $150 per metric ton more than virgin PET in the medium term many manufacturers are willing to pay the premium because the alternative is a tax of 800 euros per metric ton on unrecycled discarded plastic under a new plastics tax.



The International Finance Corp.’s strategy is to support companies embrace reduce reuse and recycling interventions by offering flexible financing to address the project technology business model and supply chain risks associated with the circular economy.



With its first ever blue loan exclusively focused on addressing global marine plastic pollution a $225 million commitment to help Indorama Ventures expand its food-grade PET recycling capacity IFC teamed up with one of the world’s biggest producers of virgin PET resins to address ocean pollution and accelerate efforts toward a more circular plastics industry where reusability and recyclability become commonplace.



Blue loans are an innovative financial instrument that is earmarked for ocean conservation projects. Commercially viable solutions supported by such blue financing solutions are particularly important given the magnitude of the problem which cannot be addressed through public investments and socially driven initiatives alone.



The Thai-based multi-national has committed to quadrupling its PET recycling capacity and diverting 750000 tons of plastic annually from landfills and open dumps and helping avoid leakage into waterways.



To put the effort into context Indorama will recycle 50 billion PET bottles every year in Brazil India Indonesia the Philippines and Thailand -- countries that are particularly vulnerable to ocean pollution because of their dense coastal populations and reliance on fishing and tourism. That effort alone is expected to save 3 million barrels of crude oil and eliminate 1.65 million tons of carbon pollution that would have gone into manufacturing new bottles. The IFC-led loan package with participation from Asian Development Bank and Deutsche Investitions-und Entwicklungsgesellschaft complemented by a $75 million green loan to finance renewable energy and energy efficiency projects will serve as a prototype to accelerate circular economy models while simultaneously encouraging the business case of building bottle-to-bottle capacities to other recyclers and PET bottle producers leveraging their partnership with the brands and convening power in the market.



Korea has already stepped up regulations on single use plastics including better labeling to facilitate more efficient waste segregation and recovery of clear PET bottles. However more can be done to create a truly circular economy and a closed-loop recycling process. Korea can set an example for other countries in Asia by developing appropriate definitions policies and standards for food-grade PET recycling with a view toward eventual harmonization across the region. As seen from the Indorama example the business case for bottle-to-bottle PET recycling is already viable and the support of innovative financing solutions such as blue loans can be used to promote further scaling up by the private sector. The South Korean government recently announced that it would promote the use of recycled PET in making food containers. Introducing such regulations to allow and encourage food grade bottle-to-bottle recycling using mechanical recycling technology which is already allowed in other developed markets such as the United States the European Union and Japan will support the Korean government’s ambitious targets of reducing plastic waste and driving a transition to a circular economy.

While the ship disaster has left small and medium scale fishermen in the western and northwestern coasts struggling to keep their livelihoods afloat the demand for deep sea fish has triggered a price increase in some varieties.

Prices of deep sea fish such as tuna snapper seer fish (thora) paraw thalapath (sailfish) continue to soar due to short supply and increased demand while smaller fish such as herrings sardines small mullet prawns crabs and other crustaceans are seeing a price drop.

In the retail market paraw is sold at an average of Rs. 1350 per kilo whereas in June last year a kilo was about Rs. 1250. Mullet is presently sold at Rs. 1375 a kilo an increase from last year’s Rs. 1230. A kilo of kelawalla is Rs. 1140 whereas it was Rs. 1107 last year. A kilo of thalapath is presently about Rs. 1392  close to a hundred rupee increase from last year. A kilo of mora is now Rs. 1213 whereas last year it was Rs. 1018.

Prawn prices came down from last year’s Rs.1290 to Rs. 1250 a kilo and in some places sold at an even lesser rate. Balaya small mullet saalaya linna fish prices are seeing a drop in prices. A kilo of Balaya is presently Rs. 620 a kilo whereas it was Rs. 760 in the retail market.

“The seas are rough during (warakan) season and ‘maa-del’ fishermen are reluctant to go deep sea fishing . The ship incident has resulted in people being wary about consuming fish. Therefore the livelihoods of small-scale fishermen have been severely affected” said All-Ceylon Fisherfolk Trade Union secretary Dinesh Fernando.

“Fishermen are jobless they cannot go to sea. In some cases their fishing gear is damaged by the plastic pellets from the sinking ship. Due to the lockdown shops that sell fishing gear are closed. Travel restrictions have left them unable to even engage in other daily paid jobs on land” he said.

He said the Government should take immediate measures to compensate fishermen affected by the ship disaster and also purchase fish from northern and eastern fishermen and ensure fish is available all over the country at reasonable prices.

“This is the fishing season in the seas of Kalpitiya Mannar and northern and eastern seas and fish there are mostly safe to consume as well” Mr. Fernando said.

At the wholesale fish market in Peliyagoda fish traders complained of a drastic drop in the demand for fish.

“We have fish supplies but few buyers. The Fisheries Corporation should step up to promote and distribute fish. They need to initiate an effective programme to purchase our fish” a vendor said.

Meanwhile the consumption of fish still remains a debatable topic.

Dr Lanka Wickremasinghe Head of the Department of Aquaculture and Seafood Technology at the Ocean University of Sri Lanka said consuming fish especially fish caught in the seas off the coast affected by the pollution from the ship should be avoided.

“One can argue that cleaning the gills and intestines will make the fish safe. But some chemicals can be absorbed into the flesh. Unless the chemicals released from the ship are thoroughly investigated it is safe to stay away from consuming fish especially from the area exposed to plastic pellets and other chemicals. If people really want to consume fish deep fried is recommended” she said.

Thushan Kathurusinghe Project Leader of the Turtle Conservation Project said that consuming deep sea fish caught in multi-day trawlers in international waters is safe for consumption while fish caught close to the coast should be avoided for some time.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Deputy Governor Chuchi Fonacier said the Monetary Board issued Resolution 695 noting the cessation of operations of Wells Fargo Bank – Manila Representative Office.

MANILA Philippines — Well Fargo Bank National Association closed down its representative office in the Philippines last month the second foreign bank to shut down its liaison office in Manila amid the pandemic.

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Deputy Governor Chuchi Fonacier said the Monetary Board issued Resolution 695 noting the cessation of operations of Wells Fargo Bank – Manila Representative Office.

“Wells Fargo decided to close its representative office in the Philippines citing the adoption of a centralized approach to optimize efficiency in line with the bank’s core international principles” Fonacier told The STAR.

Wells Fargo’s presence in the Philippines can be traced back to 1901 as part of its Asian operations footprint. It established an operations function in Manila in 2011 and then quickly grew to provide capabilities including risk project management data analytics finance and accounting.

In February last year Wells Fargo & Co. laid off about 700 workers in the Philippines as it decided to move most of its technology employees to locations with high concentration of workers such as India.

The BSP allows foreign banks to open representative offices in the Philippines to serve as liaison offices to promote and provide information about the services or products they offer but may not transact banking businesses such as acceptance of deposits issuance of letters of credit and foreign exchange trading.

Last December Korea Development Bank – Representative Office in the Philippines also closed down.

Korea Development Bank opened its representative office in the Philippines in July 2014 to provide financial advice and information to Korean companies relocating their manufacturing activities to the country.

With the closure of Wells Fargo Bank there are 11 remaining foreign banks operating representative offices in the Philippines.

These are the Bank of Singapore Ltd. Philippines Bank of Taiwan Credit Suisse AG DBS Bank Ltd. Japan Bank for International Cooperation Korea Eximbank Rothschild (Singapore) Ltd.

He wants you to know comedy is harder.,"The famously indefatigable Kevin Hart is nearing the end of marathon press interviews for his new Netflix movie Fatherhood and he’s looking well fatigable.

The Zoom interview occurs the day after the dispiriting opening game of the Sixers-Hawks series so maybe that has something to do with it.

Hart is also taking a brief excused absence from shooting a new action movie (Borderlands) in Budapest so he won’t be ringing the bell or prowling the Wells Fargo sidelines during this round of the NBA playoffs and that’s probably just as well he says.

“Every time I show up” Hart quips “something bad happens.”

On top of all that Fatherhood opening June 18 is a project that Hart has worked extra hard to bring to life — it was one of those movies derailed by the pandemic until it was rescued by Netflix and picked up for distribution by Higher Ground productions which happens to be run by Barack and Michelle Obama.

Hart’s comedy brand hasn’t always lined up with the decorous Obamas but we see a new side of him in Fatherhood and the movie’s wholesome true story of a widower (Hart) raising a daughter (Melody Hurd) with the help of friends and in-laws (Alfre Woodard Lil Rel Howery) is in the Higher Ground wheelhouse.

Even for a guy whose movies have made $4 billion worldwide partnering with the former president and first lady is “huge.”

“Huge man to find out that the Obamas were acting as producers on the movie” he said. “It showed that the project was everything that I thought it was which was meaningful impactful a great story but also an opportunity to uplift the conversation surrounding Black fathers.”

The movie is based on the life of Matt Logelin and his best seller Two Kisses for Maddy: A Memoir of Loss and Love and director/cowriter Paul Weitz (About a Boy) says the role was revised to accommodate Hart whose memoir I Can’t Make This Up struck Weitz with its candid revelations about the actor’s North Philadelphia childhood as the son of a mostly absent father.

“I had the cheat sheet of having read his autobiography which has some serious stuff in it stuff that he was dealing with in his childhood around fatherhood frankly” said the director.

Hart now 41 with four children of his own says he put a good deal of himself into the role and emphasized that he has repaired his relationship with his father. “I love my dad for who he is and I’m [always] going to” he says. “I think you learn from mistakes whether they are yours or others’. They can always act as lessons.”

Weitz had worked with Hart on 2010′s Little Fockers and even then was impressed with the comedian’s versatility on set he said. He remembers pulling him aside and telling him he’d be great at drama if he ever wanted to give it a try. He also liked Hart’s dramatic turns in 2017′s The Upside and in the obscure 2011 movie Let Go and so was eager to reteam for Fatherhood which he said taps into the actor’s ability to invite audience empathy.

“I think it goes back to Chaplin to the great stars throughout cinema history who are underdogs you want to bond with even if you don’t want to particularly have the experience they are having on screen” Weitz said. “There is an element to them that is human that gives the audience entry into what they are going through.”

That trait has made Hart one of the industry’s most bankable stars. He recently inked a four-picture deal with Netflix — on top of the limited series True Story already in development in which Wesley Snipes plays his brother. (While the movie centers on Philadelphia it’s to be shot mostly in L.A.). He also has one of the most popular streaming shows on the Roku Channel — a series of action comedy shorts called Die Hart — and is making plans for season two (Die Harter).

Fatherhood Weitz said offers the “epitome of a very relatable thing which is: Can I be a good parent?”

Hart is careful to point out that he had a lot of help in the movie. His character gets a lot of input from a mother-in-law (Woodard) who’s not sure he’s up to the job of single parent giving Hart a chance to work opposite the accomplished actress.

“Alfre and me were responsible for a lot of the heavy lifting” said Hart who found himself in the unusual position of relying on actors like Howery and Anthony Carrigan to provide the comic relief.

At the same time Hart said he doesn’t want to fall into the trap of diminishing comedy by characterizing it as a placeholder for the supposedly more serious work of drama.

“I’m just going to say it. It’s harder to do comedy. I know that dramatic roles are perceived to be the hardest of the two but comedy is extremely hard and that is overlooked” he said.

Actors like Hart who came to the movies from stand-up have learned to make people laugh live and on stage. He uses that feedback to find the jokes that inform the structure rhythm and timing of his story-based humor.

But on set “you don’t have an audience” he said. “You’re hoping these things work and then when people watch it they are going to laugh out loud but that’s a gamble.”

Hart hasn’t ironed out all the specifics of his Netflix deal but said his increasing range as an actor will allow for more options.

“I know that I have that dramatic gear. It’s just making sure that the material is right for me to showcase that gear” he said. “I’m excited about the future man. It could be a nice mix of things.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvY2FsMTAuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMS8wNi8xMi9ic28tZGV0ZWN0aXZlcy1hcnJlc3QtMi1iYW5rLWp1Z2dlcnMtYWZ0ZXItbXVsdGlwbGUtdmVoaWNsZS10aGVmdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BSO detectives arrest 2 'bank juggers' after multiple vehicle thefts,"PLANTATION Fla. – The Broward Sheriff’s Office has arrested two suspected “bank juggers” in connection with multiple vehicle burglaries.

The suspects identified as Keith Bernard Norman 47 and Gibson Wendell Green 36 both of Miami were taken into custody Thursday morning by detectives with BSO’s Burglary Apprehension Team (BAT) and the Pembroke Pines Burglary Suppression Team (BST).

According to BSO spokeswoman Veda Coleman-Wright “bank jugging is when suspects target and steal money from bank customers. They watch people entering and leaving banks. When the suspects believe a customer has left with cash they follow the customer to the next location. Detectives said the suspects then either take the money by force or burglarize the individual’s car to get the unattended cash.”

Coleman-Wright said detectives began mobile surveillance Thursday on a silver 2012 Nissan Altima in Plantation which fit the description of a car used during multiple vehicle burglaries throughout South Florida.

Authorities said Norman and Green were spotted watching customers enter and exit the Wells Fargo bank at 1191 S. University Drive in Plantation and then followed a man who left the bank and drove to a post office on Northwest Fifth Street.

Coleman-Wright said the suspects smashed the victim’s front passenger-side window after he went into the post office and took his bank bag which had been left on the front passenger seat.

She said the duo then fled the scene before being pulled over and taken into custody in the southbound lanes of Interstate 95.

“Sheriff Gregory Tony was in the area and saw the detectives conducting the takedown” Coleman-Wright said. “He got out of his vehicle put on his bulletproof vest and grabbed his patrol rifle to support his troops and assist them by providing tactical cover while they safely took both suspects into custody.”

Norman and Green were both booked into the Broward County Main Jail.

Coleman-Wright said they both also face charges in connection with a similar crime that was committed Monday afternoon.

In that case the duo are accused of targeting a victim who made a transaction at a Wells Fargo bank near University Drive and Johnson Street in Pembroke Pines.

Both men face charges of burglary to conveyance across county lines petit theft conspiracy to commit a felony and criminal mischief.

“Detectives remind people to be aware of your surroundings at all times and make sure you are not being followed when you leave the bank” Coleman-Wright said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtaGlyZXMtYW5kLWV4aXRzLW9zZWktdmFuLWhvcm4tYWxpY2UtbWlsbGlnYW4tamVubnkta2lsbGVlbi0yMDIxLTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall Street Hires and Exits: Osei Van Horn Alice Milligan Jenny Killeen,"Insider is compiling Wall Street people moves each week.

Novak estimates that prefilled syringes currently account for 10–15% of the parenteral market and anticipates rising demand.

“If you look at the top 40 injectable products all are being used with prefilled syringes” reports Dr. Nicolas Brandes director of product management Polymer Prefilled Syringes and Vial Containment at West Pharmaceutical Services.

Prefilled syringes can be made of glass or plastic such as cyclic olefin polymer/cyclic olefin copolymer (COP/COC) or polypropylene (PP). Glass dominates in most markets. Novak predicts however that the share of co-injection-molded COP/COC prefilled syringes will grow from 2% to more than 5% during the next decade.

“We have seen more approvals for products in plastics especially during the past five years” reports Brandes. He notes plastic syringes often are chosen for specific applications such as contrast imaging agents hyaluronic acid and Botox as well as for products that are sensitive to silicone oil. Plastic syringes also function well in auto-injectors.

According to Novak about 60% of prefilled syringes are staked-in needle syringes but there are considerable regional variations. The most common prefilled syringes are 1-mL long and 1-mL short. The most prevalent applications include anti-coagulant (glass 1-mL long) vaccines (glass 1-mL short) and isotonic solutions where PP is the material of choice. “With the existing COVID-19 challenge a significant increase in vaccines is expected worldwide” says Novak. This growth will stem from COVID-19 vaccines as well as heightened interest in established vaccines (e.g. flu).

Prefillable syringes are delivered as bulk goods or ready-to-fill (RTF). Gerresheimer’s bulk syringes are provided as unsterilized glass bodies in flat (Rondo) trays or customized packaging designs (e.g. bags). Its Gx RTF syringes are presented as washed sterilized RTF components to pharmaceutical and contract manufacturing operations and are available in glass or plastic. Fill volumes range from 0.5 to 5.0 mL with the most common volumes falling between 0.5 mL and 3.0 mL.

Prefilled syringe innovations

Innovations from suppliers accentuate the ease-of-use attributes of prefilled syringes and focus on adding sizes (particularly for larger volumes) reducing waste and patient and caregiver comfort and safety.

Gerresheimer has expanded its range of prefillable polymer syringes for sensitive biologics biosimilars and biobetters to include a Gx RTF ClearJect COP needle syringe 1.0-mL luer lock.

At West Pharmaceutical Services line extensions include insert needle syringes (the plastic version of a staked needle glass syringe) and more needle sizes and product volume options. “In the past three to five years we have seen more approvals in the larger 2.5-mL format” reports Brandes. The larger volume reduces the number of syringes needed per dose and improves efficiency and comfort. There’s a trend toward finer needles too. “Smaller thinner needles mean less pain” he explains.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvaW5zaWRlLXRyYWNrLWZvcm1lci1waGFybWEtYm9zcy1icmVuZGFuLW8tcmVnYW4tZ2xhbXBpbmctaXJlbGFuZC1tNjBsZmt0cnjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside Track: Former pharma boss Brendan O'Regan in glamping pitch,"Brendan O’Regan who sold his Cork-based Zenith pharma tech company to Nasdaq-listed Cognizant is getting into posh tents and camping.

WD says this type of memory will only become viable sometime in the second half of this decade when SSD controllers become more advanced. The claim contradicts other 3D NAND suppliers that believe 3D PLC SSDs could rival hard drives in the next few years.

Each new type of flash brings reduced SSD pricing but as we've seen with QLC NAND that can lead to big reductions in endurance and performance. That takes some of the shine off of a future transition to PLC (Penta Level Cell) flash that packs in five bits per cell to reduce pricing but results in even lower endurance and performance.

""I expect that transition [from QLC to PLC] will be slower"" said Siva Sivaram Western Digital's technology and strategy chief at Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2021 Global Technology Conference (via SeekingAlpha). ""So maybe in the second half of this decade we are going to see some segments starting to get 5 bits per cell.""

TLC flash is the most widely used variant today and while there are 3D QLC NAND chips available they aren't as widely used. Western Digital expects this to change only with its BiCS6 NAND memory and new controllers/firmware.

""We think that QLC across the broad segment will happen in the next [BiCS 6 generation when] the majority of bits will switch over to QLC in the marketplace"" said Sivaram. ""[…]In the next two years plus we are going to see the rapid acceleration of QLC adoption.""

Modern SSD controllers powered by Arm's Cortex-R8 cores can handle advanced error correction (4KB LDPC) algorithms while ensuring decent performance but 3D PLC flash will require even more complex error correction and hence more compute horsepower from the controller. The controller will also have to support more redundant capacity and robust wear-leveling.

""The incremental gain is not quite as much when we are going from 4 to 5 bits on the same cell so you are getting [25%]"" said Sivaram. ""To get that gain you are sacrificing a lot you need additional redundancy additional ECC so the net gain supposed to the performance loss may not be quite as desirable.""

Arm introduced its 64-bit Cortex-R82 core for next-generation SSD controllers in September 2020. Arm says the design is 1.74x ~ 2.25x faster than the Cortex-R8 in real-world applications and 21% and 23% faster than the Cortex-A55 in SPECint2006 and SPECfp2006 respectively. The Cortex-R82 is designed to run in clusters with up to eight cores so controller makers could build rather formidable processors based on the new core which will be quite handy for PLC SSDs.

There is a catch though. The first controllers with the Cortex-R82 (probably due sometime in 2023 or 2024) will likely be aimed primarily at high-end drives with in-storage compute capabilities and not on high-density SSDs featuring cheap 3D PLC flash. As a result 3D PLC flash is unlikely to become mainstream any time soon.

There are certainly plenty of challenges involved with moving to PLC flash. For example 3D PLC NAND can store five bits per cell (5 bpc) a 25% increase over quad-level cell (QLC) flash and a 66% increase over the triple-level cell (TLC) flash memory used today.



To do so NAND cells have to store 32 distinct voltage levels and SSD controllers have to read them properly and record them fast. In contrast TLC uses eight voltage levels and QLC uses 16 voltage levels. In addition to the complexity of PLC 3D NAND cells challenges like cell-to-cell interference and temperatures make it harder to read data.

To offer decent performance and endurance characteristics 3D TLC-based SSDs use 120 bit/1KB or even 340 bit/2KB LDPC ECC algorithms that are already quite complex. In addition manufacturers also implement static and dynamic wear-leveling RAID ECC and overprovisioning to further maximize endurance.

With 3D QLC-powered SSDs we'll need support for 2KB and 4KB LDPC codewords more complex wear-leveling and more overprovisioned capacities. Furthermore memory makers also have to change the design of their cells (e.g. use slightly different materials etc.) to reliably store 16 voltage levels.

All of this means that we'll see PLC SSDs later rather than sooner largely due to needed advances that aren't directly associated with manufacturing the flash itself.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25jb3VudHlpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpc3RzLXdpdGhvdXQtYm9yZGVycy1yZWZsZWN0aW9ucy1vbi1hcnQtYW5kLXBsYWNlLWF0LXRoZS1tdXNldW0tb2Ytd2lzY29uc2luLWFydC03L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Artists without Borders: Reflections on Art and Place at the Museum of Wisconsin Art | By Jennifer Turner,"West Bend WI – Exhibition open — Artists without borders: Reflections on art and place at the Museum of Wisconsin Art.

Artists without Borders: Reflections on Art and Place features nine artists with deep roots abroad. Their work reflects the global perspectives and diverse influences of the multicultural artist. The exhibition is a testament to the diversity—of backgrounds interests and styles—that is representative of Wisconsin art today. Borders are a recurrent theme. Neither inherently good nor bad borders are opportunities for hospitality as well as exclusion. Borders shown on maps offer a topographic definition of place in expressive abstract lines; understanding place and its multitude of meanings is an entirely different matter. Some artists find a productive tension in cultural difference including the disorientation of being immersed in a foreign language and unfamiliar practices. Other artists adapt to their life in America the techniques and textures of their native cultures such as traditional tilework patterns and hand-rolled paper coils. Important landmarks are a perennial inspiration from the grandeur of a legendary mountain range to the thronelike presence of a gilt barber chair. Every work is revelatory of the artist’s identity. Self-portraits in particular show the artist as they wish to be seen. The use of masks to obscure identity yields a paradoxical sort of self-portraiture by both revealing and concealing the subject. It is a reminder that the face we publicly present may be deceptive—especially for code-switching culture-straddling artists.

“Artists without Borders” features nine artists with deep roots abroad. Their work reflects the global perspectives and diverse influences of the multicultural artist. This exhibition is a testament to diversity—of backgrounds interests and styles—that is representative of Wisconsin art today.

On View at two locations:

MOWA in West Bend open through July 3 2021. MOWA | DTN opens May 12

Seven of the nine artists represented are first-generation immigrants born outside the US who draw artistic influence from their country of origin:

Faisal Abdu’allah (United Kingdom) in his investigation of Afro-British social consciousness and Muslim identity.

Nina Ghanbarzadeh (Iran) in her celebration of the beauty of the Persian alphabet.

Francisco X. Mora (Mexico) with a suite of self-portraits in the tradition of Mexican surrealism.

Nirmal Raja (India) in her use of domestic objects common in an Indian household.

Jason Yi (South Korea) in his sculptural interpretations of South Korean landscapes and legends.

Rina Yoon (South Korea) in her adoption of Korean printing and paper-making techniques.

Xiaohong Zhang (China) who melds traditional Chinese painting with Western digital art.

The two remaining artists were born in the heartland of America but maintain close ties to their cultural roots.

The company helped a veteran Saturday free of charge.

The small business had received harsh criticism after security cameras captured two men working for the company dumping unwanted furniture on the side of the road in broad daylight.

Neighbors took their concerns to our problem solver Darian Trotter who then spoke to the owner-- Justin Williams.

RELATED:

Williams apologized fired the two workers and said for the month of June he is offering free junk removal to people living on the East Side and a 35 percent discount for anyone moving to or from the East Side.

""I don't think we could find anybody else” Paul a veteran who Williams helped said. “I mean there are plenty of companies that wouldn't even come to this area of the city so for him to do it and do it for free I think it says a lot about his character.

""I hope it sends a message to the rest of the community and the rest of the city that the east is worthy enough to have people come to it and help it grow and expand.""

The owner tells us he has received a lot of support and people say they respect him for helping the community.

""This is probably something that we're going to keep up keep on doing People need help” Williams said. “Of course we're a business we have to make money but there's times like this when we can come out and actually help people so something good for the community.""

Two people Williams helped were both veterans.

""There's a lot of people that don't know there are a lot of veteran's that need help” Williams said. “There are disabled people that need help. They have junk in their house that could potentially be a fire hazard and they just don't have the help or resources to get it out. So that's something that I don't mind helping doing. So if there's anybody else that needs help just give me a call and we're going to come help.""

William says his company's motto is 'moving made easy' and that's exactly why he wants to help people.

They are also still hiring two additional staffers. You can get in contact with Williams by calling 210-718-4578.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnF1aXJlci5jb20vZm9vZC9waGlsbHktYXJlYS1icmV3ZXJpZXMtaWxsdXN0cmF0ZS1ob3ctY3JhZnQtYmVlci1jdWx0dXJlLXR1cm5zLXRveGljLWhvdy1pdC1jYW4tYmUtYXZvaWRlZC0yMDIxMDYxMy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philly-area breweries illustrate how craft-beer culture turns toxic and how it can be avoided,"The onset of craft beer’s social reckoning last month was years in the making. After decades of being walled off from open criticism the industry faced a wake-up call when allegations of sexism discrimination abuse and worse poured out of Massachusetts brewer Brienne Allan’s Instagram inbox.

“It’s good that it’s finally coming to a head. That means that we’re reaching a tipping point” said Nancy Rigberg a 35-year veteran of the brewing industry and co-owner of Center City’s Home Sweet Homebrew launched in 1986. “Societal change takes a long time but sometimes ... that dam just really needs to break and you need to send out the flood and see what happens.”

The reckoning raised a widespread issue: Toxic workplaces can flourish easily in an industry built around an intoxicating product. To understand how this happens — and how it can be avoided — The Inquirer interviewed local brewery owners and employees.

Troubles at Evil Genius

Ardmore’s Tired Hands Brewing Co. received much attention after its founder stepped down recently but another local brewery repeatedly surfaced in Allan’s posts: Evil Genius.

The Inquirer interviewed nine former Evil Genius employees most of whom were hired in 2017 when the brewery’s Fishtown taproom opened. By their accounts prospects at the brewery seemed bright at first financially and culturally. Schedules were flexible shifts were lucrative and tips were pooled to promote camaraderie. Front-of-house employees made fast friends.

And in the beginning owners Trevor Hayward and Luke Bowen were approachable — they didn’t want a corporate vibe something evidenced by their playful beer names. They’d help behind the bar during peak hours and stay after close to drink with employees.

“It was fun. ... Yeah you had to do certain things like clock in clock out clean the dishes but really there were no rules” said Emilie a former Evil Genius bartender who asked to be identified by first name only. She and other employees initially enjoyed the laid-back atmosphere even as they saw others recognize red flags.

“There were a couple employees early on who I think had picked up on things very quickly ... and they actually quit” remembered Megan Rupert a former bartender and bar manager who worked at Evil Genius’ taproom from when it opened until the pandemic closed it in March 2020. “At that point ... I kind of thought those people were like the outcasts a little bit. You know why wouldn’t they want to stay and party with us and get drunk with the owner?”

But as the taproom gained traction and staff grew problems that stemmed from a lack of discipline began bubbling up and the relationship between management and staff soured.

One employee Corey Kavulich was alleged to be particularly problematic; multiple employees accused him of inappropriate and threatening behavior. Former coworkers said he would drink during his shifts as a bartender and occasionally become belligerent with customers. He was soon promoted to events manager; it removed him from serving customers but did not stop the behavior.

At least two of his coworkers said Kavulich bit them on the neck after hugging them. “He thought he was being funny and cute and playful and it wasn’t. It was disgusting” said one employee who was bitten but did not want to be identified. Kavulich did not return a request for comment before publication; according to Bowen he left the brewery in August 2020.

When asked for comment Hayward referred The Inquirer to two Instagram posts on Evil Genius’ account one from staff and another from the owners acknowledging mistakes were made.

Former bartender and bar manager Yvonne Hatfield said she had to assign another employee to escort Kavulich out of the brewery after he threatened to stab a kitchen manager one night. Hatfield reported the incident in a 2017 email sent to Hayward and general manager Garrett Williams which was reviewed by The Inquirer. (At this time Williams was not Kavulich’s manager.)

“I’m hesitant to say anything because this has happened several times before with outcomes I just don’t quite understand” Hatfield wrote.

She recalls Hayward taking her aside later and speaking with her about it. “[He] pretty much just washed it over said it wasn’t that big of a deal” Hatfield said. “I was trying to tell Trevor that this was a history a pattern of behavior with Corey. ... Nothing came of it.”

According to numerous employees who reported these incidents to Hayward the recurring punishment for Kavulich’s behavior was to stop drinking at the brewery — a condition which was short-lived employees said. Meanwhile Hatfield and Rupert were demoted on separate occasions. Hatfield’s demotion came after she was accused of leaving the safe open at the end of a shift.

Rupert was demoted following an interaction with Kavulich in which he allegedly confronted her about a staffing decision then harassed her until she agreed to speak with him in a locked bathroom. “He made me hold his hand while he told me why my decision was wrong” Rupert said adding that the confrontation ended only when Hayward knocked on the bathroom window.

Rupert raised the incident with Williams who she said put her off then told her a few days later she was being demoted. “He basically told me that his hands were tied and there wasn’t anything we could do” she remembered.

Williams said his pull as a manager and advocate diminished over his three years at Evil Genius. After a point “I didn’t have a voice with the owners” he said.

Over time a division grew between bar staff and the office — the owners stopped interacting with FOH employees beyond ordering beers from them — and Williams lost the early leeway he had been given to establish positive workplace practices such as having staff write nightly notes to document any problems.

When incidents arose documentation was often as far as it went. As Evil Genius got busier the staff asked for security on weekends to help with crowd control. Williams procured quotes but the owners nixed the idea leaving bartenders to deal with unruly patrons. At another point staff were denied requests to use plastic cups instead of glass in the graveled beer garden — a concern because children and dogs would often play there amid broken glass. At one point Rupert incurred lasting nerve damage to her hand when she tripped in the garden while carrying a glass. (She received workers’ comp for the injury.)

“There’s a lot more that I wish I could have done for staff members that did experience problems” said Williams who left the brewery in September 2020. He also said he regrets some problematic behavior of his own such as telling a female employee that women were better at cleaning than men. “I really thought that by leading my own team and setting that example I would be able to counteract a lot of those behaviors but ... it’s great to hear so many people coming forward and saying ‘Hey this should not be normalized. This should not be the standard that people laugh off.’ ”

Setting a better standard

Like Williams other former Evil Genius employees The Inquirer spoke with for this story hope that this time is a crucible for a better industry. “Gosh I hope we make a change” said Hatfield the bar manager.

In response to the attention brought to Evil Genius’ culture the owners recently shared a plan on Instagram to hire an outside human resources representative; establish a “communication protocol” for reporting problems; and launch a diversity equity and inclusion committee. But external HR and DEI committees while a start are no cure-all. Nor are good policies that aren’t enforced.

“There’s no lever to pull. It’s a lot of small actions” said Tess Hart co-owner of Spring Garden’s Triple Bottom Brewing known for its socially conscious business approach.

In speaking with Hart and four local brewery owners — Laura Lacy of Attic Brewing in Germantown Mike Wambolt of Crime & Punishment in Brewerytown Melissa Walter of Love City in Callowhill and Zach Svoboda of Troubles End in Collegeville — a theme emerges: All of them made a deliberate decision to buck stereotypical craft-beer culture which tends to be bro-centric.

Hart remembers attending the Craft Brewers Conference five years ago. “That was very eye-opening and pretty uncomfortable for me as a woman.” Svoboda who is gay has also felt out of place at industry festivals and events. “This is just the most heteronormative non-inclusive environment. Like no gay people would ever want to be here.”

Instead these owners drew from experiences outside the beer industry to inform their company policies.

“The biggest thing that we did from day one was we implemented an anonymous corporate-culture survey” said Lacy who launched Attic with her partner after a decade administering leadership training for H&M. The survey sent out every six months asks employees if they ever feel uncomfortable at work if they feel appreciated and if they feel they’re paid a fair wage. Triple Bottom and Love City also have mechanisms for anonymous feedback.

Wambolt who comes from a teaching and social work background takes a less formal approach to creating culture. “Ultimately it’s come down to just being a decent human being” he said.

In Crime & Punishment’s six years it hasn’t always gone perfectly. At one point Wambolt hesitated to fire a hot-tempered chef who created tension in the brewery but whose food was excellent. “In hindsight I should have fired him after like the second week of being complained about.”

Another time Wambolt and his partners realized the staff had grown too homogenous. “After about the first year we kind of collectively realized that in general we just needed to be more inclusive” he said. “Now I try to keep at least half if not more than half of the staff women. It’s just a better environment.”

Lacy and Hart also stress diversity in hiring — and not just for employees’ sakes. “Customers feel more comfortable too” Lacy said.

Advocating for employees is another theme among these employers which sometimes translates to prioritizing workers over customers. Attic enforces a zero-tolerance policy for harassment and discrimination; a few patrons have been banned and one employee was terminated. Svoboda and Wambolt have also banned customers that made staff feel uncomfortable. Walter has confronted other employees and customers about line-crossing behavior.

Opportunities for professional growth are another way to support employees. Pre-pandemic Triple Bottom had an internal internship program that taught workers skills in brewing marketing and event planning with the help of a mentor; one intern went on to become the full-time brewing assistant. (Triple Bottom also strives to hire employees who were formerly incarcerated or experienced homelessness.) At Love City two current brewers started as bartenders who expressed interest in learning more about production. “When we had the ability to take on a new position in the brewery it was just the natural first place to look for us” Walter said.

These strategies converge to create workplaces that are welcoming in hopes that employees will stick around and enjoy their work.

“I want the people that work for Attic Brewing Company to still be working here five or 10 years from now” Lacy said. “And the only way to do that is to create a healthy work environment for them and to value them as people.”

WTW,Willis Towers Watson,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vZ2NhcHRhaW4uY29tL2luc3VyYW5jZS1zYXZlLWNvcmFsLXJlZWZzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can Marine Insurance Save Coral Reefs?,"By Christine Murray (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – As climate change threatens coral reefs around the world conservation experts in Latin America have enlisted an unlikely ally to try to preserve them: the marine insurance industry.

The Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System – the world’s second largest which runs from southern Mexico to Honduras – will soon be covered by two insurance policies that will pay out after hurricanes to fund repairs and debris cleaning.

A decade after experts first discussed the idea of reef insurance Mexico’s Quintana Roo state government in 2019 took out what was likely the world’s first policy covering areas near the tourist resorts of Cancun.

The nonprofit MAR Fund will soon take out a second covering sites in Mexico Guatemala Belize and Honduras paid for with grant money from the InsuResilience Solutions Fund backed by the German government.

“How important is this from 0 to 10? I’d say 10” said Claudia Ruiz Reef Rescue Initiative coordinator at MAR Fund which works on the conservation and sustainable use of the Mesoamerican reef.

“You’re not only helping the biodiversity of the reef but also the coastal communities that depend on the reef.”

Coral reefs are essential for protecting aquatic life and shielding coastlines from storms but they are under threat from pollution and warmer oceans due to climate change.

That stress has led to their bleaching – in which ailing coral expel the colorful algae living on them – which increases the likelihood the coral will die.

“The reefs are in a really bad state” said Fernando Secaira the climate risk and resilience lead for Mexico at the environmental charity The Nature Conservancy (TNC).

“We’ve lost 80% of the coral here in the Mexican Caribbean.”

Though healthy reefs can recover from hurricanes climate change has made that harder scientists say. Quick payouts to help remove debris after storms and stick broken corals back together can help reef experts say.

FAST CASH FOR REEFS

Around the world insurers are increasingly offering policies to cover climate change-related threats from flooding to wildfires.

The policies pay out if a pre-determined trigger is passed such as the size of a hurricane or flood rather than according to the actual damage allowing for quicker delivery of needed recovery cash.

“Days and a few weeks make a big difference and so having that funding very very quickly …(is) really valuable” said Simon Young senior director in the climate and resilience hub at insurance firm Willis Towers Watson the broker working with MAR Fund.

“The traditional conservation funding model does not allow for that” he added.

But some environmentalists have doubts about the new approach.

Jorge Herrera a marine biologist and coastal ecosystems specialist at CINVESTAV a Mexican science and technology institute said hurricanes aren’t the main problem facing the region’s beleaguered reefs.

He added that conservation efforts in the region focus too much on coral and not enough on mangroves seagrasses and other less flashy but essential parts of coastal ecosystems.

“The insurance should include the whole system not (just) the reef” Herrera said.

Those involved in the new insurance push said it was a first step and work was underway on similar insurance for mangroves which absorb climate-changing emissions serve as fish nurseries and protect coasts from storm surges.

Secaira whose organization designed the training for the post-hurricane reef response brigades said that after a storm coral fragments could be recovered and used in repairs making it a cost-effective way of restoring the reef.

Brigades in Puerto Morelos in Quintana Roo repaired 15000 coral colonies in the 40 days after Hurricanes Delta and Zeta slammed into the coast within weeks of each other in 2020 Secaira said.

Young said it was relatively simple to quantify the risks from various categories of hurricanes making it easier to work out insurance at a good price.

“I don’t think insurance at any cost is necessarily a good value proposition but at the right cost it definitely can be.”

When casino giant Genting Group bought an abandoned resort site on Las Vegas Boulevard in 2013 with plans for a lavish project the deal sparked hopes for the sleepy north end of the Strip.

The area was blighted by abandoned hotel projects and sprawling tracts of land where big visions never materialized. Foot traffic was thin the area was poorly lit and overall it was just quiet especially compared with casino-packed sections of the boulevard a few miles away.

“It was dead” developer Lorenzo Doumani recalled.

Eight years later Genting is scheduled to open its long-planned project Resorts World Las Vegas on June 24. The north Strip isn’t in the kind of dire straits it used to be in but the new hotel could bring more tourists to the area and if history repeats itself a surge of visitors overall to Las Vegas who want to see the latest offering in America’s casino capital.

The $4.3 billion project is set to be a flashy property with lots of star power and is the first newly built megaresort to debut on the Strip in more than a decade — all at a time when Las Vegas’ tourism industry the backbone of the local economy is starting to find its footing after getting crushed by the coronavirus pandemic.

“We are trending in the right direction but we are far from recovered” said Jeremy Aguero a principal with Las Vegas consulting firm Applied Analysis.

Big offerings

Resorts World on the site of the former mobbed-up Stardust was initially supposed to open in 2016. But its debut kept getting pushed back and in real estate circles it was all too common for people to ask “What’s going on with Resorts World?”

The property which underwent design changes is massive by any measure featuring 3500 rooms more than 40 food and beverage spots a 5.5-acre pool complex a 27000-square-foot spa a 5000-person-capacity theater 250000 square feet of meeting space and a 117000-square-foot casino.

Its collection of retail stores is slated to include a Kardashian Kloset pop-up shop that will sell items from the reality TV family’s personal closets and the resort boasts a lineup of scheduled concerts from Celine Dion Katy Perry Carrie Underwood and Luke Bryan all of whom are slated to perform several shows.

Miley Cyrus is slated to perform there as well at a grand opening celebration July 4 that will be broadcast on the skyscraper’s 100000-square-foot exterior LED screen.

Resorts World also has an affiliation with Hilton that according to analysts could lure plenty of guests who want to use or earn points with the hotel chain.

‘Shiniest new property’

Industry watchers told the Review-Journal that Resorts World could initially siphon customers from competitors. Macquarie Capital analyst Chad Beynon for instance figures other high-end properties “will probably lose some business at least early on” given Resorts World’s room count.

Also simply being the newest destination in town gives people a reason to walk in.

People “want to see the shiniest new property on the Strip” Truist Securities analyst Barry Jonas said.

Casinos rely on plenty of walk-in traffic. According to Aguero of Applied Analysis the average visitor to Las Vegas goes to five properties while here and resorts will have guests who want to venture out to see the new one.

Tourism overall has often climbed in Las Vegas when a megaresort opens as people are drawn to the city because of the new property.

“It makes Vegas that much more of an attraction” said Doumani who expects to break ground this fall on Majestic Las Vegas a nongaming hotel off the north Strip.

Alan Feldman distinguished fellow in responsible gaming at UNLV’s International Gaming Institute said that over the past 30 years “new resorts have almost always expanded the market and brought new visitors.”

Feldman a former longtime executive with MGM Resorts International said it appears that “all of the stars are aligning” for Resorts World’s debut which he believes will spark more tourism overall and higher room rates across the market.

Travel to Las Vegas is already on the rise and Feldman said Resorts World is bringing “new consumer energy” with its amenities.

There are always customers who want to see the “newest and greatest thing” but even beyond that Genting could draw visitors from Asia as international travel restrictions loosen according to Michael Parks a hotel-casino specialist with real estate brokerage CBRE Group.

Genting based in Malaysia has locations in its home country and in Singapore among other places including New York. On the Strip Resorts World was envisioned early on to feature a live panda exhibit and a replica of the Great Wall of China and even though such offerings were later scrapped the property will “pay homage to Genting Group’s roots with Asian-inspired touches throughout the design and amenities” Resorts World Las Vegas President Scott Sibella previously told the Review-Journal.

Plus with the economy reopening vaccines rolling out and coronavirus restrictions being lifted tourism overall has been gaining momentum.

As Jonas of Truist Securities noted people want to visit Las Vegas after a year of not coming here “or going anywhere for that matter.”

‘Finally coming to life’

Boyd Gaming Corp. imploded the Stardust in 2007 to clear space for its multibillion-dollar Echelon project but halted construction in summer 2008 as the once-roaring economy was stumbling.

The unfinished casino was one of many abandoned projects that littered the valley after the frenzied mid-2000s bubble burst and one in a long line of failed supersized projects on the north Strip.

By the time Genting bought the site that stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard featured two halted partially built resort projects Echelon and Fontainebleau; the vacant former New Frontier site where plans by Israeli investors for a newly built luxury resort went nowhere; the empty former Wet ‘n’ Wild water park site where multiple plans including a 142-story casino-resort never left the drawing board; and the shuttered Sahara which was being transformed into the SLS Las Vegas.

Today the north Strip is by no means buzzing with activity everywhere. The former New Frontier site — now owned by Wynn Resorts Ltd. — and the Wet ‘n’ Wild plot — the site of along-stalled arena and hotel project by ex-NBA player Jackie Robinson — remain undeveloped. Also the 60-plus-story Fontainebleau still hasn’t been finished more than a decade after it went bankrupt under the original developers.

However the SLS after a volatile start traded hands in 2018 and the new owner launched a $150 million overhaul and renamed the property Sahara Las Vegas. The Fontainebleau was reacquired by its old developer in February albeit with no word on when it would open and construction of Resorts World has brought lots of people and activity to that once-quiet site.

Moreover the nearby Las Vegas Convention Center recently finished a $1 billion expansion that brought the facility even closer to the Strip. The first major trade show in the U.S. since the pandemic hit World of Concrete was held this month at the convention center’s new West Hall.

Southern Nevadans have long predicted a turnaround on the north Strip thanks in large part to Resorts World’s long-planned entrance.

That resurgence said CBRE’s Parks “is finally coming to life.”

The electric grid is one of the most important pieces of infrastructure in the country. It currently connects more than 9200 power-generating units over 600000 miles of transmission lines. These lines are essential in getting electricity transported to our homes and businesses. Because of the importance of electricity to our daily lives grid failures can have catastrophic consequences. That's why companies are investing heavily in upgrading this critical infrastructure.

Three companies working hard to build the next-generation grid are Brookfield Renewable (BEP 2.05%) (BEPC 1.22%) NextEra Energy (NEE 1.25%) and Xcel Energy (XEL -0.16%). Here's why those investments could pay big dividends for their investors over the coming years.

Providing support to both ends of the grid

Brookfield Renewable doesn't operate the power transmission lines that make up the electrical grid. Instead it focuses on investing in two other types of assets that will enhance the grid's reliability. First it's a leader in owning operating and developing distributed generation (DG) projects. These are off-grid power-producing assets like rooftop solar and battery storage. Thus it enables end-users to generate power closer to the source reducing the load on the power grid.

Brookfield also operates large-scale energy storage assets like pumped storage. These facilities provide critical grid-stabilizing services by supplying power when other facilities are offline. For example it delivers backup capacity to address the intermittency of greener electricity grids handling energy produced by wind- and solar-generating facilities.

The company's investments to expand those two business lines will help give Brookfield Renewable the power to grow its earnings at a double-digit annual rate in the coming years. That should support its plan to increase its dividend by around 5% to 9% per year.

Building a leading grid operator

NextEra Energy is one of the largest utilities in the country. It operates two electric utilities in Florida an electricity-generating business that happens to be the world's largest wind and solar power producer and a leading transmission business. NextEra Energy Transmission integrates renewable energy and strengthens the electricity grid.

It built this leading business via acquisition and development projects. For example earlier this year it acquired GridLiance for $660 million adding 700 miles of high-voltage transmission lines across six states. Meanwhile in 2019 it bought the Trans Bay Cable a 53-mile underwater transmission system that supplies more than 40% of the power used in San Francisco. It also won approval last year to build a new transmission line in Western New York to ease grid congestion and maximize the delivery of renewable energy in the region. Overall NextEra is becoming a leader in building the next-generation grid designed to handle increased loads from renewable energy.

Those investments will help power NextEra's growth plan to expand its earnings per share at a 6% to 8% annual rate through 2023. That could support dividend growth of around 10% through next year.

Rapidly expanding its grid

Xcel Energy operates one of the fastest-growing investor-owned transmission systems. It has more than 20000 miles of transmission lines across 10 states.

The utility is investing heavily to expand its transmission business to help support increased renewable energy deployment. Overall the company is investing $24.3 billion through 2025 to expand its operations with 25% of that spending earmarked for electric transmission projects. One notable project is the proposed Colorado Pathway Transmission expansion. Xcel could invest up to $1.7 billion to build 560 miles of transmission lines that could support roughly 5.5 gigawatts of new renewable power generation.

Those transmission-related investments will help power Xcel's plan to grow its earnings per share at a 5% to 7% annual rate over the coming years. That should support similar yearly increases in its 2.6%-yielding dividend.

Building the future of energy

The global economy is switching power sources from fossil fuels to renewable energy. That will require a significant investment to upgrade the power grid. While many companies stand to benefit from this megatrend Brookfield Renewable NextEra Energy and Xcel Energy are great options for investors. That's because their investments should pay immediate benefits to shareholders via steadily rising dividends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9tb3JlLWV2LWNoYXJnaW5nLXN0YXRpb25zLW9uLXRoZS1ob3Jpem9uLWZvci1taW5uZXNvdGEvNjAwMDY3NTEwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More EV charging stations on the horizon for Minnesota,"Once a week Rodrigo Duran takes his 2019 Tesla Model 3 out for a recharge.

During the 30 to 40 minutes it takes to charge up Duran talks to people or watches videos on his smartphone. With the charge costing around $15 Duran says the time is worth it.

""I'm saving more money with my Tesla than buying a tank of gas"" he said. ""More than half.""

There are now electric vehicle or EV owners in every county of Minnesota state records show. And charging stations are springing up in many communities the other half of the chicken-and-egg equation for EV proliferation.

Within a decade state transportation officials say they expect 20% of all Minnesota light vehicles will be electric up from less than 1% now. The price premium on EVs has shrunk to under 10% in some cases while resale values and fuel and maintenance costs already are better than new gas vehicles.

Automakers anticipate half or more of their product mix will be EVs within the decade. Last month Ford unveiled an electric version of the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. its F-150 pickup.

Rodrigo Duran relies on superchargers to power his Tesla Model 3 because he doesn’t have easy access to an outdoor outlet at his home.

Most EV owners do most of their charging at home often at night when utilities lower rates. Even so for EVs to continue on the expected trajectory the construction of charging stations will have to accelerate.

""It is an early market and you need something to catalyze it"" said Brendan Jordan vice president at the Great Plains Institute a nonprofit organization in Minneapolis focused on renewable energy. ""Availability of charging is a key factor in whether people want to buy a car.""

Surveys by J.D. Power a leading auto-market researcher for years have shown that the chief hurdle to EV sales is the fear drivers have of running out of juice with nowhere to recharge a sentiment known as ""range anxiety.""

Because he lives in a rental and parks outdoors Duran can't charge the car at home. For more than a year he drove it to the Tesla supercharger at a Hy-Vee in Robbinsdale. But recently he has been using one closer to home that was recently built at a Target in St. Louis Park.

John Crouch who recently bought a Tesla Model Y SUV added a 220-volt charger to his garage using an incentive from Xcel. But construction on his driveway last week forced him to seek out the supercharger at the Target store.

An EV is ""perfect in town"" he said. But on two trips to Phoenix this past winter Crouch and his wife found that the spacing between chargers was not always ideal. ""In wintertime battery power is less and the car was loaded"" he said. ""So a 600-mile day needed two stops along the way. I thought it would be one stop. It adds a lot of time.""

The economics of charging stations are challenging. Chargers are expensive with the most advanced costing tens of thousands of dollars each. At stations with many chargers even more expensive equipment is needed to manage the flow of power.

Getting a return on investment from all that depends on usage. For now the companies making money in the business are the makers of chargers and the software that allows them to work with different types of vehicles.

About 200 EV charging stations now exist in Minnesota an away-from-home option for owners of about 19000 EVs now licensed in the state. About one-third of those EVs are hybrids that use electricity for 25 to 30 miles before switching to gasoline.

Many of the charging stations are offered by city governments cooperatives and sometimes employers as a free amenity. In downtown St. Paul EV owners can plug in at parking spots with hourly rates that are a fraction of normal spots.

Tesla the top seller of EVs initially offered free charging to all its customers but now limits that to owners of its most expensive cars. Its network of superchargers operate at higher wattages — meaning faster charging — and work only with Tesla cars. There are now 14 in Minnesota five of them in the Twin Cities and eight more announced statewide.

As part of a larger infrastructure proposal President Joe Biden wants to spend $15 billion to build 500000 charging stations for EVs across the country. It's unclear whether Congress will go along. After two months of negotiations Biden last week stopped direct talks with congressional Republicans and encouraged a bipartisan group of senators to work out a deal for infrastructure spending broadly.

Critics say the Biden proposal will substitute or crowd out commercially developed charging stations and networks. Anjali Bains transportation expert at Fresh Energy a St. Paul-based research and advocacy group said she would expect any federal program to involve grants and look similar to EV charging efforts paid for with funds from Volkswagen's legal settlement over emissions cheating.

The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency is building EV charging stations around the state with money from Volkswagen. About $7 million will be spent for what could end up being more than 100 charging stations.

So far 18 fast-charging stations which operate similarly to Tesla's have been built along with 10 Level 2 stations which transfer power at about the rate delivered by a 220-volt outlet at home. All have been built outside the Twin Cities metro area.

Retail electric cooperatives that are members of wholesale power generator Great River Energy have established 75 Level 2 charging ports and four fast-chargers. Cities that are members of the Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency have installed 19 fast-chargers and 40 Level 2 chargers.

Jeff Calder of St. Louis Park charged his Tesla last week outside Target.

Later this year Xcel Energy the state's largest utility plans to roll out 70 mostly Level 2 chargers in underserved areas of Minneapolis and St. Paul working in partnership with the two cities. Xcel also is seeking regulatory approval to own and operate 21 fast-chargers in Minnesota.

Minnesota Power also has a proposal before regulators to build 16 fast-charging stations across northeastern Minnesota. Fergus Falls-based Otter Tail Power is installing 11 fast chargers and 10 Level 2 charging sites in its western Minnesota territory.

""It is so much more complex than the gas station model"" said Tim Sexton assistant commissioner at the Minnesota Department of Transportation. He noted that many gas stations make bigger profits from the sale of food beverages and cigarettes than from fuel.

For the businesses like Target and Hy-Vee where charging stations are being located the proposition is often a straightforward real estate deal. Tesla in 2014 placed one of its first superchargers in Minnesota in a parking lot at the Ground Round Grill & Bar a family-owned restaurant in Worthington.

""They used a corner of the parking lot that doesn't get a lot of activity"" said Louise Rients manager of the restaurant. ""I think about 50% of the time people stop in and eat while they charge. It's a win-win for us.""

Target in 2018 agreed to test out renting space in parking lots at 100 stores to a mix of charging providers. Through the end of last year it had more than 1000 parking spaces at 114 stores being used for charging. In Minnesota Target has chargers at three stores in the Twin Cities and one in Alexandria.

""It adds to the infrastructure available to support electric vehicle adoption and provides an easy solution for our guests who can get a charge during their Target run"" John Leisen vice president of property management for the Minneapolis-based retailer said in a statement.

Roger Rosko who bought his first Nissan Leaf EV four years and now has two others has closely tracked the proliferation of charging stations in the Twin Cities and became adept at planning trips around them.

""A great majority of my charging I do at home"" Rosko said. ""If you plan enough you can drive these things long distance because there are starting to be high-speed chargers along the way. The landscape's changing pretty rapidly.""

When he was comfortable eating out before the pandemic Rosko favored charging stations at Hy-Vees because he enjoyed their in-store restaurants. Last week as he charged a car at the Target in St. Louis Park he placed an order on the Target app then had it brought out to him at curbside pickup.

""These things are a big plus"" Rosko said pointing at the charger. ""Part of why I shop at Lunds & Byerlys is because they have them. I'm looking for them all over the place.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nanNlbnRpbmVsLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dlc3Rlcm5fY29sb3JhZG8vY2l0eS1zdHJlZXQtbWFpbnRlbmFuY2Utc3RhcnRpbmctbmV4dC13ZWVrL2FydGljbGVfNzczNTMxM2UtY2FmZS0xMWViLTk0ZDMtYjNjYjhhMDkyYjQ2Lmh0bWzSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2pzZW50aW5lbC5jb20vbmV3cy93ZXN0ZXJuX2NvbG9yYWRvL2NpdHktc3RyZWV0LW1haW50ZW5hbmNlLXN0YXJ0aW5nLW5leHQtd2Vlay9hcnRpY2xlXzc3MzUzMTNlLWNhZmUtMTFlYi05NGQzLWIzY2I4YTA5MmI0Ni5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,City street maintenance starting next week,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

David Pogue talks plain talk about that complex story of climate change. Pogue who lives in Westport has a voice for science often hosting PBS Nova science specials and explaining away on Ted Talks. He now has a user-friendly book “How to Prepare for Climate Change – A Practical Guide to Surviving the Chaos” that was a riveting topic at a recent RMA talk.

His ability to simplify those key words of climate change the greenhouse effect began with a photo of two dogs in a car. “If we want to reach people we should call it the dog-in-the- car- effect…how you come back to your car in the summer it’s like boiling inside. Same exact thing – trapped infrared energy reflected from the sun. In the climate analog – we are the dog.”

He then shared a graph that starkly showed the dramatic rise in the levels of C02. “And if we zoom in on the last 150 years we’ll see that it really began about the time we began burning coal and oil with the Industrial Revolution.”

He has another term for global warming more inclusive global weirding. “It’s heat waves” his list begins freak snowstorms flooding water shortages. historic rains droughts. “We had the most hurricanes last season…Nature is a network of interconnected systems – you can’t turn one knob without affecting a bunch of other things.”

Addressing last year he said “We were coping with COVID crisis but the climate crisis did not slow down…2020 was tied for the hottest year ever reported on the planet. We also achieved the hottest temperature ever measured on the planet…over 130 degrees in Death Valley. We also had the most wildfires burning – the most areas in a season…five million acres burned which is equal to the entire area of Connecticut Delaware and Rhode Island. And another terrible wildfire season is coming up out west.”

So just how many climate change deniers are out there he posed? According to an annual study by Yale Program on Climate Change Communication there are 29 percent of Americans believing climate change is just a natural cycle. “That’s actually the lowest number it’s ever been in these surveys. Just as a point of comparison remember that 20 percent of us believe that aliens walk among us.”

But Pogue quickly moved off to his “Practical Guide to Surviving the Chaos.”

So how is that changing climate affecting us? “There’s an epidemic in this country of what’s called eco-despair or climate anxiety…After Hurricane Katrina one in five residents are still suffering from PTSD…Since 2016 rates of depression are up 33 percent.” How to deal with this despair? Pogue’s’ “whole book is about taking action to sleep better at night.”

Like choosing wisely where one lives. “Forty million Americans move every year especially in the pandemic. The basic guideline is you want to be inland far enough from the sea level rising and flooding.” Check out the “cool” website called “Surging Seas” – https://sealevel.climatecentral.org/ “You plug in any address and it’ll show you the water levels over time as the sea levels rise…Coastal Connecticut is not as bad as Miami. I would not be buying real estate in Miami…already they’re getting sunny day flooding 100 days a year when it hasn’t been raining when there hasn’t been a hurricane. And that happens because of the tides.”

“You want to be north far enough to escape the heat waves as well as the mosquitoes and ticks that we’ve got here and you want to be west enough to avoid the hurricanes and you want to be east far enough to avoid the wildfires. And you need fresh water – the entire western half of the country is in more or less perpetual drought.”

Pogue picks 14 cities “basically above the 42nd parallel. The Great Lakes area baby that’s where it’s at – no hurricanes and wildfires plenty of drinking water no sea level rise. All those great old rust belt cities are expected to have this huge resurgence. Places with a lot of culture art museums symphonies zoos and hospitals very important in the climate crisis era. Another option is Burlington Vermont. It feels like a seaside town because it’s on Lake Champlain a lake 500 miles long no sea level rise low obesity highly educated the lowest crime rate in the country really big on cheese and maple syrup and ice cream. Ben and Jerry’s is nearby.”

How to invest in climate change? “When you invest in a clean energy focused company you are helping to solve the problem. You’re making money at the same time. It turns out that 38 states and growing now have renewable energy mandates. They must get 50 percent of their power from renewable energy by 2030. Who stands to benefit from those laws? The utility companies because they will be the people that the states are buying electricity from. So companies like NextEra and Xcel Energy are good investments.”

And with General Motors intending to phase out of gas cars in 14 years Pogue shared “It’s the companies that mine lithium that will be sitting pretty.”

Pogue instructed all RMA attendees to download the app “Emergency” pronto. “It’s free. It’s from the American Red Cross and it’s really cool – you put in your address or your children’s addresses grandchildren’s addresses. If any disaster starts heading yours or their way it will come to life and start beeping and get your attention. even when the cell network is down like where’s the nearest shelter basic first aid how to survive a flood or hurricane.

“Most experts also agreed that you should set up a go-bag. This is a backpack that you keep in the front closet with enough stuff in it so that you can survive out of the house for a couple of days. So snacks first aid gear flashlight…grab ID and cash and any medicines. When another hurricane Sandy comes along and you’re told to evacuate you don’t want to be at the end of the line of cars stuck in traffic trying to escape.”

But if you can’t don’t forget your water heater. “There’s 40 or 80 gallons of clean fresh drinking water already within the walls of your own home. So what you do is you shut off the intake at the top and then you can pour out water from the bottom spigot let it cool off and you’ve got clean drinking water.”

And gear up against those ticks! “It turns out that the changing climate is not unpopular with everybody. Ticks love it. Tick territory is growing because the winters are not killing them…or killing off the deer.” Lyme Disease is increasing. “And the thing is you don’t always know that you’ve got Lyme disease.” So those 30000 reported cases in the 1990’s could now be 300000 cases a year. Stock up on DEET use antibiotics quickly if you come down with Lyme – “you can cure it for good. When you get back from a walk take off your clothes and throw them in the dryer – it kills whatever is on them.” To remove a tick “Just take some tweezers grab it by the head pop it right out.’ And encircle your house/patio with nine feet of lawn. “Nine feet to them is like Death Valley they can’t cross it.”

The last chapter of Pogue’s book is called “Where to Find Hope.” It includes “Look at the young people today…These people are going to replace us and they feel very strongly about decarbonizing. I think it’ll take eight years or so but I do believe we’ll get to a world that doesn’t burn coal oil and gas anymore.”"
